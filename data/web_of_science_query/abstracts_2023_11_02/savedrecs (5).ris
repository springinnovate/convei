TI  - Lymph node metastases in breast cancer: Mechanisms and molecular imaging
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease of women in the world. Breast cancer often metastasizes to axillary lymph nodes. Accurate assessment of the status of axillary lymph nodes is crucial to the staging and treatment of breast cancer. None of the methods used clinically for preoperative noninvasive examination of axillary lymph nodes can accurately identify cancer cells from a molecular level. In recent years, with the indepth study of lymph node metastases, the mechanisms and molecular imaging of lymph node metastases in breast cancer have been reported. In this review, we highlight the new progress in the study of the main mechanisms of lymph node metastases in breast cancer. In addition, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of traditional preoperative axillary lymph node imaging methods for breast cancer, and list molecular imaging methods that can accurately identify breast cancer cells in lymph nodes.

TI  - Generating Virtual Training Labels for Crop Classification from Fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown results superior to most traditional image understanding approaches in many fields, incl. crop classification from satellite time series images. However, CNNs require a large number of training samples to properly train the network. The process of collecting and labeling such samples using traditional methods can be both, time-consuming and costly. To address this issue and improve classification accuracy, generating virtual training labels (VTL) from existing ones is a promising solution. To this end, this study proposes a novel method for generating VTL based on sub-dividing the training samples of each crop using self-organizing maps (SOM), and then assigning labels to a set of unlabeled pixels based on the distance to these sub-classes. We apply the new method to crop classification from Sentinel images. A three-dimensional (3D) CNN is utilized for extracting features from the fusion of optical and radar time series. The results of the evaluation show that the proposed method is effective in generating VTL, as demonstrated by the achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 95.3% and kappa coefficient (KC) of 94.5%, compared to 91.3% and 89.9% for a solution without VTL. The results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to enhance the classification accuracy of crops using VTL.

TI  - Rule-Based Identification of Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease Using Clinical Notes from the United States Veterans Affairs Healthcare System
T2  - NEUROLOGY AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundEarly identification of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a clinical and research imperative. Use of diagnostic codes for MCI and AD identification has limitations. We used clinical notes to supplement diagnostic codes in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VAHS) electronic health records (EHR) to identify and establish cohorts of Veterans recorded with MCI or AD.MethodsTargeted keyword searches for MCI ("Mild cognitive impairment;" "MCI") and AD ("Alz*") were used to extract clinical notes from the VAHS EHR from fiscal year (FY) 2010 through FY 2019. Iterative steps of inclusion and exclusion were applied until searches achieved a positive predictive value & GE; 80%. MCI and AD cohorts were identified via clinical notes and/or diagnostic codes (i.e., including Veterans recorded by "Notes Only," "Notes + Code," or "Codes Only").ResultsA total of 2,134,661 clinical notes from 339,007 Veterans met the iterative search criteria for MCI due to any cause and 4,231,933 notes from 572,063 Veterans met the iterative search criteria for AD. Over the 10-year study period, the number of clinical notes recording AD was generally stable, whereas the number for MCI more than doubled. More Veterans were identified for the MCI or AD cohorts via clinical notes than by diagnostic codes, particularly in the AD cohort. Among Veterans identified by having "Notes + Code" for MCI, the number first recorded by a code was lower than the number first recorded by a note until FY 2015 and then gradually became comparable after FY 2015. Among Veterans identified by having "Notes + Code" for AD, the number first recorded by a note was more than double the number first recorded by a code AD in each of the FYs.ConclusionsClinical note-based identification captured more Veterans recorded with MCI and AD than diagnostic code-based identification.

TI  - Orbital Exenteration in Recurrence Cancer: 5 Years Experience.
T2  - Journal of clinical medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients who underwent orbital exenteration for periorbital, conjunctival, and primary intraorbital carcinomas. Additionally, we assessed the outcomes of anterior retrograde temporalis muscle flap restoration.METHODS: For all patients who had orbital exenteration in the previous five years, a non-comparative retrospective assessment of their medical records, histology, and radiographic imaging was carried out. We investigated the relationships between the various qualitative factors using Cramer's V Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. For each of the patient's categorical factors that were of relevance, estimates of the survival distribution were displayed, and log-rank tests were used to determine whether the survival distributions were equal.RESULTS: This study looks at 19 participants. The sample is made up of 13 men (68%) and 6 women (32%). The degree of relationship (Cramer's V index) between lymph node metastases (N) and the existence of distant metastases (M) is high, at 64%, and is statistically significant because the p-value is 0.0034 < 0.005. Lymph node metastases had a statistically significant impact on overall survival (p = 0.04 < 0.05). Thirteen of the nineteen patients tested had no palsy (68%). There was no one presenting a CSF leak.CONCLUSION: Our findings show how crucial it is to identify any lymph node involvement that orbital neoplasms may have. In patients who have received many treatments, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be used to determine the stage and spread of the cancer. To determine whether additional tumor characteristics may be explored, more expertise in the SLNB field for patients with orbital cancer who have received many treatments may be helpful. To prevent additional scarring and to be comparable to previous techniques for facial nerve lesions, the anterior retrograde approach and the transorbital procedure for temporal muscle flap in-setting are both effective methods.

TI  - The Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients Who Become Clinically Node-Negative Following Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy: A Literature Review.
T2  - Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer (BC) patients who become clinically node-negative (cN0) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after lymphatic mapping with lymphoscintigraphy is not widely accepted; therefore, it has become a topic of international debate.OBJECTIVE: Our literature review aims to evaluate the current use of this surgical practice in a clinical setting and focuses on several studies published in the last six years which have contributed to the assessment of the feasibility and accuracy of this practice, highlighting its importance and oncological safety. We have considered the advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared to other suggested methods and strategies. We also evaluated the role of local irradiation therapy after SLNB and state-of-the-art SLN mapping in patients subjected to NACT.METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed and Cochrane was conducted. All studies published in English from 2018 to August 2023 were evaluated.RESULTS: Breast units are moving towards a de-escalation of axillary surgery, even in the NACT setting. The effects of these procedures on local irradiation are not very clear. Several studies have evaluated the oncological outcome of SLNB procedures. However, none of the alternative techniques proposed to lower the false negative rate (FNR) of SLNB are significant in terms of prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we can state that lymphatic mapping with SLNB in cN+ BC patients who become clinically node-negative (ycN0) following NACT is a safe procedure, with a good prognosis and low axillary failure rates.

TI  - Identifying snowfall elevation patterns by assimilating satellite-based snow depth retrievals.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Precipitation in mountain regions is highly variable and poorly measured, posing important challenges to water resource management. Traditional methods to estimate precipitation include in-situ gauges, Doppler weather radars, satellite radars and radiometers, numerical modeling and reanalysis products. Each of these methods is unable to adequately capture complex orographic precipitation. Here, we propose a novel approach to characterize orographic snowfall over mountain regions. We use a particle batch smoother to leverage satellite information from Sentinel-1 derived snow depth retrievals and to correct various gridded precipitation products. This novel approach is tested using a simple snow model for an alpine basin located in Trentino Alto Adige, Italy. We quantify the precipitation biases across the basin and found that the assimilation method (i) corrects for snowfall biases and uncertainties, (ii) leads to cumulative snowfall elevation patterns that are consistent across precipitation products, and (iii) results in overall improved basin-wide snow variables (snow depth and snow cover area) and basin streamflow estimates.

TI  - Increase in Arctic Oscillations explains most interannual variability in Russia's wildfires
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, the escalating emissions of greenhouse gases from boreal wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere have drawn significant attention, underscoring an unprecedented wildfire season in 2021. Our calculations indicate that between 2002 and 2020, wildfires in Russia released approximately 726 +/- 280 Tg CO2eqv yr-1. This aligns closely with similar estimates derived from remote sensing data, far surpassing the earlier approximations found in the Russian National Inventory Report (NIR) by a factor of 2 to 3. Notably, in 2021 alone, Russia's wildfires emitted an exceptionally high amount of 1,700 Tg CO2eqv, exceeding the carbon emissions from the country's fossil fuel consumption. Consequently, this situation led to an almost complete counterbalance of carbon assimilation by Russian forests. Our analysis attributes over 50% of the variation in wildfire frequency between 2002 and 2021 to shifts in the Arctic Oscillation (AO). This suggests a potential for utilizing AO as a predictive variable for wildfires. It's noteworthy that the AO itself is influenced by the sustained regression of Arctic sea-ice. From this, it can be inferred that in the foreseeable future, Russian forests might undergo a transition from their role as carbon sinks to the potential net contributors of carbon to the atmosphere.

TI  - Vegetation cover change and its response to climate extremes in the Yellow River Basin.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Extreme climate events have increased in frequency and severity under the background of climate change, with vegetation growth exhibiting a sensitive response to them. By assimilating GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI using the Residual Network, we obtained a long time series and high resolution NDVI dataset of the Yellow River Basin (YRB). The dataset was utilized for examining the spatiotemporal variability of NDVI and analyzing the response of vegetation cover to climate extremes with meteorological data. Our findings reveal the following: (1) A significant rise in NDVI was seen in the YRB, displaying a mean growth rate of 0.019/10a (p<0.001). However, seasonal differences exist. The mean NDVI of multi-year declines from southeast to northwest, while the overall trend of vegetation cover improves. (2) The NDVI response to extreme temperature exhibits noticeable spatiotemporal differences. Daytime extreme high temperature in the northern YRB is negatively correlated with NDVI, while they are positively correlated in the lower YRB and the southern part of the middle YRB. Nighttime extreme high temperature exhibits a positive correlation with NDVI. Overall, NDVI displays a stronger response to extreme precipitation than to extreme temperature, with a negative correlation with CWD and a positive correlation with PRCPTOT. (3) The NDVI demonstrates a lagged response to climate extremes in the YRB, with a greater lag in response to extreme temperature than extreme precipitation. The research findings can provide scientific support for the future management and planning of vegetation in the YRB, as well as contribute to the promotion of ecological environment regulation and sustainable development.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of MBT, OBIA and PBRF Method for High-Altitude Water Body Mapping: A Case Study of Mago River Basin of Arunachal Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate mapping of high-altitude water bodies in a hilly region is a challenging task due to the hill shadows that have a similar signature as water bodies and the presence of ample amounts of small water bodies. This study compared three techniques (MBT, PBRF, and OBIA) to map water bodies in the Mago river basin, Arunachal Pradesh, a part of the Eastern Himalaya. Spectral indices (MNDWI, NDWI, NDTI, and slope) were used as input variables. The study also assessed the performance of the 'VV' band of Sentinel-1 SAR data in MBT and PBRF (MBTv and PBRFv) compared to methods without using the 'VV' band (MBTn and PBRFn). An accuracy assessment was carried out using ground truth data collected through a partial field survey, high-resolution Google Earth imagery, and visual interpretation of raw data due to inaccessibility of the area. It was found that there are 224 high-altitude water bodies present in the basin with an area of 4.77 sq. km based on the ground truth datasets. All three methods were applied to map the high-altitude water bodies and an accuracy assessment was performed. The PBRFv shows the highest overall accuracy (85.3%) with a kappa of 0.83. In comparison, both the OBIA and MBTv method produces the similar result as 71.4% and 71.7% with a kappa of 0.71 and 0.70, respectively. On the other hand, the overall accuracy of the MBTn and PBRFn method was found to be 67.1% and 83.3% with kappa as 0.63 and 0.83, respectively. The total area of the water bodies using the BPRFn method (4.60 sq. km) and BBRFv (4.62 sq. km) was found more closer to ground truth data (4.77 sq. km) compared to all other methods. MBTn has the highest number of misclassified water bodies, while PBRFv showed no misclassifications. However, PBRFv missed to map a few smaller water bodies (33 in total) due to their size. The slope factor effectively reduced noise caused by hill shadows, as water bodies were mainly found on gentle to flat land. Therefore, the PBRFv approach was considered the most suitable method for accurately mapping high-altitude water bodies compared to the other technique.

TI  - Integrating geographic data and the SCS-CN method with LSTM networks for enhanced runoff forecasting in a complex mountain basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn complex mountain basins, hydrological forecasting poses a formidable challenge due to the intricacies of runoff generation processes and the limitations of available data. This study explores the enhancement of short-term runoff forecasting models through the utilization of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.MethodsTo achieve this, we employed feature engineering (FE) strategies, focusing on geographic data and the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. Our investigation was conducted in a 3,390 km2 basin, employing the GSMaP-NRT satellite precipitation product (SPP) to develop forecasting models with lead times of 1, 6, and 11 h. These lead times were selected to address the needs of near-real-time forecasting, flash flood prediction, and basin concentration time assessment, respectively.Results and discussionOur findings demonstrate an improvement in the efficiency of LSTM forecasting models across all lead times, as indicated by Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of 0.93 (1 h), 0.77 (6 h), and 0.67 (11 h). Notably, these results are on par with studies relying on ground-based precipitation data. This methodology not only showcases the potential for advanced data-driven runoff models but also underscores the importance of incorporating available geographic information into precipitation-ungauged hydrological systems. The insights derived from this study offer valuable tools for hydrologists and researchers seeking to enhance the accuracy of hydrological forecasting in complex mountain basins.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Estimates of malaria burden and intervention uptake in Africa are primarily based on household surveys. However, their expense and infrequency limit their utility. We investigated whether data collected during antenatal care (ANC) can provide relevant information for decision-makers.Methods: Malaria test positivity rates and questionnaire data from ANC attendees at 39 health facilities were compared to questionnaire data and positivity rates among children from two cross-sectional surveys in the facilities' corresponding catchment areas.Results: Trends in parasitemia among ANC attendees were predictive of trends in parasitemia among children at the council level (mean absolute error 6.0%). Primigravid ANC attendees had the lowest rates of net ownership (modeled odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.40) and use (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.79). ANC attendees reported higher levels of care-seeking (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.48-2.14), malaria testing (OR 4.16, 95% CI 3.44-5.04), and treatment for children with fever (OR 7.66, 95% CI 4.89-11.98) compared to women surveyed in households, raising concerns about social desirability bias disproportionately impacting ANC surveys.Conclusion: ANC surveillance is an effective strategy for tracking trends in malaria burden. More work is required to elucidate the value of administering questionnaires to ANC attendees.Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T2  - NEW GLOBAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Literature discussing imperialism and neo-colonial practices focuses on the alleged power of the West and/or the United States, as well as global neoliberalism. This article argues that neo-colonial knowledge production in the autocratizing regimes of Hungary and Nicaragua reflects the rising importance of China. It shows how both governments seek to set forth new schools of thought suiting their worldview. The People's Republic of China serves as a narrative fix point for legitimizing dissociative diplomatic agendas via comprador academics supported by their government. In what is presented as changing global orders, China joins Russia as a new counterweight to the presupposed U.S. hegemonic and liberal interests. Besides advocating for new partners in the East, compradors colonializing academia argue for the distinctive needs of their respective nations represented by the government. Interviews, publications, and news reports allow one to reconstruct their colonialization efforts to support such nationalist narratives on China's rise as a global power.

TI  - Assessing potential of the Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR) for water quality monitoring across the coastal United States.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR) will provide unique high temporal frequency observations of the United States coastal waters to quantify processes that vary on short temporal and spatial scales. The frequency and coverage of observations from geostationary orbit will improve quantification and reduce uncertainty in tracking water quality events such as harmful algal blooms and oil spills. This study looks at the potential for GLIMR to complement existing satellite platforms from its unique geostationary viewpoint for water quality and oil spill monitoring with a focus on temporal and spatial resolution aspects. Water quality measures derived from satellite imagery, such as harmful algal blooms, thick oil, and oil emulsions are observable with glint <0.005sr-1, while oil films require glint >10-5sr-1. Daily imaging hours range from 6 to 12h for water quality measures, and 0 to 6h for oil film applications throughout the year as defined by sun glint strength. Spatial pixel resolution is 300m at nadir and median pixel resolution was 391m across the entire field of regard, with higher spatial resolution across all spectral bands in the Gulf of Mexico than existing satellites, such as MODIS and VIIRS, used for oil spill surveillance reports. The potential for beneficial glint use in oil film detection and quality flagging for other water quality parameters was greatest at lower latitudes and changed location throughout the day from the West and East Coasts of the United States. GLIMR scan times can change from the planned ocean color default of 0.763s depending on the signal-to-noise ratio application requirement and can match existing and future satellite mission regions of interest to leverage multi-mission observations.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node biopsy for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a well-established staging method. One variation is to inject a radioactive tracer near the primary tumor of the patient. After a few minutes, audio feedback from an external hand-held gamma-detection probe can monitor the uptake into the lymphatic system. Such probes place a high cognitive load on the surgeon during the biopsy, as they require the simultaneous use of both hands and the skills necessary to correlate the audio signal with the location of tracer accumulation in the lymph nodes. Therefore, an augmented reality (AR) approach to directly visualize and thus discriminate nearby lymph nodes would greatly reduce the surgeons' cognitive load.Materials and methods We present a proof of concept of an AR approach for sentinel lymph node biopsy by ex vivo experiments. The 3D position of the radioactive gamma-sources is reconstructed from a single gamma-image, acquired by a stationary table-attached multi-pinhole gamma-detector. The position of the sources is then visualized using Microsoft's HoloLens. We further investigate the performance of our SLNF algorithm for a single source, two sources, and two sources with a hot background.Results In our ex vivo experiments, a single gamma-source and its AR representation show good correlation with known locations, with a maximum error of 4.47 mm. The SLNF algorithm performs well when only one source is reconstructed, with a maximum error of 7.77 mm. For the more challenging case to reconstruct two sources, the errors vary between 2.23 mm and 75.92 mm.Conclusion This proof of concept shows promising results in reconstructing and displaying one gamma-source. Two simultaneously recorded sources are more challenging and require further algorithmic optimization.

TI  - Monitoring the Spread of Grapevine Viruses in Vineyards of Contrasting Agronomic Practices: A Metagenomic Investigation.
T2  - Biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study investigated the transmission of grapevine viruses, specifically grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) and grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV), in vineyards in Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada. Forty sentinel vines that were confirmed free of GRBV and GPGV by both high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and endpoint polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were introduced to two vineyards (one organic and one conventional) that were heavily infected with both GRBV and GPGV. Four months post-introduction, the sentinel vines were relocated to a phytotron. The HTS results from 15 months post-introduction revealed a widespread infection of GPGV among the sentinel vines but did not detect any GRBV. The GPGV infection rate of sentinel vines in the organic vineyard (13/18) was higher than in the conventional vineyard (1/19). The possibility of an alternative viral reservoir was assessed by testing the most abundant plants in between rows (Medicago sativa, Trifolium repens, Cirsium arvense and Taraxacum officinale), perennial plants in border areas (Fraxinus americana, Ulmus americana, Rhamnus cathartica) and wild grape (unknown Vitis sp.). The HTS result showed that cover crops and perennial plants did not harbor any grapevine viruses, while 4/5 wild grapes tested positive for GPGV but not GRBV. A pairwise sequence identity analysis revealed high similarities between the GPGV isolates found in the established vines on the vineyard and the newly contracted GPGV isolates in the sentinel vines, implicating a recent transmission event. This work provides novel insights into the spread of grapevine viruses in Niagara Region and is also the first direct proof of the spread of GPGV in natural vineyard conditions in North America.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Frequent occurrence of earthquakes and the massive exploitation of underground resources make Songyuan City an area prone to surface deformation. Surface deformation causes damage to roads, pipelines and other public facilities, and have a negative impact on the ecological protection and economic construction. Based on the SBAS-InSAR and using Sentinel-1 images as the data source, this study obtained the time series surface deformation results of Songyuan City from August 2015 to August 2019. Furthermore, through the consistency check of deformation results obtained by different methods or data, and the cross-validation between InSAR and leveling results, the reliability of time series InSAR applied to surface deformation monitoring in Songyuan City was proved. The results showed that the surface deformation of Songyuan City was dominated by slow subsidence, the average deformation rate was - 0.6 mm/year, and the deformation showed an annual cyclical "subsidence-uplift" change. The maximum cumulative subsidence reached - 100.6 mm, occurred in the oil production area in the east of Qian'an County. Finally, starting from natural influencing factors, this study analyzed the differences in deformation results of different land cover areas, studied the correlation between time series deformation and meteorological data, and discussed the relationship between deformation and earthquake distribution. By monitoring and analyzing the surface deformation results based on time series InSAR, it can provide data reference for urban planning and ecological environment improvement of Songyuan City, improve the scientific level of surface deformation disasters monitoring and prevention, and lay a good foundation for sustainable development.

TI  - Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation for HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer historically exhibited the most adverse local outcomes and, consequently, has had limited representation among trials of partial breast irradiation (PBI). We hypothesized that with contemporary HER2-targeted agents, patients may now exhibit excellent disease control outcomes after adjuvant PBI.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using a prospectively maintained institutional database, we identified patients with HER2+ breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and PBI from 2000 to 2022. Salient clinicopathologic and treatment parameters were collected. All patients received external beam PBI to 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Cumulative incidence functions were calculated to estimate the incidence of local recurrence (LR) with the competing risk of death.RESULTS: We identified 1248 patients who underwent PBI at our institution, of whom the study cohort comprised 52 (4%) with HER2+ breast cancer (median age, 64 years; range, 44-87). Nearly all had T1 tumors (98%; median size, 12 mm [range, 1-21 mm]). Most had estrogen receptor positive disease (88%), and all patients had negative surgical margins. Nearly all underwent sentinel node biopsy (94%), with the remainder undergoing no surgical axillary evaluation. Forty-two (81%) received chemotherapy; 40 (77%), hormone therapy; and 42 (81%), HER2-directed therapy, most commonly trastuzumab. At 143.8 person-years of follow-up (range, 7-226 months for each patient), we observed 2 LR events at 14 and 26 months, respectively, yielding a 2-year LR rate of 3.8%. No regional or distant recurrences were observed, nor were any breast-specific mortality events. Two deaths were observed, both without evidence of disease.CONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of patients with HER2+ early-stage breast cancer managed with BCS and PBI, we observed a 2-year LR rate of 3.8%, with no regional or distant recurrences and excellent overall survival. These findings require confirmation with longer follow-up among larger cohorts but appear consistent with the excellent results of contemporary randomized trials of PBI unselected for HER2 status.

TI  - Urban vegetation cooling capacity was enhanced under rapid urbanization in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The cooling capacity of urban vegetation, which forms "urban cooling islands" (UCI), can play an important role in mitigating urban heat islands (UHI). However, the spatiotemporal changes in UCI intensity at the national scale have not been fully explored under rapid urbanization in China. In this study, based on 23,081 Landsat images from the Google Earth Engine, spatiotemporal UCI was obtained for 320 cities in China from 2000 to 2018 and correlated with meteorological and urbanization parameters to uncover the factors driving UCI changes. The direct and indirect effects of the driving factors on UCI were investigated using structural equation modeling. Our results showed that China experienced 12.38%, 181.23%, 83.6%, and 22.63% increases in population density, gross domestic product (GDP), the impervious surface, and leaf area index (LAI), respectively, between 2000 and 2018. Furthermore, we found more rapid urbanization in the temperate continental climate (TCC) zone than in the temperate monsoon climate (TMC) and subtropical monsoon climate (SMC) zones in China. The national averaged UCI was 2.47 degrees C, with the largest UCI recorded in small cities and TCC zones. From 2000 to 2018, over 70% of cities showed an increasing trend in UCI intensity, mainly concentrated in TMC and megacities. At the national scale, the increase in UCI was likely explained by a combination result of the intensified wind speed, decrease in urban areas, and enhanced LAI. We also identified that the driving mechanisms of UCI were very different in different climatic zones. In TCC, precipitation had a major impact on UCI intensity at a threshold of 78.92 mm. In TMC and SMC, in addition to temperature, urbanization factors significantly influenced UCI. The main factors in TMC were LAI, with a specific threshold of 1.15. These results deepen the understanding of UCI formation and provide new insights into the regional adaptation of urban vegetation to mitigate urban heat waves.

TI  - Water color from Sentinel-2 MSI data for monitoring large rivers: Yangtze and Danube
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rivers provide key ecosystem services that are inherently engineered and optimized to meet the strategic and economic needs of countries around the world. However, limited water quality records of a full river continuum hindered the understanding of how river systems response to the multiple stressors acting on them. This study highlights the use of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) data to monitor changes in water color in two optically complex river systems: the Yangtze and Danube using the Forel-Ule Index (FUI). FUI divides water color into 21 classes from dark blue to yellowish brown stemming from the historical Forel-Ule water color scale and has been promoted as a useful indicator showing water turbidity variations in water bodies. The results revealed contrasting water color patterns in the two rivers on both spatial and seasonal scales. Spatially, the FUI of the Yangtze River gradually increased from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, while the FUI of the Danube River declined in the lower reaches, which is possibly due to the sediment sink effect of the Iron Gate Dams. The regional FUI peaks and valleys observed in the two river systems have also been shown to be related to the dams and hydropower stations along them. Seasonally, the variations of FUI in both systems can be attributed to climate seasonality, especially precipitation in the basin and the water level. Moreover, land cover within the river basin was possibly a significant determinant of water color, as higher levels of vegetation in the Danube basin were associated with lower FUI values, whereas higher FUI values and lower levels of vegetation were observed in the Yangtze system. This study furthers our knowledge of using Sentinel-2 MSI to monitor and understand the spatial-temporal variations of river systems and highlights the capabilities of the FUI in an optically complex environment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Although research conducted worldwide has pinpointed the importance of the cultivation of worldviews in citizenship education, little is known of how worldviews are constructed in the civics curriculum. In this study, we adopted a comparative historical approach to examine how China's civics curriculum has interpreted the meaning of life for young citizens during the transformation of the country from an empire into a nation-state. The data were drawn from 210 school textbooks published between 1902 and 2020. Four historical periods were delineated: the late Qing and Republican era, the Maoist era, the Deng Xiaoping era, and the current Xi Jinping administration. The findings demonstrated the trends and changes that took place while the ideal of citizenship and citizenship education took root, driving the modernisation of Chinese society. Through this study, we contribute to the theoretical discussions on enriching civics curriculum development from a humanist perspective.

TI  - How will power outages affect the national economic growth: Evidence from 152 countries
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Electricity system security is facing severe challenges due to climate change, natural disasters, and network cyber-attacks. Although the microeconomic impacts of power outages on economic output have been well studied, there is insufficient understanding on their macro-economic effects, thus failing to efficiently support the electricity reliability policies. With this motivation, this study first constructs a theoretical model to analyze the mechanism between power outages and economic growth based on the classical production function. Then, an empirical econometric model is developed from the theoretical analysis and applied to 152 countries. To address the potential endogeneity problems, an index of annual country lightning density is calculated using remote sensing data and is served as an instrumental variable of power outages. Our major findings are that: (1) every 1% decrease in System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) will lead to an increase in global economic growth of 2.16%. (2) the impacts of power outages are heterogenous among different countries, and larger impacts occur in countries of lower-income, larger land area and lower electrification rates. (3) the improvement of power infrastructure quality in low-income countries can significantly narrow the world wealth gap, and the Gini index will decline by 9.55 parts per thousand if the SAIDI in low-income countries is reduced to 10% quantile of that in highincome countries. Our results provide evidence for investment in power system operating and power supply quality improving.

T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a new dataset of high-resolution satellite readings of soil moisture in conjunction with climate-economy econometric models and machine learning methods, we quantify the risk to global agricultural commodities from climate change. Our climate risk measure based on soil moisture fluctuations has a significantly negative impact on the yield of major cereals, and the effect is greater than temperature and precipitation. This impact concentrates on countries with lower income levels, harsher climate conditions, or less irrigated farmland. Moreover, we show agricultural commodities are less vulnerable to current drought risks in countries with higher frequencies of past droughts, suggesting that countries adapt to climate change through learning from prior experience.

TI  - Fluorescent-guided surgery and the use of indocyanine green sentinel lymph node mapping in the pediatric and young adult oncology population
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Technetium-99 (Tc-99m) lymphoscintigraphy with blue dye injection is an accepted method for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, but blue dye has known adverse effects, and injection of Tc-99m may increase time under anesthesia for pediatric patients. Indocyanine green (ICG) may serve as an adjunct to assist with visibility and identification of SLNs. We hypothesized that sensitivity of ICG was similar to blue dye in SLN biopsies.Methods: Thirty patients (36 procedures with 96 total specimens) underwent preoperative intradermal injection of Tc-99m, followed by intradermal injection of isosulfan blue and ICG. Test characteristics of blue dye, ICG, and Tc-99m included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).Results; ICG had a sensitivity of 87% and PPV of 83% for detection of Tc-99m-hot lymph nodes; blue dye had a sensitivity of 44% and PPV of 97%. For detection of pathologically confirmed lymph nodes, ICG had a sensitivity of 84% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 91%. Tc-99m had a sensitivity of 82% and a PPV of 94%. ICG had no significant difference in odds of being positive in pathology-confirmed lymph nodes compared to Tc-99m (odds ratio [OR], 0.818; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-2.172; p = .823) and had higher odds than isosulfan blue (OR, 0.025, 95% CI, 0.001-0.148; p < .001).Conclusion: This study established the efficacy of ICG as an adjunct to SLNB in the pediatric and young adult population. ICG was safe, more efficacious than blue dye, and may obviate the need for lymphoscintigraphy in selected patients resulting in reduced time under anesthesia.

M3  - Article
AB  - Crop discrimination helps monitor crops and strengthen the agricultural industry to secure food supplies. From existing crop-related studies and observations, found that vegetative Empirical models were limited in crop classification for Kharif and Rabi season crops based on biomass. To improve biomass assessment, this study proposes a modified Vegetation Index using the deviation factor from the plot between the Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index (DPSVI) and the Dual Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI). The deviation factor corrects the difficulties in the lower and higher ranges and is found to be 0.5 for Kharif and Rabi at the harvest stage. Performance of Integrated SAR Vegetation Index carried out to both seasons and shows Kharif (R2 = 0.83), Rabi (R2 = 0.87). In addition, cross-validation with Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Dif-ference Vegetation Index, which has R2 values of 0.84 and 0.86 for Kharif and Rabi seasonal crops respectively. A correlation was performed to assess the capability of the proposed model for individual crops and found that good correlation with vertically grown Kharif and rabi crops except for Sesamum Indicum. A classification capability of the Kharif (76%) and Rabi (84%) crops and variation shows crops are healthy and have more greenery. From the results, a modified measure outperformed than DPSVI and DpRVI at the harvest stage for a selected crop in the above season and proved an alternate.

TI  - Recognizing Relational Interactions with Social Institutions in Refugee Children's Experiences of Intertwining Vulnerability and Agency.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In this paper, we examine relational interactions between refugee children and social institutions, building the case for the recognition of the co-occurrence and intertwining of vulnerability and agency in children's experiences in diverse refugee situations. This developmental relational approach offers refinement of a general relational worldview by specifying how vulnerable and agentic experiences are co-constructed by children and adult individuals and institutions. We analyze the conceptual roots of vulnerable and agentic experiences, and use the concept of co-construction to specify the processes and outcomes of interactive relational experiences. Evidence from example studies of the intertwining of vulnerability and agency in specific refugee situations demonstrates how refugee children contribute to power-oriented experiences. Due recognition of the relational co-construction of intertwining vulnerable and agentic experiences provides a basis for refining generalized relational observations, and a fine-grained basis for developing policies and procedures to dispel ambivalence to refugee children and to change inequitable policies and practices.

AB  - Eyelid squamous cell carcinoma is a major type of rare eyelid cancer, together with basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma. It is a painless disease that progresses slowly and is often detected by the appearance of nodules or plaques. Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light, fair skin, radiation and human papillomavirus infection. The standard treatment is surgical removal, and in cases of orbital invasion, orbital content removal is required. If sentinel node biopsy reveals a high risk of lymph node metastasis, adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered. Local chemotherapy, such as imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil, may be used for eyelid squamous cell carcinoma in situ. When surgery or radiotherapy is not recommended for distant metastases or locally advanced disease, drug therapy is often according to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in Japan. The treatment often requires a multidisciplinary team to ensure the preservation of function and cosmetic appearance.This review is aimed at oncologists and focuses on the classification, epidemiology, examination and diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of rare eyelid cancers, particularly eyelid squamous cell carcinoma.

T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The summer season has a high influence on the aerosol load of Turkey. Atmospheric parameters produce a radiative climatic response when exposed to aerosols from multiple sources. The main aim of this research is to observe the spatio-temporal characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) with atmospheric and surface covariates during the summer of 2003-2016 in Turkey. The AOD products for this study were retrieved at level 3 from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on a daily timescale. Prevailing meteorological parameters such as precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, surface soil moisture, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used on a daily and monthly timescale. The spatio-temporal distribution of aerosols and meteorological parameters were plotted and analyzed from which each variable exhibited a unique spatial distribution. The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was used to analyze the increasing and decreasing trends of AOD throughout the years. MODIS AOD had an increasing trend in the eastern, northeastern, southeastern, southwestern, and northern regions of Turkey whereas a significant decreasing trend was observed in the northwestern regions. MISR AOD had a strong significantly increasing trend in the eastern, northeastern, southern, and central regions whereas the western, northern, and central regions of Turkey expanded under a decreasing trend. Furthermore, correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between AOD and the prevailing covariates from which the correlation between EVI and AOD was extremely variable in both datasets. Wavelet analysis (both continuous and coherence) was performed to analyze the periodic nature of AOD and meteorological parameters. Both MODIS and MISR exhibited significant coherencies in the 16-256 periodic for all covariates except for EVI which was plotted on a monthly time scale. In this study, a notable variation was observed in the space-time dynamics between MODIS and MISR datasets which can be used for future studies that attempt to analyze the relationship between AOD and covariates during the summer season.

TI  - Oppy on arguments and worldviews: an internal critique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper develops an internal critique of Graham Oppy's metaphilosophy of religion - his theories of argumentation, worldview comparison, and epistemic justification. First, it presents Oppy's views and his main reasons in their favor. Second, it argues that Oppy is committed to two claims - that only truth-conducive reasons can justify philosophical belief and that such justification depends entirely on one's judgments about the theoretical virtues of comprehensive worldviews - that jointly entail the unacceptable conclusion that philosophical beliefs cannot be justified. Third, it briefly argues that of his two claims, it is his thoroughgoing coherentism that should be rejected.

TI  - Diagnostic value of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging in acral melanoma-predominant Asian patients.
T2  - Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor staging is crucial for melanoma, of which acral melanoma is the predominant subtype in Asians. 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-FDG-PET/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) serve as non-invasive imaging tools for tumor staging. However, the literature is scarce on the diagnostic value of PET for acral melanoma.METHODS: From January 1, 2006, to November 30, 2022, a total of 352 patients were diagnosed with melanoma at our hospital. Of them, 90 were diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma and underwent preoperative PET/CT for staging and sentinel lymph node biopsy or complete lymph node dissection. Staging of PET/CT was confirmed by histopathology or following imaging. The lymph node biopsy, distant metastasis status, and PET/CT imaging results were analyzed.RESULTS: Of all the 90 patients with cutaneous melanoma, 72 of them were diagnosed as acral melanoma(80.0%). Compared with the histopathologic results, the lymph nodes were true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative in 12, 54, seven, and 17 cases, respectively. The sensitivity of PET/CT for local lymph nodes was 41.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.5-61.1%), while its specificity was 88.5% (95% CI, 77.8-95.3%). As for the detection of distal metastasis, the PET results were true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative in six, 65, 15, and four cases, respectively. The sensitivity of PET for distal metastasis detection was 60.0% (95% CI, 26.2-87.8%), while its specificity was 81.3% (95% CI, 71.0-89.1%).CONCLUSION: Although non-invasive, PET/CT has relatively low sensitivity in regional lymph node evaluations and fair sensitivity in distal metastasis detection in Asian patients with acral melanoma. Thus, PET/CT may be more useful in patients with clinically palpable nodes or more advanced disease stage.

TI  - Rasterizing CO2 emissions and characterizing their trends via an enhanced population-light index at multiple scales in China during 2013-2019.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Climate change caused by CO2 emissions (CE) has received widespread global concerns. Obtaining precision CE data is necessary for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality. Significant deficiencies of existing CE datasets such as coarse spatial resolution and low precision can hardly meet the actual requirements. An enhanced population-light index (RPNTL) was developed in this study, which integrates the Nighttime Light Digital Number (DN) Value from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and population density to improve CE estimation accuracy. The CE from the Carbon Emission Accounts & Datasets (CEADS) was divided into three sectors, namely urban, industrial, and rural, to differentiate the heterogeneity of CE in each sector. The ordinary least square (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), temporally weighted regression (TWR), and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models were employed to establish the quantitative relationship between RPNTL and CE for each sector. The optimal model was determined through model comparison and precision evaluation and was utilized to rasterize CE for urban, industrial, and rural areas. Additionally, hot spot analysis, trend analysis, and standard deviation ellipses were introduced to demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of CE at multiple scales. The performance of the GTWR outperformed other methods in estimating CE. The enhanced RPNTL demonstrated a higher coefficient of determination (R2=0.95) than the NTL (R2=0.92) in predicting CE, particularly in rural regions where the R2 value increased from 0.76 to 0.81. From 2013 to 2019, high CE was observed in eastern and northern China, while a decreasing trend was detected in northeastern China and Chengdu-Chongqing. Conversely, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Fenwei Plain, and Henan Province showed an increasing trend. The center of gravity for industrial and rural CE is shifting towards western regions, whereas that for urban CE is moving northward. This study provides valuable insights for decision-making on CE control.

TI  - Predicting global distributions of eukaryotic plankton communities from satellite data.
T2  - ISME communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor the global dynamics of marine plankton. Previous research has focused on developing models to predict the size or taxonomic groups of phytoplankton. Here, we present an approach to identify community types from a global plankton network that includes phytoplankton and heterotrophic protists and to predict their biogeography using global satellite observations. Six plankton community types were identified from a co-occurrence network inferred using a novel rDNA 18S V4 planetary-scale eukaryotic metabarcoding dataset. Machine learning techniques were then applied to construct a model that predicted these community types from satellite data. The model showed an overall 67% accuracy in the prediction of the community types. The prediction using 17 satellite-derived parameters showed better performance than that using only temperature and/or the concentration of chlorophyll a. The constructed model predicted the global spatiotemporal distribution of community types over 19 years. The predicted distributions exhibited strong seasonal changes in community types in the subarctic-subtropical boundary regions, which were consistent with previous field observations. The model also identified the long-term trends in the distribution of community types, which suggested responses to ocean warming.

TI  - Speculation on optimal numbers of examined lymph node for early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer from the perspective of stage migration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), how to perform lymphadenectomy to avoid stage migration and achieve reliable targeted excision has not been explored in depth. This study comprehensively considered the stage migration and survival to determine appropriate numbers of examined lymph node (ELN) for early-stage EOC and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).MethodsFrom the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we obtained 10372 EOC cases with stage T1M0 and ELN >= 2, including 2849 HGSOC cases. Generalized linear models with multivariable adjustment were used to analyze associations between ELN numbers and lymph node stage migration, survival and positive lymph node (PLN). LOESS regression characterized dynamic trends of above associations followed by Chow test to determine structural breakpoints of ELN numbers. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsMore ELNs were associated with more node-positive diseases, more PLNs and better prognosis. ELN structural breakpoints were different in subgroups of early-stage EOC, which for node stage migration or PLN were more than those for improving outcomes. The meaning of ELN structural breakpoint varied with its location and the morphology of LOESS curve. To avoid stage migration, the optimal ELN for early-stage EOC was 29 and the minimal ELN for HGSOC was 24. For better survival, appropriate ELN number were 13 and 8 respectively. More ELNs explained better prognosis only at a certain range.DiscussionNeither too many nor too few numbers of ELN were ideal for early-stage EOC and HGSOC. Excision with appropriate numbers of lymph node draining the affected ovary may be more reasonable than traditional sentinel lymph node resection and systematic lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Identification of thermal front dynamics in the northern Malacca Strait using ROMS 3D-model
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The thermal front in the oceanic system is believed to have a significant effect on biological activity. During an era of climate change, changes in heat regulation between the atmosphere and oceanic interior can alter the characteristics of this important feature. Using the simulation results of the 3D Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we identified the location of thermal fronts and determined their dynamic variability in the area between the southern Andaman Sea and northern Malacca Strait. The Single Image Edge Detection (SIED) algorithm was used to detect the thermal front from model-derived temperature. Results show that a thermal front occurred every year from 2002 to 2012 with the temperature gradient at the location of the front was 0.3 & DEG;C/km. Compared to the years affected by El Nino and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the normal years (e.g., May 2003) show the presence of the thermal front at every selected depth (10, 25, 50, and 75 m), whereas El Nino and negative IOD during 2010 show the presence of the thermal front only at depth of 75 m due to greater warming, leading to the thermocline deepening and enhanced stratification. During May 2003, the thermal front was separated by cooler SST in the southern Andaman Sea and warmer SST in the northern Malacca Strait. The higher SST in the northern Malacca Strait was believed due to the besieged Malacca Strait, which trapped the heat and make it difficult to release while higher chlorophyll a in Malacca Strait is due to the freshwater conduit from nearby rivers (Klang, Langat, Perak, and Selangor). Furthermore, compared to the southern Andaman Sea, the chlorophyll a in the northern Malacca Strait is easier to reach the surface area due to the shallower thermocline, which allows nutrients in the area to reach the surface faster.

TI  - Infection of Primary Nasal Epithelial Cells Grown at an Air-Liquid Interface to Characterize Human Coronavirus-Host Interactions.
T2  - Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Video-Audio Media
AB  - Three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) - SARS-CoV (2002), MERS-CoV (2012), and SARS-CoV-2 (2019) - have emerged and caused significant public health crises in the past 20 years. Four additional HCoVs cause a significant portion of common cold cases each year (HCoV-NL63, -229E, -OC43, and -HKU1), highlighting the importance of studying these viruses in physiologically relevant systems. HCoVs enter the respiratory tract and establish infection in the nasal epithelium, the primary site encountered by all respiratory pathogens. We use a primary nasal epithelial culture system in which patient-derived nasal samples are grown at an air-liquid interface (ALI) to study host-pathogen interactions at this important sentinel site. These cultures recapitulate many features of the in vivo airway, includingthe cell types present, ciliary function, and mucus production. We describe methods to characterize viral replication, host cell tropism, virus-induced cytotoxicity, and innate immune induction in nasal ALI cultures following HCoV infection, using recent work comparing lethal and seasonal HCoVs as an example1. An increased understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the nose has the potential to provide novel targets for antiviral therapeutics against HCoVs and other respiratory viruses that will likely emerge in the future.

TI  - Optical Breast Imaging: A Review of Physical Principles, Technologies, and Clinical Applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Optical imaging involves the propagation of light through tissue. Current optical breast imaging technologies, including diffuse optical spectroscopy, diffuse optical tomography, and photoacoustic imaging, capitalize on the selective absorption of light in the near-infrared spectrum by deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin. They provide information on the morphological and functional characteristics of different tissues based on their varied interactions with light, including physiologic information on lesion vascular content and anatomic information on tissue vascularity. Fluorescent contrast agents, such as indocyanine green, are used to visualize specific tissues, molecules, or proteins depending on how and where the agent accumulates. In this review, we describe the physical principles, spectrum of technologies, and clinical applications of the most common optical systems currently being used or developed for breast imaging. Most notably, US co-registered photoacoustic imaging and US-guided diffuse optical tomography have demonstrated efficacy in differentiating benign from malignant breast masses, thereby improving the specificity of diagnostic imaging. Diffuse optical tomography and diffuse optical spectroscopy have shown promise in assessing treatment response to preoperative systemic therapy, and photoacoustic imaging and diffuse optical tomography may help predict tumor phenotype. Lastly, fluorescent imaging using indocyanine green dye performs comparably to radioisotope mapping of sentinel lymph nodes and appears to improve the outcomes of autologous tissue flap breast reconstruction.

TI  - Effect of spontaneous vegetation on beneficial arthropods in Mediterranean vineyards
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat destruction and land use intensification are major causes of arthropod decline in agroecosystems. Arthropods are key organisms that are linked to many ecosystem functions and sustainability of agriculture. Using 37 vineyards in Southern France as a model system, we analysed which characteristics of spontaneous inter-row vegetation positively influence beneficial arthropods and pest insect predation. We specifically studied the effects of flower cover, grass cover, the ratio of perennials to annuals, plant species richness and extrafloral nectar on beneficial arthropod communities in vineyards. We used direct observation and net hunting to evaluate arthropod abundance. Sentinel cards with Lucilia sp. larvae were placed on grapevine plants to analyse caterpillar predation. We found that most groups of tested beneficial arthropods were positively influenced by flower cover and plant species richness. In particular, the abundance of predators such as ladybirds (adults and larvae) and crab spiders and the abundance of parasitic wasps were positively correlated to flower cover in vineyard interrow vegetation. The abundance of ladybirds, hoverflies and crab spiders was also positively related to plant species richness. Our results demonstrated the importance of floral resources and plant diversity for beneficial arthropods and caterpillar predation confirming their key role in biological control of pest insects.

TI  - Estimation of historical daily airborne pollen concentrations across Switzerland using a spatio temporal random forest model.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - High concentrations of airborne pollen trigger seasonal allergies and possibly more severe adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health events. Predicting pollen concentration accurately is valuable for epidemiological studies, in order to study the effects of pollen exposure. We aimed to develop a spatiotemporal machine learning model predicting daily pollen concentrations at a spatial resolution of 1*1km across Switzerland between 2000 and 2019. Daily pollen concentrations for five common, highly allergenic pollen types (hazel, alder, birch ash, and grasses) were available from fourteen measurement sites across Switzerland. We considered several predictors such as elevation, species distribution, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, satellite-observed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and land-use (CORINE, Landsat satellite) to explain variation in pollen concentration. We employed feature engineering techniques to encode categorical variables and fill in missing values. We applied a random forest machine learning model with 5-fold cross-validation. The 5th-99th percentiles for concentrations of hazel, alder, birch, ash, and grass pollen at the pollen monitoring stations were 0-298, 0-306, 0-1153, 0-800, and 0-290 pollen grains/m3, respectively. The results of a predictive model for these concentrations yielded overall R2 values of 0.87, 0.84, 0.89, 0.88, and 0.91, and temporal root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 16.07, 16.72, 69.04, 41.50, and 22.45 pollen grains/m3. An analysis of predictor variable importance indicates that the average national daily pollen concentration is the most important predictor of pollen concentrations for all pollen types. Furthermore, meteorological variables including temperature, total precipitation, humidity, boundary layer height, wind speed, and wind direction, as well as date and satellite features, are important factors in pollen concentration prediction. These spatiotemporal pollen models will serve to estimate individual residential pollen exposure for epidemiological studies. Resulting estimates will enable us to study respiratory and cardiovascular mortality and hospital admissions in Switzerland.

TI  - Cancer immunotherapy responses persist after lymph node resection.
T2  - bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Due to the critical role of lymph nodes (LNs) in the initiation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses, it is unclear whether surgical removal or ablative radiation therapy of LNs should be performed in patients with metastatic LNs that will receive immunotherapy. Surgical removal of LNs to prevent metastatic recurrence, including sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and completion lymph node dissection (CLND), are performed in routine practice. However, removing LNs eliminates opportunities for generating anti-cancer immune responses that are enhanced with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Balancing the potential risks and benefits of LN surgery is necessary to maximize outcomes for patients. In contrast to mouse studies using ectopic tumor implantation 1,2 , the phase III clinical trial NCT00636168 found patients with completely resected stage III melanoma (primary tumor, sentinel LNs and disease-related LNs all removed) still benefited from anti-CTLA4 inhibition. Our retrospective analysis demonstrated that stage III melanoma patients with SLNB or CLND have similar response to anti-PD1 inhibition. Using orthotopic murine mammary carcinoma and melanoma that have spontaneous LN metastases, we show that responses to ICB persist in mice after resection of TDLNs.

TI  - Integrated analysis of marine biotoxins and contaminants of emerging concern in bivalve mollusks from Santa Catarina, Brazil.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Santa Catarina is the main producer state of oysters and mussels in Brazil, reaching 98% of national production. To assure the safety of bivalve mollusks production, control programs of marine biotoxins (MBs) have been continuously performed. Herein, the co-occurrence of MBs and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in oyster and mussels from the main production sites of Santa Catarina was reported, covering 178 compounds. Samples of wild and non-cultivated oysters and mussels were also assessed. Chemometric tools were used to evaluate and optimize several sample preparation techniques such as solid-liquid, ultrasound assisted, and pressurized liquid extraction. The optimized protocol was based on ultrasound assisted extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed the incidence of several CECs and MBs. In the case of MBs, all results were below the regulatory limits for both cultivated and non-cultivated samples. Wild mollusks have shown a higher number of compounds. Regarding CECs, the more frequent compounds were caffeine, diclofenac, meloxicam, and sertraline. Domoic acid and okadaic acid were the main toxins detected. The results highlighted the need of monitoring for MBs and the potential of oyster and mussels as sentinel organisms to risk analysis of CECs in coastal regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to describe a simultaneous sample preparation and analysis of CECs and MBs in bivalve mollusks, as well as the first report of meloxicam and florfenicol in mussels and oysters.

AB  - Context. The availability of large bandwidth receivers for millimeter radio telescopes allows for the acquisition of position-position-frequency data cubes over a wide field of view and a broad frequency coverage. These cubes contain a lot of information on the physical, chemical, and kinematical properties of the emitting gas. However, their large size coupled with an inhomogenous signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are major challenges for consistent analysis and interpretation.Aims. We searched for a denoising method of the low S/N regions of the studied data cubes that would allow the low S/N emission to be recovered without distorting the signals with a high S/N.Methods. We performed an in-depth data analysis of the (CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-17 (1-0) data cubes obtained as part of the ORION-B large program performed at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We analyzed the statistical properties of the noise and the evolution of the correlation of the signal in a given frequency channel with that of the adjacent channels. This has allowed us to propose significant improvements of typical autoassociative neural networks, often used to denoise hyperspectral Earth remote sensing data. Applying this method to the( 13)CO (1-0) cube, we were able to compare the denoised data with those derived with the multiple Gaussian fitting algorithm ROHSA, considered as the state-of-the-art procedure for data line cubes.Results. The nature of astronomical spectral data cubes is distinct from that of the hyperspectral data usually studied in the Earth remote sensing literature because the observed intensities become statistically independent beyond a short channel separation. This lack of redundancy in data has led us to adapt the method, notably by taking into account the sparsity of the signal along the spectral axis. The application of the proposed algorithm leads to an increase in the S/N in voxels with a weak signal, while preserving the spectral shape of the data in high S/N voxels.Conclusions. The proposed algorithm that combines a detailed analysis of the noise statistics with an innovative autoencoder architecture is a promising path to denoise radio-astronomy line data cubes. In the future, exploring whether a better use of the spatial correlations of the noise may further improve the denoising performances seems to be a promising avenue. In addition, dealing with the multiplicative noise associated with the calibration uncertainty at high S/N would also be beneficial for such large data cubes.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy vs No Axillary Surgery in Patients With Small Breast Cancer and Negative Results on Ultrasonography of Axillary Lymph Nodes The SOUND Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - IMPORTANCE Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary node staging of patients with early breast cancer (BC), but its necessity can be questioned since surgery for examination of axillary nodes is not performed with curative intent.OBJECTIVE To determine whether the omission of axillary surgery is noninferior to SLNB in patients with small BC and a negative result on preoperative axillary lymph node ultrasonography.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The SOUND (Sentinel Node vs Observation After Axillary Ultra-Sound) trial was a prospective noninferiority phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and Chile. A total of 1463 women of any age with BC up to 2 cmand a negative preoperative axillary ultrasonography result were enrolled and randomized between February 6, 2012, and June 30, 2017. Of those, 1405 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Data were analyzed from October 10, 2022, to January 13, 2023.INTERVENTION Eligible patients were randomized on a 1:1 ratio to receive SLNB (SLNB group) or no axillary surgery (no axillary surgery group).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of the studywas distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at 5 years, analyzed as intention to treat. Secondary end points were the cumulative incidence of distant recurrences, the cumulative incidence of axillary recurrences, DFS, overall survival (OS), and the adjuvant treatment recommendations.RESULTS Among 1405 women (median [IQR] age, 60 [52-68] years) included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 708 were randomized to the SLNB group, and 697 were randomized to the no axillary surgery group. Overall, the median (IQR) tumor size was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) cm, and 1234 patients (87.8%) had estrogen receptor-positive ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu), nonoverexpressing BC. In the SLNB group, 97 patients (13.7%) had positive axillary nodes. The median (IQR) follow-up for disease assessment was 5.7 (5.0-6.8) years in the SLNB group and 5.7 (5.0-6.6) years in the no axillary surgery group. Five-year distant DDFS was 97.7% in the SLNB group and 98.0% in the no axillary surgery group (log-rank P =.67; hazard ratio, 0.84; 90% CI, 0.45-1.54; noninferiority P =.02). A total of 12 (1.7%) locoregional relapses, 13 (1.8%) distant metastases, and 21 (3.0%) deaths were observed in the SLNB group, and 11 (1.6%) locoregional relapses, 14 (2.0%) distant metastases, and 18 (2.6%) deaths were observed in the no axillary surgery group.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, omission of axillary surgery was noninferior to SLNB in patients with small BC and a negative result on ultrasonography of the axillary lymph nodes. These results suggest that patients with these features can be safely spared any axillary surgery whenever the lack of pathological information does not affect the postoperative treatment plan.

TI  - Petrogenesis of Chang'E-5 young mare low-Ti basalts
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The regolith samples returned by the Chang'E-5 mission (CE-5) contain the youngest radiometrically dated mare basaltic clasts, which provide an opportunity to elucidate the magmatic activities on the Moon during the late Eratosthenian. In this study, detailed petrographic observations and comprehensive geochemical analyses were performed on the CE-5 basaltic clasts. The major element concentrations in individual plagioclase grain of the CE-5 basalts may vary slightly from core to rim, whereas pyroxene has clear chemical zonation. The crystallization sequence of the CE-5 mare basalts was determined using petrographic and geochemical relations in the basaltic clasts. In addition, both fractional crystallization (FC) and assimilation and fractional crystallization models were applied to simulate the chemical evolution of melt equilibrated with plagioclase in CE-5 basalts. Our results reveal that the melt had a TiO2 content of similar to 3 wt% and an Mg# of similar to 45 at the onset of plagioclase crystallization, suggesting a low-Ti parental melt of the CE-5 basalts. The relatively high FeO content (>14.5 wt%) in melt equilibrated with plagioclase could have resulted in extensive crystallization of ilmenite, unlike in Apollo low-Ti basalts. Furthermore, our calculations showed that the geochemical evolution of CE-5 basaltic melt could not have occurred in a closed system. On the contrary, the CE-5 basalts could have assimilated mineral, rock, and glass fragments that have higher concentrations of KREEP elements (potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus) in the regolith during magma flow on the Moon's surface. The presence of the KREEP signature in the CE-5 basalts is consistent with literature remote sensing data obtained from the CE-5 landing site. These KREEP-bearing fragments could originate from KREEP basaltic melts that may have been emplaced at the landing site earlier than the CE-5 basalts.

TI  - Analysis of physical changes in Fars province water zones related to climatic parameters using remote sensing, Bakhtegan, Tashk, Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, severe climate change, decreased precipitation, temperature rise, and increased evapotranspiration (ET) have significantly reduced waterbodies. Furthermore, governments have prioritized the study of water level fluctuations of lakes to protect them from degradation nationally and regionally. The present study investigated the physical changes in lakes Bakhtegan and Tashk due to climatic parameters. To this end, Landsat satellite imagery and the NDWI were employed to calculate the area of the waterbodies from 1986 to 2018. The results showed that the area had decreased during the study period- since 2009, Lake Bakhtegan had dried up completely. In 2008 and 2010, the lowest precipitation was 127.82 and 107.7 mm, respectively. During the study period (1986 to 2018), the average temperature was 19.44 degrees C, with an increase of 0.6 degrees C. Among the climatic parameters, precipitation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.55, and potential evapotranspiration (PET), with a correlation coefficient of about -0.68, were more strongly correlated with changes in the area of the waterbodies. To predict temperature and precipitation in the study area in the coming decades (2020-2050), the HadCM2 model of the CORDEX Project -WAS (South Asia) was used under two scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. These scenarios revealed the decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature trends. As a result, the waterbodies' areas were estimated using the projected precipitation and PET for the period 2050-2020, indicating a decrease in the areas of the waterbodies.

TI  - Writing (with) the body: the case of Kim de l'Horizon's <i>Blutbuch</i>
T2  - TEXTUAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In recent years, narratology has yielded innovative views on how certain narratives create and convey meaning through embodied processes. Such 'embodied narratives' have increasingly been considered to reflect the way human perception itself functions: by drawing upon corporeal impressions before mental cognition, and physical sensation before language. This article suggests that Kim de l'Horizon's Blutbuch offers further productive insight regarding the nature and function of the embodied narrative. The novel - an auto-fictional tale that deals with non-binary identity - shot to fame in the winter of 2022 after winning prestigious literary awards in the German-speaking world; and it has been lauded, in particular, for the pride of place it offers to the author-narrator's embodied perspectives on gender identity. As this article will argue, however, Blutbuch also foregrounds a biopolitical worldview in which all boundaries - and not just those of gender - are seen as superfluous. In doing so, not only does the novel allows its author-narrator to create a narrative body that reappropriates for itself the agency that cisnormative discourse would traditionally deny it, but it also proposes an expanded understanding of the embodied narrative: one that conceives of such forms of writing as metaphors for the body itself.

TI  - Cosmopolitanism and social dominance orientation mediate relationship between political orientation and sexism
T2  - ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, 'anti-gender discourse' has been institutionalised by the governing right-wing party in Hungary to a wide effect, from the removal of accreditation from a gender studies MA program to the Parliament's refusal to ratify the Istanbul Convention. The anti-egalitarian backlash echoes those emergent in other countries where right-wing populism has gained ground - such as Poland, Turkey, India, the United States, and Brazil. The present study examined the role of two opposite orientations, cosmopolitanism as an egalitarian worldview and social dominance orientation as the preference for hierarchies and inequality among groups and people in general, in mediating the relationship between political orientation and sexism among a representative Hungarian sample (N =1000). The path analysis revealed that left-wing political orientation was associated with higher levels of cosmopolitan orientation, while right-wing political orientation was associated with higher levels of SDO. Higher levels of cosmopolitan orientation were associated with a more positive attitude toward feminists and lower levels of modern sexism and gender-based zero-sum thinking, while higher levels of SDO were associated with the opposite. Furthermore, cosmopolitan orientation mediated the relationship between political orientation and modern sexism and attitudes toward feminists, while SDO mediated the relationship between political orientation and modern sexism and gender-based zero-sum thinking. Our study emphasizes the important role of cosmopolitan orientation in opposing SDO and promoting a more egalitarian worldview.

TI  - Satellite forecasting of crop harvest can trigger a cross-hemispheric production response and improve global food security
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global food security is increasingly threatened by climate change and regional human conflicts. Abnormal fluctuations in crop production in major exporting countries can cause volatility in food prices and household consumption in importing countries. Here we show that timely forecasting of crop harvest from satellite data over major exporting regions can trigger production response in the opposite hemisphere to offset the short-term fluctuations and stabilize global food supply. Satellite forecasting can reduce the fluctuation extents of country-level prices by 1.1 to 12.5 percentage points for anticipated wheat shortage or surplus in Russia and Ukraine, and even reverse the price shock in importing countries for anticipated soybean shortage in Brazil. Our research demonstrates that by leveraging the seasonal lags in crop calendars between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, operational crop monitoring from satellite data can provide a mechanism to improve global food security.The forecast of crop harvests in important exporting regions can trigger production reactions in the other hemisphere to compensate for seasonal price fluctuations and help stabilize the agricultural market, according to an analysis of simulations of an economic model driven by remote sensing data.

TI  - 'They tried to evil me': An explanatory model for Black Africans' mental health challenges
T2  - NURSING INQUIRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper explores the explanatory models of mental challenges among Black Africans in England. It argues that understanding these models is critical for providing culturally appropriate care to this population. The study employed qualitative methodology, and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Twelve mental health service users who are living in England and self-identified as first or second-generation Black Africans were purposively selected. The data were gathered using face-to-face semistructured interviews. Data were manually analysed in accordance with IPA concepts of searching for common, unique and idiosyncratic themes across transcripts. The findings revealed three themes Black Africans associated to their explanatory model of mental health challenges: complexities of migration, African-centred worldview and negative life experiences. To help alleviate the Eurocentric nature of mental health practice in England, it is hoped that this explanatory model will become an integral part of mental health practice in England and around the world.

TI  - How textural features can improve SAR-based tropical forest disturbance mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and timely accurate information about tropical forest disturbances is crucial for tracking critical forest changes, supporting forest management, and enabling law enforcement activities. In recent years, forest disturbance monitoring and alerting using cloud-penetrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has proven effective at national and pan-tropical scales. Related detection approaches mostly rely on detecting postdisturbance altered backscatter values in C or L-band SAR backscatter time series. Some disturbances are characterized by post-disturbance tree remnants or debris. For the time periods where these kinds of remnants remain present at the surface, the SAR backscatter values can be similar to those of stable forest. This can cause omission errors and delayed detection and it is considered a key shortcoming of current backscatter-based approaches. We hypothesized that despite fairly stable backscatter values, different orientation and arrangement of tree remnants leads to an altered heterogeneity of neighboring pixel values and that this can be quantified by textural features. We assessed six uncorrelated Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textural features using dense Sentinel-1C-band SAR time series. Forest disturbances, based on each GLCM feature using a pixel-based probabilistic change detection algorithm, were compared against results from forest disturbances mapped based only on backscatter data. We studied the impact of speckle-filtering on GLCM features and GLCM kernel sizes. We developed a method to combine backscatter and GLCM features, and we evaluated its robustness for a variety of natural and human-induced forest disturbance types across the Amazon Biome. Out of the six tested GLCM features GLCM Sum Average (SAVG) performed best. GLCM features derived from non-speckle filtered and speckle-filtered backscatter data did not show a noticeable impact on accuracy. A combination of backscatter and GLCM SAVG resulted in a reduced omission error of up to 36% and an improved timeliness of detections by average of to 30 days, with individual detection showing even higher improvements on a pixel level. The method was found to be robust across a variety of forest disturbance types. The largest reduction of omission errors and greatest improvement of timeliness was evident for sites with large unfragmented disturbance patches (e.g., large-scale clearings, fires and mining). For increasing GLCM kernel sizes, we observed a trade-off between reduced omission errors combined with improved timeliness and increasing commission errors. A kernel size of 5 was found to provide the best trade-off for reducing omission errors and improving timeliness while not introducing commission errors. The results emphasize that combining SAR-based textural features and backscatter can overcome omission errors caused by post-disturbance tree remnants or debris. This can help to improve the consistency and timelines of short (C-band) and long wavelength (L-band) based operational SAR disturbance monitoring and alerting.

TI  - The <i>"Creativity Crisis"</i> as a Mind in Crisis: A Cultural-Historical Activity Theory Position
T2  - INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Creativity is considered a global ability and crucial for ordinary-daily and special (e.g., science, aesthetic) activities. In this paper, from the position of Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), we expand the debate about the creativity crisis and hypothesize that the noted crisis is only the tip of the iceberg represented by the crisis of the postmodern' incoherent mind, reflecting the crisis of self-realization as a leading activity in the individualistic epoch. By investigating creativity as an original functionality of the mind, two key titles are stressed. One is the halting of the activity system; two, it is the inconsistency between the objective meanings sphere and the subjective sense-making sphere. Both titles represent the epistemological rupture embedded in the mainstream culture and praxis rooted in the internal contradictions of individualism and post-modernism as worldview and practices, leading the mind to close its eyes on the contradictions which are the crucial source of grasping the internal content (abstraction and generalization) of the given experience, hence, a crucial source of creativity. Thus, it is considered that not only creativity is in crisis, but also the coherence of the mind as well, as an extreme result of the shattered postmodern existence.

TI  - Modeling construction and demolition waste quantities in Tanta City, Egypt: a synergistic approach of remote sensing, geographic information system, and hybrid fuzzy neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A waste management strategy needs accurate data on the generation rates of construction and demolition waste (CDW). The objective of this study is to provide a robust methodology for predicting CDW generation in Tanta City, one of the largest and most civilized cities in Egypt, based on socioeconomic and waste generation statistics from 1965 to 2021. The main contribution of this research involves the fusion of remote sensing and geographic information systems to construct a geographical database, which is employed using machine learning for modeling and predicting the quantities of generated waste. The land use/land cover map is determined by integrating topographic maps and remotely sensed data to extract the built-up, vacant, and agricultural areas. The application of a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) based on an adaptive quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm and a hierarchical pruning scheme is introduced to predict the waste quantities. The performance of the proposed models is compared against that of the FNN with error backpropagation and the group method of data handling using five evaluation measures. The results of the proposed models are satisfactory, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), determination coefficient, Kling-Gupta efficiency, and index of agreement ranging between 0.70 and 1.56%, 0.01 and 0.03, 0.99 and 1.00, 0.99, and 1.00. Compared to other models, the proposed models reduce the MAPE and NRMSE by more than 92.90% and 90.64% based on fivefold cross-validation. The research findings are beneficial for utilizing limited data in developing effective strategies for quantifying waste generation. The simulation outcomes can be applied to monitor the urban metabolism, measure carbon emissions from the generated waste, develop waste management facilities, and build a circular economy in the study area.

AB  - BackgroundLentigo maligna melanoma is mainly localized in the head and neck region in elderly patients. Due to its slow horizontal growth, it has a good prognosis compared to other melanoma subtypes, but specific data are rare.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to investigate sentinel lymph node biopsy in lentigo maligna melanoma under local anaesthesia and to discuss the benefit.MethodsInvestigation of patients with lentigo maligna melanoma and tumour thickness & GE;1 mm treated at the Department of Dermatology, University Medical Centre Tuebingen, between January 2008 and October 2019.ResultsIn total, 204 patients (126 SLNB, 78 non-SLNB) with a median age of 75.7 years (SLNB: 73.3 years, non-SLNB: 79.7 years) could be included. Sixteen of 126 (12.7%) sentinel lymph nodes were positive. Five-year overall survival was 87.9% (88.5% SLNB; 87.4% non-SLNB) and 5-year distant metastasis-free survival was 85.8% (85.4% SLNB; 86.7% non-SLNB). There was no significant difference for distant metastasis-free survival (p = 0.861) and overall survival (p = 0.247) between patients with and without sentinel lymph node biopsy.ConclusionsSentinel lymph node biopsy in lentigo maligna melanoma under local anaesthesia is a safe and simple method, even in very old patients. However, LMM has a very good 5-year overall survival. In high-risk patients with high tumour thickness and/or ulceration, adjuvant immunotherapy can now be offered without the need to perform this procedure.

TI  - Revealing the ecological impact of low-speed mountain wind power on vegetation and soil erosion in South China: A case study of a typical wind farm in Yunnan
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limited local electricity consumption in northeastern, northwestern, and northern China, developers are committed to unlocking wind resource-rich areas in the mountainous regions of southern China, leading to the southward movement of wind power. Construction processes destroy vegetation (especially forests) and may cause subsequent ecological impacts. However, due to the scarcity of cloudless remote sensing images in southern China, the ecosystem impact of low-speed wind farm construction in southern China remains unclear, which is not conducive to decision-making. This study used the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model to fuse the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value obtained by Landsat 5 satellite Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat 8 satellite Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the NDVI value obtained by Moderateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Cloudless and high-resolution (30 m) fusion results were used to establish a system framework for evaluating and quantifying the impact of low-speed mountain wind farms on vegetation and soil erosion. The results showed that wind farm construction led to a significant decline in mountain vegetation growth. The impact ranges of wind farm roads were mainly within the 0-30 m buffer zone (the reduction range of NDVI was 0.04-0.22), and the impact ranges of wind turbine foundations were mainly within the 0-60 m buffer zone (the reduction range of NDVI was 0.00-0.26). In addition, the NDVI in regions damaged by mountain wind farm construction was more sensitive to climate change. After vegetation damage, the synergistic effect of factors such as rain and terrain may lead to the doubling of soil erosion (compared to 2010, the increase in soil erosion could reach 1195.96%). In the study area, roads should be scientifically planned to reduce their length, and vegetation restoration and environmental supervision should be strengthened.

T2  - URBAN WATER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Determination of total impervious area (TIA) or effective impervious area (EIA) is mandatory for hydrological modelling of water quantity and quality in urban areas. In this study, a multilayer deep learning model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented for estimating TIA. A more realistic automated method is suggested to determine EIA by integrating the remote sensing data, the digital format of the drainage network, and a digital elevation model (DEM). A graphical user interface (GUI) called EIA estimator is developed for automatic creation of EIA maps. An effort is made to derive a relationship between TIA and EIA. Several power relationships are obtained for easily measurable TIA and hydraulically relevant EIA in urban catchments of India. These relationships would aid planners and decision-makers with quick initial estimates for surface water quantity and quality problems.

TI  - Herman Bavinck and same-sex marriage: A current application of older theological concepts
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - It seems like an anachronism to turn to Herman Bavinck for a vision of homosexual relationships in the church. It is indeed an anachronism when we look at Bavinck's treatment of this phenomenon. Except for a reference to 'unnatural sin', he does not explicitly reflect on this theme. Yet, his theological concepts may offer possibilities for creating an openness to same-sex marriage in the church. This article examines four of Bavinck's concepts, namely the concepts of catholicity, hermeneutics, subjectivation and worldview. While the first three concepts suggest an openness, it is different with the fourth concept. This leads to the question of how to value it. Added to this, it is uncertain how Bavinck's later hermeneutical insights relate to his Christian worldview. In this article, these insights are weighed, and the conclusion is drawn that there is no evidence that the relativisation of historical and natural worldviews in the Bible also applies to Bavinck's moral biblical worldview. Therefore, it seems that Bavinck's concepts do not lead to openness for same-sex marriage in the church. If we make use of these concepts today, we must again account for the weight we assign to the various concepts, their interrelationship and the relative weight of each concept with respect to other concepts. Contribution: This research contributes both to the understanding of the tensions in Bavinck's theology, to the consciousness of Bavinck's hermeneutics, and to the reflection on same-sex relationships in the church.

TI  - Marine mucilage mapping with explained deep learning model using water-related spectral indices: a case study of Dardanelles Strait, Turkey
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rapid detection and periodic monitoring of mucilage formations are of valuable importance for early warning and mitigation strategies. Recent advances in remote sensing technology offer extraordinary advantages for identifying and monitoring fast-emerging and floating mucilage aggregates. To determine mucilage formations on the water surface, this study utilize a cloud-free Sentinel-2 image acquired on May 21, 2021, when mucilage aggregates were abundantly apparent in the Dardanelles Strait. To investigate the contribution of water-related indices in the delineation of mucilage-covered areas, the normalized difference turbidity index, Normalized difference water inde, and automated mucilage extraction index (AMEI) were employed in a pixel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model. According to the classification results, the determination of mucilage formations was achieved with about 98% and 95% in terms of overall accuracy, respectively. The results indicated that the AMEI index was the most effective water-related spectral index in distinguishing mucilage formations from clear water, producing the highest classification accuracy. The game theory-based SHapley Additive exPlanations for global explanation and integrated gradients for local explanation methods were also employed to analyze and interpret the intrinsic behavior of the employed CNN models and determine the most effective spectral features in trained models. The results revealed that while the AMEI index was the most influential one, all water indices were relatively more effective compared to the spectral bands. Overall, the findings of this study validate the effectiveness of CNN models for autonomously recognizing and monitoring mucilage formations in the marine environment.

TI  - Fault geometry and low frictional control of the near-field postseismic deformation of the 2021 Mw 7.3 Maduo earthquake
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2021 Maduo earthquake caused -160 km-long complex coseismic surface rupture and postseismic deformation. However, the afterslip pattern and primary reason for the overlapped coseismic slip and afterslip in shallow portion in Maduo earthquake are still unclear. Here, we used -0.85 yr Sentinel-1 data to obtain the timedependent postseismic deformation of the 2021 Mw 7.3 Maduo earthquake and inverted afterslip distribution. We calculated the frictional parameter of the seismogenic fault based on the time series afterslip and depicted the rupture surface based on three-dimensional coseismic displacement. Our findings indicated that the more considerable postseismic deformation in the near-field was concentrated on the bending region near the epicenter. The maximum afterslip was -0.35 m in the shallow upper crust. The shallow afterslip overlapped with the coseismic rupture, mainly caused by the low frictional parameter (a - b = 0.002) and shear heating in the shallow region. The fault geometry was gentle in the supershear rupture area, while changed substantially in the west of the epicenter. This highlights that the fault bending could have controlled both coseismic and postseismic deformation pattern in near-field. It also indicates that fault bending controls the stress propagation for large strike-slip fault, which provides a new perspective for seismic risk assessment of other strike-slip faults in the Bayan Har block.

TI  - Long-term trends in land erosion and accretion within the Meghna-Tetulia-Feni River Estuary (1973-2023)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive comprehension of the mechanisms governing land erosion and accretion is of utmost importance in the pursuit of sustainable management strategies for estuarine environments. The present study aims to examine the enduring patterns of land erosion and accretion in the Meghna-Tetulia-Feni River Estuary in Bangladesh over a span of five decades, from 1973 to 2023. The study utilizes a dataset comprising 24 Landsat images captured during six significant years (1973, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2023). The research employs both supervised and unsupervised classification techniques to demarcate the estuarine landscape into five distinct categories. These categories are subsequently reclassified into land and water classes for further analysis. The results suggest that there was a total land gain of 1406.91 km2 throughout the fifty-year period, with an average yearly increase of 28.14 km2. Significantly, the period spanning from 1980 to 1990 witnessed a notable increase in the net accretion rate, reaching a peak of 81.10 km2/year. Consequently, the total accretion during this period amounted to 1183.78 km2. In contrast, it is expected that the time span between 2010 and 2023 will experience a substantial decrease in land area, estimated to be roughly 705.73 km2. Given the significant geomorphological transformations and their wider economic and ecological consequences, this study proposes the implementation of an adaptable and flexible management approach that prioritizes the sustainable utilization of land and water resources in the Meghna-Tetulia-Feni River Estuary.

AB  - The use of remote sensing to map land cover and changes in land use has proven to be a practical, reliable, and accessible approach. These images provide precise details about the landscape, utilizing image processing techniques, modeling, and classification algorithms. This study aimed to identify different areas, such as coffee plantations, water bodies, urban areas, forests, exposed soil, and pastures in the Funil reservoir region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Image data from Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellites for June 2021 were used. Different supervised classification algorithms such as rf, rpart1SE, and svmLinear2 were applied based on a large volume of remote sensing data. The analyses and maps were performed using the software RStudio, considering a significance level of 5%. The highest accuracy and kappa index values were found for the rf algorithm, followed by svmLinear2 and rpart1SE. The results showed that the rf algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and kappa index values, followed by svmLinear2 and rpart1SE. However, during the validation phase, the svmLinear2 algorithm outperformed based on the statistical results of the confusion matrix. Therefore, it was considered the most suitable for generating the thematic mapping of the landscape. This is because svmLinear2 identified a more significant number of coffee areas and better-distinguished vegetation areas.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Huitongshan skarn-type deposits, in which ore bodies primarily occur in the outer contact zone between K-feldspar granite and marble in the Beishan area, are evidently related to hydrothermal alteration of the surrounding rock. Key mineral alteration processes include serpentinization, epidotization, chloritization, carbonatization, jarosite, ferritization, and hematitization.Methods: WorldView-3 (WV-3), a satellite-recorded high-spatial resolution multispectral image, has been widely used in the exploration and prediction of different types of deposits around the world. In this study, WV-3 multispectral images were used to extract the spatial distribution data of the main altered minerals in the Huitongshan area. Dedicated radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and image fusion were used to pre-process the extracted spectral information related to hydrothermal alteration. In addition, directed principal component analysis (PCA) and a unique mineral index were designed based on the effective use of the WV-3 data band corresponding to the spectral absorption characteristics of altered minerals.Results: The findings of this study show that the PCA model and mineral index pro-posed herein are reliable both in theory and for practically obtaining extraction information. Additionally, the WV-3 data are well suited for identifying hydroxy-bearing alterations with rich short-wave infrared bands that distinguish Fe-OH-bearing alterations from Mg-OH-bearing alterations. The results obtained were applied to identify potential targets for skarn-type copper deposits and the implementation of prospecting practices.Discussion: This study provides a basis for the application of WV-3 data as an important and effective tool for alteration information extraction and determination of prospecting practice, thereby proving the validity of multispectral remote sensing images in mineral resource exploration.

TI  - The heterogeneous geomorphological impact of an exceptional flood event and the role of floodplain vegetation
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Application of an integrated spatial approach combining several sources of remote sensing data to include both channel and floodplain morphological and sedimentological impacts has identified the geomorphological effects of three extreme flood events during a single flood season (2019-2020) along a 16-km reach of the River Teme, UK. This combined approach allowed the assessment of in-channel pattern development, incision and aggradation; lateral bank migration; and overbank sedimentation and scour by out-of-channel flows. Rates of change during the event period were compared with those in the previous 10 years. The approach also allowed the role of vegetation and cultivation, both bankside and out on floodplains, to be assessed with variations in the extent of riparian wood and channel slope driving contrasts in the extent of the response. The spatial impacts from such extreme events are highly localised, varied in kind, and can be considered for both rivers and floodplains together. Erosional effects were distinctively distributed and not simply contributions to ongoing meander development; channel aggradation was localised, and overbank sedimentation explicably patchy. In reaches without woody vegetation, differences in channel and floodplain slope, local floodplain relief as created by prior events, and the impact of man-made structures were factors that drove variations in flood response. This study strongly underlines the role of continuous riparian vegetation in maintaining bank stability and constraining lateral channel migration, but also to the potential influence of floodplain vegetation and planting for 'natural engineering' in the context of floodplains as well as channels in comparable environments. Maintenance of riparian vegetation in the context of landowner and Natural England conflict and management of future flood risk is important, but also highlighted is the need to consider the role of hedgerows and wider planting for constraining soil and riverbank erosion during flood events.An integrated remote sensing assessment of in-channel pattern development, incision and aggradation; lateral bank migration; and overbank sedimentation and scour by out-of-channel flows highlighted that that spatial impacts from such extreme events are highly localised, varied in kind. The approach determined the role of continuous riparian vegetation in maintaining bank stability but also to the potential influence of floodplain vegetation and planting for 'natural engineering' in the context of floodplains as well as channels.image

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) predominantly presents in the head and neck of the elderly. The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for LMM patients remains to be determined, as the reported average yield of positive lymph nodes is less than 10%. In this nationwide cohort study, we wanted to identify LMM patients with an increased risk of SLNB-positivity.METHODS: LMM with an SLNB indication according to the 8th AJCC melanoma guidelines were retrospectively identified from the nationwide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA). A penalized (LASSO) logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the optimal combination of clinicopathological factors to predict a positive SLNB.RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2020, 1989 LMM patients met our inclusion criteria. SLNB was performed in 16.7% (n=333) and was positive in 7.5% (25/333). The false-negative rate was 21.9%. Clinically detectable regional lymph node (LN) metastases were found in 1.3% (n=25). Clinicopathological characteristics best predictive for SLNB-positivity (Odds ratio; 95% CI) were age (0.95; 0.91-0.99), ulceration 1.59 (0.44-4.83), T4-stage (1.81; 0.43-6.2), male sex (1.97; 0.79-5.27), (lymph)angioinvasion (5.07; 0.94-23.31), and microsatellites (7.23; 1.56-32.7) (C-statistic 0.75). During follow-up, regional LN recurrences were detected in 4.2% (83/1989) of patients, of which the majority (74/83) had no evidence of regional LN metastases at baseline.CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the limited SLNB-positivity in LMM patients. Based on the identified high-risk clinicopathological features, a nomogram was developed to predict the risk of a positive SLNB.

TI  - National Institutes of Health Funding Gaps for Principal Investigators
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN

AB  - Importance Early-stage and established investigators compete for a limited supply of funds from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Regardless of their previous funding success, many principal investigators (PIs) encounter a funding gap in which they no longer receive ongoing funding from the NIH.Objective To determine incidence rates of PI-level funding gaps, the mean funding gap length, and whether these 2 metrics are associated with previous funding success.Design, Setting, and Participants This study was conducted using data from NIH RePORTER. Historical datafiles for fiscal year (FY) 2011 to FY 2021 were aggregated to generate 2 master datafiles for this period: all NIH awards and only R01 awards. PIs with no funding in FY 2011 or FY 2021 were removed. PIs were sorted by FY 2011 total funding amounts and grouped by quarter of amount.Results A total of 39 944 unique researchers were awarded 220 131 NIH awards, of which 103 753 were R01 awards. For all NIH awards, there was an overall linear increase from top quarter to bottom quarter in the percentage of PIs who had at least 1 year without funding (from 27% to 75%), percentage of these gap PIs who had at least 2 consecutive years without funding (from 56% to 68%), and mean maximum consecutive years without funding for gap PIs (2.2 years to 3.1 years). For only R01 awards, there was an overall linear increase from top quarter to bottom quarter in the percentage of PIs who had at least 1 year without funding (50% to 74%), percentage of gap PIs who had at least 2 consecutive years without funding (59% to 71%), and mean maximum consecutive years without funding for gap PIs (2.4 years to 3.1 years).Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of NIH-funded investigators, PIs with higher NIH funding were less likely to experience a funding gap. Additionally, when these PIs encountered a funding gap, this period without funding was shorter; however, among all PIs, funding gaps typically lasted 2 to 3 years. These associations were found inclusive of all NIH awards and when analysis was limited to only R01 awards. These findings may be useful to PIs and academic institutions as they prepare, structure, and project research resource allocations.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of glacier retreat and its relationship with local climate in Cordillera Apolobamba, Peru
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Glaciers play a pivotal role as essential water sources, and monitoring their dynamics is crucial for understanding the profound impacts of climate change. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the temporal dynamics of glacier retreat and its relationship with the local climate in Cordillera Apolobamba, Peru, spanning 1986 to 2015. Using Landsat satellite imagery and the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), we quantify changes in glacial cover at five-year intervals, starting in 1986. Additionally, we explore the climate drivers associated with these changes by analyzing local climatic data. The results reveal a remarkable and concerning trend in the temporal evolution of glacial areas in the CA. By 2015, the extent of glacial retreat had reached approximately 51.84% of the surface area estimated in 1986, with an average annual loss rate of 0.79 km(2)/year. This retreat corresponds to a substantial reduction in glacial volume over the study period. This study unveils direct and inverse relationships between precipitation, temperature, and the glacier retreat rate. This discerns that temperature predominantly drives the loss of glacier area, while the glacier retreat rate is conditioned by precipitation. The results provide crucial data for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers striving to understand the intricate interplay between climate variables and glacial dynamics and their broader implications for water resource management in high-altitude regions.

TI  - What can methods for assessing worldviews and broad values tell us about socio-environmental conflicts?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-environmental conflicts are manifestations of disputes regarding nature or disagreements over the distribution of costs and benefits resulting from nature's transformation induced by human activities. These conflicts often result from divergent worldviews and broad values, which shape the way people interact with and value nature in a profound way. Interestingly, even though they are well-known in their fields, methods for assessing worldviews and broad values are not used as often when addressing sustainability challenges as they should be. By exploring the literature on worldviews and broad value assessment, this review identifies four alternative methods - consensus analysis, ethical analysis, framing analysis, and worldview assessment - that can facilitate dialog in socio-environmental conflict settings. It highlights the usefulness and potential of these methods as a value-centered leverage for transformative change.

TI  - The statistical OPEA models indicate an anomaly in the solar X-ray flare energy levels
T2  - ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have recognized an anomaly on the solar activity cycle, while we researching on the question that there can be two different flare mechanisms working on the stellar surface. We discuss an anomaly in the solar flare activity levels in the cycle minima and maxima from the 20th to 22nd Solar Activity Cycles, depending on the models and analyses of the X-ray data. In this study, we used the GOES satellite data accumulated from 1976 to 1989 and detected 670 solar flares. We have separately carried out two independent statistical analyses for the examination of the solar flare activity. Firstly, we derived the equivalent durations distribution via the total durations of flares. Contrary to our expectations based on flare stars, it seems that this distribution is modelled by four different fits, instead of just one model fit. We found that the model parameters, such as plateau, half - time, and span, vary via time in the different trends from the Solar Activity Cycle. Secondly, we have derived the cumulative frequency models for solar flares. Contrary to the studies in the literature, we found that these frequency models do not take shape depending on the minimum or maximum of a solar activity cycle. If these results are not an unexpected anomaly, this study indicates that the existence of a different trend can be revealed apart from the solar activity cycle for the flare energy level variation, when the solar flare behaviour is separately determined for each cycle and they are compared with each other.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of spatial and temporal resolutions for digital change detection: case of forest fire
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - One of the most important subjects in remote sensing is digital change detection which identifies the differences between the before and after an event in spatial context. Even though lots of new satellite images have been launched to use with improvement of their resolutions, there needs to utilize at least two satellite images one of which must be acquired before the event happened. It is rather difficult to always find out proper spatial resolutions for change detection. The aim of this study is to evaluate and investigate the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on change detection. In this respect, the forest fire case was chosen as an event with five different satellite images (i.e. IKONOS, WorldView-2, ASTER, Landsat7 and Landsat8) having different acquisition time which is almost 10-year range. In this study, different spatial resolutions vs temporal resolutions were examined on different change detection algorithms which are image differencing, image rationing, NDVI differences, principle component analyses and minimum noise fractions (MNF). These data sets were tested on Adrasan area (Antalya, Turkiye) for change detection of forest fire. The obtained results has been shown that change detection using proposed MNF method for Landsat data sets have the highest accuracy with the value of 95.65%. Then the other high accuracy was obtained as 92.89% in MNF method for ASTER data sets. In addition, the other method (i.e. image ratio) is another high accuracy as 92.82% obtained for IKONOS and WorldViev-2 images. Finally, the relation between temporal resolution and spatial resolution has been generated as a graphical representation with spatial kernel size/filtering.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing is an effective tool used in a variety of earth science applications including extracting geological details at unmapped terrain. In this research, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is applied to geological classification of a Zgounder silver deposit (Anti-Atlas, Morocco) using a combination of data acquired by Sentinel-2 and a digital elevation model (DEM). The aim of this study is to identify potential zones of mineralization on the basis of automatic geology mapping using the SVM classification. Image enhancement and processing techniques have been used to improve geological and lithological discrimination. Also, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce data redundancy by choosing bands that retain more than 90% of the original information. The results showed an overall classification accuracy of > 97%, with a kappa index > 0.96. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the classification approach produced an image containing lithological units, allowing easy identification of potential mineralization zones. The study shows that the approach presented can help construct a first-pass geological map for areas where information on the lithology is unavailable. It saves time and resources compared to geological mapping in the field.

TI  - Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network Model for Image Classification.
T2  - IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Image classification plays an important role in remote sensing. Earth observation (EO) has inevitably arrived in the big data era, but the high requirement on computation power has already become a bottleneck for analyzing large amounts of remote sensing data with sophisticated machine learning models. Exploiting quantum computing might contribute to a solution to tackle this challenge by leveraging quantum properties. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QC-CNN) that applies quantum computing to effectively extract high-level critical features from EO data for classification purposes. Besides that, the adoption of the amplitude encoding technique reduces the required quantum bit resources. The complexity analysis indicates that the proposed model can accelerate the convolutional operation in comparison with its classical counterpart. The model's performance is evaluated with different EO benchmarks, including Overhead-MNIST, So2Sat LCZ42, PatternNet, RSI-CB256, and NaSC-TG2, through the TensorFlow Quantum platform, and it can achieve better performance than its classical counterpart and have higher generalizability, which verifies the validity of the QC-CNN model on EO data classification tasks.

TI  - Diurnal source apportionment of organic and inorganic atmospheric particulate matter at a high-altitude mountain site under summer conditions (Sierra Nevada; Spain).
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - High-altitude mountain areas are sentinel ecosystems for global environmental changes such as anthropogenic pollution. In this study, we report a source apportionment of particulate material with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10mum (PM10) in a high-altitude site in southern Europe (Sierra Nevada Station; SNS (2500m a.s.l.)) during summer 2021. The emission sources and atmospheric secondary processes that determine the composition of aerosol particles in Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain) are identified from the concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), 12 major inorganic compounds, 18 trace elements and 44 organic molecular tracer compounds in PM10 filter samples collected during day- and nighttime. The multivariate analysis of the joint dataset resolved five main PM10 sources: 1) Saharan dust, 2) advection from the urbanized valley, 3) local combustion, 4) smoke from a fire-event, and 5) aerosol from regional recirculation with high contribution of particles from secondary inorganic and organic aerosol formation processes. PM sources were clearly associated with synoptic meteorological conditions, and day- and nighttime circulation patterns typical of mountainous areas. Although a local pollution source was identified, the contribution of this source to PM10, OC and EC was small. Our results evidence the strong influence of middle- and long-range transport of aerosols, mainly from anthropogenic origin, on the aerosol chemical composition at this remote site.

TI  - Cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter heart interventions.
T2  - EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology
M3  - Review
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Stroke remains a devastating complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with the incidence of clinically apparent stroke seemingly fixed at around 3% despite TAVR's significant evolution during the past decade. Embolic showers of debris (calcium, atheroma, valve material, foreign material) are captured in the majority of patients who have TAVR using a filter-based cerebral embolic protection device (CEPD). Additionally, in systematic brain imaging studies, the majority of patients receiving TAVR exhibit new cerebral lesions. Mechanistic studies have shown reductions in the volume of new cerebral lesions using CEPDs, yet the first randomised trial powered for periprocedural stroke within 72 hours of a transfemoral TAVR failed to meet its primary endpoint of showing superiority of the SENTINEL CEPD. The present review summarises the clinicopathological rationale for the development of CEPDs, the evidence behind these devices to date and the emerging recognition of cerebral embolisation in many non-TAVR transcatheter procedures. Given the uniqueness of each of the various CEPDs under development, specific trials tailored to their designs will need to be undertaken to broaden the CEPD field, in addition to evaluating the role of CEPD in non-TAVR transcatheter heart interventions. Importantly, the cost-effectiveness of these devices will require assessment to broaden the adoption of CEPDs globally.

TI  - Genetic parameters and genome-wide association studies for mozzarella and milk production traits, lactation length, and lactation persistency in Murrah buffaloes.
T2  - Journal of dairy science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Genetic and genomic analyses of longitudinal traits related to milk production efficiency are paramount for optimizing water buffaloes breeding schemes. Therefore, this study aimed to: 1) compare single-trait random regression models under a Single-step Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (ssGBLUP) setting based on alternative covariance functions (i.e., Wood - WD, Wilmink - WL, and Ali-and-Schaeffer - AS) to describe milk (MY), fat (FY), protein (PY), and mozzarella (MZY) yields, fat-to-protein ratio (FPR), somatic cell score (SCS), lactation length (LL), and lactation persistency (LP) in Murrah dairy buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis); 2) combine the best functions for each trait under a multiple-trait framework; 3) estimate time-dependent SNP effects for all the studied longitudinal traits; and, 5) identify the most likely candidate genes associated with the traits. A total of 323,140 test-day records from the first lactation of 4,588 Murrah buffaloes were made available for the study. The model included the average curve of the population nested within herd-year-season of calving, systematic effects of number of milkings per day, and age at first calving as linear and quadratic covariates, and additive genetic, permanent environment, and residual as random effects. The WD model had the best goodness of fit based on the deviance information criterion and posterior model probabilities for all traits. Moderate heritabilities were estimated over time for most traits (0.30 ± 0.02 for MY; 0.26 ± 0.03 for FY; 0.45 ± 0.04 for PY; 0.28 ± 0.05 for MZY; 0.13 ± 0.02 for FPR; and 0.15 ± 0.03 for SCS). The heritability estimates for LP ranged from 0.38 ± 0.02 to 0.65 ± 0.03 depending on the trait definition used. Similarly, heritabilities estimated for LL ranged from 0.10 ± 0.01 to 0.14 ± 0.03. The genetic correlation estimates across DIM for all traits ranged from -0.06 (186 to 215 DIM for MY-SCS) to 0.78 (66 to 95 DIM for PY-MZY). The SNP effects calculated for the random regression model coefficients were used to estimate the SNP effects throughout the lactation curve (from 5 to 305 d). Numerous relevant genomic regions and candidate genes were identified for all traits, confirming their polygenic nature. The candidate genes identified contribute to a better understanding of the genetic background of milk-related traits in Murrah buffaloes and reinforce the value of incorporating genomic information in their breeding programs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Snowmelt floods are highly hazardous meteorological disasters that can potentially threaten human lives and property. Hence, snowmelt susceptibility mapping (SSM) plays an important role in flood prevention systems and aids emergency responders and flood risk managers. In this paper, a method of identifying snowmelt flood hazards is proposed, and a large-scale snowmelt flood hazard zonation scheme based on historical recordings and multisource remote sensing data is established. To assess the quality of our approach, the proposed model was tested in the cold and arid region of Xinjiang, China. Overall, 140 historical snowmelt flood events and 27 explanatory factors were selected to construct a geospatial dataset for SSM of the contemporary period. GridSearchCV was used to comprehensively search the candidate parameters from the grid of given parameters obtained with the random forest (RF) algorithm. Then, the geospatial dataset was divided into two subsets: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Next, SSM results were obtained with the RF algorithm using optimized parameters. The results indicate that our optimized RF classifier performs well for the task of SSM, with a high AUC value (0.975) for the test dataset. The validation and analysis suggest that the proposed method can efficiently identify snowmelt flood hazards in undersampled arid areas at a regional scale.

TI  - Protected yet unmanaged: insights into the ecological status of conservation priority stony reefs in Belgian waters based on the integrative use of remote sensing technologies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stony reefs are ecologically important, providing irreplaceable ecosystem services. These fragile environments are recognised as conservation priorities by all relevant global and European policies. Bottom-contacting fisheries are an important source of anthropogenic disturbance to the seafloor's physical and ecological integrity having immediate and destructive consequences on stony reefs and compromising ecological functions. This study, aimed to assess the ecological status (community composition and functions) of two stony reef areas -Northwest and Hinder Banks study sites -in Belgian waters using multiple remote sensing tools. Insights on the study sites' geomorphological context and fishing patterns were gained using echo-sounding and publicly available satellite data. Video-based benthic community data were assessed against the exposure to fishing pressure using a trait-based approach linked to the biotas' resistance and recovery potential. In the Northwest study site, between 2019 and 2022 there was a significant decline in the abundance of benthic species classified with low resistance and recovery potential to trawling. Conversely, there was a notable increase in species with moderate scores. During the same period, this site experienced an eight-fold increase in fishing effort and the hydroacoustic data revealed the presence of several trawl-marks in 2022. Similar changes in benthic communities were observed in the Hinder Banks too. Here, the abundance of species with low resistance and recovery potential was significantly lower in locations that were geomorphologically exposed to trawling compared to sheltered ones. Exposed locations had a higher abundance of opportunistic species, with moderate to high scores. The presence of several trawl marks on the seafloor was observed in the exposed locations, corresponding to fishing hotspots identified in the satellite data. Trawling activities marginally impacted richness and total abundance, but negatively altered benthic functional composition. The findings of this study provide scientific evidence of the detrimental impact of bottom-contacting fisheries on conservation priority biotopes and argues against the coexistence of such activities with Marine Protected Areas. The results of our investigation are of interest to environmental managers for the adequate implementation of environmental legislation in the face of rapid and widespread anthropogenic changes.

T2  - Journal of imaging
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The accuracy assessment of three different Normalized Difference Water indices (NDWIs) was performed in La Salada, a typical lake in the Pampean region. Data were gathered during April 2019, a period in which floods occurred in a large area in the Southwest of the Buenos Aires Province (Argentina). The accuracy of the estimations using spaceborne medium-resolution multi-spectral imaging and the reliability of three NDWIs to highlight shallow water features in satellite images were evaluated using a high-resolution airbone imagery as ground truth. We show that these indices computed using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery are only loosely correlated to the actual flooded area in shallow waters. Indeed, NDWI values vary significantly depending on the satellite mission used and the type of index computed.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundPatients with cT1-2 colon cancer (CC) have a 10-20% risk of lymph node metastases. Sentinel lymph node identification (SLNi) could improve staging and reduce morbidity in future organ-preserving CC surgery. This pilot study aimed to assess safety and feasibility of robot-assisted fluorescence-guided SLNi using submucosally injected indocyanine green (ICG) in patients with cT1-2N0M0 CC.MethodsTen consecutive patients with cT1-2N0M0 CC were included in this prospective feasibility study. Intraoperative submucosal, peritumoral injection of ICG was performed during a colonoscopy. Subsequently, the near-infrared fluorescence 'Firefly' mode of the da Vinci Xi robotic surgical system was used for SLNi. SLNs were marked with a suture, after which a segmental colectomy was performed. The SLN was postoperatively ultrastaged using serial slicing and immunohistochemistry, in addition to the standard pathological examination of the specimen. Colonoscopy time, detection time (time from ICG injection to first SLNi), and total SLNi time were measured (time from the start of colonoscopy to start of segmental resection). Intraoperative, postoperative, and pathological outcomes were registered.ResultsIn all patients, at least one SLN was identified (mean 2.3 SLNs, SLN diameter range 1-13 mm). No tracer-related adverse events were noted. Median colonoscopy time was 12 min, detection time was 6 min, and total SLNi time was 30.5 min. Two patients had lymph node metastases present in the SLN, and there were no patients with false negative SLNs. No patient was upstaged due to ultrastaging of the SLN after an initial negative standard pathological examination. Half of the patients unexpectedly had pT3 tumours.ConclusionsRobot-assisted fluorescence-guided SLNi using submucosally injected ICG in ten patients with cT1-2N0M0 CC was safe and feasible. SLNi was performed in an acceptable timespan and SLNs down to 1 mm were detected. All lymph node metastases would have been detected if SLN biopsy had been performed.

TI  - Linkage between growth phenology and climate-growth responses along landscape gradients in boreal forests.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Boreal forests represent an important carbon sink and, therefore, significantly contribute to climate change mitigation. Tree-ring width series of boreal species reflect climate variation at the moment of tree-ring formation but also lagged climatic effects from dormancy preceding tree-ring formation and antecedent growing seasons. However, little is known about how the growth sensitivity to climate in specific intra-annual periods varies across the landscape. Here, we assessed growth responses to climate variation during the 45months preceding the tree-ring formation for nine boreal stands of Picea glauca and Picea mariana distributed along the gradients of elevation and slope aspect. We combined process-based modeling of wood formation and remote sensing data to determine growth phenology at each site. Next, we classified intra-annual seasons with significant climate-growth correlations based on the timing of dormancy and growth periods. Both the phenology and the climate-growth relationships systematically shifted with elevation and, to a lower extent, also with slope orientation at the treeline. The mean duration of the growing season varied between 100days at treelines above 900m and 160days at lowlands below 500m. The growth at treelines was stimulated by temperature in the summer of the tree-ring formation year and two years before tree-ring formation. The period of significant climate-growth correlations during the current summer did not exceed three months in agreement with the local duration of the growing season. The growth of trees in lower elevations was instead stimulated by high temperature during the dormancy periods but restricted by high temperature in antecedent summer seasons. In conclusion, our study highlights the linkage between the timing of climate-growth sensitivity and growth phenology, primarily determined by proximity to the treeline. Consequently, accounting for landscape gradients in growth phenology is crucial for upscaling the climatic limits of boreal stands' growth as climate change progresses.

TI  - Reconstruction of daily chlorophyll-a concentrations in the transit of severe tropical cyclone Hudhud using the ExDINEOF method
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical regions experience a diverse range of dense clouds, posing challenges for the daily reconstruction of chlorophyll-a concentration data. This underscores the pressing need for a practical method to reconstruct daily-scale chlorophyll-a concentrations in such regions. While traditional data reconstruction methods focus on single variables and rely on specific factors to infer missing data at specific locations, these single-variable methods may falter when applied to tropical oceans due to the scarcity of available data. Fortunately, all oceanographic variables undergo similar atmospheric and marine dynamic processes, creating internal relationships between them. This allows for the reconstruction of missing data through correlations between variables. Thus, this study introduces a multivariate reconstruction approach using the extended data interpolating empirical orthogonal function (ExDINEOF) method to reconstruct missing daily-scale chlorophyll-a concentration data. The ExDINEOF method considers the simultaneous relationships among multiple variables for data reconstruction in tropical oceans. To verify the method's robustness, missing data were reconstructed during the formation and passage of severe tropical cyclone Hudhud through the Bay of Bengal. The results demonstrate that ExDINEOF outperforms traditional data reconstruction methods, exhibiting favorable spatial distribution and enhanced accuracy within the dynamic tropical marine environment. Furthermore, an assessment of marine physical environmental factors associated with chlorophyll-a concentration data provides additional evidence for the ExDINEOF method's accuracy. Notably, the ExDINEOF method offers comprehensive spatial distribution aligned with underlying physical mechanisms governing phytoplankton distribution patterns, detailed phytoplankton growth, bloom, extinction variations in time series, satisfactory accuracy, and comprehensive local-level details.

TI  - Novel model based on ultrasound predict axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWhether there is axillary lymph node metastasis is crucial for formulating the treatment plan for breast cancer. Currently, invasive methods are still used for preoperative evaluation of lymph nodes. If non-invasive preoperative evaluation can be achieved, it will effectively improve the treatment plan.ObjectiveConstructed a predict model based on ultrasound examination, which forest axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, and validated this model.MethodPatients admitted to Xiamen First Hospital from April 2018 to August 2021 with complete case data were included in this study. Patients who had undergone breast cancer resection and axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy were divided into a training and validation cohort in a 7:3 ratio. In the training cohort, patients were divided into metastatic and non-metastatic groups based on whether axillary lymph nodes had metastasis. The parameters of the two groups were compared, and statistically significant parameters were included in multivariate analysis. Then, a Nomogram model was constructed, named Lymph metastasis predict model (LMPM). Calibration curves, receiver operating curve (ROC), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were plotted between the training and validation cohort, calculate the risk score of each patient, identify the optimal cutoff value, and test the predictive efficacy of LMPM.ResultTwo hundred seventy-three patients were enrolled in final study, the average age 49.7 & PLUSMN; 8.7, training cohort included 191 patients, the diameter of breast cancer, the lymph node peak systolic flow velocity (LNPS) and the cortex area hilum ratio (CH) of lymph node were exist significant difference in metastatic and non-metastatic group. Multivariate analysis showed cancer diameter, LNPS and CH included in LMPM, the cutoff value was 95, the calibration curve, ROC, DCA in training and validation cohort show satisfactory result.ConclusionThe predict model-LMPM, can predict axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which is useful for developing personalized treatment plans. However, further validation of the model is required by incorporating a larger number of patients.

TI  - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY AND MORTALITY FOLLOWING ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
T2  - The Canadian journal of cardiology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which residential mobility is associated with declining health among disease-specific populations, such as survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), remains unknown.METHODS: This prospective cohort study consisted of 3,377 patients followed from index AMI (Dec 1, 1999-March 30, 2003) until death or until the last available follow-up date (March 30, 2020) in Ontario, Canada. Each residential postal code move from a patient's sentinel AMI event was tracked. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards examined the associated impact of each residential postal code move on mortality after adjusting for age, sex, baseline socioeconomic, psychosocial factors, changes in neighbourhood income level from each residential move, pre-existing cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular illnesses, and rural residence. All models evaluated death and long-term care institutionalization as competing risks to distinguish mortality from other end-of-life destination outcomes among community-dwelling populations.RESULTS: The study sample included 3,369 patients with 1,828 (54.3%) having at least one residential move throughout the study. 86.5% of patients either died in the community or transitioned from a community dwelling into a long-term care facility as an end-of-life destination. When adjusted for baseline factors and changing neighbourhood socioeconomic status over time, each residential move was associated with a 12% higher rate of death (Adjusted HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.05-1.19, p<.001) and a 26% higher rate of long-term care end-of-life institutionalization (Adjusted HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.14-1.58, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Residential mobility was associated with higher mortality following AMI. Further research is needed to better evaluate intermediary causal pathways that may explain why residential mobility is associated with end-of-life outcomes.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma is a rare adnexal tumor that arises from apocrine progenitor cells. These tumors may be associated with benign apocrine hyperplasia, and a longstanding history of a lesion should not preclude a malignant diagnosis. We report a case of a 70-year-old female who presented to the clinic with a 3-year history of an asymptomatic vulvar lesion. An excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a tumor with two distinct components. The first component was determined to be a benign tubular apocrine adenoma. The second component, arising within the apocrine adenoma, was determined to be an apocrine carcinoma based on histopathologic features and immunohistochemical profile. Twelve months after subsequent wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy, the patient is alive without recurrence.

TI  - Hot deformation behavior and flow stress modeling of coarse-grain nickel-base GH4151 superalloy ingot materials in cogging
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the high deformation resistance and poor thermal ductility of the new cast GH4151 alloy ingots, cracks are easy to occur during cogging process. For clarifying the effects of deformation parameters on microstructural evolution and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) nucleation mechanisms. In this work, the causes of crack formation and extension were first investigated using SEM and EBSD. The study revealed that the reasons for crack formation and propagation are the MC carbides at the original grain boundaries, large-size y' phase, residual eutectic phases, and tiny pores near the grain boundaries. Subsequently, a series of hot compression tests were performed using a Thermecamastor-Z thermo-mechanical simulator at temperatures ranging from 1080(degrees)C to 1160(degrees)C and a strain rate range of 0.01 -10 s(-1). The constitutive equation of the Arrhenius model and the hot working map was established, determining activation energy(Q) of 1086.58 kJ center dot mol(-1). Large-size y' is coherent with the matrix. For the y-Fy' dual-phase region, heterogeneous strain-induced dynamic recrystallization (HDRX) occurs, and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) is the main nucleation mechanism for DRX. However, for y single-phase region, DDRX plays a more significant role. Furthermore, the MC phase (>1 mu m) has different crystal orientations with the y matrix and acts as sites for recrystallization through particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN). Finally, a fine and uniform grain structure can be obtained in the temperature range of 1120-1135(degrees)C and the strain rate range of 0.1 s(-1) to 1 s(-1).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Satellite image analysis of thermal comfort for a sustainable urban ecology of Winneba, Ghana
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate thermal heat effects for a sustainable urban living environment through planning and interventions, studies on land surface temperature (LST) in urban settings are crucial. Thus, the relationship between LST and surface landscape must be established to accurately assess the impacts of surface temperature changes for planning purposes. This will help gain knowledge about the spatial concentration of the heat effects and to design practical needs of urban planning. The study aimed to analyse and reveal the spatial dynamics of LST and its statistical relationship with two normalised satellite indices using Landsat satellite data. The Landsat-derived LST is validated using the MODIS surface temperature data. It also mapped the heat spots (HS) and evaluated the ecological evaluation index and thermal comfort using the thermal field variance index (TFVI). The results showed spatial variation in LST even within the built-up areas due to heterogeneity in the surface characteristics. Thus, localised heat islands (HIs) exist within short distances. The analysis established an inverse correlation for LST-NDVI and a direct correlation for LST-NDBI. The vegetation and water surfaces served as important heat reduction sinks while heavily built-up areas and the hardened-clayey bare surfaces served as heat-enhancing sources. More than half (52.80%) of the study area enjoys an excellent (48.57%) and good (4.23%) ecological evaluation index, indicating excellent to good thermal comfort. Much of these areas are in the urban periphery. Also, more than one-third (38.96%) enjoy the worst (34.85%) and worse (4.11%) ecological evaluation index and thus high thermal discomfort. Identifying these HS areas and evaluating the thermal comfort will help the planners and decision-makers to fully evaluate the thermal consequences of different landuse or land development scenarios and therefore improve the scientific basis of future planning and regulations.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Mono-Window Algorithm were used to generate LULC and estimate LST. Results reveal an increase in built-up areas, rising LST, and variable UHI thresholds. The study highlights the impact of COVID-19 on LST in 2020. Positive correlations between LST and Normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) and negative correlations with Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were observed. Projections for 2030 suggest an increase in high-temperature areas.

TI  - An improved volume power approach to estimate LAI from optimized dual-polarized SAR decomposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has proven to be a valuable tool for monitoring the Earth's surface, particularly vegetation. However, many studies using SAR have focused solely on backscattering sensitivity without considering the structural and physical properties of the vegetation being analysed. This study proposes a new approach for vegetation monitoring using the Volume Power (VP) analysis technique. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy of VP derived from the Freeman Durden (FD) decomposition technique for dual polarimetric SAR data. To increase the sensitivity of vegetation scattering in SAR analysis, this study modified the VP using Depolarized Volume Power (DVP) and Anisotropic Volume Power (AVP). The first modification, DVP, was achieved by incorporating the degree of polarization (m) in the analysis. The second modification, AVP, is achieved by considering the anisotropic scattering properties of vegetation. The modified VP is then used to estimate Leaf Area Index (LAI) using an empirical relationship between LAI and the modified VPs. The accuracy of the LAI estimation is evaluated using ground truth measurements. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provides more accurate LAI estimates than traditional methods. The approach also shows improved sensitivity to vegetation scattering compared to the original VP from the FD, indicating the effectiveness of the degree of polarization and anisotropic scattering in reducing the impact of unwanted scattering mechanisms from the surface. The accuracy (R-2) between in-situ LAI and the LAI retrieved from AVP and DVP was 0.85 and 0.82, whereas for FDVP, it was 0.74. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach for improving the accuracy of VP estimation in dualpolarimetric SAR data and enabling more accurate and efficient estimation of LAI.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection Using the Random Forest Approach: The Case of The Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - GLOBAL CHALLENGES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land use change dynamics is critical for tackling food security, climate change, and biodiversity loss on a global scale. This study is designed to classify land use and land cover in the upper Blue Nile River Basin (BNRB) using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The Landsat images for Landsat 45, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 are used for classification purposes. The study area is classified into seven land use/land cover classes: cultivated lands, bare lands, built-ups, forests, grazing lands, shrublands, and waterbodies. The accuracy of classified images is 83%, 85%, and 91% using the Kappa index of agreements. From 1983 to 2022 periods, cultivated lands and built-up areas increased by 47541 and 1777 km2, respectively, at the expense of grazing lands, shrublands, and forests. Furthermore, the area of water bodies has increased by 662 km2 due to the construction of small and large-scale irrigation and hydroelectric power generation dams. The main factors that determine agricultural land expansion are related to population growth. Therefore, land use and land cover change detection using a random forest is an important technique for multispectral satellite data classification to understand the optimal use of natural resources, conservation practices, and decision-making for sustainable development.Random Forest-based land use/cover classification is an effective way to classify satellite data. Cultivated land and built-up areas significantly increased at the expense of forests, grasslands, and shrublands from 1983 to 2022 in the Blue Nile Basin. Water bodies also increased due to the construction of small and large dams for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation.image

TI  - Enhancing suspended sediment concentration retrieval by integrating thermal infrared and optical bands of Landsat-8 and machine learning algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) variabilities sizably affect the bio-optical conditions in water bodies. Remote sensing plays a key role in spatiotemporal monitoring of the SSC in inland and coastal waters. However, existing studies on remote sensing of SSC focus on optical domains, i.e. visible and near-infrared bands. Here, we assume thermal infrared bands can potentially contribute to retrieving SSC, inspired by sediments' heat-trapping effect demonstrated in aquatic research. Thus, we propose to incorporate the thermal infrared bands of Landsat-8 along with the optical bands for the estimation of SSC using machine learning models. In this study, 85 Landsat-8 images collected from the Google Earth Engine (GEE), coupled with in-situ observations from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations, were employed to estimate SSC variabilities in Missouri-Mississippi Rivers. The relationship between in-situ SSC and water temperature revealed a promising correlation (R = 0.7), motivating our assumption of incorporating thermal infrared bands. Therefore, we employed both optical and thermal infrared bands of Landsat-8 imagery as predictors for the first time to estimate SSC. Three machine learning algorithms of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were considered. The results demonstrated that incorporating thermal infrared bands improved the performance of the models (average improvements in R-2 for similar to 9.6% and in RMSE for similar to 18.9%) with respect to the use of optical bands only.

TI  - Coastal landscape degradation and disappearance of Davislaguna Lake, Sorkappland, Svalbard, 1900-2021
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes the transformation of the coastal landscape near former Davislaguna Lake, SE Spitsbergen. It is a comparative study which outlines the changing state of the area based on old maps, other archival materials, remote sensing data from the years 1900 to 2021, and our own fieldwork performed since 2005. The indirect cause of this transformation is identified herein as climate warming which has produced a progressive degradation of the cryosphere and triggered three key forces behind the said transformation: glacial recession in the 20th century, shortening of the sea-ice season, permafrost thawing in the 21st century. From the year 1900 to the 1920s the coastal landscape of the study area consisted of a bay with beaches between a mountain range in the west and a tidewater glacier tongue protruding into the sea in the northeast. The tongue subsequently melted and the bay became transformed into a coastal plain, with the resulting lake becoming separated from the sea by a gravel-sand bar by 1936. Afterwards, both the plain and lake dwindled in size due to the decline of the bar found to the west. This process continued until the lake became divided into two parts in the 1980s; one of these then disappeared between 2006 and 2010, and the second one by 2021. Hence, the land in question, with the coastal plain partly glaciated and surrounding the bay, then unglaciated and surrounding the lake, became over time replaced by the sea. Today, the process of abrasion acting near the sea is destroying the remaining beaches and cutting down the steep slopes of area mountains and ice-cored moraines.

AB  - IntroductionAs applied to early Breast Cancer (BC) patients, Sentinel-node Biopsy (SNB) has undergone major changes over the years, especially concerning the widening of indication criteria or skipping systematic axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after a positive SN. We aimed to ascertain whether a strict versus a more liberal use of SNB resulted in different clinical outcomes in our clinical experience. MethodsWe studied consecutive BC patients undergoing SNB between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2020. There were 1,587 patients and 1,634 SNB procedures. Cases were divided into two study groups: the "strict" SNB group (unifocal tumors up to 35 mm in whom ALND was always performed for a positive SN, amounting to 1183 SNBs), and the "liberal" SNB group (extended tumor size up to selected T3 cases, as well as multifocal or bilateral disease, and patients with previous contralateral BC, not always followed by ALND after a positive SN, amounting to 451 SNBs). Patients were closely followed-up to the end of the study.ResultsClinico-pathological variables were strikingly different between study groups, with the liberal group showing a higher risk profile. Cox regression analysis for disease recurrence did not show significant differences in axillary, lymph-node, or locoregional recurrence rates or distant relapse. Neither were differences in survival between groups.ConclusionIt seems reasonable to adopt the liberal SNB approach, as the goal of surgical management in early BC patients must be attaining optimal locoregional disease control, no matter the differences in distant metastatic spread rates across different BC risk profiles

TI  - Elucidating Hidden and Enduring Weaknesses in Dust Emission Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale classical dust cycle models, developed more than two decades ago, assume for simplicity that the Earth's land surface is devoid of vegetation, reduce dust emission estimates using a vegetation cover complement, and calibrate estimates to observed atmospheric dust optical depth (DOD). Consequently, these models are expected to be valid for use with dust-climate projections in Earth System Models. We reveal little spatial relation between DOD frequency and satellite observed dust emission from point sources (DPS) and a difference of up to 2 orders of magnitude. We compared DPS data to an exemplar traditional dust emission model (TEM) and the albedo-based dust emission model (AEM) which represents aerodynamic roughness over space and time. Both models overestimated dust emission probability but showed strong spatial relations to DPS, suitable for calibration. Relative to the AEM calibrated to the DPS, the TEM overestimated large dust emission over vast vegetated areas and produced considerable false change in dust emission. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that calibrating dust cycle models to DOD has hidden for more than two decades, these TEM modeling weaknesses. The AEM overcomes these weaknesses without using masks or vegetation cover data. Considerable potential therefore exists for ESMs driven by prognostic albedo, to reveal new insights of aerosol effects on, and responses to, contemporary and environmental change projections.

TI  - Glaciological and meteorological investigations of an Alpine debris-covered glacier: the case study of Amola Glacier (Italy)
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris-covered glaciers are common in many regions of the world, and accurately modelling their melt is of increasing importance for water resources planning, and biological and ecological research. In this study, we investigate meteorological and glaciological conditions and estimate the melt of Amola Glacier (a small debris-covered glacier in the Adamello-Presanella Massif, Italian Alps) using an empirical approach, based on shortwave radiation, surface temperature, debris thickness and thermal resistance. Meteorological conditions are deter-mined from a supraglacial automatic weather station, while the model is calibrated using i) field data acquired during the ablation season 2020, including a network of ablation stakes and thermistors, ii) modelled solar ra-diation and iii) thermal imagery from Landsat 8 TIRS.The analysis of glacier meteorological conditions shows a high prevalence of cloud-covered (50.60% of daytime observations) and humid conditions, with a high daily air temperature range (22.24 degrees C). Analysis of thermistor data suggests that a linear thermal gradient of the debris layer can be assumed when the model is run at daily resolution. Modelled debris thickness, surface temperatures and melt capture patterns observed on the field, including the decrease in debris thickness and increasing melt with elevation and their variability across the glacier surface. The root mean square error between measured and observed melt is 0.16 m, corresponding to 22% of the average observed melt, in line with the performance of empirical models for debris-free and debris-covered ice. The model could thus be used to provide a first estimate of debris-covered ice melt for glaciers in the Adamello region. Improvements to the model would require measuring all energy fluxes on the glacier from a weather station and investigating their spatial distribution on the glacier surface.

TI  - Key perceptions associated with attitudes towards water reuse in a Swedish town
T2  - WATER REUSE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As climate change and urbanization affect current water management systems, new solutions and approaches rooted in public acceptance are needed to ensure future water supply. In this study, we examine public attitudes to reuse of recycled water and associated worldviews, values, and perceptions in a site without historical water issues. A survey of 143 randomly sampled residents in the municipality of the growing Swedish town Knivsta revealed that 81.4% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards using recycled water in general. The results did not indicate any differences in attitudes between those living in and outside the municipality's urban areas. Perceived benefits and risks were found to be significantly related to both attitudes towards using recycled water in general and to the extreme case of using it for drinking purposes. Additionally, trust in public authorities was highly predictive of attitudes towards drinking recycled water. Furthermore, attitudes were found to be related to an environmental worldview and underlying biospheric, altruistic, and hedonic values. This indicates a need to consider the intended purpose as well as engaging with underlying values as part of the technology legitimation process for improving the chances of successful implementation of water recycling technologies.

TI  - Trends in Warm Season Mesoscale Convective Systems Over Asia in 2001-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) frequently occur over Asia during the warm season, often producing intense precipitation with associated socioeconomic impacts. Here we reveal significant trends in MCS occurrence frequency and related precipitation in Asia during the warm season (March-September) in 2001-2020, using a tracking method that combines cloud and precipitation criteria with high-resolution satellite data from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. To examine whether there are differences between MCSs of different scales, both meso-alpha scales (M alpha CSs) and meso-beta scales (M beta CSs), with horizontal scales of 200-2,000 km and 20-200 km, are tracked. The distribution pattern of frequency and related precipitation of both MaCSs and M beta CSs are quite similar and manifest positive trends over East Asia (EA) and Northeast Asia, and negative trend over Southeast Asia (SEA). The MCS precipitation trend contributes significantly to total precipitation trend, with MaCSs contributing the most. Our analysis indicates the trend in lower-tropospheric water vapor flux convergence has a similar spatial pattern to the MCS frequency and related precipitation trend. Based on an atmospheric moisture flux decomposition analysis, the water vapor flux convergence trend can largely be explained by the change in horizontal wind convergence, while the specific humidity trend driven largely by temperature change plays a minor role. The trend in wind convergence in EA and SEA is possibly related to the evident trend in the lower-tropospheric anticyclone over the western North Pacific and SEA, which might be due to the relatively stronger warming in the Indian Ocean during the past two decades.

TI  - Coseismic Kinematics of the 2023 Kahramanmaras, Turkey Earthquake Sequence From InSAR and Optical Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We derive the ALOS-2 coseismic interferograms, pixel-offsets and Sentinel-2 sub-pixel offsets of the 2023 M(w)7.8 and M(w)7.7 Kahramanmaras, Turkey earthquake sequence. Offset maps show that the sequence ruptured similar to 300 km along the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) and similar to 180 km along the secondary Cardak and Dogansehir faults. We infer the coseismic slip distribution and interseismic fault motion by inverting the co- and inter-seismic observations. Inversion results show that the coseismic slip (similar to 8.0 m) and interseismic strike-slip rate (similar to 4.6 mm/yr) on the main rupture of the M(w)7.8 event are basically consistent with the similar to 8.4 m and similar to 3.9 mm/yr of the M(w)7.7 event. Most coseismic slips of the M(w)7.8 and M(w)7.7 events occur within 10 and 12 km at depth, respectively, in keeping with the interseismic locking depth of 10.4 +/- 3.3 km and 11.1 +/- 3.1 km. This implies that the coseismic rupture kinematics correlate with the interseismic strain accumulation. Moreover, static stress changes show that the M(w)7.7 event is likely promoted by similar to 2 bar stress increase from the M(w)7.8 event on the central section of its main rupture.

TI  - Wintertime Cooling of the Arctic TOA by Low-Level Clouds
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, clouds are known to warm the climate system in the thermal infrared because they typically emit thermal radiation to space at effective temperatures lower than the combined cloud-free atmosphere and surface. However, here we show that & SIM;40% of low-level clouds over sea ice tend to cool the Arctic system at TOA and contribute to a radiative cooling of the Arctic winter climate by -2.3 Wm-2, or a & SIM;16% reduction over the infrared warming effect of all clouds during winter. Based on satellite observations, low-level clouds residing in surface-based temperature inversions emit more longwave radiation to space than would occur in cloudless skies. While these clouds are known to significantly warm the surface, they cool the Arctic climate system overall. Our results imply that accurately representing the cloud radiative effects unique to the Arctic could help to constrain the regional energy budget.The Arctic has become emblematic of climate change, with rapid warming that is at least twice as fast as the rest of the planet. However, major uncertainties in our confidence to understand and predict Arctic climate persist, particularly regarding the radiative effects of clouds. Here we use satellite data to quantify the radiative effects of Arctic low-level clouds, and find approximately 40% of low-level clouds over sea ice tend to radiatively cool the Arctic climate system (Earth's surface and the atmosphere) in winter, rather than warm the climate system as is typical for most clouds in the thermal infrared regime. This cooling effect is governed by the widespread surface temperature inversions (layers in which temperature increases with altitude), which cap these low-level clouds and allow more longwave radiation to escape from the Earth to space compared to clear skies. This finding reveals a fundamental, but overlooked, characteristic of cloud radiative effects in the wintertime Arctic and establishes a new perspective for understanding Arctic climate change.A full range of radiative effects for Arctic wintertime low clouds over sea ice is investigatedAbout 40% of low clouds over sea ice tends to cool the Arctic at the top of the atmosphere in the polar nightThese low clouds with a cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere reside within frequent surface-based temperature inversions

TI  - Remote sensing delineation of wildfire spatial extents and post-fire recovery along a semi-arid climate gradient
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the wildfire extent and post-fire vegetation recovery is critical for fire and forest management. Remote sensing imagery is widely used in wildfire detection because it provides continuous and large-scale surface monitoring capability. In this study, we apply and evaluate the performance of the LandTrendr algorithm in wildfire detection across a semi-arid climate region with a marked precipitation gradient. The aims are to compare the performance of four spectral indices for the burned areas and post-fire recovery detection for different climate conditions and investigate the relationship between suitable model parameters and climate conditions. The results show that NDVI outperforms other indices, including NBR, in burned area detection for drier areas (annual precipitation <400 mm). Disturbance signal-to-noise ratio can serve as an indicator for suitable index selection for semi-arid areas. Although the performance in the detection of burned pixels varies among different indices, they are all suitable for delineating post-fire recovery except for the wet site (annual precipitation of 575 mm) where NBR displays the best performance. Parameter optimization results along the climate gradient show that climate conditions have a significant impact on suitable parameter selection. These findings provide guidance on vegetation wildfire detection in arid and semi-arid climates to support wildfire risk and forestry management.

TI  - Mechanisms influencing changes in water cycle processes in the changing environment of the Songnen Plain, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of the land-surface water cycle has undergone substantial changes as a result of climate change and human activities. Disclosing the evolution of the water cycle and its mechanisms in a changing environment is a challenging and hot issue in hydrological science research, which is essential for regional ecological protection and sustainable development. Based on the MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model, multi-source data are used to simulate the water cycle change process in the Songnen Plain from 1980 to 2020. The study indicates that groundwater data inverted by GRACE and GLDAS data is relatively accurate, which effectively reflects the process of groundwater storage change in particular regions. Moreover, the surface-groundwater coupling model employs strongly correlated inverse groundwater data to simulate the water cycle change process in the Songnen Plain, yielding highly accurate simulation results. In terms of the impact of climate change and human activities on the water cycle process, climate change is the primary cause of changes in the regional water cycle, with contributions to actual evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and groundwater level of 77.04 %, 70.88 %, and 67.86 %, respectively. Nonetheless, as human activities intensify, their impact on the water cycle process progressively increases. From the perspective of the mechanism of water cycle change, the decrease in wetland area, the expansion of urban areas, and the increase in urban water demand are the primary causes of regional water cycle change between 1995 and 2010. The establishment of water conservation facilities and the dramatic increase in paddy field area are the primary causes of the water cycle change between 2011 and 2020. This study combines

TI  - The synergies of SMAP enhanced and MODIS products in a random forest regression for estimating 1 km soil moisture over Africa using Google Earth Engine
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the coarse scale of soil moisture products retrieved from passive microwave observations (SMPMW), several downscaling methods have been developed to enable regional scale applications. However, it can be challenging for users to access final data products and algorithms, as well as managing different data sources and formats, various data processing methods, and the complexity of the workflows from raw data to information products. Here, the Google Earth Engine (GEE), which as of late offers SMPMW, is used to implement a workflow for retrieving 1 km SM at a depth of 0-5 cm using MODIS optical/thermal measurements, the SMPMW coarse scale product, and a random forest regression. The proposed method was implemented on the African continent to estimate weekly SM maps. The results of this study were evaluated against in-situ measurements of three validation networks. Overall, in comparison to the original SMPMW product, which was limited by a spatial resolution of only 9 km, this method is able to estimate SM at 1 km spatial resolution with acceptable accuracy (an average correlation coefficient of 0.64 and a ubRMSD of 0.069 m3/m3). The results show that the proposed method in GEE provides a precise estimation of SM with a higher spatial resolution across the entire continent.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound for predicting response to neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients-a single institution experience
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn node-positive breast cancer patients at diagnosis (cN +) that render node-negative after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in selected cases. Axillary ultrasound (AUS) is most often used for re-staging after NAST. We aimed to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of AUS after NAST for predicting nodal response at the Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana.MethodsBiopsy-confirmed cN + patients consecutively diagnosed at our institution between 2008 and 2021, who received NAST, followed by surgery were identified retrospectively. Only patients that underwent AUS after NAST were included. AUS results were compared to definite nodal histopathology results. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of AUS. We also calculated the proportion of patients with false-positive AUS that results in surgical overtreatment (unnecessary ALND).ResultsWe identified 437 cN + patients. In 244 (55.8%) AUS after NAST was performed. Among those, 42/244 (17.2%) were triple negative (TN), 78/244 (32.0%) Her-2 positive (Her-2 +), and 124/244 (50,8%) luminal Her-2 negative cancers. AUS was negative in 179/244 (73.4%), suspicious/positive in 65/244 (26.6%) (11/42 (26.2%) TN, 19/78 (24.4%) Her-2 + , and 35/124 (28.2%) luminal Her-2 negative cancers). On definite histopathology, nodal complete response (pCR) was observed in 89/244 (36.5%) (19/42 (45.2%) TN, 55/78 (70.5%) Her-2 + , and 15/124 (12.1%) luminal Her-2 negative cancers). Among patients with suspicious/positive AUS, pCR was observed in 20/65 (30.8%) (6/11 (54.5%) TN, 13/19 (68.4%) Her-2 + and 1/35 (2.9%) luminal Her-2 negative cancers). Sensitivity was 29.0%, specificity 77,5%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 38.5%. Specificity and PPV in TN was 68.4% and 45.4%, in Her-2 + 76.4% and 31.6%, in luminal Her-2 negative 93,3% and 97,1%, respectively.ConclusionIn approximately half of the patients, AUS falsely predicts nodal response after NAST and may lead to overtreatment in 30% of the cases (ALND). However, AUS has to be interpreted in context with tumor subtype. In luminal Her-2 negative cancers, it has a high PPV and is therefore useful.

TI  - Sense making in the wake of familial death: "I continue to work through those feelings"
T2  - DEATH STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sense making is especially common in bereavement when a death challenges an individual's existing worldview. Thus, it is often discussed in the context of statistically atypical deaths, such as the death of a child or death by suicide, that are apt to create a crisis of meaning. Less understood is the process of sense making following more statistically normative deaths, such as those that occur in old age following prolonged illness. In this descriptive phenomenological study, researchers analyzed qualitative interviews and digital narratives created by six individuals who had experienced the death of an older family member with dementia, seeking to identify the essential nature of sense making during bereavement following so-called "normal" losses. Three themes (memorializing the whole person, reflecting on the caregiving experience, and emotional sense making) were identified, shedding light on this specific meaning making process among individuals representing a large and growing segment of the population.

TI  - Ecological effects of offshore transport in the shelf sea and its response to climate warming
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although shelf seas contribute substantially to marine primary production (MPP), its variation in MPP under climate warming is poorly known because it is additionally influenced by the horizontal supply of terrigenous materials relative to the open oceans. The offshore transport in the North Yellow Sea (NYS) and its ecological effects were studied to explore the role of offshore transport in controlling the MPP of shelf seas and its variation under climate warming. Results of analyses of millennial sedimentary records in the NYS show that the offshore transport of terrigenous materials is essential for the MPP of the outer shelf, and this process is likely to be regulated by a horizontal temperature gradient. With the warming of the Kuroshio Current during 2002-2021, the flux of offshore transport of coastal materials increased, thereby increasing the MPP of the outer shelf. However, this conclusion is not supported by remote sensing data, which might be induced by the overlook on the vertical heterogeneity of internal properties in shelf sea waters from remote sensing.

The currently available urban poverty monitoring in Indonesia is, however, primarily depends on the expensive and resource-demanding Indonesia National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS). Despite its high-quality poverty statistics, such national-scale survey collection methods are indispensably labor and cost expensive to scale. Alternative data is essentially required to be explored for supporting government poverty data in order to increase the data granularity. In this study, we aim to develop the spatially granular poverty index (SGPI) consisting of multisource remote sensing satellite imageries and big data sources. With 1 km resolution, the SGPI is composed of nighttime light (NTL), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution levels, education and healthcare Point of Interest (POI) data, as alternative economic activity and poverty proxy indicators. Three different approaches of the equal-weighted sum method, the Pearson correlation coefficient method weighted method, and PCA weighted method are compared and evaluated to combine different indicators. Our result shows that the SGPI built in the scope of Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA) by using the equal weighted sum with Yeo-Johnson transformation (EWS-YJ) has the highest correlation with official poverty data which is 0.954. Based on visual identifications through high-resolution satellite imagery, the areas with a relatively high SGPI value are densely populated, and vice versa. Our findings suggest that multi-source remote sensing and geospatial big data integration are promising alternative approaches for granular urban poverty mapping based on spatial characteristics.

TI  - The Dialogical Self of Taoistic Dynamics: How scientists and practitioners can trigger the discovery of a harmonious self
T2  - INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the present paper, I relate the Dialogical Self Theory with the philosophy of Taoism. For that purpose, I instance the premises of Taoism such as that human being use open ideograms (signs and symbols) that grow constantly in their meaning, that the meaning of life can be only unraveled if the unity of opposites is integrated in one's worldview and that the human being listens to his natural intuition and does not force himself to do things (wuwei = effortless action which has its origins in Laozi's TaoTeChing). When those premises are applied to the Dialogical Self Theory, psychologists can help people to develop a harmonious self because the self is operationalized as an open system that is constantly in flux of meaning. Hidden I-positions might be shifted to the foreground while helping the human being to listen to a multitude of positions and to not act in a rigid fashion. In order for scientists and practitioners to use the insights of what I call the Dialogical Self of Taoistic Dynamics, I propose an open interview guide that could help people to realize their harmonious pluralistic self.

TI  - Hourly emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases from open biomass burning in China during 2016-2020
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Open biomass burning (OBB) is a significant source of air pollutants and greenhouse gases that have contributed to air pollution episodes in China in recent years. An accurate emission inventory is critical for the precise control of OBB. Existing OBB emission datasets are commonly based on MODIS observations, and most only have a daily-scale temporal resolution. Daily OBB emissions, however, might not accurately represent diurnal variations, peak hours, or any open burning processes. The China Hourly Open Biomass Burning Emissions (CHOBE) dataset for mainland China from 2016 to 2020 was developed in this study using the spatiotemporal fusion of multiple active fires from MODIS, VIIRS S-NPP and Himawari-8 AHI detections. At a spatial resolution of 2 km, CHOBE provided gridded CO, NOx, SO2, NH3, VOCs, PM2.5, CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from OBB. CHOBE will enhance insight into OBB spatiotemporal variability, improves air quality and climate modelling and forecasting, and aids in the formulation of precise OBB preventive and control measures.

TI  - Soil Moisture Dominates the Forest Productivity Decline During the 2022 China Compound Drought-Heatwave Event
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compound drought-heatwave (CDHW) events threaten ecosystem productivity and are often characterized by low soil moisture (SM) and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). However, the relative roles of SM and VPD in constraining forest productivity during CDHWs remain controversial. In the summer of 2022, China experienced a record-breaking CDHW event (DH2022). Here, we applied satellite remote-sensing data and meteorological data, and machine-learning techniques to quantify the individual contributions of SM and VPD to forest productivity variations and investigate their interactions during the development of DH2022. The results reveal that SM, rather than VPD, dominates the forest productivity decline during DH2022. We identified a possible critical tipping point of SM below which forest productivity would quickly decline with the decreasing SM. Furthermore, we illuminated the evolution of SM, VPD, evapotranspiration, forest productivity, and their interactions throughout DH2022. Our findings broaden the understanding of forest response to extreme CDHWs at the ecosystem scale.Low soil moisture (SM) and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are widely recognized as the dominant drivers of forest productivity decline during compound drought-heatwave (CDHW) events. In the summer of 2022, a record-breaking CDHW (DH2022) struck China. In this study, we decoupled the respective impacts of SM and VPD in determining forest productivity decline during DH2022. We found that during DH2022, SM, rather than VPD, is the dominant driver of forest productivity decline, and once SM decreases below a certain threshold, forest productivity would decline sharply. We illuminated the evolution of SM, VPD, evapotranspiration, forest productivity, and their interactions throughout DH2022. Our findings promote the understanding of forest response to extreme CDHWs at the ecosystem scale and thus potentially improve terrestrial ecosystem models' ability to evaluate and predict the impacts of CDHWs.Soil moisture (SM), rather than vapor pressure deficit, dominates the forest productivity decline in the 2022 China compound drought-heatwave eventForest productivity would decline sharply once SM drops below a certain threshold during extreme compound drought-heatwave eventsEvolution of the 2022 China compound drought-heatwave event and its impacts on forests were illuminated

TI  - Surgical Stabilization of Rib Fractures is Associated with Better Return on Investment for a Healthcare Institution than Non-Operative Management.
T2  - The journal of trauma and acute care surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surgical stabilization of rib fractures(SSRF) continues to gain popularity due to patient benefits. However, little has been produced regarding the economic benefits of SSRF and its impact on hospital metrics such as Vizient. The aim of this study was to explore these benefits hypothesizing SSRF will demonstrate positive return on investment(ROI) for a healthcare institution.METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all rib fracture patients over 5 years at our Level 1 trauma center. Patients were grouped into SSRF versus nonoperative management(NOM). Basic demographics were obtained including case mix index(CMI). Outcomes included narcotic requirements in morphine milliequivalents(MME) prior to discharge, mortality, and discharge disposition. Furthermore, actual hospital length of stay(ALOS) versus Vizient expected LOS were compared between cohorts. Contribution margin(CM) was also calculated. Independent t-test, paired t-test, and linear regression analysis were performed, and significance set at p < 0.05.RESULTS: A total of 1,639 patients were included; 230(14%) underwent SSRF. Age, gender, and Injury Severity Score were similar. SSRF patients had more ribs fractured (7 versus 4; p < 0.001) and more patients with flail chest (43.5% versus 6.7%; p < 0.001). SSRF patients also had a significantly higher CMI (4.33 versus 2.78; p = 0.001). Narcotic requirements and mortality were less in the SSRF cohort; 155 versus 246 MME (p < 0.001) and 1.7% versus 7.1% (p = 0.003), respectively. SSRF patients were more likely to be discharged home (70.4% versus 63.7%; p = 0.006). SSRF patients demonstrated shorter ALOS where NOM patients demonstrated longer ALOS compared to Vizient expected LOS. CMs for SSRF patients were significantly higher and linear regression analysis showed a CM $1,128.14 higher per patient undergoing SSRF (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing SSRF demonstrate a significant ROI for a healthcare organization. Despite SSRF patients having a higher CMI, they were able to be discharged sooner than expected by Vizient calculations resulting in better a CM.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, Therapeutic.

TI  - Insights into post-emplacement lava flow dynamics at Mt. Etna volcano from 2016 to 2021 by synthetic aperture radar and multispectral satellite data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-emplacement dynamics of lava flows is governed by several factors such as poroelastic deformation of the substrate; gravity-induced repacking and rearrangement of the vesicle-bearing fluid lava and other void spaces by superposed flows; lava densification processes; viscoelastic strain relaxation of the ground caused by the lava load; thermal cooling and contraction of the solid lava; and discrete motion of surface blocks. Here we investigate post-emplacement lava flow dynamics at the Mt. Etna volcano, and we infer on the possible causes by exploiting optical and radar satellite data. Synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-1 satellite mission provided high-resolution horizontal and vertical displacement rates and displacement time series of the lava flows emplaced on the Mt. Etna volcano summit from January 2016 to July 2021. Sentinel-2 multispectral data allowed to identify the lava flows boundaries emplaced during the December 2018 and May 2019 paroxysms. Finally, high resolution COSMO-SkyMed radar data allowed to account for the topographic changes generated by the lava emplacement by means of stereo radargrammetry technique. Such an unprecedented dataset provided a full picture of the lava flow dynamics, whose kinematics is governed lava cooling, which in turn produce thermal contraction of the lava body and viscous compaction of the underlying substrate. Both phenomena act at different periods, being the thermal contraction predominant for recent lava flows. Downslope sliding is also invoked, especially for recent lava flows emplaced on high slope areas.

TI  - Divergent Temporal Trends of Mercury in Arctic Char from Paired Lakes Influenced by Climate-Related Drivers.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Climate-driven changes including rising air temperatures, enhanced permafrost degradation, and altered precipitation patterns can have profound effects on contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), in High Arctic lakes. Two physically similar lakes, East Lake and West Lake at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada are being affected by climate change differently. Both lakes have experienced permafrost degradation in their catchments; however, West Lake has also undergone multiple underwater Mass Movement Events (MMEs; beginning in fall 2008), leading to a sustained 50-fold increase in turbidity. This provided the unique opportunity to understand the potential impacts of permafrost degradation and other climate-related effects on Hg concentrations and body condition of landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), an important sentinel species across the Circum-Arctic. Our objectives were to assess temporal trends in char Hg concentrations and to determine potential mechanisms driving the trends. There was a significant decrease in Hg concentrations in East Lake char, averaging 6.5%/year and 3.8%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted means, respectively, from 2008 to 2019. Conversely, in West Lake there was a significant increase, averaging 7.9%/year and 8.0%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted mean Hg concentrations, respectively, for 2009 to 2017 (the last year with sufficient sample size). The best predictors of length-adjusted Hg concentrations in West Lake were carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, indicating a shift in diet including possible dietary starvation brought on by the profound increase in lake turbidity. Our study provides an example of how increasing lake turbidity, a likely consequence of climate warming in Arctic lakes, may influence fish condition and Hg concentrations.

TI  - The phenological response of European vegetation to urbanisation is mediated by macrobioclimatic factors.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Plant phenology is a crucial component of ecosystem functioning and is affected by multiple elements of global change; we therefore need to quantify the current phenological changes associated to human activities and understand their impacts on ecosystems. Urbanisation and the intensification of anthropogenic activities alter meteorological conditions and cause phenological changes in urban vegetation worldwide. We used remote sensing data to evaluate the phenological response (start of season date SOS, length of season LOS and end of season date EOS) of five main vegetation types (evergreen forests, deciduous forests, mixed forests, sparse woody vegetation and grasslands) to urbanisation in the 69 most populated pan-European metropolitan areas (i.e., those that include cities with a population over 450,000 inhabitants) for the period 2002-2021. In general, SOS advanced and LOS increased with urbanisation intensity across European metropolitan areas. We found that macrobioclimatic factors strongly determined the strength and direction of the phenological response to urbanisation intensity. The greatest advances in SOS with increasing urbanisation were registered in metropolitan areas in the Mediterranean region, where there was also more uncertainty in this relationship. The EOS advanced with urbanisation in metropolitan areas in the Mediterranean macrobioclimate, whereas in areas with higher precipitation during summer the opposite trend was observed suggesting water availability mediates the response between urbanisation and autumn phenophases. Our results suggest that macrobioclimatic constraints operating at the continental scale are crucial to understand the relationship between plant phenology and urbanisation intensity.

TI  - Burn severity and land-use legacy influence bird abundance in the Atlantic-Mediterranean biogeographic transition
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire regimes in mountain landscapes of southern Europe have been shifting from their baselines due to rural abandonment and fire exclusion policies. Understanding the effects of fire on biodiversity is paramount to implement adequate management. Herein, we evaluated the relative role of burn severity and heterogeneity on bird abundance in an abandoned mountain range located in the biogeographic transition between the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean region (the Natural Park 'Baixa Limia-Serra do Xure & PRIME;s'). We surveyed the bird community in 206 census plots distributed across the Natural Park, both inside and outside areas affected by wildfires over the last 11 years (from 2010 to 2020). We used satellite images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat missions to quantify the burn severity and heterogeneity of each fire within each surveyed plot. We also accounted for the past land use (forestry or agropastoral use) by using a land cover information for year 2010 derived from satellite image classification. We recorded 1735 contacts from 28 bird species. Our models, fitted by using GLMs with Poisson error distribution (pseudo-R2-average of 0.22 & PLUSMN; 0.13), showed that up to 71% of the modeled species were linearly correlated with at least one attribute of the fire regime. The spatiotemporal variation in burnt area and severity were relevant factors for explaining the local abundance of our target species (39% of the species; Akaike weights >0.75). We also found a quadratic effect of at least one fire regime attribute on bird abundance for 60% of the modeled species. The past land use, and its legacy after 10 years, was critical to understand the role of fire (Akaike weights >0.75). Our findings confirm the importance of incorporating remotely sensed indicators of burn severity into the toolkit of decision makers to accurately anticipate the response of birds to fire management.

AB  - Cultivated land fragmentation (CLF) has severely affected China's agricultural production efficiency, large-scale operations, agricultural modernization, and food security. Exploring the spatiotemporal evolution patterns and driving forces of CLF is crucial for agricultural modernization. However, the driving forces of CLF in different agricultural regions in China still need to be clarified. In this study, CLF was measured in 2000, 2010, and 2020 based on remote sensing data with landscape pattern metrics, and the driving forces of spatial differentiation were detected based on a geographical detector model. The overall cultivated land area has slightly declined during the study period while the CLF has intensified. CLF showed significant spatial autocorrelation, with CLF increased-cultivated land decreased (2000 to 2010) and CLF decreased-cultivated land decreased (2010 to 2020). The contribution rate of land use intensity on CLF was the highest among all agricultural regions, excluding the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. In contrast, the contribution rates of other factors significantly varied across agricultural regions. These findings provide scientific support in formulating policies to conserve cultivated land for sustainable use of agricultural resources and CLF management in China.

TI  - Cloud modification factor parametrization for solar UV based on the GOES satellite: Validation using ground-based measurements in Sao Paulo city, Brazil
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach for parametrization of the cloud effect on ultraviolet (UV) sun wavelengths is proposed. Diagnostic and observational studies show that solar reflectance at 0.65 mu m (R0.65 mu m) could be a proxy for cloud optical depth, and it can be applied to parametrize the cloud modification factor (CMF), which is often applied to estimate the UV index. For all sky conditions, a linear relation between broadband CMF (0.2-0.4 mu m) and R0.65 mu m is derived, given by CMF(theory) = 1.09-1.19 center dot R0.65 mu m using a radiative transfer model, which is close to CMF (observed) = 1.15 1.55 Rch1 based on ground-based radiation measurements and geostationary satellite channel 1 reflectance data (R-ch1). The observationally derived CMF versus Rch1 fitting was applied for four different cloud classes from the satellite scene classification products: cirrus, cumulus, stratus and deep convective clouds. CMF varies with R-ch1 from 1 for optically thin clouds to 0.05 for stratus and convective clouds, while CMF >0.7 denotes cirrus clouds. These values differ significantly from the constant CMF values suggested in the literature, particularly for convective clouds. The parameterization found here for each cloud is assessed by comparing the UVI estimated using the novel CMF function to UVI ground-based observations during a four-year period in S (a) over tildeo Paulo, Brazil. Because of high temporal and spatial satellite data availability, the parametrized CMF in terms of R-ch1 is well suited for incorporation into operational weather services, estimating UVI under cloudy conditions with high correlation (r > 0.8) and low errors (root mean square error <2.0) when compared to ground data. In addition, CMF parametrization provides a better IUV cloud effect than the CMF given in the literature. The findings shown here enable better UVI estimation under overcast skies over tropical climates, allowing for more realistic information regarding health and sun exposure to be communicated to the public.

TI  - Multiband 2D InSAR deformation models with error estimates from natural neighbour interpolation: Case study in the Latrobe Valley, Australia
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A long term objective for Australia is to develop a continent-wide 2D deformation model based on satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Nation-wide InSAR processing has been demonstrated in European countries and Japan. However, there are some key differences to the Australian situation for a 2D model (i.e., vertical and east-west surface movement rates) where SAR data from ascending and descending satellite orbits are needed. The primary difference is that while ESA's Sentinel-1 ascending and descend-ing satellite observations underpin 2D models in other parts of the world, the Australian continent is only covered by descending Sentinel-1 SAR data in most areas. Combined with Australia's large size of 7.63 million km2, this means a different approach is needed to realise 2D deformation models. In this article, we propose the novel approach of (1) combining supplementary multiband SAR (as-cending X-band and L-band) with the descending C-band Sentinel-1 data, and (2) using natural neighbour (NN) interpolation as a com-putationally efficient interpolation method for combining the multiband InSAR data on common grids prior to 2D model computation. This is an alternative to the computationally intensive Ordinary Kriging (OK) approach. A disadvantage of NN compared to OK is that it does not compute an error estimate, which we address by deriving an error estimate for the NN interpolation so that errors are pro-vided for each 2D rate to aid with their correct interpretation. To demonstrate our new approach, we compute experimental 2D defor-mation models that propagate the full error budget from InSAR, a GNSS connection to ITRF2014 and NN interpolation into an error grid in the Latrobe Valley in southeast Australia. The significance of our approach is that it provides a suitable combination of methods that may be used to develop 2D continental deformation models for Australia's unique circumstances. Our results demonstrate the accu-racy of NN and OK interpolation are at the same level (within error), and the error estimates from both interpolation techniques are also comparable: X band (TerraSAR-X) -1 mm/yr; C band (Sentinel-1) -2.5 mm/yr, and L band (ALOS PALSAR1) 4 mm/yr. For the first time, we reveal 2D deformation in the Latrobe Valley region showing horizontal east-west deformation in the area surrounding an above-ground mine and reaching 20 mm/yr, with vertical subsidence rates reaching-40 mm/yr. & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Tumescent anesthesia use for cutaneous malignancies does not impact sentinel node identification but decreases estimated blood loss.
T2  - Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel node biopsy is performed to stage clinically and radiographically occult regional disease in cases of malignancy, including cutaneous cancer such as melanoma. The use of tumescent anesthesia with sentinel node biopsy for cutaneous malignancies has not been well studied. Therefore, we aimed to compare the rate of successful sentinel node identification and estimated blood loss between patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy with and without the use of tumescent anesthesia.METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of a prospectively maintained single-institution database of all patients who underwent reconstruction after the extirpation of a cutaneous malignancy over an 18-month period. Patient demographics, tumor histology, and characteristics, indication for and success of sentinel node biopsy, use of tumescent anesthesia, and total estimated blood loss were examined.RESULTS: Sentinel node biopsy was performed in 15 of 39 patients (38.5%) receiving tumescent anesthesia compared with 6 of 26 patients (23.1%) not receiving it (p=0.19). Sentinel node biopsy had a success rate of 100% in the tumescent and nontumescent anesthesia groups. The mean estimated blood loss in the tumescent anesthesia group was 36.7mL versus 59.6mL in the nontumescent anesthesia group (p<0.001). Complication rates were comparable between the tumescent anesthesia (12.8%) and nontumescent anesthesia (19.2%) groups (p=0.48).CONCLUSION: The use of tumescent anesthesia in cutaneous malignancy extirpation and immediate reconstruction was not associated with a decreased sentinel node identification rate or change in complication rates. However, tumescent anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the estimated blood loss.

TI  - The overlooked contribution of trees outside forests to tree cover and woody biomass across Europe
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees are an integral part in European landscapes, but only forest resources are systematically assessed by national inventories. The contribution of urban and agricultural trees to national-level carbon stocks remains largely unknown. Here we produced canopy cover, height and above-ground biomass maps from 3-meter resolution nanosatellite imagery across Europe. Our biomass estimates have a systematic bias of 7.6% (overestimation; R = 0.98) compared to national inventories of 30 countries, and our dataset is sufficiently highly resolved spatially to support the inclusion of tree biomass outside forests, which we quantify to 0.8 petagrams. Although this represents only 2% of the total tree biomass, large variations between countries are found (10% for UK) and trees in urban areas contribute substantially to national carbon stocks (8% for the Netherlands). The agreement with national inventory data, the scalability, and spatial details across landscapes, including trees outside forests, make our approach attractive for operational implementation to support national carbon stock inventory schemes.

TI  - Characterization and expression of heat shock and immune genes in natural populations of<i> Prodiamesa</i><i> olivacea</i> (Diptera) exposed to thermal stress
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper characterizes the heat stress response (HSR) and explores the impact of temperatures on the immune response of larvae from two chironomid species, Prodiamesa olivacea and Chironomus riparius. Genes involved in crucial metabolic pathways were de novo identified in P. olivacea: Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsc70, Cdc37, and HSF for the heat stress response (HSR) and TOLL, PGRP, C-type lectin, and JAK/hopscotch for the immune system response (ISR). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the expression levels of the selected genes in short-term treatments (up to 120') at high temperatures (35 degrees C and 39 degrees C). Exposing P. olivacea to elevated temperatures resulted in HSR induction with increased expression of specific heat shock genes, suggesting the potential of HSPs as early indicators of acute thermal stress. Surprisingly, we found that heat shock represses multiple immune genes, revealing the antagonist relation between the heat shock response and the innate immune response in P. olivacea. Our results also showed species-dependent gene responses, with more significant effects in P. olivacea, for most of the biomarkers studied, demonstrating a higher sensitivity in this species to environmental stress conditions than that of C. riparius. This work shows a multi-species approach that enables a deeper understanding of the effects of heat stress at the molecular level in aquatic dipterans.

TI  - Mapping oil pollution in the Gulf of Suez in 2017-2021 using Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of Suez region accommodates diverse activities, including oil exploration and production, recreational activities, and export and import ports. The Gulf region is exposed to pollution risks due to these interactions, with few research studies documenting these pollution cases. This research aimed to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data to detect and map all the oil pollution incidents within the geographical extent of the Gulf of Suez that occurred from 2017 to 2021, locating the most affected regions and possible sources of pollution. It enabled the detection and mapping of nearly 150 oil spill incidents that occurred over 67 dates during the study period and covered 851 km2 of the sea surface. The year 2018 recorded the greatest pollution area over the study period, with 201 km2. Along the Gulf coast, Suez, Ain Sokhna, and Ras Ghareb cities recorded the highest number of marine pollution incidents. The research also located seven sources of pollution that frequently discharge into the Gulf water without regulations. This research recommends implementing a realtime monitoring system for oil pollution to robustly detect any future oil incidents in these high-risk areas as quickly as possible and minimize their environmental impact.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing to Address Green Heritage of the City of Marrakech, Morocco
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and rapid urbanization have significant impact on green spaces and natural resources in African countries. To investigate this impact in the city of Marrakech, this study develops remote-sensing data to monitor changes in land cover and land use from 1990 to 2020. Results show almost 35% diminution of vegetation cover over the investigation period. In 1990, the city of Marrakech had a vegetation cover of 4.2 km(2), which fell to 2.7 km(2) in 2020. The main change occurred between 1990 and 2000 with a decrease of 13.7%, which is essentially due to the increase in build-up areas, related to the rapid growth of the city's population. This evolution in land cover affects the urban environment negatively including air quality and temperature regulation. This research provides a better understanding of changing trends, confirms the importance of using satellite imagery to monitor vegetation cover in urban settings, helps determine efficient environmental management, and affects successful green infrastructure policy and planning, thereby allowing for improved adaptation and mitigation to climate change.

TI  - Analysing the elevation-distributed hydro-climatic regime of the snow covered and glacierised Hunza Basin in the upper Indus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the high altitude Hindukush Karakoram Himalaya (HKH) mountains, the complex weather system, inaccessible terrain and sparse measurements make the elevation-distributed precipitation and temperature among the most significant unknowns. The elevation-distributed snow and glacier dynamics in the HKH region are also little known, leading to serious concerns about the current and future water availability and management. The Hunza Basin in the HKH region is a scarcely monitored, and snow- and glacier-dominated part of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). The current study investigates the elevation-distributed hydrological regime in the Hunza Basin. The Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) model, with a degree day and an energy balance approach for simulating glacial melt, is forced with precipitation derived from two global datasets (ERA5-Land and JRA-55). The mean annual precipitation for 1997-2010 is estimated as 947 and 1,322 mm by ERA5-Land and JRA-55, respectively. The elevation-distributed precipitation estimates showed that the basin receives more precipitation at lower elevations. The daily river flow is well simulated, with KGE ranging between 0.84 and 0.88 and NSE between 0.80 and 0.82. The flow regime in the basin is dominated by glacier melt (45%-48%), followed by snowmelt (30%-34%) and rainfall (21%-23%). The simulated snow cover area (SCA) is in good agreement with the MODIS satellite-derived SCA. The elevation-distributed glacier melt simulation suggested that the glacial melt is highest at the lower elevations, with a maximum in the elevation 3,218-3,755 masl (14%-21% of total melt). The findings improve the understanding of the local hydrology by providing helpful information about the elevation-distributed meltwater contributions, water balance and hydro-climatic regimes. The simulation showed that the DDD model reproduces the hydrological processes satisfactorily for such a data-scarce basin.

TI  - Comparative analysis between ERA5 reanalysis data and MRR observation data at different altitudes for fall velocity and liquid water content
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous measurements of rainfall parameters are required for radio planning and flood management among others. However, due to the dearth of requisite infrastructure and expertise within the region, it is usually necessary to use satellite and reanalysis data. In this study, the performance of ECMWF ERA5 data in providing fall velocity (W) and liquid water content (LWC) estimates at different altitudes was compared with measurements from a ground-based Micro Rain Radar in a tropical location. Results obtained showed correlation values of 0.60-0.94 and 0.16-0.93 for fall velocity and liquid water content, respectively. The performance of ERA5 was found to decrease with altitude. In general, the results show the sufficient reliability of the ERA-5 reanalysis data for the two parameters on vertical scales. Therefore, it can be inferred that the ERA-5 data are reliable in estimating the average LWC and W, especially on a vertical scale for both hydrological and radio wave propagation studies. & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Age-Based Stratification to Estimate Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and Carbon Stocks of Rubber Plantations in Tripura
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis (Wild. Ex Adr. De Juss.) Muell. Arg.) is emerging as a fast-expanding plantation crop in India and Southeast Asia. Traditionally, aboveground biomass (AGB) is estimated from forest type or crown density stratification by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) and does not explicitly account for standing age. The present study estimates the AGB and carbon (C) stock of natural rubber (NR) plantations in Tripura, India, which were estimated to cover 93 thousand hectares (kha) in 2021 using remote sensing. A multi-year satellite data-based rubber plantation age-class map was used with measured AGB to generate age-based rubber AGB and C-stock maps with 5-year interval age classes. The total carbon stored for all age group rubber plantations was found to be 2.8 Tg. State-level forest cover and type statistics from the Forest Survey of India (FSI) biannual reports, i.e. India State of Forest Report, were used to understand the dynamics of the forest over the past two decades. This study indicates that the expansion of rubber plantations was accompanied by a loss in natural vegetation and a reduction in standing pools. While India is committed to reducing carbon emissions, and NR plantations have the potential to be an important source of C-stocks at the state and national levels, results indicate that this study site has undergone significant changes in natural forest cover and type. The developed approach may be utilized in practical applications for accurate C-stock accounting in other managed forests.

TI  - On a ∼210 t Caribbean coastal boulder: The <i>huracanolito</i> seaward of the ruins of the Bucanero resort, Juragua, Oriente, Cuba
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coastal boulder deposits (CBDs), named huracanolitos in Cuba, found along rocky shores, result from storms, tropical cyclones or tsunamis. Despite being important indicators for coastal hazard assessment, determining the mode of emplacement of CBDs (storm/hurricane or tsunami) is not easy. We present, for the first time in English, data about CBDs along the shores of the Cuban Archipelago. More specifically, we focused on a CBD, that is, to our knowledge, the largest one ever described on Cuba Island. Located on a low-lying coral reef terrace on the SE shore of the island, the reefal limestone CBD is emplaced seaward of the ruins of the Bucanero resort. The resort was built in 1989, endured hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005) and, in October 2012, was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. As observed on Corona and Landsat satellite images since 1962, the CBD was not moved, neither by hurricane Flora (1963) nor Sandy (2012), both associated with important storm surges and powerful swells. We determined the CBD volume with open-source structure from motion photogrammetry as 82.6 m(3). Then, we estimated from a sample its density as 2550 kg/m(3). Finally we calculated its weight as 210.6 tons. We calculated the minimum flow velocity responsible for the emplacement of the CBD 33 +/- 2 m inland-6.83 +/- 0.54 m/s and 7.26 +/- 0.51 m/s. Such flow velocities are compatible with those of both tsunamis and hurricanes. Because of the greater frequency of hurricanes than tsunamis in the area, we propose that a tropical cyclone generated the extreme surge and wave that emplaced the Bucanero CBD. Such CBDs demonstrate that on Cuba's south coast, we can expect marine flooding exceeding the flooding during the major hurricanes of recent decades.

TI  - Review of mapping analysis and complementarity between solar and wind energy sources
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This review aims to identify the available methodologies, data, and techniques for mapping the potential of solar and wind energy and its complementarity and to provide significant research and patents regarding these issues. The review shows that the mapping methodologies vary in space and time, going from a global scale to a microscale. Studies use observed data, such as land-based monitoring stations, upper-air stations, wind towers, and satellite data. Additionally, they use meteorological modeling, such as analysis and reanalysis from global models, and mesoscale and microscale models. The complementarity analysis uses mainly correlation techniques such as Pearson's, Spearman, or Kendall's correlation. However, some studies pointed out that these techniques are unsuitable for analyzing wind and solar time series. This brings additional research and methods to assess and evaluate the complementarity between energy sources, reinforcing that there is no standard or common methodology to perform complementarity analyses. The patent survey has shown that most patents are regarding power plant components, configuration, energy storage in hybrid systems, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence techniques for improving power plant operation. A case study was established to illustrate the methodology of mapping the solar and wind potential and their complementarity.

TI  - Detecting the long-term spatiotemporal crop phenology changes in a highly fragmented agricultural landscape
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends in crop phenometrics reveal the influence of climate variability and change on crop growth and development. However, the trends are less clear in fragmented tropical smallholder landscapes, because there is high spatial and temporal variability in crop phenology. Frequent historical and high spatial resolution (<30 m) Earth observations are needed to track changes in crop phenology in fragmented landscapes but are often unavailable. The spatial-temporal gap can be closed by integrating infrequent high spatial resolution Earth observations with low spatial/high temporal resolution observations through data fusion. We fused 30 m resolution Landsat and 250 m resolution MODIS imagery to investigate trends in crop phenology from 2000 to 2020 in a fragmented agricultural landscape of Ethiopia. We used the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) that had recently been modified for application in fragmented agricultural landscapes. We used the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test for crop phenology trend analysis. Crop phenology based on Landsat-MODIS fusion was compared to MODIS-based crop phenology without fusion. We found data fusion yielded a smaller magnitude of changes in the start of season (SOS:-0.2-day-y-1) and end of season (EOS: -0.50day-y-1) compared to MODIS SOS (-0.5-day-y-1) and EOS (1.38-day-y-1) due to MODIS-related mixing with the surrounding natural vegetation in the fragmented agricultural landscape. EOS showed a faster rate of change compared to SOS over the 21-years. The Landsat and MODIS fusion captured spatial variation in the timing and magnitude of change specific to crops and their growing environment, which has implications for adaptation strategies. Our results highlight the importance of long-term data fusion to improve the spatial dimension of crop phenology time series analysis. Integrating time series land cover maps into the data fusion processing chain could further improve long-term data fusion for crop phenology trend analysis.

TI  - Discovery and Feasibility Study of Medical Fluorophore 33 as a Novel Theranostic Agent
T2  - ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescent dyes have garnered significant attention as theranostic platforms owing to their inherent characteristics. In this study, we present the discovery of Medical Fluorophore 33 (MF33), a novel and potent theranostic agent with a phenaleno-isoquinolinium salt structure that can serve as a cancer therapeutic strategy. The synthesis of MF33 is readily achievable through a simple Rh(III)-catalyzed reaction. Moreover, MF33 displayed strong fluorescence signals, excellent microsomal stability, and high biocompatibility in vivo. It induces significant apoptosis in cancer cells via the p53/p21/caspase-3 signaling pathway, leading to selective cytotoxicity in various cancer cells. In vivo fluorescence imaging with MF33 enabled the visualization of sentinel lymph nodes in living mice. Notably, repeated intraperitoneal administration of MF33 resulted in antitumor activity in mice with colorectal cancer. Collectively, our findings suggest that phenaleno-isoquinolinium salt-based MF33 is a viable theranostic agent for biomedical imaging and cancer treatment.

M3  - Review
AB  - Harold Gillies, plastic surgeon, and Donald Morton, surgical oncologist, were iconic pioneers in their respective fields. Both of them made their mark by identifying crucial practical problems and finding innovative ways of solving them. Gillies grappled with the challenge of restoring form and function to British military personnel injured in World War I, and he set up a dedicated facility for performing this work. He introduced many new reconstructive techniques that became the foundation of the modern specialty of plastic and reconstructive surgery, which he established and nurtured. Morton, in the United States, applied his problem-solving skills to the long-debated question of the best way to manage regional lymph nodes in patients with melanoma. He developed the innovative technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy and initiated large-scale international clinical trials to establish its validity and clinical value. This and other important contributions to the emerging field of surgical oncology earned Morton his reputation as a pioneer and leader of that specialty. The problems that confronted Gillies and Morton were completely different, but both demonstrated remarkable skills as master problem-solvers in their respective fields and made extraordinary contributions to the body of knowledge and welfare of patients. All surgeons must be problem-solvers because every patient who presents for surgical management represents a new problem (or set of problems) to be addressed. As surgeons, we would do well to consider individuals such as Gillies and Morton as role models for our own problem-solving activities in day-to-day clinical practice.

TI  - Positive effects of tree diversity on tropical forest restoration in a field-scale experiment
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Experiments under controlled conditions have established that ecosystem functioning is generally positively related to levels of biodiversity, but it is unclear how widespread these effects are in real-world settings and whether they can be harnessed for ecosystem restoration. We used remote-sensing data from the first decade of a long-term, field-scale tropical restoration experiment initiated in 2002 to test how the diversity of planted trees affected recovery of a 500-ha area of selectively logged forest measured using multiple sources of satellite data. Replanting using species-rich mixtures of tree seedlings with higher phylogenetic and functional diversity accelerated restoration of remotely sensed estimates of aboveground biomass, canopy cover, and leaf area index. Our results are consistent with a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the lowland dipterocarp rainforests of SE Asia and demonstrate that using diverse mixtures of species can enhance their initial recovery after logging.

TI  - Snow-corrected vegetation indices for improved gross primary productivity assessment in North American evergreen forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - North American evergreen forests cover large areas and influence the global carbon cycle. Satellite remote sensing has been used to track the phenology of ecosystem photosynthesis of these forests by detecting variation in vegetation optical properties associated with physiological and structural features, and most of these methods have been closely tied to vegetation greenness. However, in evergreens, the application of satellite data to monitor photosynthetic phenology is often limited by the lack of sensitivity of greenness-based indices. In this study, we identified 47 evergreen forest flux sites in North America that had MODIS observation overlapping with the flux tower records. We then calculated four vegetation indices using MODIS MAIAC data (MCD19A1), including NDVI, CCI, NIRv, and kNDVI, for the 47 flux sites and evaluated relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP) and vegetation indices across the North American evergreen forests. Our results showed that snow had substantial effects on the performance of all vegetation indices in tracking GPP phenology, particularly in the early spring when rapid changes occurred to both GPP and snow cover. Different vegetation indices were affected differently, indicating contradictory and confounding effects of snow on these indices. After correcting for the snow effects, both CCI and NIRv performed well in tracking GPP phenology, albeit for different reasons. CCI is sensitive to seasonal changes in the relative levels of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, which are closely tied to GPP phenology in evergreens. NIRv is sensitive to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and to the contribution of deciduous components to the overall optical properties. We also found that correlations between GPP and vegetation indices varied among ecoregions and climate classes. In general, regions with pronounced seasonal GPP patterns had stronger correlations between GPP and greenness-based indices than regions with weaker seasonal GPP patterns. These biome differences were less pronounced for CCI. The snow artifacts and complementary vegetation index effects reported here should be considered in any large-scale studies of GPP using reflectance-based indices from optical satellites.

TI  - Global enhanced vegetation photosynthesis in urban environment and its drivers revealed by satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation on the future impacts of climatic and environmental change on vegetation photosynthesis has been largely restricted to controlled field experiments, which can hardly be extended to global scale due to limited spatial, species and ecosystem coverages. However, in urban areas plants experience altered environments that mimic potential future conditions, with higher air temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and pollution levels. Cities can therefore be used as global, unplanned experiments for assessing the photosynthetic response to multiple climatic and environmental drivers. Following this logic, here we investigate the urbanization impact on vegetation primary productivity and its drivers at global 160 mega-cities, using highspatial resolution satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data as the proxy of photosynthesis. SIF enhancements were observed across most of the urban-rural gradients, accounting for more than 85% of the investigated land pixels. More importantly, SIF enhancements due to indirect urbanization impact (i.e., the impacts of climatic and environmental factors on vegetation growth) offset approximately 47% of the SIF reductions due to land cover change, a value significantly higher than that observed for a greenness spectral index (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) (30%). Atmospheric CO2, air temperature, radiation and atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were found to be the main drivers accounting for the enhanced SIF in urban areas. These results prove a dominant and global enhancement of vegetation photosynthesis in urban conditions, and reveal the specific contribution of climatic and environmental factors. Our findings can help to forecast the impacts of future environmental conditions on vegetation photosynthesis, and enhance our knowledge on the overall response of terrestrial biomes to climate change.

TI  - Satellite-based land surface temperature and soil moisture observations accurately predict soil respiration in temperate deciduous and coniferous forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration, defined as the total flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil to the atmosphere, is a key ecosystem process that affects the regional and global carbon (C) cycles and is highly sensitive to temperature and soil moisture. It is challenging to quantify soil respiration at the ecosystem level from commonly used in-situ soil chamber measurements because of large spatial variability. Methods that provide temporally and spatially continuous estimates of soil respiration at various scales are vital to understand the impact of climate change on soil C stock. In this study, we evaluate three commonly used empirical models and a Random Forest machine learning algorithm applied to satellite derived estimates of land surface temperature (LST) and soil moisture to estimate soil respiration in temperate deciduous and coniferous forests in Canada. The models were calibrated using in-situ soil temperature and moisture and validated against in-situ measurements of soil CO2 fluxes (gCm- 2day � 1) from automatic soil chambers. We separately evaluate the performance of nighttime and daytime satellite-based LST and soil moisture observations in modeling soil respiration. The soil respiration models were also evaluated at daily and monthly time scales against in-situ measurements. Results indicate that models based on satellite LST, and soil moisture can explain more than 70% of the variability in observed soil respiration. Nighttime LST at a monthly time scale resulted in consistently higher accuracy than daytime LST in estimating soil respiration. Satellite observations resulted in comparable accuracy in estimating soil respiration as in-situ measurements. Satellite LST and soil moisture observations are indispensable data sources to estimate soil respiration at ecosystem level and its upscaling to regional and global scales.

TI  - All-sky infrared radiance data assimilation of FY-4A AGRI with different physical parameterizations for the prediction of an extremely heavy rainfall event
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) allows for high-spatiotemporalresolution observations of the local severe weather systems. The capabilities for assimilating the all-sky AGRI infrared radiances are explored with the WRF three-dimensional variational data assimilation system (WRF3DVAR) to improve the forecast accuracy of an extremely heavy rainfall event over the Henan Province of China in this study. In particular, data assimilation experiments are conducted with different physical parameterization schemes, including microphysical schemes and cumulus parameterizations. The results show that the all-sky AGRI radiance data assimilation experiments based on the Purdue Lin microphysics scheme and the Kain-- Fritsch cumulus scheme can lead to better forecasts of the rainfall intensity and location, respectively. Meanwhile, it is found that the analyzed cloud top temperature fits the observations better when cloudy radiances from the AGRI are assimilated using the Purdue Lin scheme. This finding suggests that proper physical processes could facilitate the effective use of AGRI cloud-affected observations. On the other hand, positive forecast impacts from assimilating the all-sky AGRI radiance data have been confirmed when compared to the experiments that assimilate only the clear-sky AGRI radiances or only conventional observations. The assimilation of the all sky AGRI water vapor channel is conducive to humidifying the initial conditions in the middle and low troposphere with more realistic analysis increments of water vapor, cloud water, and cloud ice, resulting in improved intensity forecasts of the heavy rainfall system and better forecast skill scores.

TI  - Simultaneous removal of phosphorus, zinc, and lead from oligotrophic ecosystem by iron-driven denitrification: Performance and mechanisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the current situation of complex pollution caused in surface water by oligotrophic condition and heavy metal release from river and lake bottom sediments. This study aimed to achieve the simultaneous removal of nitrate, phosphorus, Zn2+ and Pb2+ through microbial approach. At nitrate concentration of 4.82 mg L-1, carbon to nitrogen ratio of 1.5, pH of 6.0, and Fe2+ concentration of 5.0 mg L-1, the nitrate removal efficiency of Zoogloea sp. FY-6 reached 95.17%. The addition of pollutants under these conditions resulted in 88.76% removal of total phosphorus at 18 h, and 85.46 and 78.59% removal of Zn2+ and Pb2+ respectively, and there was competition for adsorption between Zn2+ and Pb2+. Extracellular polymers and fluorescence excitation-emission substrates confirmed that Fe2+ reduced heavy metal toxicity through promoting bacterial production of secretions and promotes denitrification as a carbon source. Meanwhile, contaminant removal curves and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated the synchronous removal of Zn2+ and Pb2+ mainly through biological action and the formation of nanoscale iron oxides. Biological-iron precipitation also provided adsorption sites for phosphorus. This research provides the theoretical foundation for applying microorganisms to restore oligotrophic source water (rivers and lakes) containing complex pollutants.

TI  - The understory microclimate in agroforestry now and in the future-a case study of Arabica coffee in its native range
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is having a major impact on crop production and food security worldwide, and particularly so for smallholder farmers. As agroforestry is common with smallholder farmers, it is important to not only model the macroclimate, but also the microclimate that crops experience below the canopies. However, there are few highresolution spatiotemporal climate projections for forest understories, because of constraints related to the lack of i) development of models for downscaling global climate projections, ii) high-resolution gridded datasets of environmental factors influencing microclimate, and iii) spatially replicated in-situ microclimate measurements. We focused on a landscape in southwestern Ethiopia where Arabica coffee originated, and, in the present day, is commonly grown as a shade crop. We first examined the relative contribution of in-situ field measurements vs. GIS-derived estimates of vegetation and topographic features in explaining in-situ microclimate. Second, we used a statistical downscaling approach to obtain past and future microclimate maps at 30-meter spatial resolution for the part of the landscape that is covered by trees. Predictive models using in-situ variables performed equal to models with GIS variables, indicating that remote sensing data might substitute for in-situ field measurements. Vegetation and topographic features were both important in explaining microclimatic variation. Our spatiotemporal projections of the microclimate indicate that coffee farming might have to relocate to higher altitudes due to increasing temperatures, that vegetation might buffer the macroclimate at middle altitudes to some extent, and that decreasing trends in relative humidity at the beginning of the wet season might become problematic for coffee production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that we can rely on remote sensing data to create microclimate maps in landscapes where in-situ field measurements are challenging, and we suggest how these microclimate projections can be used as a tool to promote climate-resilient agriculture at the local and landscape levels.

TI  - The contribution of remote sensing and input feature selection for groundwater level prediction using LSTM neural networks in the Oum Er-Rbia Basin, Morocco
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The planning and management of groundwater in the absence of in situ climate data is a delicate task, particularly in arid regions where this resource is crucial for drinking water supplies and irrigation. Here the motivation is to evaluate the role of remote sensing data and Input feature selection method in the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting groundwater levels of five wells located in different hydrogeological contexts across the Oum Er-Rbia Basin (OER) in Morocco: irrigated plain, floodplain and low plateau area. As input descriptive variable, four remote sensing variables were used: the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERGE) Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation, Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), MODIS land surface temperature (LST), and MODIS evapotranspiration. Three LSTM models were developed, rigorously analyzed and compared. The LSTM-XGB-GS model, was optimized using the GridsearchCV method, and uses a single remote sensing variable identified by the input feature selection method XGBoost. Another optimized LSTM model was also constructed, but uses the four remote sensing variables as input (LSTM-GS). Additionally, a standalone LSTM model was established and also incorporating the four variables as inputs. Scatter plots, violin plots, Taylor diagram and three evaluation indices were used to verify the performance of the three models. The overall result showed that the LSTM-XGB-GS model was the most successful, consistently outperforming both the LSTM-GS model and the standalone LSTM model. Its remarkable accuracy is reflected in high R2 values (0.95 to 0.99 during training, 0.72 to 0.99 during testing) and the lowest RMSE values (0.03 to 0.68 m during training, 0.02 to 0.58 m during testing) and MAE values (0.02 to 0.66 m during training, 0.02 to 0.58 m during testing). The LSTM-XGB-GS model reveals how hydrodynamics, climate, and land-use influence groundwater predictions, emphasizing correlations like irrigated land-temperature link and floodplain-NDVI-evapotranspiration interaction for improved predictions. Finally, this study demonstrates the great support that remote sensing data can provide for groundwater prediction using ANN models in conditions where in situ data are lacking.

TI  - Unraveling the intricate relationship: Influence of microbiome on the host immune system in carcinogenesis.
T2  - Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is an outcome of various disrupted or dysregulated metabolic processes like apoptosis, growth, and self-cell transformation. Human anatomy harbors trillions of microbes, and these microbes actively influence all kinds of human metabolic activities, including the human immune response. The immune system which inherently acts as a sentinel against microbes, curiously tolerates and even maintains a distinct normal microflora in our body. This emphasizes the evolutionarily significant role of microbiota in shaping our adaptive immune system and even potentiating its function in chronic ailments like cancers. Microbes interact with the host immune cells and play a part in cancer progression or regression by modulating immune cells, producing immunosuppressants, virulence factors, and genotoxins.RECENT FINDINGS: An expanding plethora of studies suggest and support the evidence of microbiome impacting cancer etiology. Several studies also indicate that the microbiome can supplement various cancer therapies, increasing their efficacy. The present review discusses the relationship between bacterial and viral microbiota with cancer, discussing different carcinogenic mechanisms influenced by prokaryotes with special emphasis on their immunomodulatory axis. It also elucidates the potential of the microbiome in transforming the efficacy of immunotherapeutic treatments.CONCLUSION: This review offers a thorough overview of the complex interaction between the human immune system and the microbiome and its impact on the development of cancer. The microbiome affects the immune responses as well as progression of tumor transformation, hence microbiome-based therapies can vastly improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies. Individual variations of the microbiome and its dynamic variability in every individual impacts the immune modulation and cancer progression. Therefore, further research is required to understand these underlying processes in detail, so as to design better microbiome-immune system axis in the treatment of cancer.

TI  - Wild ungulates as sentinels of flaviviruses and tick-borne zoonotic pathogen circulation: an Italian perspective
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundVector-borne zoonotic diseases are a concerning issue in Europe. Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) have been reported in several countries with a large impact on public health; other emerging pathogens, such as Rickettsiales, and mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been increasingly reported. All these pathogens are linked to wild ungulates playing roles as tick feeders, spreaders, and sentinels for pathogen circulation. This study evaluated the prevalence of TBEV, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Coxiella spp. by biomolecular screening of blood samples and ticks collected from wild ungulates. Ungulates were also screened by ELISA and virus neutralization tests for flaviviral antibody detection.ResultsA total of 274 blood samples were collected from several wild ungulate species, as well as 406 Ixodes ricinus, which were feeding on them. Blood samples tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. (1.1%; 0-2.3%) and Rickettsia spp. (1.1%; 0-2.3%) and showed an overall flaviviral seroprevalence of 30.6% (22.1-39.2%): 26.1% (17.9-34.3%) for TBEV, 3.6% (0.1-7.1%) for Usutu virus and 0.9% (0-2.7%) for West Nile virus. Ticks were pooled when possible and yielded 331 tick samples that tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. (8.8%; 5.8-11.8%), Rickettsia spp. (26.6%; 21.8-31.2%) and Neoehrlichia mikurensis (1.2%; 0-2.4%). TBEV and Coxiella spp. were not detected in either blood or tick samples.ConclusionsThis research highlighted a high prevalence of several tick-borne zoonotic pathogens and high seroprevalence for flaviviruses in both hilly and alpine areas. For the first time, an alpine chamois tested positive for anti-TBEV antibodies. Ungulate species are of particular interest due to their sentinel role in flavivirus circulation and their indirect role in tick-borne diseases and maintenance as Ixodes feeders and spreaders.

TI  - Comparing Photovoltaic Power Prediction: Ground-Based Measurements vs. Satellite Data Using an ANN Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate prediction of photovoltaic (PV) power output is crucial for assessing the feasibility of early-stage projects in relation to specific site weather conditions. While various mathematical models have been used in the past for PV power prediction, most of them only consider irradiance and ambient temperature, neglecting other important meteorological parameters. In this article, a 1-year dataset from a high-precision meteorological station at the Green Energy Research facility is utilized, along with electrical parameters from a polycrystalline silicon c-Si PV module exposed during the study period, to forecast PV power. In addition, the accuracy of using satellite data for PV power forecasting is investigated, considering the growing trend of its utilization in recent research. Regression techniques, such as linear regression with interaction, tree regression, Gaussian process regression, ensemble learning for regression, response surface methodology, SVM cubic, and artificial neural network (ANN), are employed for PV power prediction, using both ground measurement data and satellite data. Comparatively lower accuracies are observed when using satellite data across all regression methods, in contrast to the higher accuracies achieved with ground-based measurements. Notably, the Gaussian process regression method demonstrates high accuracy (R-2 = 0.25 for satellite data and R-2 = 0.94 for ground-based data). Furthermore, the ANN approach further enhances the accuracy of PV power forecasting, yielding R-2 = 0.42 for satellite data and R-2 = 0.96 for ground-based data. These findings emphasize the need for caution when relying on satellite data for PV power forecasting, even when employing advanced ANN approaches. It underscores the importance of considering ground-based measurements for more reliable and accurate predictions.

TI  - The impact of clinical education on knowledge and attitudes towards brain death among Polish medical students - a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding brain death is essential for progress in organ transplantation; however, it remains a challenging ethical matter. In 2019, Poland revised its legislation on brain death to align with international standards. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and worldview concerning brain death among Polish medical students, categorised according to their stage of education.Methods An online questionnaire was administered to 169 medical students from four Polish medical universities. The participants were divided into preclinical (n = 94) and clinical (n = 75) groups. The questionnaire consisted of two parts, with the first part comprising 13 questions focusing on knowledge about brain death and the process of its determination. The second part contained six questions related to the participants' worldview regarding brain death, particularly concerning organ transplantation.Results The average score obtained by the respondents was 7.53 (+/- 2.35; min. 1, max. 13) in knowledge checking part of the developed questionnaire (maximal score:13). Students in the clinical stage of their education achieved significantly higher scores compared to preclinical students (mean 8.84; +/- 1.89 vs mean 6.49; +/- 2.15; p < 0.001). Significant correlations were found between the results of the knowledge part of the questionnaire and responses to worldview questions.Conclusions The stage of education influenced the knowledge of brain death among medical students, although the overall test scores were unsatisfactory. Higher test scores were associated with worldview responses indicating compliance with the current legislation in Poland and evidence-based medicine.

TI  - Effects of prophylactic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).
T2  - Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: RBC alloimmunization remains a significant problem for many patients with SCD. To reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide limited or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need chronic transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with SCD.METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients with SCD transfused with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e, K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had antibodies documented before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped and molecular typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or a positive direct antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected antibodies to the Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic phenotype was Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant alleles.RESULTS: During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83 (87.4%) were not. Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients.CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.

TI  - Observed decreasing trend in the upper-tropospheric cloud top temperature
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining the response of cloud top temperature (CTT) to global warming correctly is crucial for understanding the current and future energy budget of the climate system. For a given cloud fraction, colder CTT implies more longwave radiation being capped within the Earth-atmosphere system, consequently heating it. Current climate models predict an almost fixed CTT for upper-tropospheric clouds as the climate is expected to warm up during the 21st century, as explained by the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis. However, our analysis, based on the last 19 years of satellite observations (12.2002-11.2021), reveals a significant decreasing trend in upper-tropospheric CTT with almost no change in the corresponding cloud fraction. This cooling rate is several times larger than the observed surface warming rate. This finding suggests a missing heating component by upper-tropospheric clouds in current climate predictions.

TI  - Identification of geothermal potential based on land surface temperature derived from remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of thermal infrared remote sensing technology and the maturation of remote sensing inversion algorithms based on surface temperatures, identifying high-temperature anomalous areas by inverting surface temperatures has become an crucial approach to finding geothermal potential areas. The eastern region of Longyang in western Yunnan Province is renowned for geothermal resources, though the distribution area of geothermal potential remains unknown. Therefore, this study used Landsat-8 TIRS data and four surface temperature inversion algorithms, namely, mono-window algorithm, single-channel algorithm, Du split window algorithm (SWD), and Jimenez-Munoz split window algorithm (SWJ), to explore the astern region of Longyang. The inversion results were compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Surface Temperature (MODIS LST) results for analysis and cross-validation to select the optimal algorithm. A multi-view remote sensing temperature anomaly information extraction method was adopted. Moreover, the overall threshold method, the fracture structure buffer method, and the joint analysis of diurnal temporal data were combined for the reduction of the thermal anomaly area as well as for comprehensively defining the geothermal prospective area in the study area. The results demonstrated that the mono-window algorithm had the highest accuracy with a Pearson coefficient of 0.77, which is more suitable for the surface temperature inversion in Longyang area. Furthermore, three geothermal anomalies (A, B, and C) were identified in the study area, with larger thermal anomaly in A and C, but a smaller one in B. All three areas had hot spring points verified, with A and C exhibiting more significant development potential. The research results provide a reliable methodological basis for the development of geothermal resources in the region.

TI  - Long-term precipitation prediction in different climate divisions of California using remotely sensed data and machine learning
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study presented a novel paradigm for forecasting 12-step-ahead monthly precipitation at 126 California gauge stations. First, the satellite-based precipitation time series from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), TerraClimate, ECMWF Reanalysis V5 (ERA5), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) products were bias-corrected using historical precipitation data. Four methods were tested, and quantile mapping (QM) was the best. After pre-processing data, 19 machine-learning models were developed. random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, and K-nearest-neighbours were chosen as the best models based on Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) measurement. After hyperparameter adjustment, the Bayesian back-propagation regularization algorithm fused the results. The superior models' predictions were considered inputs, and the target's initial step was labeled. The next 11 steps at each station followed this approach, and the fusion models accurately predicted all steps. The 12th step's average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), correlation coefficient (R) were 0.937, 52.136, 0.880, and 0.869, respectively, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness at high forecasting horizons to help policymakers manage water resources.

TI  - Infestation rates of lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus on Atlantic salmon in fixed and towed sentinel cages
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea lice are a key limitation to sustainable salmon aquaculture, and effective monitoring strategies are critical for the management of these parasites. Sentinel cages are an established means of assessing infestation pressure at fixed locations, but as smolts move through systems they will be exposed to varying lice densities. As a means of assessing infestation pressure along trajectories, we describe the development and application of towed sentinel cages (TSCs) in a Scottish sea loch containing salmonid aquaculture. Trial deployments took place over 3 yr (2016-2018), and levels of sea lice infestation were compared between methodologies. Oceanographic data was collected alongside TSCs to put the results into the environmental context that smolts and sea lice experienced during the tows. The sea lice infestation rates found from TSCs were comparable to those on contemporaneously deployed fixed sentinel cages. Thus, due to their practicability and consistency with other surveillance methods, TSCs could be used to improve the assessment of exposure risk along wild salmonid smolt migration trajectories, where these are known.

TI  - Oncology hospitalist impact on hospice utilization.
T2  - Cancer
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unplanned hospitalizations among patients with advanced cancer are often sentinel events prompting goals of care discussions and hospice transitions. Late referrals to hospice, especially those at the end of life, are associated with decreased quality of life and higher total health care costs. Inpatient management of patients with solid tumor malignancies is increasingly shifting from oncologists to oncology hospitalists. However, little is known about the impact of oncology hospitalists on the timing of transition to hospice.OBJECTIVE: To compare hospice discharge rate and time to hospice discharge on an inpatient oncology service led by internal medicine-trained hospitalists and a service led by oncologists.METHODS: At Smilow Cancer Hospital, internal medicine-trained hospitalists were integrated into one of two inpatient medical oncology services allowing comparison between the new, hospitalist-led service (HS) and the traditional, oncologist-led service (TS). Discharges from July 26, 2021, through January 31, 2022, were identified from the electronic medical record. The odds ratio for discharge disposition by team was calculated by logistic regression using a multinomial distribution. Adjusted length of stay before discharge was assessed using multivariable linear regression.RESULTS: The HS discharged 47/400 (11.8%) patients to inpatient hospice, whereas the TS service discharged 18/313 (5.8%), yielding an adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 (95% CI, 1.07-3.51; p=.03). Adjusted average length of stay before inpatient hospice disposition was 6.83days (95% CI, 4.22-11.06) for the HS and 16.29days (95% CI, 7.73-34.29) for the TS (p=.003).CONCLUSIONS: Oncology hospitalists improve hospice utilization and time to inpatient hospice referral on an inpatient medical oncology service.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Patients with advanced cancer are often admitted to the hospital near the end of life. These patients generally have a poor chance of long-term survival and may prefer comfort-focused care with hospice. In this study, oncology hospitalists discharged a higher proportion of patients to inpatient hospice with less time spent in the hospital before discharge.

TI  - Evaluation of Axilla With Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (Using Methylene-Blue) and Reverse Axillary Mapping (Using Fluorescein) to Validate Optimum and Safe Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has replaced routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in node negative axillae. In cases where the axilla needs to be dissected, one must dissect below the uppermost intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) to avoid damaging arm lymphatics. Methods One milliliter of methylene blue dye was injected around the areola. Fluorescein dye (1 ml) was injected into the upper arm. After SLNB and ALND, the axilla was visualized under blue light. The location of fluorescent lymphatics was mapped with respect to the uppermost ICBN. Results The identification rate of sentinel lymph nodes and arm lymphatics was 100%. Arm lymphatics were above ICBN in 86.7%. The false negative rate of SLNB was 13%, with sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions SLNB using the single-dye technique has results comparable to dual agent studies that utilize blue dye and radioactive colloid. The uppermost ICBN could define the superior limit of axillary dissection.

TI  - Linking coastal environmental and health observations for human wellbeing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas have long been attractive places to live, work, and recreate and remain so even in the face of growing threats from global environmental change. At any moment, a significant portion of the human population is exposed to both positive and negative health effects associated with coastal locations. Some locations may be "hotspots" of concern for human health due to ongoing climatic and other changes, accentuating the need for better understanding of coastal environment-human health linkages. This paper describes how environmental and health data could be combined to create a coastal environmental and human health observing system. While largely based on information from the US and Europe, the concept should be relevant to almost any coastal area. If implemented, a coastal health observing system would connect a variety of human health data and environmental observations for individuals and communities, and where possible cohorts. Health data would be derived from questionnaires and other personal sources, clinical examinations, electronic health records, wearable devices, and syndromic surveillance, plus information on vulnerability and health-relevant community characteristics, and social media observations. Environmental data sources would include weather and climate, beach and coastal conditions, sentinel species, occurrences of harmful organisms and substances, seafood safety advisories, and distribution, proximity, and characteristics of health-promoting green and blue spaces. Where available, information on supporting resources could be added. Establishment of a linked network of coastal health observatories could provide powerful tools for understanding the positive and negative health effects of coastal living, lead to better health protections and enhanced wellbeing, and provide significant benefits to coastal residents, including the historically disadvantaged, as well as the military, hospitals and emergency departments, academic medical, public health, and environmental health programs, and others. Early networks could provide best practices and lessons learned to assist later entries.

TI  - Preliminary evidence of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> parasitism in Southeast England
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Controlling the invasive fruit pest, Drosophila suzukii, relies on a range of complimentary pest management approaches. However, increasing external costs (e.g., labour, exclusion mesh and fuel), are limiting the ability to control the pest via non-chemical means. Extant UK parasitoids could be exploited for the suppression of D. suzukii populations, but there is currently a lack of knowledge of the UK species utilising D. suzukii as a host or their lifecycle requirements. Between 2017 and 2020, we identified parasitoids developing in D. suzukii, in Southeast England.Sentinel traps, containing laboratory reared D. suzukii larvae/pupae in fruit, were deployed within the vicinity of commercial crops and semi-natural areas. Six generalist parasitoid species were recovered from D. suzukii sentinel traps. These included two species of larval parasitoids (Leptopilina heterotoma Thomson (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) and Asobara tabida (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and four pupal parasitoids (Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), Spalangia erythromera (Forster) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), Trichopria modesta (Ratzeburg, 1848) and T. prema Nixon (both Hymenoptera: Diapriidae)).The performance of the first four species as D. suzukii parasitoids was further tested in the laboratory and then in the field to assess rates of parasitism. Pachycrepoideus vindemiae was the most abundant species recovered from field collections and had in increasing rate of population rate in the laboratory. Other species were not successful at parasitising D. suzukii. In the field, adult D. suzukii emergence from sentinel traps was reduced by similar to 21% where parasitoids could access D. suzukii larvae and pupae.Parasitoids of D. suzukii are understudied in the UK, and this research indicates where future efforts could be made in understanding the interaction between host and parasitoid and the opportunities to exploit extant parasitoids for the control of D. suzukii. We also evaluate the prospects for classical and augmented control and discuss how they may fit with current regional integrated pest management options.

TI  - Reliability of vegetation resilience estimates depends on biomass density
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Concerns have been raised that the resilience of vegetated ecosystems may be negatively impacted by ongoing anthropogenic climate and land-use change at the global scale. Several recent studies present global vegetation resilience trends based on satellite data using diverse methodological set-ups. Here, upon a systematic comparison of data sets, spatial and temporal pre-processing, and resilience estimation methods, we propose a methodology that avoids different biases present in previous results. Nevertheless, we find that resilience estimation using optical satellite vegetation data is broadly problematic in dense tropical and high-latitude boreal forests, regardless of the vegetation index chosen. However, for wide parts of the mid-latitudes-especially with low biomass density-resilience can be reliably estimated using several optical vegetation indices. We infer a spatially consistent global pattern of resilience gain and loss across vegetation indices, with more regions facing declining resilience, especially in Africa, Australia and central Asia.A systematic comparison of optical satellite data shows that vegetation resilience is broadly declining in many areas, despite the unreliability of resilience estimates in high biomass regions.

TI  - An evaluation of the response of vegetation greenness, moisture, fluorescence, and temperature-based remote sensing indicators to drought stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought seriously threatens the food and ecological security of many countries in the world. Currently, various remote sensing indicators of vegetation status have been utilized in drought monitoring and warning. This study classified them into four types according to the biophysical characteristics of vegetation, i.e., temperature, moisture, fluorescence, and greenness-based indicators. However, their responses to drought stress are still less clear at present, which is not conducive to remote sensing of drought. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of their responses to drought was conducted in this study. MODIS spectral reflectance and land surface temperature products were used to obtain temperature, moisture, and greenness-based indicators, while five solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence datasets were used to obtain fluorescence-based indicators. Soil moisture anomaly, Standardized Precipitation Index, and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index calculated by reanalysis and in-situ meteorological data were employed to indicate drought stress. The Chinese mainland was selected as the study area and the study period covers the year from 2000 to 2020 with months from May to September, the vegetation growing period. Evaluation results demonstrated that: 1) The responses of all indicators to drought stress were the most sensitive in arid areas, the second in transitional areas, and the last in humid areas; Monitoring or evaluation of drought with remote sensing vegetation indicators was more suitable for arid and transitional areas. 2) Among all indicators, the temperature-based indicator was found to be the most sensitive, the moisture-based indicator was in the second, the fluorescence-based and greenness-based indicators were in the third where the former presented a little more sensitive than the latter. 3) Vegetation temperature and moisture-based indicators should be integrated in the comprehensive indexes of drought rather than only integrate vegetation greenness-based indicators. Soil background effect in the remotely sensed vegetation indicators can be reduced with the feature space model.

TI  - Structural complexity biases vegetation greenness measures
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Vegetation 'greenness' characterized by spectral vegetation indices (VIs) is an integrative measure of vegetation leaf abundance, biochemical properties and pigment composition. Surprisingly, satellite observations reveal that several major VIs over the US Corn Belt are higher than those over the Amazon rainforest, despite the forests having a greater leaf area. This contradicting pattern underscores the pressing need to understand the underlying drivers and their impacts to prevent misinterpretations. Here we show that macroscale shadows cast by complex forest structures result in lower greenness measures compared with those cast by structurally simple and homogeneous crops. The shadow-induced contradictory pattern of VIs is inevitable because most Earth-observing satellites do not view the Earth in the solar direction and thus view shadows due to the sun-sensor geometry. The shadow impacts have important implications for the interpretation of VIs and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence as measures of global vegetation changes. For instance, a land-conversion process from forests to crops over the Amazon shows notable increases in VIs despite a decrease in leaf area. Our findings highlight the importance of considering shadow impacts to accurately interpret remotely sensed VIs and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence for assessing global vegetation and its changes.Remote sensing often detects higher vegetation greenness for croplands than for forests, despite forests having a greater leaf area. This study shows that this is an artefact of shadows caused by forest structures and explores how to correct for this when interpreting global vegetation change data.

T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: The past three decades have seen an unprecedented shift towards treatment de-escalation in surgical therapy of breast cancer.Summary: Radical mastectomy has been replaced by breast-conserving and oncoplastic approaches in most patients, and full axillary lymph node dissection by less radical staging procedures, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy and targeted axillary dissection. Further, attempts have been made to spare healthy tissue while increasing the probability of removing the tumor with clear margins, thus improving cosmetic results and minimizing the risk of local recurrence. In this context, modern probe-guided localization techniques have been introduced to guide surgical excision. This progress was accompanied by the development of targeted systemic therapies. At the same time, radiotherapy for breast cancer has undergone significant changes. The use of hypofractionation has decreased the typical length of a treatment course from 5-6 weeks to 1-3 weeks. Partial breast irradiation is now a valid option for de-escalation in patients with low-risk features. Axillary radiotherapy achieves similar recurrence rates and decreases the risk of lymphedema in patients with limited sentinel node involvement.Key messages: Taken together, these advances are important steps towards individualization of locoregional management strategies. This highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches for de-escalation of locoregional therapies.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural residue burning have increased by 75 % since 2011 across India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying crop residue burning across India is imperative, owing to its adverse impacts on public health, the environment, and agricultural productivity. Specific information about the extent and characteristics of agricultural crop burning can verify the emission potential of agricultural systems and thereby facilitate targeted dissemination of agricultural innovations and support policymakers in mitigating the harmful effects. With a focus on district-level burning estimates, our study provides a comprehensive seasonal analysis of agricultural burning in India, including burned area, dry matter burned, and gaseous emissions for seven major crops from 2011 to 2020. To quantify the actual residues burned, we developed a remote sensing-based approach that incorporates the monitoring of agricultural burned area to quantify the actual residues burned. Including this satellite measure of the burned area greatly improves emissions estimates and minimizes error compared to typical approaches, which instead use an assumed fraction of total residues that are burned for each crop type. We estimated that emissions have increased by approximately 75 % for CO and Greenhouse gasses - CO2, CH4 and N2O - from 2011 to 2020. Total CO(2)e emissions increased from similar to 19,340 Gg.yr(-1) in 2011 to similar to 33,834 Gg.yr(-1) in 2020. Most emissions occurred during end of the Kharif season, followed by Rabi, caused by the burning of rice and wheat residues. Among the Indian states, Punjab has the highest burning activity, with 27 % (2.0 million hectares) of its total cultivated area burned in 2020. Interestingly, Madhya Pradesh has emerged as the second-largest contributor, accounting for 30 % of the total burned area across India in 2020. Our study demonstrates how satellite data can be used to map agricultural residue burning at scale, and this information can provide crucial insights for policy framing, targeting, and interventions to manage agricultural residues without compromising air quality and climate.

T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the present research, the presence of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) on the surface of the San Jose Dam located in the city of San Luis Potosi, S.L.P, Mexico, was monitored and mapped. The monitoring was conducted for 2 years (2018-2020) with remote sensing data from OLI Landsat 8 sensors, based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results demonstrated the capability and accuracy of this method, where it was observed that the aboveground cover area, proliferation, and distribution of water hyacinth are influenced by climatic and anthropogenic factors during the four seasons of the year. As part of a sustainable environmental control of this invasive species, the use of water hyacinth (WH) root (RO), stem (ST), and leaf (LE) components as adsorbent material for Pb(II) present in aqueous solution was proposed. The maximum adsorption capacity was observed at pH 5 and 25 °C and was 107.3, 136.8, and 120.8 mg g-1 for RO, ST, and LE, respectively. The physicochemical characterization of WH consisted of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 physisorption, infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), charge distribution, and zero charge point (pHPZC). Due to the chemical nature of WH, several Pb(II) adsorption mechanisms were proposed such as electrostatic attractions, ion exchange, microprecipitation, and pi-cation.

AB  - ObjectiveTo explore the experiences of acculturation into secular Swedish society of former members of cults, with particular focus on mental health, needs and resources.DesignQualitative method using the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) from the DSM-5 as an interview guide. Analysis of participants' experiences of acculturation through systematic text condensation.ParticipantsEleven Swedish former members of ideological or religion-based cults.SettingSwedish mainstream, secular society.ResultsFormer cult members experience an 'in-between time' in the period after leaving the cult and find themselves in a confusing, chaotic state. They describe having lived in an honor culture where acts of violence were normalized. In the cult, they felt disconnected from themselves, and post-cult they try to regain access to their own values and feelings as well as create new bonds with family members and friends outside the cult. They find it hard to talk about their cult background and find relief in communicating with other former cult members. In their post-cult life, they eventually start seeing the world in a brighter, more hopeful way than before. However, they are also at risk of re-experiencing cult-related traumatic events and of new traumatic experiences within the post-cult acculturation process, and of persistent psychological distress.ConclusionFormer cult members face a challenging acculturation process, having lost a functioning worldview upon leaving the cult but not yet gained another to take its place. While the in-between time is often transient, they may need support from the healthcare system, especially regarding mental health concerns, while establishing themselves into mainstream society.

TI  - Assessment of landcover impacts on the groundwater quality using hydrogeochemical and geospatial techniques.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Groundwater quality is influenced by urbanization and land use land cover (LULC) changes. This study investigated their impact on groundwater quality in Quetta City, Pakistan, from 2015 to 2021. About 58 groundwater samples from monitoring wells were analyzed using hydrogeochemical and statistical methods. The water quality index (WQI), Wilcox, USSL, and various agricultural indices were employed to assess water quality trends. LULC analysis and NDVI using Sentinel-2 imagery revealed increased urban and agricultural areas and decreased barren land. Rapid urbanization was evident, with the buildup class expanding by 7.50% during this period. NDVI findings emphasized monitoring vegetation health and water quality for environmental assessments. The groundwater in Quetta was primarily classified as Cl-Ca·Mg, Cl-Ca, and Cl-Na according to the Piper diagram, with water-rock interactions and rock weathering evident. Most groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation according to the Wilcox and USSL diagrams. The WQI demonstrated overall safety for human consumption, but declining WQI values in northern parts due to urbanization are concerning. The results also revealed a moderate positive relationship between landcover classes and WQI values. It can be concluded that urbanization and excessive use of pesticides contributed to declining agricultural land quality. The spatial overlay of agricultural indices with landcover class suggested that barren land was most suitable, followed by build-up and agriculture were suitable for drinking and agriculture purposes. Moreover, agricultural indices moderately declined due to excessive fertilizers and pesticides in the agriculture landcover class. Thus, effective water resource management is crucial to address challenges. This comprehensive study serves as a baseline for future research and recommends larger-scale studies to implement efficient management strategies, urbanization planning, and safe irrigation and drinking water practices to prevent groundwater pollution.

AB  - In this research, first, nanoporous zeolite-NaY was functionalized with 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane (organic linker) and then N-methylimidazole group. Then magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) under ultrasonic energy conditions on the surface and internal pores of zeolite-Y (1-MeIm IL@ZY-Fe3O4) were formed. The identification, confirmation of the structure and morphology of the prepared magnetic nanohybrid was done by using FTIR, FESEM, TEM, EDX, TGA, XRD, VSM and BET instrumental techniques. Next, its catalytic performance in the synthesis of a number of 3-benzimidazolyl (or benzothiazolyl)-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives was investigated through the three-component condensation reaction of various aromatic aldehydes, 2-aminobenzimidazole or 2-aminobenzothiazole, and thioglycolic acid in EtOH at room temperature. The results of the experiments show that the presence of magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) inside the pores of zeolite functionalized with ionic liquid not only causes easy and quick separation of the nanocatalyst by an external magnetic field but also can be effective in catalyzing the reaction as a Lewis acid.

AB  - This paper investigated how the meta-heuristic models can be used to facilitate the use of satellite data and estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) images. Focusing on estimating daily ET directly from received images of the electromagnetic bands of Landsat 8 satellite utilizing metaheuristic models, authors used daily ET images estimated by the SEBAL algorithm to calibrate and verify these models. The results of this research showed that the ANN model with DC and RMSE of 0.98 and 0.09025 mm/day, respectively, is more accurate compared to the ACO (with DC = 0.65 and RMSE = 1.45 mm/day) and PSO (with DC = 0.23 and RMSE = 1.60 mm/day) models in the verification stage in estimating daily ET images. The ACO model compared to the PSO model is more accurate in estimating ET images with DC of 0.65 and 0.23 in the verification step, respectively. While removing half of the training data, the accuracy of the PSO model surpasses the ACO model with DC of 0.0.85 and 0.80, respectively. Also, the ANN model is more accurate than the other two models in estimating ET, both when considering all the data and half of the training data (with DC = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.09 mm/day).

T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study examines potential changes in the summer rainy season of a watershed, using a cumulative rainy deficit curve to define the onset and demise of the rainy season. Historical daily rainfall data from 41 gauge stations within the Xiang River Basin in 1960-2017 were analyzed. Results indicate that the climatology of the onset date is Julian day 72 and the climatology of the demise date is Julian day 236. There is, however, a difference between the two segments, e.g., 1960-1989 and 1990-2017. The median rainy season duration in 1990-2017 is 138 days. This is larger than that of 1960-1989, which is 120 days. There is a statistically significant correlation between the onset date of the rainy season and the duration of the rainy season. Daily soil moisture estimates were derived from satellite remote sensing data. The averaged soil moisture during the rainy season is much higher than that of the non-rainy season. To examine the difference in quick flow between rainy and non-rainy season, baseflow separation was applied to daily streamflow time series. Result reveals the median of weekly quick flow in rainy season is 1316 cms, which is 5.7 times that of the weekly quick flow in non-rainy season. Different mechanisms that drive spring and summer rainfall, as well as potential use of the results in water management, are discussed.

TI  - A reproducible and replicable approach for harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and cloud shadows significantly impact optical remote sensing. Combining images from different sources can help to obtain more frequent time series of the Earth's surface. Nevertheless, sensor differences must be accounted for and treated before combining images from multiple sensors. Even after geometric correction, inter-calibration, and bandpass, disparities in image measurements can persist. One potential factor contributing to this phenomenon is directional effects. Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrections have emerged as an optional processing method to soften differences in surface reflectance (SR) measurements, where the c-factor is one of the available options for this task. The c-factor efficiency is well-proven for medium spatial resolution products. However, its use should be restricted to images from sensors with a narrow view since it causes subtle changes in the processed images. There are currently a limited number of open tools for users to independently process their images. Here, we implemented the required tools to generate a Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Surface Reflectance (NBAR) product through the c-factor approach, and we evaluated them for a study area using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images. Several comparisons were conducted to verify the SR and NBAR differences. Initially, a single-sensor approach was adopted and later a multi-source approach. Notably, NBAR products exhibit fewer disparities compared to SR products (prior to BRDF corrections). The results reinforce that the c-factor can be used to improve time series compatibility and, most importantly, provide the tools to allow users to generate the NBAR products themselves.

TI  - Do environmental disasters affect human capital? The threat of forest fires
T2  - ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the threat of forest fires is prevalent across the globe, there exists limited empirical evidence on how such environmental disasters influence access and equity in educational outcomes through economic channels. In this article, I combine satellite data on fire radiative power with an individual-level panel dataset to estimate the short-term and long-term impact of forest fires on human capital in rural Nepal. Using a fixed effects panel regression approach, I find that a one standard deviation increase in fire radiative power from last year's forest fires is associated with a 1.06 percentage point decline in the likelihood of completing middle school. Results indicate that a one standard deviation increase in fire radiative power from fires 6-10 years ago leads to a 6.34 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of completing middle school, implying that the impact of environmental shocks on educational outcomes can be larger in the long run. Subsequent analysis indicates that a yearly lagged fire radiative power exacerbates disparities in middle school completion between individuals that attend government schools and those that attend private schools. While the effects of fires on self-reported measures of health outcomes and absenteeism in school are statistically insignificant, individuals report an increase in worry about inadequate food and scholarships in response to a one standard deviation increase in fire radiative power from last year's forest fires. These findings support the hypothesis that natural disasters lead to economic damage and food insecurity that, in turn, result in disinvestment in school supplies, higher grade repetition and lower likelihood of middle school completion in the developing world.

T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - At active volcanoes recurring eruptive events, erosive processes and collapses modify the edifice morphology and impact monitoring and hazard mitigation. At Etna volcano (Italy) between February and October 2021, 57 paroxysmal events occurred from the South-East Crater (SEC), which is currently its most active summit crater. Strombolian activity and high lava fountains (up to 4 km) fed lava flows towards the east, south and south-west, and caused fallout of ballistics (greater than 1 m in diameter) within 1-2 km from the SEC. The impacted area does not include permanent infrastructure, but it is visited by thousands of tourists. Hence, we rapidly mapped each lava flow before deposits became covered by the next event, for hazard mitigation. The high frequency of the SEC paroxysms necessitated integration of data from three remote sensing platforms with different spatial resolutions. Satellite (Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument, PlanetScope, Skysat and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager) and drone images (visible and thermal) were processed and integrated to extract digital surface models and orthomosaics. Thermal images acquired by a permanent network of cameras of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia were orthorectified using the latest available digital surface model. This multi-sensor analysis allowed compilation of a geodatabase reporting the main geometrical parameters for each lava flow. A posteriori analysis allowed quantification of bulk volumes for the lava flows and the SEC changes and of the dense rock equivalent volume of erupted magma. The analysis of drone-derived digital surface models enabled assessment of the ballistics' distribution. The developed methodology enabled rapidly and accurate characterisation of frequently occurring effusive events for near real-time risk assessment and hazard communication.

TI  - A Larger 'We'; Identity, Spirituality and Social Change in Pluralistic Societies
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Over the last decade, in the United States in particular, there has been an increasingly acute awareness of historic and ongoing social, racial, gender, and other disparities, and the frequent deployment of categories (for example BIPOC, LGBTQQIA2SP+, Latinx) and concepts (for example 'cultural appropriation', 'white privilege', 'intersectionality') that centre thinking and conversations around various axes of difference. For some critics, the hyper-focus on questions of difference is dismissed as 'wokeness', and its seeming ascendency across elite spaces-academic, cultural, and corporate-is viewed with alarm, particularly insofar as its advocates are seen to champion a type of illiberalism. Others have raised concerns that hyper-identitarianism may diminish possibilities for worker and class solidarity, or that it represents only an attenuated form of social justice. This article adds to this conversation by asking whether the energetic foregrounding of difference typical of 'wokeness' does not also pose a spiritual conundrum. To explore this question, it outlines what is here called the 'connective worldview', which draws from deep ecology, spiritual practices, and mystical insights common to many religious traditions to understand humans and their identities as interdependent, ephemeral and, ultimately, subject to transcendence. The article contrasts this with the 'particularistic worldview', which tends to set both individual and group identities in sharp relief, emphasizing the need to honour and manage difference. It argues that an 'integrated' perspective-one that strikes a balance between both world-views-will be key for activists looking to foment social change while forging a larger 'we' in diverse, pluralistic societies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this paper, we propose a method for retrieving salinity in the Sea of Azov. The method is based on combining in situ and remote sensing measurements. The operational results of the salinity reconstruction are necessary for the assimilation of thermohaline fields, which is used to set initial conditions to the hydrodynamic model and achieve higher accuracy of its results. The proposed method consists of implementing a general regression between historical in situ measurements and L2 MODIS optical measurements. We used properly calibrated and validated satellite data taken from open internet services. The results show different approaches to obtain the linear regression in spring and summer. Particular emphasis is made on analysing the precision of the reconstructed salinity fields relative to in situ measurements. These estimates are based on the comparison of reconstructed salinity with the long-term seasonal trends on in situ data for the periods of 1990-2018 and 2000-2018. The final reconstructed salinity fields are computed from linear regressions for spring and summer. These reconstructed fields are stored as data sets on a regular grid of the Sea of Azov and they are ready for visualization and use as input data for the ocean circulation models.

In seven (out of eight) states/territories in Australia, operational curing data are derived from the MapVictoria satellite model. From 2013 to 2023, MapVictoria data have been calculated using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra satellite. Terra has exceeded its designed mission lifetime, but the continuation of satellite curing data is crucial for fire agencies to continue fire danger calculations.AimsThe aim of this study was to adjust the MapVictoria model so it could be calculated using a newer satellite sensor system: Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS).MethodsData from the VIIRS bands were adjusted to match those of MODIS using timeseries from 2013 to 2020. The adjusted VIIRS bands were used to derive a VIIRS curing model: 'viirs-mvcuring'.Key resultsThe viirs-mvcuring model exhibited lower curing estimates than MODIS by up to 2.6% in Northern sites and 1.4% in Southern sites and exhibited lower curing estimates than ground-based curing by 0.1% in Northern sites and 3.5% in Southern sites.ConclusionsThe development of the viirs-mvcuring model has ensured continued availability of satellite curing data.ImplicationsThe transition to VIIRS will provide continued input of curing into fire danger calculations across Australia.In Australia, MODIS-based grassland curing (senescence) data have fed into fire danger calculations since 2013. MODIS has exceeded its designed lifespan, so the grassland curing model has transitioned to VIIRS. The VIIRS curing model was handed over to the Bureau of Meteorology for continued daily input into fire danger calculations.

TI  - Oncologic Safety of One-Stage Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction in Breast Cancer Patients With Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes: A Single-Center Retrospective Study Using Propensity Score Matching.
T2  - Clinical breast cancer
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the oncologic safety of one-stage implant-based breast reconstruction (OIBR) following mastectomy in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).METHODS: We collected clinical and pathological data from breast cancer patients with positive SLNs who underwent OIBR or not after mastectomy between January 2015 and December 2018. A total of 194 patients were included, with 130 patients undergoing mastectomy alone (MA) and 64 patients receiving OIBR after mastectomy. The clinical and pathological features, as well as the postoperative oncologic outcomes, of the 2 groups were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to mitigate the effects of data bias and confounding factors.RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 66 months for the OIBR group and 64 months for the MA group after PSM. The majority of reconstructive surgeries use an approach of prosthetic implantation (52.0%). This is followed by prosthetic implantation combined with a latissimus dorsi (LD) flap (32.0%), and acellular dermal matrix (ADM)-assisted implant placement (16.0%). During the follow-up period, a local recurrence was observed in 1 case, regional recurrence in 3 cases, and distant metastasis leading to death in 3 cases among the OIBR group patients. No significant difference was found between the OIBR and MA groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (P=.66), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (P=.91), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) (P=.44), and overall survival (OS) (P=.57).CONCLUSION: OIBR is a safe option for breast cancer patients with positive SLNs and does not negatively impact cancer recurrence or overall survival.

TI  - The geochemistry, origin, and hydrothermal alteration mapping associated with the gold-bearing quartz veins at Hamash district, South Eastern Desert, Egypt.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Integrating diverse techniques and datasets, significantly enhances the accurate identification of various mineral deposits. This work aims to determine different types of mineral deposits in the Hamash district (Southern Eastern Desert, Egypt) by combining structural features (derived from ALOS PALSAR DEM), alteration zones (detected using ASTER and Sentinel-2), and ore mineralogy. Multispectral imaging, such as ASTER and Sentinel-2 satellite data, provides a cost-effective and efficient tool for lithological and hydrothermal alteration mapping utilizing selective band ratios (SBR), directed principal component analysis (DPCA), feature-oriented false-color composites (FFCC), and constrained energy minimization (CEM). The deductions drawn from the analysis of ASTER and Sentinel 2 satellite data are solidly corroborated through meticulous investigations of pre-existing lithological maps in the study area, on-site validation via fieldwork, and robust laboratory analysis, attesting to reliable results. Validation of remote sensing results was performed through field observations, petrographic investigations, X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), and SEM-EDX analyses. Based on ore mineralogy derived from XRD and SEM results the quartz-vein-associated ore minerals in the Hamash district include chalcopyrite, pyrite, hematite, goethite, bornite, covellite, and gold. According to the present paragenesis, the mineralization in the study area is classified into three types: sulfide mineralized zone, transitional zone, and supergene zone. Using an ore microscope,our studies identified that the alteration zones include gold-bearing sulfide minerals as well as the minerals goethite and malachite. In gold-bearing quartz samples, the concentrations of Cu, As, Ag, and Sb are positively correlated with Au at the degree of shear deformation. According to data gathered from the fire assay results, Au content varied from 0.027 to 57.20 ppm, along with Cu (10-6484ppm), Ag (0.5-20.5ppm), As (5-2046ppm), Zn (3-1095ppm), Pb (2-1383ppm), and Sb (5-23). Our results confirmed that the Hamash region is one of the most important gold-bearing sites, with gold concentrations ranging from 0.027 up to 57.20ppm. Furthermore, the current contribution highlighted four stages in the paragenetic sequence of the recorded ores, including magmatic, metamorphic, hydrothermal, and supergene by origin, indicating a considered similarity with the known Egyptian gold sites regarding host rocks, mineralization style, alteration assemblage, and several ore mineral conditions.

TI  - Novel multidrug-resistant sublineages of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> clonal complex 22 discovered in India
T2  - MSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen in India causing community and nosocomial infections, but little is known about its molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance in hospital settings. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize 478 S. aureus clinical isolates (393 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 85 methicilin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) collected from 17 sentinel sites across India between 2014 and 2019. Sequencing results confirmed that sequence type 22 (ST22) (142 isolates, 29.7%), ST239 (74 isolates, 15.48%), and ST772 (67 isolates, 14%) were the most common clones. An in-depth analysis of 175 clonal complex (CC) 22 Indian isolates identified two novel ST22 MRSA lineages, both Panton-Valentine leukocidin+, both resistant to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, and one harboring the the gene for toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst). A temporal analysis of 1797 CC22 global isolates from14 analysis of 1797 CC22 global isolates from 14 different studies showed that the two Indian ST22 lineages shared a common ancestor in 1984 (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 1982-1986), as well as evidence of transmission to other parts of the world. Moreover, the study also gives a comprehensive view of ST2371, a sublineage of CC22, as a new emerging lineage in India and describes it in relationship with the other Indian ST22 isolates. In addition, the retrospective identification of a putative outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) ST239 from a single hospital in Bangalore that persisted over a period of 3 years highlights the need for the implementation of routine surveillance and simple infection prevention and control measures to reduce these outbreaks. To our knowledge, this is the first WGS study that characterized CC22 in India and showed that the Indian clones are distinct from the EMRSA-15 clone. Thus, with the improved resolution affordedafforded by WGS, this study substantially contributed to our understanding of the global population of MRSA.

TI  - Does sentinel node mapping impact morbidity and quality of life in endometrial cancer?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of post-operative complications and quality of life (QoL) related to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy vs systematic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer.Methods A prospective cohort included women with early-stage endometrial carcinoma who underwent lymph node staging, grouped as follows: SLN group (sentinel lymph node only) and SLN+LND group (sentinel lymph node biopsy with addition of systematic lymphadenectomy). The patients had at least 12 months of follow-up, and QoL was assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cervical Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and EORTC-QLQ-Cx24. Lymphedema was also assessed by clinical evaluation and perimetry.Results 152 patients were included: 113 (74.3%) in the SLN group and 39 (25.7%) in the SLN+LND group. Intra-operative surgical complications occurred in 2 (1.3%) cases, and all belonged to SLN+LND group. Patients undergoing SLN+LND had higher overall complication rates than those undergoing SLN alone (33.3% vs 14.2%; p=0.011), even after adjusting for confound factors (OR=3.45, 95% CI 1.40 to 8.47; p=0.007). The SLN+LND group had longer surgical time (p=0.001) and need for admission to the intensive care unit (p=0.001). Moreover, the incidence of lymphocele was found in eight cases in the SLN+LND group (0 vs 20.5%; p<0.001). There were no differences in lymphedema rate after clinical evaluation and perimetry. However, the lymphedema score was highest when lymphedema was reported by clinical examination at 6 months (30.1 vs 7.8; p<0.001) and at 12 months (36.3 vs 6.0; p<0.001). Regarding the overall assessment of QoL, there was no difference between groups at 12 months of follow-up.Conclusions There was a higher overall rate of complications for the group undergoing systematic lymphadenectomy, as well as higher rates of lymphocele and lymphedema according to the symptom score. No difference was found in overall QoL between SLN and SLN+LND groups.

TI  - A Bridge Over Troubled Water: How Worldview Helps Overcome the Religious-Secular Divide in Development Cooperation and Beyond
T2  - REVIEW OF FAITH & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As research has shown, collaboration between religious and non-religious actors in the context of international development is often difficult and limited. Though various barriers exist, mutual misunderstanding and prejudices appear to be the main reason for the religious-secular divide. This essay argues that this divide-both within the development sector and beyond-can be bridged more effectively by understanding religion in terms of "worldview." As everyone holds a certain worldview, this concept challenges the current dichotomy and creates a more level playing field as starting point for dialogue. Problematic for the development sector, however, is the widespread equation of secularity with neutrality, and of neutrality with professionalism. The "professional identity" concept can help uncouple this connection.

TI  - Epidemiology of Postoperative Complications After Esophagectomy: Implications for Management.
T2  - The Annals of thoracic surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in operative techniques and postoperative care, esophagectomy remains a morbid operation. Leveraging complication epidemiology and the correlation of these complications may improve rescue and refine early recovery pathways.METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed all esophagectomies performed at a tertiary academic center from 2014 to 2021 and quantified the timing of the most common complications. Daily incidence values for index complications were calculated, and a covariance matrix was created to examine the correlation of the complications with each other. Study investigators performed a Cox proportional hazards analysis to clarify the association between early diagnosis of postoperative atrial fibrillation and pneumonia with subsequent anastomotic leak.RESULTS: The study analyzed 621 esophagectomies, with 580 (93.4%) cervical anastomoses and 474 (76%) patients experiencing complications. A total of 159 (25.6%) patients had postoperative atrial fibrillation, and 155 (25.0%) had an anastomotic leak. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) postoperative day of these complications was day 2 (IQR, days 2-3) and day 8 (IQR, days 7-11), respectively. Our covariance matrix found significant associations in the variance of the most common postoperative complications, including pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, anastomotic leak, and readmissions. Early postoperative atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio, 8.1; 95% CI, 5.65-11.65) and postoperative pneumonia (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.98-7.38) were associated with anastomotic leak.CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining a high index of suspicion for early postoperative complications is crucial for rescuing patients after esophagectomy. Early postoperative pneumonia and atrial fibrillation may be sentinel complications for an anastomotic leak, and their occurrence may be used to prompt further clinical investigation. Early recovery protocols should consider the development of early complications into postoperative feeding and imaging algorithms.

TI  - Monitoring the impacts of crop residue cover on agricultural productivity and soil chemical and physical characteristics.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To the best of our knowledge, the impacts of crop residue cover (CRC) on agricultural productivity and soil fertility have not been studied by previous researchers. In this regard, this study aims to apply an integrated approach of remote sensing and geospatial analysis to detect CRC and monitor the effects of CRC on agricultural productivity, as well as soil chemical and physical characteristics. To achieve this, a series of Landsat images and 275 ground control points (GCPs) collected from the study areas for the years 2013, 2015, and 2021 were used. A convolutional neural network (CNN), a class of artificial neural network has commonly applied to analyze visual imagery, was employed in this study for CRC detection in two classes (Not-CRC and CRC) for the years 2013, 2015, and 2021. To assess the effects of CRC, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to Landsat image series for the years 2015 (22 images), 2019 (20 images), and 2022 (23 images). Furthermore, this study evaluates the impacts of CRC on soil fertility based on collected field observation data. The results show a high performance (Accuracy of>0.95) of the CNN for CRC detection and mapping. The findings also reveal positive effects of CRC on agricultural productivity, indicating an increase in vegetation density by about 0.1909 and 0.1377 for study areas 1 and 2, respectively, from 2015 to 2022. The results also indicate an increase in soil chemical and physical characteristics, including EC, PH, Na, Mg, HCO3, K, silt, sand, and clay from 2015 to 2022, based on physical examination. In general, the findings underscore that the value of an integrated approach of remote sensing and geospatial analysis for detecting CRC and monitoring its impacts on agricultural productivity and soil fertility. This research can offer valuable insight to researchers and decision-makers in the field of soil science, land management and agriculture.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variability analysis of water quality using remote sensing data: A case study of Lake Manyame
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, the quality of freshwater in inland water bodies has been a major issue of concern due to the negative impact of human activities. With the increase in global population, it is projected that the quality of the water resources will deteriorate. Quantitative information on the state of water quality is quite crucial in water resources planning and conservation. Conventional or ground-based measuring tools are more time demanding, expensive for monitoring water quality parameters of inland water bodies, resulting in incomprehensive coverage in time and space. Due to the paucity of images with fine spatial and temporal resolution like Sentinel 2, provides invaluable information at a fine spatial scale for water quality monitoring to supporting progress towards achieving Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs). This study quantified the spatial and temporal variations of water quality parameters of Total Nitrogen (TN), Turbidity, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSS) derived from cloud free and remotely sensed Sentinel 2 satellite data for a period from 2017 to 2022 for Lake Manyame in Zimbabwe. Furthermore, the research developed empirical models based on the linear regression between in-situ water sample data and water quality indicators of Sentinel 2. The results showed that between 2017 and 2022, the water quality in Lake Manyame significantly fluctuated. The regression coefficients (R2) be-tween remote sensed water quality parameters and field or sample water data ranged from R2 = 0.63 to R2 = 0.95, providing a promising possibility for operational use of freely available remote sensing data in water quality monitoring in data constrained countries.The study demonstrated the importance and capability of using freely available Sentinel 2 data, with fine spatial and temporal resolution in providing invaluable information and evaluating on the state and indicators of water quality in inland water bodies in space and time. Such information is crucial in informing resource managers and decision makers in conserving water resources.

TI  - Early warning of statewide COVID-19 Omicron wave by sentineled urbanized sewer network monitoring using digital PCR in a province capital city, of Gujarat, India.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been implemented globally. However, there remains confusion about the number and frequency of samples to be collected, as well as which types of treatment systems can provide reliable specific details about the virus prevalence in specific areas or communities, enabling prompt management and intervention measures. More research is necessary to fully comprehend the possibility of deploying sentinel locations in sewer networks in larger geographic areas. The present study introduces the first report on wastewater-based surveillance in Gandhinagar City using digital PCR (d-PCR) as a SARS-Cov-2 quantification tool, which describes the viral load from five pumping stations in Gandhinagar from October 2021 to March 2022. Raw wastewater samples (n=119) were received and analyzed weekly to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 109 of which were positive for N1 or N2 genes. The monthly variation analysis in viral genome copies depicted the highest concentrations in January 2022 and February 2022 (p<0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test) coincided with the Omicron wave, which contributed mainly from Vavol and Jaspur pumping stations. Cross-correlation analysis indicated that WBE from five stations in Gandhinagar, i.e., capital city sewer networks, provided two-week lead times to the citywide and statewide active cases (time-series cross-correlation function [CCF]; 0.666 and 0.648, respectively), mainly from individual contributions of the urbanized Kudasan and Vavol stations (CCF; 0.729 and 0.647, respectively). These findings suggest that sewer pumping stations in urbanized neighborhoods can be used as sentinel sites for statewide clinical surveillance and that WBE surveillance using digital PCR can be an efficient monitoring and management tool.

TI  - 'Forest malaria' in Myanmar' Tracking transmission landscapes in a diversity of environments
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the Greater Mekong Subregion, case-control studies and national-level analyses have shown an association between malaria transmission and forest activities. The term ' forest malaria' hides the diversity of ecosystems in the GMS, which likely do not share a uniform malaria risk. To reach malaria elimination goals, it is crucial to document accurately (both spatially and temporally) the influence of environmental factors on malaria to improve resource allocation and policy planning within given areas. The aim of this ecological study is to characterize the association between malaria dynamics and detailed ecological environments determined at village level over a period of several years in Kayin State, Myanmar.Methods We characterized malaria incidence profiles at village scale based on intra- and inter-annual variations in amplitude, seasonality, and trend over 4 years (2016-2020). Environment was described independently of village localization by overlaying a 2-km hexagonal grid over the region. Specifically, hierarchical classification on principal components, using remote sensing data of high spatial resolution, was used to assign a landscape and a climate type to each grid cell. We used conditional inference trees and random forests to study the association between the malaria incidence profile of each village, climate and landscape. Finally, we constructed eco-epidemiological zones to stratify and map malaria risk in the region by summarizing incidence and environment association information.Results We identified a high diversity of landscapes (n = 19) corresponding to a gradient from pristine to highly anthropogenically modified landscapes. Within this diversity of landscapes, only three were associated with malariaaffected profiles. These landscapes were composed of a mosaic of dense and sparse forest fragmented by small agricultural patches. A single climate with moderate rainfall and a temperature range suitable for mosquito presence was also associated with malaria-affected profiles. Based on these environmental associations, we identified three eco-epidemiological zones marked by later persistence of Plasmodium falciparum, high Plasmodium vivax incidence after 2018, or a seasonality pattern in the rainy season.Conclusions The term forest malaria covers a multitude of contexts of malaria persistence, dynamics and populations at risk. Intervention planning and surveillance could benefit from consideration of the diversity of landscapes to focus on those specifically associated with malaria transmission.

TI  - Wildfire monitoring technologies of transmission line corridors based on Fengyun-3E satellite imaging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Facing towards the Carbon Neutrality goal by 2060, renewable energy sources are boosted in China in the past decade. Either these renewables or power systems are sensitive and vulnerable to natural disasters, such as wildfire and typhoon. In this paper, a fire spot identification algorithm is proposed for wildfire disaster occurred in transmission line corridors based on Fengyun-3E (FY-3E). It mitigates the effect of large observation of solar zenith angle, as well as changes of satellite views, on the infrared channel detection. And cloud information under complex atmospheric conditions is analyzed to extract the cloud pixel fire spot, which decreases false ratio of fire-spot alerts. According to the analysis of hybrid pixel linear spectrums, the fire-spot detection sensitivity of FY-3E is four times as that of geostationary meteorological satellites. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was confirmed by an application in the Shanxi province power grid of State Grid in China. It shows that and the FY-3E has a superiority in wildfire monitoring for power system in terms of fire detection sensitivity, spatial range accuracy, and positioning accuracy. Compared to geostationary meteorological satellites, the fire locating accuracy of FY-3E is increased by more than one-fold. This research can assist the operation and maintenance departments of transmission lines to rapidly detect wildfire, thereby reducing the damage of wildfires on the power grid.

TI  - Effect of volume and methylene blue on fluorescence intensity and transit of indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node mapping in a simulated feline tumor model.
T2  - American journal of veterinary research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of volume and solution on transit time and fluorescence intensity (FI) using near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF) in a simulated tumor model in cats. Secondarily, to describe SLN mapping with indocyanine green (ICG) NIRF and report any adverse effects of intradermally injected ICG in cats.ANIMALS: 7 healthy purpose-bred domestic shorthaired male cats.METHODS: Cats were randomly divided into 2 groups (ICG or ICG + methylene blue [MB]). Transit time and FI were determined for 1 or 2 mL solutions injected intradermally in 4 quadrants around a simulated tumor. Following massage, fluorescence intensity was quantified by calculating the corrected total ROI fluorescence using ImageJ software. Cats were monitored for adverse effects up to 4 weeks post-injection.RESULTS: A larger solution volume had decreased transit times to the SLN (P = .001). There was no significant difference in transit times between ICG and ICG-MB. ICG demonstrated a greater FI (P = .001) in the SLN compared to ICG-MB. Methylene blue did not percutaneously fluoresce under NIRF. The volume of the solution did not significantly affect FI. No adverse reactions were reported.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased volume of ICG may aid in rapid percutaneous lymphatic tracking from tumor to SLN. Indocyanine green alone may be preferred over ICG-MB for greater visualization of the SLN. Intradermal injections of ICG and ICG-MB were well-tolerated in healthy cats with no significant complications. Clinical evaluation of this technique in an impaired lymphatic system, as seen in cancer patients, should be assessed in future research.

TI  - Improving pixel-based classification of GRASS GIS with support vector machine
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Open source GIS software GRASS releases 8.0 to 8.4 have received some long overdue improvements in imagery handling such as the ability to reuse spectral signature files of existing classifiers, machine readable output of accuracy assessment tool and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Practical comparison of all three pixel-based classifiers of GRASS GIS indicated that the maximum likelihood discriminant analysis classifier is the fastest and least accurate one, followed by a sequential maximum a posteriori classifier with reasonably fast execution time and good accuracy. The newly added SVM classifier is the slowest one but provides the highest accuracy and also shows the highest improvement potential by hyperparameter optimization. To illustrate the capabilities of the core classifiers, a showcase is presented where a single Sentinel 2 image is classified to distinguish 18 crop types using all three classifiers available in GRASS.

TI  - Analysis of the evolution of the Yellow River Delta coastline and the response of the tidal current field
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline of the Yellow River Delta has undergone continual alterations due to both natural forces and human activity. Studying these changes is crucial for promoting economic growth and preserving the region's ecological balance. Based on imagery captured by the Landsat5 and Landsat8 satellites, this study uses statistical data from the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), including Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR), to analyze the changes in the Yellow River Delta coastline from 2009 to 2019. This being the case, a hydrodynamic model under different shoreline conditions was established using Delft3D to compare and analyze the impact of shoreline changes on the tidal current field. From 2009 to 2019, the coastline in the study area exhibited an average movement distance of 1285m (NSM) and an annual change rate of 127.7m/a (LRR). The average increase in the area of the current estuary was 7.68km(2)/a, while the average decrease in the area of the old estuary was 4.91km(2)/a. Shoreline evolution is primarily influenced by the influx of water and sediment into the ocean. Following the implementation of water and sediment regulation, the existing estuary's shoreline experienced a rapid initial accumulation of silt, which subsequently decelerated over time. Conversely, the former estuary has consistently undergone erosion. The greater the change in shoreline, the closer to the coast, and the greater the change in the tide. From 2009 to 2019, flow velocity and direction in the Yellow River Delta generally showed a decreasing trend, with changes ranging from 0.34% to 25.94%. The residual flow velocity near the current estuary gradually increased by about 2cm/s, while that near the abandoned old estuary gradually decreased by about 1cm/s, with no significant changes offshore. The sediment transported by the Yellow River is deposited at the current estuary, causing the coastline to move northeastward. In the abandoned estuary, there is erosion, causing the coastline to retreat.

TI  - Perseverance, partnerships and passion: ingredients for successful local government policy to promote healthy and sustainable diets
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLocal government authorities are well-placed to invest in evidence-based food policies that promote a population-wide shift to healthy and sustainable diets. This study describes the contextual factors that facilitated or impeded policy-making related to healthy and sustainable diets within a 'best-performing' local government in Victoria, Australia.MethodsGuided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), data from semi-structured interviews with individuals involved in developing the City of Greater Bendigo's Food System Strategy were analysed using the seven-stage Framework Method.ResultsSemi-structured interviews (n = 24) were conducted with City of Greater Bendigo employees (n = 15) and key stakeholders working for local organisations (n = 6) or at a state or national level (n = 3). Interviewees mostly held positions of leadership (n = 20) and represented diverse areas of focus from health (n = 7), food systems (n = 4) and planning and public policy (n = 3). Data analysis revealed 12 cross-cutting themes; eight facilitating factors and four impeding factors. Facilitating factors included perseverance, community engagement, supportive state policy, effective leadership, a global platform and networks, partnerships, workforce capacity and passion, and the use of scientific evidence. Impeding factors included access to secure, ongoing financial resources, prohibitive state and federal policy, COVID-related disruptions to community engagement and competing stakeholder interests. Overall, this study suggests that the City of Greater Bendigo's success in developing an evidence-based local food system policy is built upon (i) a holistic worldview that embraces systems-thinking and credible frameworks, (ii) a sustained commitment and investment throughout the inner-setting over time, and (iii) the ability to establish and nurture meaningful partnerships with community groups, neighbouring local government areas and state-level stakeholders, built upon values of reciprocity and respect.ConclusionsDespite insufficient resourcing and prohibitive policy at higher levels of government, this 'best performing' local government in Victoria, Australia developed an evidence-based food system policy by employing highly skilled and passionate employees, embracing a holistic worldview towards planetary health and harnessing global networks. Local government authorities aspiring to develop integrated food policy should nurture a workforce culture of taking bold evidence-informed policy action, invest in mechanisms to enable long-standing partnerships with community stakeholders and be prepared to endure a 'slow-burn' approach.

TI  - Transformer-based contrastive prototypical clustering for multimodal remote sensing data
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the increasing diversity of available remote sensing data sources, multimodal fusion land cover classification has emerged as a promising direction in the community of Earth observation. However, modern supervised multimodal deep learning methods heavily rely on extensive amounts of human-annotated training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised method for multimodal remote sensing land-cover type clustering: Transformer-based Multimodal Prototypical Contrastive Clustering (TMPCC). It is based on three core designs. First, we design a multimodal Transformer that learns a shared space through adaptive interactions between and within modalities. Second, we introduce an online clustering mechanism based on unified prototype learning that is scalable to large-scale multimodal datasets. Third, we employ a self-supervised training strategy that combines instance contrastive loss and clustering loss to enable efficient and effective model training. Coupling these three designs allows for training an end-to-end online clustering network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal RS data clustering, e.g., the highest clustering accuracy (92.28%) among existing methods on the hyperspectral-LiDAR Trento dataset. Our method demonstrates promising scalability in terms of modality and sample size, and it can also generalize to out-of-sample data. The code for this method is openly available at https://github .com /AngryCai /TMPCC.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of water quality parameters in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid socio-economic development of the Yellow River Delta (YRD), the pressure on the supply of water resources has continued to rise. The development of oil-based industries has also led to a series of ecological and environmental problems, such as wetland degradation and water quality deterioration. As an increasing number of rivers are getting polluted, resulting in the deterioration of their water quality, monitoring, managing, and protecting water resources in the YRD is particularly important. In this study, water quality monitoring data and simultaneous Sentinel-2 image data from April 30, 2020, to October 26, 2021, were used to construct an experimental sample in the YRD. Water quality parameters (WQPs) concentrations were correlated with Sentinel-2 image element spectral reflectance and sensitive bands were selected. An empirical method based on the characteristic bands was used to invert a total of six water quality indicators, namely dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-H), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and turbidity. The results show: (1) A total of five water quality inversion models for DO, TN, CODMn, TP and TN were effective in the areas of the Guangli River, the Tiaohe and the Branch River. The inversion accuracies of the five inversion models (R2of 0.6099, 0.9271, 0.9581, 0.8784 and 0.7387; RMSE of 1.2723, 0.3413, 0.9923, 0.0118 and 1.8476; RPD of 1.53, 2.08, 3.56, 2.76 and 1.53) indicated the feasibility of the water quality inversion method based on Sentinel-2 data using statistical theory for monitoring water quality concentration in the YRD. (2) The spatial distribution of water quality in the YRD was generally characterized by high water quality in the upper reaches and low water quality in the middle and lower reaches (except for some seasonal variations). Among them, the water quality of the upper reaches of the Guangli River was poor, with opposite trends in DO and TN concentrations. In the Tiaohe, CODMn and TP concentrations were not strongly correlated. However, CODMn and TP concentrations were high in the middle reaches where water quality was the worst. The TN concentrations in the Branch River decreased between 2020 and 2021, but the water quality is still in Category V. Therefore, continued attention and appropriate water quality management measures in the YRD are required. Further, by measuring water quality indicators at monitoring stations, regression-fitting equations for WQPs were established to obtain complementary multi-platform observations. Thus, the water quality conditions in the YRD region can be evaluated more accurately and quickly. The research results not only provide an important reference basis for the identification and monitoring of pollution sources, prevention and treatment of water environment pollution in the YRD, but also provide water security for socio-economic and ecological environment security.

TI  - Continuous Erector Spinae and Serratus-Intercostal Block With Ketamine-Dexmedetomidine Sedation for Quadrantectomy and Axillary Dissection in a Multimorbid Patient
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multimorbidity is a clinical presentation that poses an increased risk of perioperative and postoperative complications. Tailored anaesthetic management could potentially minimise the risk of negative outcomes. Peripheral nerve and fasciae blocks are valid strategies for perioperative and postoperative pain management, which avoid complications related to general anaesthesia and reduce the risk of intensive care unit admission as well as the hospital length of stay. We describe the case of a 56-old patient with multimorbidity, including obesity with a BMI of 45.7, unstable angina, predicted difficult airway management and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) scheduled for left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, managed with a left continuous thoracic erector spinae plane (ESP) block plus serratus-intercostal plane block (BRanches of Intercostal nerves at the Level of MidAxillary line (BRILMA)), and sedation with combined ketamine-dexmedetomidine. Fascial blocks combined with opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) proved to be effective for the multimorbid patient, ensuring successful perioperative management and a proper recovery after surgery.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The total precipitable water vapour (TPW) extraction algorithm using the Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) has the potential to be improved on a regional scale. The aim of this study was to improve the TPW extraction algorithm of OLCI for the first time using environmental variables, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and elevation from mean sea level, on a regional scale over Iran. A previously developed TPW recovery algorithm was applied to the OLCI data during cloud-free days throughout a one-year period (1 January-29 December 2020). The artificial neural network (ANN) methodology was utilized in eight models. The evaluation results revealed the effectiveness of the models varied based on the topography and climate of each station. The assessment findings demonstrated that model 2, which integrated LST, elevation, and NDVI data in the ANN framework, outperformed other models across the study area.

TI  - Enhanced impact of prolonged MHWs on satellite-observed chlorophyll in the South China Sea
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are period of extreme ocean temperatures that can last from a few days to several years. The increasing frequency and intensity of MHWs have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems. This study explores the characteristics of MHWs from 1982 to 2021 and their effects on chlorophyll (Chl) from 1998 to 2021 in the South China Sea (SCS), utilizing satellite data and reanalysis products. MHWs were classified into short-duration MHWs (SMHWs) and long-duration MHWs (LMHWs) based on their duration to analyze their effects. High-intensity and frequent MHWs were observed in the coastal regions of China, the western SCS (WSCS, average depth more than 200 m), and southwest of the Luzon Strait (LS, average depth more than 200 m). MHWs have increased by 14 days (R-2 = 0.42, p < 0.01) and 0.99 times (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.01) per decade over the past four decades. The per-decade rate of increase is 44 % of the average MHWs days, and 36 % of the frequency in entire SCS.LMHWs contributed the most to this increase at a rate of 6.5 days (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.01) and 0.25 times (R-2 = 0.45, p < 0.01) per decade. The trend of MHWs in the Pearl River estuary (PRE, On the coastal continental shelf, average depth <200 m) is noteworthy for cause for concern, increasing by 19 days and 1.4 times per decade.During SMHWs, the Chl response was relatively insignificant, with roughly 3 % negative anomalies across the entire SCS. However, LMHWs had a more profound impact on Chl,which decliend 8 % over the SCS, especially in the WSCS, PRE, and southwest of LS. During summer in the WSCS and winter southwest of LS, the negative anomalies of Chl varied between 20 % and 40 % of its daily climatology for each grid. In contrast, a noteworthy positive Chl response was observed in the PRE and adjacent waters during summer. The duration and intensity of MHWs in these regions affected Chl, and the suppression of Chl was more prominent as the intensity and duration increased, except in the PRE, where MHWs promoted Chl during both spring and summer. We identified various mechanisms by which MHWs impacted Chl in these regions, including weakened upwelling and eddies in the WSCS, changes in plume distribution along the PRE, and shallow mixed layer and weakened cyclonic circulation in the LS during winter. Our study underscores the need for immediate conservation measures to mitigate the effects of MHWs on marine ecosystems, particularly in the PRE and adjacent regions where harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a frequent and ongoing threat.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present research focuses on investigating the application of remote sensing for mapping mining waste and identifying areas prone to acid mine drainage within the area of active mining through sub-pixel analysis on Sentinel-2 and OLI sensor of Landsat-8. For this purpose, the Sarcheshmeh mine located in southeast of Iran was investigated. Mine wastes were initially identified using a partial sub-pixel matched filtering algorithm on OLI and Sentinel-2 data images. Areas having potential for AMD were subsequently determined and assessed by comparing field observations and samples analyses including pH of water samples, as well as mineralogical X-ray diffraction analyses, chemical and spectral analyses like visible near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy, and pH of rock and hardened precipitates samples. Drainage networks were extracted from the digital elevation model (DEM) of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and overlain on the discriminated potential sources of AMD to determine if the hydrologic network intersected the areas of mine waste. Sub-pixel analyses of Sentinal-2 and OLI sensor data indicate that mineral mapping abundance accuracies for potential acid-generating minerals species were determined to be more than 79%. This result suggests that mineral mapping through these sensors is an effective tool for the characterization of mineral species comprising mine waste in areas prone to AMD. Overlaying the results also showed that it is possible to determine the impact of the wastes or polluted AMD on the region and design a plan for managing, controlling, and neutralizing contaminated areas.

TI  - Relaxivity Enhancement of Hybrid Micelles via Modulation of Water Coordination Numbers for Magnetic Resonance Lymphography
T2  - NANO LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considerable efforts have been made to develop nanoparticle-based magnetic resonance contrast agents (CAs) with high relaxivity. The prolonged rotational correlation time (t(R)) induced relaxivity enhancement is commonly recognized, while the effect of the water coordination numbers (q) on the relaxivity of nanoparticle-based CAs gets less attention. Herein, we first investigated the relationship between T-1 relaxivity (r (1)) and q in manganese-based hybrid micellar CAs and proposed a strategy to enhance the relaxivity by increasing q. Hybrid micelles with different ratios of amphiphilic manganese complex (MnL) and DSPE-PEG2000 were prepared, whose q values were evaluated by Oxygen-17-NMR spectroscopy. Micelles with lower manganese doping density exhibit increased q and enhanced relaxivity, corroborating the conception. In vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging demonstrates that DSPE-PEG/MnL micelles could differentiate metastatic SLN from inflammatory LN. Our strategy makes it feasible for relaxivity enhancement by modulating q, providing new approaches for the structural design of high-performance hybrid micellar CAs.

TI  - Integrating testing for sexually transmissible infections into annual health assessments for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people: a cross-sectional analysis.
T2  - Sexual health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of an expanding syphilis epidemic, we assessed the integration of sexually transmissible infection (STI) testing within annual health assessments for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people aged 16-29years in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services between 2018 and 2020.METHODS: Using routinely collected electronic medical record data from a national sentinel surveillance system (ATLAS), we performed a cross-sectional analysis to calculate the proportion of assessments that integrated any or all of the tests for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and HIV. We used logistic regression to identify correlates of integration of any STI test.RESULTS: Of the13892 assessments, 23.8% (95% CI 23.1, 24.6) integrated a test for any STI and 11.5% (95% CI 10.9, 12.0) included all four STIs. Of assessments that included a chlamydia/gonorrhoea test, 66.9% concurrently included a syphilis test. Integration of any STI test was associated with patients aged 20-24years (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4) and 25-29years (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2) compared to 16-19years and patients residing in very remote (OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.7-4.8), remote (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.1-2.8), and regional areas (OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.2-2.8) compared to metropolitan areas. There was no association with patient sex.CONCLUSIONS: Integration of STI testing into annual health assessments for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people was higher in remote areas where disease burden is greatest. Integration is similar in men and women, which contrasts with most studies that have found higher testing in women.

TI  - Climate of Syria Based on Cordex Simulations: Present and Future
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional climate models are widely used to assess current and future impacts of climate change. In this study, we evaluate the performance of regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment programme integrated over the following three CORDEX domains: AFR, MNA and WAS. Four meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and cloud cover) were evaluated over Syria at a grid spacing of 0.44 & DEG;. The performance of five models in simulating the present climate characteristics (1989-2008) is evaluated with respect to the observations: CRU, ERA5 reanalysis and SARA and CLARA satellite data. We find that the mini-ensemble captures well the general spatial patterns and annual cycles of the selected variables. Anotheraim of this study was to assess the expected change of the mentioned four climate variables over Syria under the moderate emission scenario (RCP4.5) and the high emission scenario (RCP8.5) in the near future (2031-2050) and in the far future (2080-2099) with respect to the present climate (1989-2008). The simulations show a decreasing trend in cloud cover (between 6% and 10%) and precipitation (up to 9%) by mid and late century, regardless of the forcing scenarios. The simulations show a pronounced warming over Syria, which is expected to reach 6 & DEG;C by the end of the twenty-first century following the high greenhouse gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5). Furthermore, such an increase, combined with a decrease in precipitation, will shift Syria's climate towards a more arid one.

TI  - Detection and Monitoring of Potential Geological Disaster Using SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As a global geological environment problem, geological disasters are more likely to induce severe geological disasters and cause loss of personnel and property due to their suddenness and concealment, frequent heavy rainfall and regular extreme weather. In this paper, Sentinel-1A data and DEM data combined with short baseline synthetic aperture interferar (SBAS-InSAR) technology are used to analyze and calculate the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of surface deformation in Zibo-Weifang area of Shandong Province during 2016-2019. Linear fitting of InSAR monitoring deformation results is performed using level monitoring data to verify the accuracy of the results. The findings indicate that surface deformation in most of the study area is relatively stable, but in some areas, especially near Lucun Town, the maximum negative deformation rate exceeds 80mm/a. Based on the surface deformation results, a total of 377 potential geological disasters are identified using an integrated multi-source stereo observation system of the sky and ground. This identification is done by observing optical remote sensing images and taking the absolute value of surface deformation rate greater than 10 mm/a as the judgment basis, along with ground investigation and review. Several typical geological disaster sites are screened and they are found to be in unstable state. The research results can provide scientific support for geological disaster prevention and control in Shandong Province.

TI  - Survival after sentinel lymph node biopsy for early cervical cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node biopsy represents an alternative to pelvic lymphadenectomy for lymph node staging of early-stage cervical carcinoma, but prospective evidence on long-term oncological safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone versus pelvic lymphadenectomy is missing.ObjectiveTo investigate, with this meta-analysis, the impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone versus pelvic lymphadenectomy on survival for patients with early-stage cervical cancer.MethodsA systematic literature review was performed. We excluded studies in which pelvic lymphadenectomy was systematically performed after every sentinel lymph node biopsy, including only articles where pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed because sentinel lymph node biopsy was not conclusive. A meta-analysis was carried out combining 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates with a random and fixed effect model. Heterogeneity was tested using the Cochran X2 test and quantified with Higgins information I2.ResultsThe search of databases and registers found 927 items and six articles (two retrospective and four prospective). The median time of follow-up was 34.8 months (range 13-53). Overall common effect disease-free survival was 98% while random effect disease-free survival was 94%. Overall heterogeneity was 77%. A subgroup analysis was applied, dividing studies into one group including sentinel lymph node biopsy negative data only (common effect disease-free survival 91%; random effect disease-free survival 90%), and one group with a negative and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (common effect disease-free survival 98%; random effect disease-free survival 96%). In the analysis of overall survival, positive and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy cases were examined together (common and random effect overall survival 99%). Ultrastaging did not affect disease-free survival (common and random effect disease-free survival 92% in the ultrastaging group vs common effect disease-free survival 99% and random effect disease-free survival 96% in the non-ultrastaging group).ConclusionsBoth 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rate after sentinel lymph node biopsy alone are higher than 90% and do not differ from pelvic lymphadenectomy survival data. Ultrastaging did not impact survival.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of the Central Chile Mega Drought on debris cover, broadband albedo, and surface drainage system of a Dry Andes glacier.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In recent years, Chile has experienced an extraordinary drought that has had significant impacts on both the livelihoods of people and the environment, including the Andean glaciers. This study focuses on analyzing the surface processes of Universidad Glacier, a benchmark glacier for the Dry Andes. Multiple remote sensing datasets are used alongside a novel spectral index designed for mapping of rock material located on the glacier's surface. Our findings highlight the precarious state of the glacier, which serves as a crucial water source for the region. The glacier exhibits locally varied debris accumulation and margin retreat. The most significant impacts are observed on the tongue and secondary accumulation cirques, with the latter at risk of disappearing. The debris cover on the tongue is expanding, reaching higher elevations, and is accompanied by glacier retreat, especially at higher altitudes. The equilibrium line is rapidly shifting upglacier, although the mid-season snow cover still frequently reaches the 2013 equilibrium line, even in 2020. Changes in stream density on the glacier tongue indicate an increased water supply in this area, likely due to enhanced melting of glacial ice. These observed processes align well with meteorological data obtained from reanalysis products. The behavior of dust and debris is influenced by precipitation amount, while the rate of retreat is linked to air temperature.

TI  - Accelerating effects of growing-season warming on tree seasonal activities are progressively disappearing
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenological changes induced by climate warming have profound effects on water, energy, and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. In addition to pre-season warming, growing-season warming may drive tree phenology by altering photosynthetic carbon uptake. It has been reported that the effect of pre-season warming on tree phenology is decreasing. However, temporal change in the effect of growing-season warm-ing on tree phenology is not yet clear. Combining long-term ground observations and remote-sensing data, here we show that spring and autumn phenology were advanced by growing-season warming, while the accelerating effects of growing-season warming on tree phenology were progressively disappearing, man-ifesting as phenological events converted from being advanced to being delayed, in the temperate deciduous broadleaved forests across the Northern Hemisphere between 1983 and 2014. We further observed that the effect of growing-season warming on photosynthetic productivity showed a synchronized decline over the same period. The responses of phenology and photosynthetic productivity had a strong linear relationship with each other, and both showed significant negative correlations with the elevated temperature and vapor pressure deficit during the growing season. These findings indicate that warming-induced water stress may drive the observed decline in the responses of tree phenology to growing-season warming by decelerating photosynthetic productivity. Our results not only demonstrate a close link between photosynthetic carbon uptake and tree seasonal activities but also provide a physiological perspective of the nonlinear phenological responses to climate warming.

TI  - Smoke emissions from biomass burning in Central Mexico and their impact on air quality in Mexico City: May 2019 case study.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Smoke emissions from biomass burning considerably influence regional and local air quality. Many natural wildfires and agricultural burns occur annually in Central Mexico during the hot, dry season (March to May), potentially leading to air quality problems. Nevertheless, the impact of these biomass burning emissions on Mexico City's air quality has not been investigated in depth. This study examines a severely deteriorated air quality case from 11 to 16 May 2019, during which fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) exceeded the 99th percentile of the available official dataset (2005-2019). Specifically, this work aims to highlight the role of fires and regional pollution in the severe episode observed in Mexico City, identifying the fires that were the sources of regional pollution, the type of fuel burned in those fires, and the dominant atmospheric transport pattern. Biomass burning emissions were calculated for different land cover types using satellite data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). PM2.5 increased by a factor of 2 at some monitoring sites, and ozone concentration increased to 40% in Mexico City during the poor air quality episode. Our results indicate that over 50% of the fire activity observed during the 2019 fire season was concentrated in May in Central Mexico. The burning activity was mainly seen over shrubland and forest between 10 and 15 May. Moreover, the fire radiative power analysis indicates that most energy was associated with burning shrubland and forests. Organic carbon emissions were estimated highest on 14 and 15 May, coinciding with the largest number of fires. Back trajectory analysis indicates that enhanced concentration of air pollutants in Mexico City originated from biomass burning detected in neighboring states: Guerrero, Michoacan, and the State of Mexico. Smoke from fires on the specific vegetation cover was advected into Mexico City and contributed to the bad air quality episode. Further meteorological analysis evidenced that the fire intensity and emissions were worsened by low humidity and the late onset of the rainy season in Central Mexico.

TI  - Primary malignant melanoma of the vagina: A case report
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant primary melanoma of the vagina (PMV) is a rare type of non-cutaneous melanoma often discovered in postmenopausal women. PMV has a very aggressive disease course and a poor prognosis. The best course of treatment is not presently agreed upon. In this report, we describe the case of a 68-year-old woman presenting with a malignant PMV and its subsequent management. The patient presented with right vaginal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding and a new vaginal mass. A PET scan identified a 28 x 38 mm hypermetabolic vaginal lesion, without nodal involvement or distant metastasis. A posterior exenteration type 2B was performed, including the anal mucosa. Sentinel lymph node dissection, vaginal and rectal resection as well as a terminal colostomy were also carried out. Final staging was FIGO stage III and T4bN1. Four months later, the patient presented with a recurrent vaginal bleed and intra-vaginal induration. Imaging revealed loco-reginal recurrence at the site of the primary malignancy with countless metastases. The patient opted for palliative care given the early disseminated recurrence and her multiple comorbidities. We review the treatment options for PMV, mainly the importance of surgery as the mainstay of treatment as well as the interest of adding checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy or targeted therapy to the treatment plan. We also summarize the characteristics of PMV and its main prognostic factors.

TI  - Effects of spatial data resolution on the modelling and mapping of soil organic carbon content in hill country grassland landscapes
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Limited use has been made of spatially explicit modelling of soil organic carbon (SOC) in highly complex farmed landscapes to advance current mapping efforts. This study aimed to address this gap in knowledge by evaluating the spatial prediction of SOC content in the 0-75 mm soil depth in hill country landscapes in New Zealand (NZ) using point-based training data, along with topographic covariates and Sentinel 2 spectral band ratios using an automated set of machine learning (AutoML) tools in ArcGIS. Subsequently, it also focused on quantifying the effects of spatial data resolution (i.e., 1, 8, 15, and 25 m) in terms of predicted map accuracy. Farmlets with contrasting phosphorus fertilizer and sheep grazing histories located at the Ballantrae Hill Country Research Station, NZ were selected to conduct the research. Six candidate algorithms incorporated in the AutoML tools (i.e., XGBoost, LightGBM, linear regression, decision trees, extra trees, random forest) and ensemble model were utilized to model the spatial pattern of SOC content. The results show that the ensemble model that combine predictions of various algorithms applied for 1 m data resolution enables the highest performance and accuracy (i.e., R2 = .76, RMSE = 0.66%). Among the predictive variables used in the model, slope, wetness, and topographic position indices were found to be the most important topographical features that explain SOC patterns in the study area. Inclusion of spectral indices derived from remote sensing, including surface soil moisture and clay minerals ratio, made further improvement to the SOC content prediction. The study reveals that a decrease in the resolution of the geospatial data does not substantively affect the mean SOC content estimation of a farm-scale modelling. However, using coarser resolution data reduces the ability of the model to predict changes in the spatial pattern of SOC content across a hill country grassland landscape.

TI  - Task-Oriented Compression Framework for Remote Sensing Satellite Data Transmission
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - High-ratio image compression has always been a hotspot for remote sensing satellite image transmission. Especially for a resource-limited environment on board, image compression plays an important role in data storage and transmission. This article proposes a novel method for integrating information extraction network and image compression network into a comprehensive compression framework in order to achieve high-ratio image codec. To reconstruct region-of-interest (ROI) latent representations, we propose a latent feature selection (LFS) module. Some of the channel representations are removed according to the spatial location of the background, but the channel representations of ROI are entirely retained. To effectively validate the performance of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is better at satellite data compression than traditional codecs.

TI  - Assessment of global eddies from satellite data by a scale-selective eddy identification algorithm (SEIA)
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Automatic ocean eddy identification algorithms are crucial for global eddy research. In this study, a scale-selective eddy identification algorithm (SEIA) that features improvements in the detection and tracking processes is presented for the global ocean based on sea level anomalies. First, the previous strategy of using thresholds to define eddy boundaries is replaced with a scale-selective scheme, which restricts the numbers of upper and lower grid points based on the data resolution and eddy spatial scale. Under such conditions, overestimated eddy boundaries will be flexibly removed. Furthermore, an effective overlap scheme is used to track eddies by calculating the intersection ratio of time-step-successive eddies. The SEIA generates approximately 1.6 million anticyclonic eddies and 1.5 million cyclonic eddies by the satellite altimetry product from the French Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data (AVISO) over a 29-year period (1993-2021; https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.o00035.00004). Assessments of the global distribution of eddies, eddy propagation speed, eddy path and evolution characteristics, and observation-based eddy hydrological conditions verify the validity of the SEIA. This study provides solid support for ocean eddy-related research in a warming climate.

TI  - The fusion of multiple scale data indicates that the carbon sink function of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is substantial
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the "sensitive area" of climate change, and also the "driver" and "amplifier" of global change. The response and feedback of its carbon dynamics to climate change will significantly affect the content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, due to the unique geographical environment characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, there is still much controversy about its carbon source and sink estimation results. This study designed a new algorithm based on machine learning to improve the accuracy of carbon source and sink estimation by integrating multiple scale carbon input (net primary productivity, NPP) and output (soil heterotrophic respiration, Rh) information from remote sensing and ground observations. Then, we compared spatial patterns of NPP and Rh derived from the fusion of multiple scale data with other widely used products and tried to quantify the differences and uncertainties of carbon sink simulation at a regional scale.ResultsOur results indicate that although global warming has potentially increased the Rh of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it will also increase its NPP, and its current performance is a net carbon sink area (carbon sink amount is 22.3 Tg C/year). Comparative analysis with other data products shows that CASA, GLOPEM, and MODIS products based on remote sensing underestimate the carbon input of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (30-70%), which is the main reason for the severe underestimation of the carbon sink level of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (even considered as a carbon source).ConclusionsThe estimation of the carbon sink in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is of great significance for ensuring its ecological barrier function. It can deepen the community's understanding of the response to climate change in sensitive areas of the plateau. This study can provide an essential basis for assessing the uncertainty of carbon sources and sinks in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and also provide a scientific reference for helping China achieve "carbon neutrality" by 2060.This study designed a carbon sink estimation method for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by integrating machine learning and multiple scale ground- and remote sensed-based data.The estimated total carbon sink of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 22.3 Tg C/year, accounting for about 10% of China's total carbon sink.The carbon sink of former estimation maybe greatly underestimated due to the underestimation of carbon input in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant carbon use efficiency (CUE) reflects the carbon assimilation ability and carbon sequestration potential of organisms, and is an important quantitative index in ecology. Therefore, investigating CUE can better understand and explore ecosystem carbon flux and carbon allocation patterns. In this paper, the Wuding River Basin is taken as the research area. MODIS were used to calculate CUE and explore its spatiotemporal variations. Using remote sensing environmental indicators (RSEI) extract ecological sources, and the MCR model were used to construct an ecological spatial network. By analogy with complex network theory, calculate topological indicators, and combine its ecological significance to investigate the relationship between CUE and these indicators, considering their ecological significance. The results are as follows: (1) The average CUE value slightly increased, with an overall increase in the southeastern part of the study area, minor changes in the southern parts, and an overall decrease in the western and northern parts of the basin. (2) CUE showed a strong positive correlation with closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, harmonic closeness centrality, and a negative correlation with eccentricity, while no significant correlation was found with component number.

TI  - Australia's Black Summer wildfires recovery: A difference-in-differences analysis using nightlights
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines how communities of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, recovered from the extreme wildfire event of 2019-2020 (i.e., the Black Summer fires). Using monthly night-time radiance as an indicator of economic activity in a geographic area (i.e., a mesh block) from January 2017 to June 2021, I conducted a spatiotemporal and socio-economic analysis of economic recovery after the 2019-2020 wildfires using the differencein-differences method. This is the first study to examine the intersectional role of space with time and socioeconomic characteristics for extreme wildfire recovery. The findings reveal that wildfire-affected locations had about 0.038 sigma and 0.026 sigma lower night-time radiance in major cities and rural hinterlands (i.e., inner regions), respectively, than the unaffected areas. These numbers translate to approximately 30% reduction in economic activities in both areas. The findings remain consistent when using Facebook's movement range data. The pace of recovery varied spatially across time and socio-economic groups. In rural hinterlands of NSW, wildfire-affected communities, both poor and non-poor, followed a slower recovery trajectory than wildfire-affected city dwellers. In major cities, the economic recovery of poor communities lagged behind non-poor communities. Accounting for such spatial, temporal and socio-economic heterogeneity in the natural hazard recovery process can support the design of equitable wildfire risk reduction and management strategies and programs. If unaddressed, gaps in wildfire recovery can increase location and economic group specific vulnerabilities to future wildfires. Note that nightlights are not a good proxy for economic activity in heavily forested remote and rural areas; thus limiting the application of the use of high frequency satellite data for wildfire recovery analysis only in major cities and rural hinterlands.

AB  - Quaternary unconsolidated sediments are pronouncedly widespread features on the planetary surface, documenting significant geological signals of earth surface processes, climate change and biogeochemical cycles. The extensive unconsolidated deposits play a vital role in natural hazards and Anthropogenic activities, especially in alpine regions where massive unconsolidated materials are produced. However, the spatial distribution and total volume of unconsolidated sediments across the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin (YTRB) remain largely unknown due to the limitation of traditional field surveys and on-site measurements as well as the complex landscape in the remote area. This study presents the datasets for the systematic distribution and spatial accumulation of unconsolidated sediments across the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin, southern Tibet. Combining remotely sensed data with numerous field investigations, an integrated method based on image processing and kriging interpolation-pixel integration was performed to semi-automatically classify and quantify the unconsolidated sediments. Eleven categories of sediments were mapped and their total accumulation is estimated at approximately 4.97 x 10(11) t. Ultimately, 17 groups of classification and thickness maps were derived, revealing the distribution and volume of unconsolidated and Quaternary sediments. The datasets fill the gaps in comprehensive investigations of unconsolidated sediments for YTRB, and provide a fundamental database to support the scientific understanding of potential linkages between the distribution of unconsolidated sediments with environmental changes and human activities.

AB  - Intelligent syndromic surveillance is an important part of multi-point triggering and multi-channel surveillance system of intelligent early warning of infectious diseases in China, and an inevitable development process of traditional syndromic surveillance as the constant emergence of new technologies. Intelligent syndromic surveillance collects not only the medical data of patients seeking medical care in hospitals but also massive non-medical information. However, along with its rapid development, challenges in intelligent syndromic surveillance have emerged, such as information explosion, cost-effective balance, information sharing, data security and privacy. This paper summarizes the concept and development of intelligent syndromic surveillance to provide references for the method and technique development of intelligent early warning of infectious diseases and new thought for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China and in the world.

TI  - Prediction of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis in acral melanoma with positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Metastasis in a nonsentinel lymph node (non-SLN) is an unfavorable independent prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma (CM). Recent data did suggest potential value of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in CM patients with non-SLN metastasis. Prediction of non-SLN metastasis assists clinicians in deciding on adjuvant therapy without CLND. We analyzed risk factors and developed a prediction model for non-SLN status in acral melanoma (AM).Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 656 cases of melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from 2009 to 2017. We identified 81 SLN + AM patients who underwent CLND. Clinicopathologic data, including SLN tumor burden and non-SLN status were examined with Cox and Logistics regression models.Results: Ulceration, Clark level, number of deposits in the SLN (NumDep) and maximum size of deposits (MaxSize) are independent risk factors associated with non-SLN metastases. We developed a scoring system that combines ulceration, the cutoff values of Clark level V, MaxSize of 2 mm, and NumDep of 5 to predict non- SLN metastasis with an efficiency of 85.2% and 100% positive predictive value in the high-rank group (scores of 17-24).Conclusions: A scoring system that included ulceration, Clark level, MaxSize, and NumDep is reliable and effective for predicting non-SLN metastasis in SLNpositive AM.

TI  - Improving MODIS Precipitable water vapour in mainland China based on the LSF model
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV) measurements derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) exhibit considerable promise for global high-resolution PWV monitoring but with limited accuracy. This study proposes a correction model for MODIS PWV, leveraging the least squares method (LS) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The study used Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) PWV products (the accuracy is equivalent to Radiosonde-derived PWV) from 230 stations provided by the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) for 2016 to 2019, serving as the ground truth for correcting MODIS PWV. Subsequently, the model undergoes an external coincidence test utilising the data from 2020. Initially, a linear or quadratic expression (LS model) was established through the application of the least squares method, effectively capturing the trends between the two PWV datasets. Then the periodic characteristics of residuals from the LS model were analysed by FFT. The outcomes reveal that within regions and seasons abundant in PWV, the quadratic expression is more consistent with the trend. The primary variation period of residuals exhibits variability across regions, with the annual period emerging as the primary fluctuation pattern in the majority of regions. Following this, we constructed the correction model (LSF model) that considered the cycle characteristics of residuals with the model type adopted for the LS model as the main part. After correction by the LSF model, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of MODIS PWV decreased by 33.1%, 55.8%, 33.0%, and 19.4% in four seasons, respectively. Compared to the LS model, the LSF model showcased relative enhancements of the coefficient of determinations (R2) by 119.8%, 99.6%, 165.9%, and 39.6% in the four seasons, respectively, with an overall further decrease of 35.7% in RMSE. The LSF model demonstrates a superior degree of fitting and yields improved correction (c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Discontinuity of sediment transport from the Bohai Sea to the open sea dominated by the wind direction
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sediment transport of the Bohai Sea through the Bohai Strait is a key issue in coastal shelf research. Based on remote sensing data and numerical simulation results, the sediment transport from the Bohai Sea to the Yellow sea is temporally discontinuous, and the surface and bottom layers exhibit two distinct processes. Further analysis showed that discontinuities are caused by differences in stratification intensity due to wind directions. During strong northwesterly winds, suspended sediments from the Bohai Sea can be transported along the Laizhou Bay through the southern part of Bohai Strait. And northeasterly wind can strengthen the stratification by driving stronger the Yellow Sea Warm Current. Strong stratification significantly inhibited the upward diffusion of the bottom suspended sediments. Stratification with different intensities can affect the efficiency of sediment transport, which can overcome the limitations of the sediment transport mechanism in the Bohai Sea. The insights obtained in this study into the effect of stratification on sediment transport could benefit further exploration of other hydrological mechanisms in coastal shelf seas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION SPIRITUALITY & AGING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Although one of the fastest-growing ethnic minority groups in the US, South Asians (SA) remain underrepresented in research, public health programs, and policies. South Asian American older adults, many of whom migrate later in life to reunite with their adult children, are particularly disadvantaged given the limited availability of culturally congruent health and social care, thus often adversely affecting their ability to age well. Furthermore, recent ethnogerontological research suggests that the meanings attached to aging well may differ across cultures. This qualitative study attempts to bridge this gap in knowledge by foregrounding the stories of SA older adults and their perceptions of aging well. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with South Asian Americans 50 years and older (n = 32; 18 women; 14 men). Thematic analysis of the interview data showed that aging well for participants entailed (1) gerotranscendence, reflected in a less materialistic and more cosmic worldview, graceful acceptance of death, and an increase in altruistic behavior; and (2) generativity, wherein participants felt an obligation to preserve their role as cultural transmitters and keepers of traditional wisdom that they would pass on to the next generation. Religious faith and spiritual well-being facilitated, while communication gaps between generations acted as barriers to aging well. Increased volunteering opportunities, meaningful intergenerational engagement, and involvement in faith-based activities may enhance their subjective well-being and enable SA older adults to age well.

TI  - Investigating the effect of surface urban heat island on the trend of temperature changes
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has led to the emergence of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) and air pollution, necessitating comprehensive investigations into the urbanization process. This study explores the impact of urbanization on temperature trends in northern Iran using remote sensing and neural networks. MODIS images from 2001, 2010, and 2019 were employed to determine climatic features and vegetation levels. SUHI indices and the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) were utilized to assess ecological comfort and urban heat islands. Markov chain methods were used for forecasting future thermal pollution. The relationship between temperature, air pollutants, spectral indices, and thermal indices was investigated through regression analysis. Furthermore, multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were employed for predicting indicator values. The findings reveal an increase in thermal pollution indicated by elevated Land Surface Temperature (LST), SUHI, and UTFVI values, along with a decrease in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values between 2001 and 2019. The Urbanization Index (UI) values demonstrate a 5% increase in urban areas during the same period. The UTFVI values suggest a decline in ecological comfort due to urbanization and reduced vegetation, with the majority of the region experiencing the poorest thermal comfort in 2019. The SUHI index peaked at 11.72 in 2019, with the highest values observed in spring and the lowest in winter. Correlation analysis highlights a significant relationship between LST and various factors, including SUHI, UTFVI, CH4, SO2, and CO2, underscoring the influence of temperature increase on pollution escalation in the study area. Air pollution assessment indicates the highest concentration of CO gas in the northern and southern parts of the region. Tehran exhibits the highest CO gas levels at 0.051 ppm, while Golestan records the lowest at 0.012 ppm. SO2 levels reach their peak in northern regions (0.0088 ppm) and are lowest in southern regions (0 ppm). The Markov and CA-Markov chain methods predict that by 2050, approximately 50% of the region will experience high temperatures. Neural network results demonstrate that the LSTM method outperforms MLP and RBF methods, with R2 values of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively, indicating higher accuracy in LST prediction during testing and validation stages. Overall, this study highlights the potential of neural networks in predicting thermal pollution and facilitating effective land management strategies in urban areas.(c) 2023 COSPAR.

AB  - The rapid decline of Lake Urmia in northwest Iran, caused by both human and natural factors, motivated our utilization of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The objective was to identify the most effective reservoir outflow simulation scheme and assess the influence of land use changes in the Zarrineh River basin on Lake Urmia. The target release approach for controlled reservoirs and the measured outflow schemes were evaluated. Despite improved calibration results in the latter method, the former demonstrated superior performance during the validation phase. Three land use scenarios - a model with the 2001 land use map, a model with the 2008 land use map, and a model with a gradually updating land use map - were considered. The gradually updating land use scenario exhibited a significant enhancement in validation results; it showed a 250% increase in water yield, while evapotranspiration declined by 3%.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of air pollution in Tehran, Isfahan, Semnan, Mashhad, Golestan, and Shiraz during the Corona era and before. For this purpose, Sentinel satellite images were used to investigate the concentration of Methane (CH4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), aerosol pollutants in In the era before and during Corona. Furthermore, greenhouse effect-prone areas were determined in this study. In the following, the state of air inversion in the studied area was determined by taking the temperature on the surface of the earth and in the upper atmosphere, as well as the wind speed into account. In this research, the prediction of air temperature for the year 2040 was conducted using the Markov and Cellular Automaton (CA)-Markov methods, considering the impact of air pollution on the air temperature of metropolises. Additionally, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods have been developed to determine the relationship between pollutants, areas prone to air inversions, and temperature values. According to the results, pollution caused by pollutants has decreased in the Corona era. According to the results, there is more pollution in Tehran and Isfahan metropolises. In addition, the results showed that air inversions in Tehran is the highest. Additionally, the results showed a high correlation between temperature and pollution levels (R2 = 0.87). Thermal indices in the studied area indicate that Isfahan and Tehran, with high values of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) and being in the 6th class of thermal comfort (Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI)), are affected by thermal pollution. The results showed that parts of southern Tehran province, southern Semnan and northeastern Isfahan will have higher temperatures in 2040 (class 5 and 6). Finally, the results of the neural network method showed that the MLP method with R2 = 0.90 is more accurate than the RBF method in predicting pollution amounts. This study significantly contributes by introducing innovative advancements through the application of RBF and MLP methods to assess air pollution levels during the COVID-19 and pre-pandemic periods, while also investigating the intricate relationships among greenhouse gases, air inversion, air temperature, and pollutant indices within the atmosphere. The utilization of these methods notably enhances the accuracy and reliability of pollution predictions, amplifying the originality and significance of this research.(c) 2023 COSPAR.

AB  - Objectives: To understand the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and related factors in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shandong Province, and provide reference for the promotion of PrEP and PEP in MSM. Methods: From April to July in 2022, MSM were recruited from 7 sentinel surveillance sites in Shandong Province for a questionnaire survey, and the sample size of each city site was 400. The information about sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, the uses of PrEP and PEP and others were collected from the MSM, and blood samples were collected from them for HIV and syphilis testing. Results: A total of 2 815 MSM were investigated, the majority of them were aged less than 30 years (55.7%, 1 569/2 815), unmarried (68.6%, 1 931/2 815) and had education background of college and above (56.5%, 1 590/2 815). Only 9.2% (258/2 815) had used PrEP and 10.8% (305/2 815) had used PEP. Multivariate logistic regression showed that factors associated with high likelihood of PrEP use in MSM included age ≤30 years (aOR=4.04, 95%CI:1.25-13.01), self-perceived lower risk of HIV infection (aOR=1.76, 95%CI:1.16-2.68), group sex and commercial sex in the past six months (aOR=1.51, 95%CI: 1.10-2.09; aOR=1.69, 95%CI: 1.16-2.47), new-type drug use (aOR=1.53, 95%CI: 1.11-2.11), receiving peer education (aOR=1.56, 95%CI: 1.03-2.37), other people using PrEP (aOR=3.29, 95%CI: 2.48-4.36), and being HIV negative (aOR=8.40, 95%CI:1.12-63.12). Factor associated with low likelihood of PrEP use in MSM was anal sex with casual partner (aOR=0.67, 95%CI:0.49-0.90). Factors associated with high likelihood of PEP use in MSM included age under 50 years (≤30 years old: aOR=2.41, 95%CI:1.02-5.69; 31-49 years old: aOR=3.33, 95%CI:1.42-7.85), no self-perceived risk for HIV infection (aOR=1.87, 95%CI:1.12-3.11), group sex in the past six months (aOR=1.68, 95%CI:1.23-2.29), new-type drug use (aOR=3.86, 95%CI:2.94-5.07) and receiving no peer education (aOR=1.54, 95%CI:1.12-2.12). Conclusions: In Shandong, a higher proportion of MSM used PrEP and PEP. Peer education and self-perceived HIV infection risk education should be strengthened to increase the rates of PrEP and PEP use in MSM.
AB  - 目的： 了解山东省MSM的HIV暴露前后预防（PrEP/PEP）用药情况并分析相关因素，为PrEP/PEP工作的推广提供参考依据。 方法： 2022年4-7月在山东省7个城市监测哨点招募MSM进行问卷调查，每个城市样本量为400人。收集MSM社会人口学、性行为、PrEP/PEP用药等信息，并采集血标本做HIV和梅毒抗体检测。 结果： 研究对象MSM共2 815人，以≤30岁（55.7%，1 569/2 815）、未婚（68.6%，1 931/2 815）、大专及以上文化程度（56.5%，1 590/2 815）为主。PrEP用药者占9.2%（258/2 815）；PEP用药者占10.8%（305/2 815）。多因素logistic回归分析结果显示，MSM中PrEP用药的可能性较高的相关因素包括年龄≤30岁（aOR=4.04，95%CI：1.25~13.01）、自我认知HIV感染风险较低（aOR=1.76，95%CI：1.16~2.68）、最近6个月发生群交行为（aOR=1.51，95%CI：1.10~2.09）、最近6个月发生同性商业性行为（aOR=1.69，95%CI：1.16~2.47）、使用新型毒品（aOR=1.53，95%CI：1.11~2.11）、接受同伴教育（aOR=1.56，95%CI：1.03~2.37）、知晓别人PrEP用药（aOR=3.29，95%CI：2.48~4.36）、HIV抗体阴性（aOR=8.40，95%CI：1.12~63.12）；MSM中PrEP用药的可能性较低的相关因素为主要性伴为临时性伴（aOR=0.67，95%CI：0.49~0.90）。MSM中PEP用药的可能性较高的相关因素包括年龄<50岁（≤30岁：aOR=2.41，95%CI：1.02~5.69；31~49岁：aOR=3.33，95%CI：1.42~7.85）、自我认知无HIV感染风险（aOR=1.87，95%CI：1.12~3.11）、最近6个月发生群交行为（aOR=1.68，95%CI：1.23~2.29）、使用新型毒品（aOR=3.86，95%CI：2.94~5.07）以及未接受同伴教育（aOR=1.54，95%CI：1.12~2.12）。 结论： 山东省MSM的PrEP/PEP用药比例较高。应加强同伴教育和自我认知HIV风险教育，提高MSM中PrEP/PEP用药的使用率。.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial Net ecosystem productivity in the ASEAN from 2001 to 2020 based on remote sensing and improved CASA model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has attracted considerable attention for its rich land ecosystem productivity. However, recent excessive human disturbances may have triggered significant transformations. Consequently, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystem productivity in this region is crucial for strengthening regional ecological sustainability and implementing climate change mitigation strategies. In this study, we harnessed multi-source remote sensing data, an improved CASA model, Theil-Sen Median estimators, Mann-Kendall tests, and Hurst exponent to estimate the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the ASEAN region and simulate its spatiotemporal dynamics change. The results showed that the mean annual NEP from 2001 to 2020 in ASEAN was 396.83gC/m2, exhibiting a gradual downward trend. From a spatiotemporal tendency perspective, the areas of NEP decline in the ASEAN region far outweighed the areas of increase, with 60.03% of the total area showing a decrease in NEP, 33.14% showing a boost, and 6.83% showing no significant change. In terms of change persistence, 79.3% of NEP demonstrated anti-persistence, indicating a stronger trend of NEP change reversal. Coupling analysis results indicated that the areas with a future increasing trend of NEP constituted 36.11% of the total area, while areas with no significant future change accounted for 0.08%, areas with a future decreasing trend included 25.21%, and 38.6% of the region exhibited uncertain future trends. Researchers should continually monitor areas with decreasing NEP and uncertain future trends. This study, driven by remote sensing data and combined with the improved CASA model, has successfully estimated the Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) at both site and regional scales. The analysis results of NEP in the ASEAN region have enhanced our comprehension of the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation carbon balance changes in ASEAN, providing data support for formulating "low-carbon economy" strategies and promoting the sustainable development of regional ecosystems.

TI  - A regional, remote sensing-based approach to mapping land degradation in the Little Karoo, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing global consensus that assessments of land degradation be conducted at regional or smaller scales. Working at this scale allows for locally relevant environmental and land use conditions to be incorporated into the assessment methodology. In this paper, a recently developed regional approach to assessing land degradation in the Hardeveld bioregion of the Succulent Karoo is applied to the Little Karoo region of this biome. The methodology uses fuzzy classification statistical techniques to combine field data with multiple Sentinel-2A and Landsat vegetation indices, as well as regionally modelled soil variables. The resultant habitat condition archetype map values show strong correlation with field observations of perennial plant and bare soil cover in 96 ground-truthed plots. The archetype map indicates that heavily degraded hotspots of high bare ground cover occur throughout the project region, although there is an overall lower average habitat condition in the western half of the Little Karoo. The mean habitat condition archetype value for the entire project area is 0.54 (standard deviation = 0.13), on a continuous scale where 0 and 1 represent the most degraded and pristine extremes, respectively. Random forest regression analysis of various environmental covariates of degradation indicates a strong relationship between habitat condition and topographic as well as rainfall variables, although the limited accuracy of modelled livestock data may obscure the negative impacts of overgrazing. The 30 m resolution habitat condition archetype map builds upon previous degradation research in the Little Karoo and has the potential to inform future conservation, restoration, and rangeland management decisions. The methodology was successfully transferred to a new region and provides an opportunity to improve reporting on the extent of land degradation across South Africa.

TI  - Investigation and validation of two all-weather land surface temperature products with in-situ measurements
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The need for cross-comparison and validation of all-weather Land Surface Temperature (LST) products has arisen due to the release of multiple such products aimed at providing comprehensive all-weather monitoring capabilities. In this study, we focus on validating two well-established all-weather LST products (i.e. MLST-AS and TRIMS LST) against in-situ measurements obtained from four high-quality LST validation sites: Evora, Gobabeb, KIT-Forest, and Lake Constance. For the land sites, MLST-AS exhibits better accuracy, with RMSEs ranging from 1.6 K to 2.1 K, than TRIMS LST, the RMSEs of which range from 1.9 K to 3.1 K. Because MLST-AS pixels classified as "inland water" are masked out, the validation over Lake Constance is limited to TRIMS LST: it yields a RMSE of 1.6 K. Furthermore, the validation results show that MLST-AS and TRIMS LST exhibit better accuracy under clear-sky conditions than unclear-sky conditions across all sites. Since the accuracy of the all-weather LST products is considerably affected by the input clear-sky LST products, we further compare the all-weather LST with the corresponding input clear-sky LST to conduct an error source analysis. Considering the clear-sky pixels on MLST-AS directly using the estimates from MLST, the error source analysis is limited to examining TRIMS LST and its input (i.e. MODIS LST). The findings indicate that TRIMS LST is highly correlated with MODIS LST. The investigation and validation of the two selected all-weather LST products objectively evaluate their accuracy and stability, which provides important information for applications of these all-weather LST products.

TI  - Post-earthquake recovery monitoring and driving factors analysis of the 2014 Ludian <i>M</i><sub>s</sub>6.5 earthquake in Yunnan, China based on LUCC
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The occurrence of earthquakes has been recognized as a natural disaster capable of significantly impacting land use/cover change (LUCC) patterns. During the post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction phase, obtaining an accurate and scientific grounded understanding of the LUCC process in the affected area is essential for analyzing the subsequent changes in recovery and identifying the underlying driving forces. In this study, we selected the 2014 Ludian Ms6.5 earthquake as the focal point of our research. Through the utilization of Google Earth Engine and Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing image, we employed the Random Forest classification algorithm to analyze the structural and transformational changes of LUCC in Ludian County prior to and post the earthquake. In addition, we produced comprehensive post-earthquake damage map and recovery map through the LUCC transfer amount to analyze each township's damage and recovery degree quantitatively. Finally, we employed the geographic detector to investigate the driving factors contributing to the post-earthquake recovery degree. As is demonstrated by our results, the earthquake inflicted substantial damage on cropland, grassland, and built-up areas, with Longtoushan Town and Huodehong Town suffering the most severe damage. After three years, we found that cropland and built-up areas had been restored, while previously unused land had been successfully treated, yielding initial restoration progress. Upon reaching the six-year mark, built-up areas continued to expand, while cropland acreage exhibited a decline in comparison to the P1 and P2 phases. Concurrently, forest and grassland areas increased relative to the P1 and P2 phases, signifying Ludian County's successful restoration. The factor detection results show that socio-economic factors are potent factors that promote post-earthquake recovery, and the earthquake factors also have a continuous impact. The research results can serve as a valuable reference for informing local disaster area reconstruction planning as well as ensuring effective protection of ecological environment.

TI  - How do new mothers describe their postpartum sexual quality of life? a qualitative study
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSexuality plays a critical role in a woman's postpartum quality of life and also has a strong impact on the quality of her relationship. Given the sparse body of published literature on the subject, we aimed to explore how new mothers explain their postpartum sexual quality of life.MethodA qualitative study was carried out in Iran and Switzerland from December 2018 to March 2019. Focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with mothers in the first four months after parturition. Mothers who were older than 18 years, were married or in a stable relationship, and experienced a low-risk vaginal birth or cesarean section participated in the study. We used Graneheim and Lundman's approach for analyzing the data. Multiple data collection methods, maximum variation sampling, and peer checks were applied to enhance the rigor of the data.ResultsWe achieved data saturation after two focus group discussions (FGDs), 15 IDIs in Iran, and 13 IDIs in Switzerland. We extracted three themes for postpartum sexual quality of life: (a) sexual worldview, (b) interpersonal relationship, and (c) postpartum sex storm. The participants described sexual worldview as "sexual beliefs", "sexual perceptions", and "sexual behaviors". The interpersonal relationship consists of "changes in postpartum interpersonal relationships" and "supportive role of the husbands/partners". The last one, postpartum sex storm, has three categories including "direct changes in sexual life", "indirect changes in sexual life", and "resumption of sexual intercourse". Differences between the two cultures were identified in some subcategories such as "sexual interests", "comparable to the first intercourse in life", "negative sexual behaviors of husbands/partners", "positive sexual behavior of mothers", "helping with child care and housework", and "emotional support".ConclusionNew mothers explained postpartum sexual quality of life as a three-theme phenomenon. Although most results were similar in both cultures, there were some differences. Our study's results suggest that sexual quality of life is a topic that encompasses international as well as cultural aspects.

TI  - A 10-m resolution impervious surface area map for the greater Mekong subregion from remote sensing images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution and multi-temporal impervious surface area maps are crucial for capturing rapidly developing urbanization patterns. However, the currently available relevant maps for the greater Mekong subregion suffer from coarse resolution and low accuracy. Addressing this issue, our study focuses on the development of accurate impervious surface area maps at 10-m resolution for this region for the period 2016-2022. To accomplish this, we present a new machine-learning framework implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform that merges Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar images and Sentinel-2 Multispectral images to extract impervious surfaces. Furthermore, we also introduce a training sample migration strategy that eliminates the collection of additional training samples and automates multi-temporal impervious surface area mapping. Finally, we perform a quantitative assessment with validation samples interpreted from Google Earth. Results show that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the final impervious surface area maps range from 92.75% to 92.93% and 0.854 to 0.857, respectively. This dataset provides comprehensive measurements of impervious surface coverage and configuration that will help to inform urban studies.

TI  - Intraoperative assessment of axillary sentinel lymph nodes by telepathology
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeAlthough axillary dissection is no longer indicated for many breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive axillary sentinel lymph nodes (ASLN), intraoperative ASLN assessment is still performed in many institutions for patients undergoing mastectomy or neoadjuvant therapy. With recent advancements in digital pathology, pathologists increasingly evaluate ASLN via remote telepathology. We aimed to compare the performance characteristics of remote telepathology and conventional on-site intraoperative ASLN assessment.MethodsData from ASLN evaluation for breast cancer patients performed at two sites between April 2021 and October 2022 was collated. Remote telepathology consultation was conducted via the Aperio eSlideManager system.ResultsA total of 385 patients were identified during the study period (83 telepathology, 302 on-site evaluations). Although not statistically significant (P = 0.20), the overall discrepancy rate between intraoperative and final diagnoses was slightly higher at 9.6% (8/83) for telepathology compared with 5.3% (16/302) for on-site assessment. Further comparison of performance characteristics of ASLN assessment between telepathology and conventional on-site evaluation revealed no statistically significant differences between deferral rates, discrepancy rates, interpretive or sampling errors, major or minor disagreements, false negative or false positive results as well as clinical impact and turn-around time (P & GE; 0.12).ConclusionASLN assessment via telepathology is not significantly different from conventional on-site evaluation, although it shows a slightly higher overall discrepancy rate between intraoperative and final diagnoses (9.6% vs. 5.3%). Further studies are warranted to ensure accuracy of ASLN assessment via telepathology.

TI  - Zero-Sharpen: A universal pansharpening method across satellites for reducing scale-variance gap via zero-shot variation
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a technique that combines a high-resolution panchromatic image (HRPAN) and a low-resolution multi-spectral image (LRMS) to generate a high-resolution multi-spectral image (HRMS). Traditional methods perform sharpening based on given image pairs, but their performance is limited due to the employment of scale-varying linear mapping assumptions. Existing deep-learning-based methods can establish arbitrary non-linear sharpening functions based on large-scale training data. However, supervised methods suffer from scale-variance generalization for training on the simulated reduced resolution data, while unsuper-vised methods arise distortion for the absence of reference and introduction of inaccurate spectral observation assumptions. Besides, the generic satellite-specific learning (i.e. training and testing on the homologous satellite data) causes low generalization when processing the heterologous satellite data. To this end, we combine the advantages of deep learning and variational optimization, to propose a universal pansharpening method that can be applied across different satellites with reducing the scale variance, termed as Zero-Sharpen. On the one hand, we build image-pair-specific neural networks to extend the spatial mapping and spectral observation assumptions to the nonlinear space. These assumptions are incorporated as deep spatial prior and deep spectral observation prior for regularization, assisting variational models to iteratively adapt to the full-resolution scale. On the other hand, the variational optimization mechanism also promotes the optimization of deep networks so as to achieve the preservation of spectral and spatial information in a zero-shot learning manner. In doing so, our method can be easily available across different satellites. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Baixuzx7/ZeroSharpen.

TI  - Reservoir inventory for China in 2016 and 2021
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir inventories are essential for investigating the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water scape changes. They provide fundamental data sources to explore the sustainability and management efficiency of water resources. However, publicly released reservoir inventories are currently limited to a single temporal domain. As a result, the effectiveness of governmental policy implementation on water resources remains to be explored due to the lack of multi-time datasets. In this study, we generated a reservoir inventory for China for the years 2016 and 2021 with an overall accuracy of 99.71%. The reservoirs were visually interpreted from annually composited Landsat images, and each reservoir is represented by a polygon with attributes of reservoir name, area and storage capacity. About 10.32% of the reservoirs have increased storage capacity from 2016 to 2021, while 22.73% have decreased. Most provinces and river basins in China have expanded their accumulated storage capacity from 2016 to 2021.

TI  - Monitoring of large-scale forest restoration: Evidence of vegetation recovery and reversing chronic ecosystem degradation in the mountain region of Pakistan
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global ecosystem restoration efforts are aimed at climate change mitigation. In response to the challenge of global warming and supporting local adaptation, the Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Program (BTAP) was launched in 2014 to restore depleted forest ecosystems by extensive afforestation and/or reforestation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. Under the BTAP, afforestation of all categories was carried out in an area of 300,000 ha, and 160 million plants were distributed under Farm Forestry and 4509 enclosures were established for Assisting Natural Regeneration (ANR) with the help of the local community. The present study evaluated historic deforestation trends using bi-temporal (1990-2010) change analysis and the performance of recent forest ecosystem restoration efforts based on time series analysis of stallite images. A total of 226 afforestation sites of the BTAP - Phase I were examined to determine the vegetation growth and evidence of ecosystem restoration efforts by regression and trend analysis of the annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites from 2014 to 2021. The forest plantation and protected natural regeneration performance across the three key forest management regions of the Southern, Malakand and Northern zones remained variable, with growth values of 29%, 47% and 24%, respectively. The results suggest that the three forest regions lost 3.2% of the forest between 1990 and 2010. While accounting for most conservative figures validated from satellite data, the BTAP interventions during 2014-2018 improved the overall forest cover from 14.5% to 16.5% in these regions. The framework developed in this study and the derived results can help to formulate an evidence-based assessment of indicators for ecological restoration and nature-based solutions.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping of Al Taif urban area, Saudi Arabia, using remote sensing data and microtremor measurements: integrated approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many people are killed by landslides due to earthquakes or severe rain, and structures and facilities built on or near slopes sustain significant damage. Such landslides on naturally occurring slopes can be large enough to utterly destroy towns or communities. Based on remote sensing and microtremor data, the area around Al Taif has been evaluated for its susceptibility to landslides. Digital elevation model (DEM), slope angle, and slope aspect thematic layers were used to depict remote sensing data. The landslide susceptibility was extracted from remote sensing thematic data. The elevations of the Al Taif area, which range from 832 to 2,594 m amsl, were identified based on the DEM. Al Taif's slope angles range from 0 & DEG; to 67.3 & DEG; degrees. Nearly flat (0 & DEG; to 4.75 & DEG;), moderate (4.75 & DEG; to 11.1 & DEG;), steep (11.2 & DEG; to 29.1 & DEG;), and very steep slope (& LE;29.1 & DEG;) are the different classifications for the slope. Additionally, measurements of the microtremor have been taken at 42 locations throughout the region. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) approach was used to process and analyze microtremor data in order to determine the resonance frequency and H/V amplification factor. The findings show that, while the amplification factor varies from 1.17 to 9.28, the dominant frequency values fall between 0.3 and 12.75 Hz. To determine the frequency, amplitude, and azimuthal site response, 11 sites were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the direction of the site response in the sliding areas was parallel to the landslide directional response, indicating that the site response direction tracked the landslide direction. Practical approval of the study's findings has been given at a number of locations by field measurements at some of the Taif urban area's most recent landslide occurrence areas. These findings show that the integration between remote sensing and microtremor measurements is a useful tool for pinpointing landslide-prone areas, which helps to lessen the danger to people's lives and property. This susceptibility zonation applied to the Al Taif area has produced a good match between the distribution of the reported landslides and the zones of high susceptibility. To define the general trend and geographic distribution of potentially unstable slopes and landslide potential zones, this study's findings must be used as a guide.

TI  - Perceived expert and laypeople consensus predict belief in local conspiracy theories in a non-WEIRD culture: Evidence from Turkey
T2  - JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Past research has shown that perceived scientific consensus (or lack thereof) on an issue predicts belief in misinformation. In the current study (N = 729), we investigated how perceived consensus among both experts and laypeople predicts beliefs in localized and specific conspiracy theories in Turkey, a non-WEIRD country. Participants in our study were found to overestimate consensus among both experts and laypeople regarding baseless conspiracy theories surrounding the alleged secret articles of the Lausanne Treaty and unused mining reserves in Turkey. Notably, conspiracy believers exhibited a higher tendency to overestimate consensus compared to non-believers. Furthermore, perceived expert consensus had a stronger association with conspiracy beliefs than perceived laypeople consensus. We also explored the correlates of conspiracy beliefs and perceived consensus, including socioeconomic factors, worldview, cognitive sophistication, and personality. The results further indicate that the correlations between belief and perceived consensus manifest with comparable magnitudes, irrespective of the specific conspiracy theories under consideration. These findings support the potential of perceived consensus as an important factor for understanding conspiracy beliefs.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of landscape fragmentation on ecosystem services: A three-decade perspective
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape fragmentation and structure play a crucial role in determining the provision of ecosystem services. Although there has been extensive research on the impact of shifting land use and land cover on ecosystem services, the specific effect of landscape fragmentation on the value of these services has not yet been quantified. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationship between landscape fragmentation and Ecosystem service value (ESV). The findings indicate that ESV is negatively associated with the increasing conversion of landscapes into smaller patches. To conduct this analysis, a mapping methodology was employed using Landsat images from four different time periods (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). The fragmentation analysis resulted in the identification of six hierarchical landscape parts: patch, edge, perforated, small core, medium core, and large core. ESV for a typical land use and land cover was calculated using a weighted Coefficient value (CV) based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), while ESV for fragmented landscapes was estimated using Costanza's Coefficient Value from the years 1997 and 2014. The deterioration of eco-regions in terms of quality can be attributed to fragmented vegetation and water bodies. This degradation has resulted in a decrease in the ecosystem service value (ESV) of specific areas from 62.07 million USD/year to 50.56 million USD/year between 1990 and 2020. In 1990, the ESV of agricultural land was 381.04 USD/year, while that of built-up areas was 15.83 USD/year. However, by 2020, these values had increased to 431.05 USD/year and 105.33 USD/year, respectively. Furthermore, in the fractured landscape of 2020, the service values of water bodies were significantly lower compared to the past. It is important to note that anthropogenic influences play a significant role in driving land use changes and causing the transformation and fragmentation of ecosystem services in naturally occurring landscapes.

TI  - An integrated biological effects assessment of the discharge water into the Sunndalsfjord from an aluminium smelter
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated biological effects study using field transplanted mussels was applied to determine the potential biological effects of an effluent discharge from an aluminium smelter into a Norwegian fjord. Chemical body burden and biological effects were measured in mussels positioned downstream (1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 km) from the aluminium smelters discharge for a period of 6 weeks. A suite of biomarkers, from whole organism to subcellular responses were measured. Chemical concentrations in mussel tissues were low; however, a change in the PAC (polyaromatic compound) profile from high to low pyrogenic influence provided evidence of exposure to the smelter's effluent. Overall, the biological responses observed where greater in the mussels positioned closest to the smelter (1-5 km). Lowest chemical accumulation and biomarker responses were observed in mussels positioned 10 km from the smelter and were considered as the reference field population. Mussels located furthest from the smelter (20 km) exhibited significant biomarker responses and suggested a different contaminant source within the fjord. The integrated biological response index (IBR) was applied and reflected the expected level of exposure to the smelters discharge, with highest IBR calculated in mussels positioned closest to the discharge (1-5 km). Principal component analysis (PCA) also differentiated among mussel groups, with the most impacted located closest to the smelter. Not one chemical factor could explain the biological responses observed in mussels, but the presence of PAH16, PAH41 and metals Mn, Ni and Cr were the main contributors measured to the higher stress seen in the mussels from the 1 and 5 km groups.

TI  - Role of parasitoids and landscape structure in aphid population dynamics in winter canola
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Three aphid species infest winter canola, Brassica napus L. fields in central Oklahoma and are serious pests: the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae L., green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and turnip aphid, Lipaphis pseudobrassicae (Davis). Mortality caused by parasitoids may be an important component of biological control of aphids in Oklahoma canola fields. Therefore, it is important to determine the effect of parasitoids on aphids in canola and the factors that affect it. We undertook a study during three consecutive growing seasons to: 1) estimate aphid suppression by parasitoids in each of 23 canola fields using cages that excluded natural enemies and cages that permitted access by parasitoids; and 2) evaluate how aphid parasitism in canola is related to the composition and configuration of the landscape surrounding each canola field. Parasitism was estimated using turnip aphid infested sentinel canola plants stationed in each field in autumn and in spring of each growing season. Two parasitoids with broad host ranges, Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) and Aphelinus nigritus (Howard), parasitized turnip aphids in canola. There were fewer aphids and more parasitoids in cages that permitted access to parasitoids than in cages that excluded natural enemies. Partial redundancy analysis demonstrated that parasitism rate by D. rapae was positively related to landcover of wetlands and negatively related to contagion of patches. Parasitism by A. nigritus was positively but weakly associated with landcover of summer crops, but not with any other measured landscape variable. Wetlands in central Oklahoma agricultural landscapes apparently are habitat for aphid parasitoids from which they disperse to canola fields and parasitize aphids. Partial redundancy analysis showed that relative aphid density in fields was negatively related to parasitism by D. rapae. Results indicate that parasitoids suppress aphid infestations in canola fields and demonstrate potential for habitat management to improve biological control of aphids in canola.

TI  - A deep learning framework for crop mapping with reconstructed Sentinel-2 time series images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate access to regional scale crop plant area and spatial distribution is essential for regional agricultural production and food security, especially in the context of global population growth and climate change. Deep learning has become prevalent in crop mapping under complex conditions due to its powerful feature extraction and nonlinear ability. This study proposes a time-series image classification framework using Attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (A-BiGRU) to map rice, maize, and soybean in Fujin, China, from reconstructed Sentinel-2 time-series images. Firstly, the reconstructed Sentinel-2 time-series images with 10 spectral dimensions and 22 temporal dimensions were obtained by linear interpolation and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Then, a neural network, the A-BiGRU was developed to identify different crops by taking advantage of their unique growth patterns. The attention mechanism enables temporal neural networks to focus on the critical growth periods of crops. Additionally, the structure of GRU is simpler than that of long short-term memory (LSTM) and simple recurrent neural network (SRNN), which reduces the number of parameters and alleviates overfitting. Compared to GRU, BiGRU can fully uses the time-series information of the entire crop growth cycle. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared two deep learning methods (LSTM and SRNN) and three widely used non-deep learning classifiers (Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results demonstrate that A-BiGRU achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 0.9804, a macro F1 score of 0.9788 and a kappa score of 0.9714. We also selected four typical regions and compared the classification results with optical images, which showed that the proposed method has a good recognition effect. Therefore, the A-BiGRU method is capable of achieving highprecision crop mapping.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: The current study was performed to evaluate the incidence of positive lymph nodes (LNs) in relation to known pathological risk factors, specifically among patients with apparent low-grade, small tumors.Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to retrospectively identify patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019, with known tumor size and regional LN examined. A comparison between patients who had positive and negative LNs was conducted to identify risk factors for LN metastases in relation to survival. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with diagnosed grade 1 vulvar SCC and tumor size up to 2 cm according to the status of LNs.Results: Multivariate analysis found that both grade of disease and tumor size were significant factors in predicting LN status. Among patients with low-grade small tumors up to 2 cm, the odds ratio for positive LNs was 2.5 for those with tumor size larger than 1 cm. In a multivariate survival analysis, older age, larger tumor size, and positive LNs were independently associated with decreased survival.Conclusions: The current study confirms that among small tumors, those larger than 1 cm have a significantly increased risk for positive nodes compared with those smaller than 1 cm, and, among this specific group, patients with positive nodes have decreased survival. Future studies are needed to answer the question of whether, in the era of the sentinel node procedure, it is safe to omit LN evaluation altogether.

TI  - Retrieval of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Arabian Gulf water of arid region by Sentinel-2 data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in water increases temperature and turbidity, limits the photosynthesis of aquatic plants, and reduces biologically available oxygen. It is important to study SSC in the coastal waters of the Arabian Gulf. Thus, this study mapped the SSC of coastal water between Al Arish and Al Ghariyah in northern Qatar using the spectral bands of the MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 by calculating the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index and Normalized Suspended Material Index. The results are studied using the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. The mapping of SSC in the water using NDSSI showed the presence of a high concentration of suspended sediments between Al Arish and Al Mafjar and a low concentration between Al Mafjar and Al Ghariyah. The mapping of NSMI showed values between 0.012 (clear water) and 0.430 (more suspended material) for the occurrence of suspended materials and supported the results of NDSSI. The study of turbidity using an NDTI image showed turbidity index values ranging from -0.44 (clear water) to 0.12 (high turbidity) and confirmed the occurrence and distribution of suspended sediments and materials in the water. The MNDWI image was able to discriminate clear water with bright pixels from silty sand and mud flats. The relationships between NDSSI, NSMI, and NDTI were correlated with in-situ measurements and studied to find suitable indices to map SSC. Regression analyses showed the strongest relationship between NSMI and NDTI (R2 = 0.95) next to NDSSI and NDTI, where NDTI had the

AB  - Background Hospital mortality after acute myocardial infarction ( AMI, ICD- 10: I21-I22) is used as OECD indicator of the quality of acute care. The reported AMI hospital mortality in Germany is more than twice as high as in the Netherlands or Scandinavia. Yet, in Europe, Germany ranks high in health spending and availability of cardiac procedures. We provide insights into this contradictory situation.Methods Information was collected on possible factors causing the reported differences in AMI mortality such as prevalence of risk factors or comorbidities, guideline conform treatment, patient registration, and health system structures of European countries. International experts were interviewed. Data on OECD indicators 'AMI 30-day mortality using unlinked data' and 'average length of stay after AMI' were used to describe the association between these variables graphically and by linear regression.Results Differences in prevalence of risk factors or comorbidities or in guideline conform acute care account only to a smaller extent for the reported differences in AMI hospital mortality. It is influenced mainly by patient registration rules and organization of health care. Non-reporting of day cases as patients and centralization of AMI care-with more frequent inter-hospital patient transfers-artificially lead to lower calculated hospital mortality. Frequency of patient transfers and national reimbursement policies affect the average length of stay in hospital which is strongly associated with AMI hospital mortality (adj R-2 = 0.56). AMI mortality reported from registries is distorted by different underlying populations.Conclusion Most of the variation in AMI hospital mortality is explained by differences in patient registration and organization of care instead of differences in quality of care, which hinders cross-country comparisons of AMI mortality. Europe-wide sentinel regions with comparable registries are necessary to compare (acute) care after myocardial infarction.

T2  - Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: For some time now, the question of de-escalation in axillary staging in breast cancer patients has been raised. The aim is to improve the patients' quality of life and reduce morbidity by optimizing surgical strategies with a high level of oncological safety. This review offers a current overview of published evidence and clinical practice, aiming to guide the surgical community as they reassess and reshape their practices.RECENT FINDINGS: Years after introducing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node negative breast cancer patients several guidelines suggest completely omitting SLNB in older patients with low-risk tumors. It is worth noting that for patients with a metastatic sentinel lymph node in the upfront surgery setting, a de-escalation of axillary surgery may in fact lead to an escalation of radiation therapy. Currently, there is limited evidence on the axillary surgical approach for patients with initially positive node status achieving complete axillary response (ycN0), resulting in heterogenous guideline recommendations.SUMMARY: Innovative trials are contributing to a growing evidence on de-escalation of axillary surgery with the aim of reducing arm morbidity and improving long-term health-related quality of life.

TI  - Evaluation of fused multisource data of air temperature based on dropsonde and satellite observation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous vertical air temperature (AT) from in-situ observation is of crucial importance for understanding the atmospheric environment, but the satellite data that have complete spatial coverage lacked vertical in-situ observation data, and the vertical dropsonde data from in-situ observations only were single-point observations. Therefore, this article introduced machine learning algorithms for fusing in-situ observation and multi satellite data to achieve spatial continuity of vertical data on a large scale. Specially, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) were employed to capture the non-linear relationships between the variables and estimated AT. The pre-training process and fine-tuning process ensured the prediction of AT spatiotemporal distribution. The four models were implemented for three-dimensional AT estimating across China. Additionally, we used the radiosonde observation data to evaluate the accuracy of estimated AT data under conventional weather and typhoon conditions. Our results revealed that the RF model performed the best with the R of 0.9992, the MAE of 0.70 degrees C, and the RMSE of 1.04 degrees C at the national scale, followed by the SVR and ANN models. The RNN model exhibited promising results under typhoon conditions, which will be valuable insights for further research on the applicability of machine learning models under different weather conditions. Besides, having a larger sample size does not necessarily result in reduced errors. For instance, the MAE value for SVR in the pressure height range of 100-200 hPa was larger than that in the pressure height range of 300-400 hPa, but the former sample size was 16,324, which was 7433 higher than the latter.

TI  - Refined assessment of space-time changes, influencing factors and socio-economic impacts of the terrestrial ecosystem quality: A case study of the GBA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial ecosystem is the cradle of energy and material basis for human survival and development. However, there are large research deficits in accurately and finely depicting the quality of the terrestrial ecosystem (QTE) and assessing its changing triggers' contribution. Here, we summarized three major principles for selecting image sources in remote sensing data fusion. A continuous 30-m net vegetation productivity (NPP) dataset during 2000-2019 for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was derived by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model and pre-fused normalized difference vegetation index. The factors' contributions to the QTE changes were quantitatively assessed. The role of the QTE in affecting the socioeconomic and its behind mechanisms was quantitatively investigated. The results showed that: (1) Highquality images sources are the preference for spatio-temporal fusion of remote sensing data. Images with close month, the same season and year, and sensors should be then selected. Images of different sensors with similar spectral bandwidth, the ones from adjacent years and seasons, can be alternately considered. (2) Fine-resolution NPP has higher accuracy than coarse-resolution NPP and has marked advantages in finely characterizing the QTE. In the past 20 years, the QTE in the GBA has shown a fluctuating increasing trend (0.20 Tg C/yr). (3) Human activities contributed 54.19% of the QTE changes in the GBA, and dominates the QTE changes in the central rapidly urbanizing areas. Residual factors accounted for an overall contribution ratio of 35.71%. Climate change dominants the peripheral forest variations in the GBA. (4) In the GBA, the improvement of QTE has a significant positive socio-economic impact, it contributes to the GDP increment firstly then the GDP aggregate indirectly. Our results highlight that it is of great urgent to estimate long-term continuous NPP with high spatiotemporal resolution globally. Controlling strategies should be implemented to reduce factitious impacts on QTE. High level of ecological and environmental protection promotes the sustainable development.

TI  - Clinical practice consensus for the diagnosis and management of melanoma in Taiwan.
T2  - Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi
M3  - Practice Guideline
AB  - Melanoma is rare in Taiwan. Asian melanoma is distinct from Western melanoma because acral and mucosal melanoma accounts for the majority of melanoma cases, leading to distinct tumor behaviors and genetic profiling. With consideration of the clinical guidelines in Western countries, Taiwanese experts developed a local clinical practice consensus guideline. This consensus includes diagnosis, staging, and surgical and systemic treatment, based only on clinical evidence, local epidemiology, and available resources evaluated by experts in Taiwan. This consensus emphasizes the importance of surgical management, particularly for sentinel lymph node biopsies. In addition, molecular testing for BRAF is mandatory for patients before systemic treatment. Furthermore, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are prioritized for systemic treatment. This consensus aimed to assist clinicians in Taiwan in diagnosing and treating patients according to available evidence.

AB  - This article frames what one of my collaborators calls nuestra ciencia (our science) as a concept that expresses a transborder worldview based on region-specific scientific land and healing practices. I trace the ways Indigenous science came into fierce conflict with the twentieth-century wave of Anglo settler-colonial land grabs in south Texas and how the resulting force of mass agriculture enabled mass destruction and biodiversity loss in the region. It offers an environmental, archival, and ethnographic analysis of curanderismo (Mexican traditional medicine) as science and explores its relationship to settler colonialism, environmental degradation, and processes of racialization in relation to health, science, and medical technologies, as well as tracing the ongoing material record of its practice. I frame Mexican transborder healing traditions (curanderismo and plant medicine) as serious social, scientific, and ecological processes. I make it clear that although this practice is often considered a Mexican tradition, de-Indigenized mestizos also practice, exploit, and appropriate it, while its roots lie in Indigenous lifeways and knowledge.

TI  - Leveraging multimission satellite data for spatiotemporally coherent cyanoHAB monitoring
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) present a critical public health challenge for aquatic resource and public health managers. Satellite remote sensing is well-positioned to aid in the identification and mapping of cyanoHABs and their dynamics, giving freshwater resource managers a tool for both rapid and long-term protection of public health. Monitoring cyanoHABs in lakes and reservoirs with remote sensing requires robust processing techniques for generating accurate and consistent products across local and global scales at high revisit rates. We leveraged the high spatial and temporal resolution chlorophyll-a (Chla) and phycocyanin (PC) maps from two multispectral satellite sensors, the Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Sentinel-3 (S3) Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) respectively, to study bloom dynamics in Utah Lake, United States, for 2018. We used established Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to map Chla from MSI and train new MDNs for PC retrieval from OLCI, using the same architecture and training dataset previously proven for PC retrieval from hyperspectral imagery. Our assessment suggests lower median uncertainties and biases (i.e., 42% and -4%, respectively) than that of existing top-performing PC algorithms. Additionally, we compared bloom trends in MDN-based PC and Chla products to those from a satellite-derived cyanobacteria cell density estimator, the cyanobacteria index (CI-cyano), to evaluate their utility in the context of public health risk management. Our comprehensive analyses indicate increased spatiotemporal coherence of bloom magnitude, frequency, occurrence, and extent of MDN-based maps compared to CI-cyano and potential for use in cyanoHAB monitoring for public health and aquatic resource managers.

TI  - Assessment of soil organic carbon stocks in Alberta using 2-scale sampling and 3D predictive soil mapping
T2  - FACETS
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-dimensional predictive soil mapping approach for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (t/ha) at high spatial resolution (30 m) for Alberta for 2020-2021 is described. A remote sensing data stack was first prepared covering Alberta's agricultural lands. A total of 404 sampling locations were distributed across Alberta using 2-scale sampling: specialIntscript 22 pilot farms representing main climatic zones and specialIntscript conditioned Latin hypercube sampling at each farm. Soil samples were taken at four standard depths (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 cm) using soil probes and analyzed for SOC. Predictive models for SOC content and bulk density were built separately and then used to predict at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 100 cm and calculate aggregated SOC stocks per pixel. The SOC content and bulk density models had R squares of 0.61 and 0.68, respectively. Based on these mapping results, grassland soils were consistently associated with higher SOC stocks across all soil types as compared to croplands. The average SOC stock increase for grassland soils compared to cropland soils was 2.1 Mg per hectare, ranging from 2.17 to 6.09 Mg per hectare depending on soil type. Results also showed that symbolscript % of total SOC stocks were located in subsoil, which was higher than expected.

TI  - Depictions of Refugees in Children's Picturebooks in Turkey
T2  - EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The United Nations' announcements of a rise in the number of refugees have led to questions on how refugees are portrayed in children's picturebooks. Works that introduce children, at a young age, to the concept that there are other societies and cultures besides the one in which they currently reside have the potential to broaden their worldview and provide them with new insights. To further understand this, the current study focused on analyzing picturebooks (n = 15) of children in Turkey, as the country hosts the largest number of refugees in the world The portrayal of refugees, the discourses regarding refugees, and the cycles pointing to refugees are discussed through inductive content analysis. The results showed that refugees were portrayed as victims, homeless and helpless, and as people struggling to survive. The most dominant discourse about refugees is that they are longing for a family. In the refugee cycle in books, the migration itself constitutes the broadest stage. The results are presented for discussion in terms of educational and political implications.

TI  - A method for estimating yield of maize inbred lines by assimilating WOFOST model with Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is the most widely planted food crop in China, and maize inbred lines, as the basis of maize genetic breeding and seed breeding, have a significant impact on China's seed security and food safety. Satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used for growth monitoring and yield estimation of various crops, but it is still doubtful whether the existing remote sensing monitoring means can distinguish the growth difference between maize inbred lines and hybrids and accurately estimate the yield of maize inbred lines. This paper explores a method for estimating the yield of maize inbred lines based on the assimilation of crop models and remote sensing data, initially solves the problem. At first, this paper analyzed the WOFOST(World Food Studies)model parameter sensitivity and used the MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) method to calibrate the sensitive parameters to obtain the parameter set of maize inbred lines differing from common hybrid maize; then the vegetation indices were selected to establish an empirical model with the measured LAI(Leaf Area Index) at three key development stages to obtain the remotely sensed estimated LAI; finally, the yield of maize inbred lines in the study area was estimated and mapped pixel by pixel using the EnKF(Ensemble Kalman Filter) data assimilation algorithm. Also, this paper compares a method of assimilation by setting a single parameter. Instead of the WOFOST parameter optimization process, a parameter representing the growth weakness of the inbred lines was set in WOFOST to distinguish the inbred lines from the hybrids. The results showed that the yield estimated by the two methods compared with the field measured yield data had R2: 0.56 and 0.18, and RMSE: 684.90 Kg/Ha and 949.95 Kg/Ha, respectively, which proved that the crop growth model of maize inbred lines established in this study combined with the data assimilation method could initially achieve the growth monitoring and yield estimation of maize inbred lines.

TI  - The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the emergence of a forced anthropogenic climate change signal from observations is critical for informing adaptation responses. By regressing local variations in climate onto annual Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST), we track the emergence of an anthropogenic signal in long-term quality assured observations of temperature and precipitation for the island of Ireland, a sentinel location on the western European Atlantic seaboard. Analysis of station based observations, together with island scale composite series is under-taken for annual and seasonal means, together with 16 indices of extremes, with the derived signal-to-noise ratio classified as normal, unusual or unfamiliar relative to early industrial climate. More than half of indices show the emergence of at least unusual conditions relative to early industrial climate. The increase in annual mean temperature has led to the emergence of unfamiliar climate at six of eleven stations. Warming at the island scale is estimated at 0.88 degrees C per degree warming in GMST. While many stations show the emergence of unusual climate for spring, summer and autumn mean temperature, no forced signal of change is found for winter mean temperature. Changes in cool/warm days and nights are unfamiliar relative to early industrial climate. However, no anthropogenic signal is found for the hottest day annually or in summer - an extreme often associated with climate change in public consciousness. Increases in annual precipitation totals have emerged as unusual for western stations with large increases in winter totals per degree warming in GMST (e.g., 25.2% and 19.7% at Malin Head and Markree, respectively), indicating heightened flood risk with continued warming. By contrast, summer precipitation shows no significant relationship with GMST. Increases in rainfall intensity have emerged as unusual for 30% of stations, with increases consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Our analysis shows that an emerging climate change signal is discernible for Ireland, a location strongly influenced by climate variability.

TI  - Absence of post-treatment changes in sentinel lymph nodes does not translate into increased regional recurrence rate in initially node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeTo determine whether the absence of post-treatment changes in the negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in the neoadjuvant setting for biopsy-proven cN + disease results in an increased regional recurrence (RR) rate in patients after SLN biopsy (SLNB) only.MethodsBreast cancer patients with biopsy-proven cN + disease who converted to node-negative disease after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) and underwent SLNB only were included. Retrospective analysis was performed for patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2021. Pathohistological specimens were reviewed for the presence of post-treatment changes in the SLNs. Patients with negative SLNs (ypN0) were divided into two groups: (i) with post-treatment changes, (ii) without post-treatment changes. Patients' characteristics were compared between groups. Crude RR rates were compared using the log-rank test. Recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were calculated using Kaplan-Meier.ResultsOf 437 patients with cN + disease, 95 underwent SLNB only. 82 were ypN0, 57 with post-treatment changes (group 1), 25 without post-treatment changes (group 2). During the median follow-up of 37 months (range 6-148), 1 isolated regional recurrence occurred in group 2 (RR rate 0% for group 1 vs. 4% for group 2, p = 0.149). There were no differences in 3-year RFS and OS between groups.ConclusionAbsent post-treatment changes in negative SLNs for biopsy-proven cN + disease that covert to node-negative after NAST did not result in increased regional recurrence rates in our cohort. Multidisciplinary input is essential to determine whether additional treatment is needed in these patients.

TI  - Assessment of Vegetative Cover Dynamics During Pre and Post Covid-19 Period Using Sentinel-2A Imageries in the Western Ghats, South India
T2  - MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has changed the living environment in various aspects just like any other disaster. The goal of this study was to use time series remote sensing data to analyze vegetative cover change in the Western ghats of south India from January 2018 to June 2021 (pre & post covid scenario). In this context, biodiversity in terms of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been investigated in relation to variations in anthropogenic activity levels before and after the Covid-19 period. A spatio-temporal analysis of NDVI, LULC change, rainfall and AOD in relation to lockdown due to Covid-19 was conducted in this study. The study demonstrates the adaptability of remote sensing techniques and GIS for monitoring the changes in biodiversity in a more precise and cost-effective way, which is ideal for conservation planning and prioritization. Also, this study investigates the relationship between rainfall, AOD and NDVI during the study period. The results show that some parts of the Western Ghats which lies in Chamrajnagar of Karnataka, Erode and Dharmapuri of Tamil Nadu experienced significant vegetative cover change during the study period. It is also been inferred that there are changes in vegetative cover along the transect points situated in Shimoga of Karnataka, Palakkad and Idukki of Kerala due to the outbreak of forest fires. The restriction during the Covid-19 lock down has minimized the disturbance in the Ghats region which echoed in the increase in vegetative cover as well as areal extent of water bodies during post corona period (2021). The effect of increase in rainfall has reflected in the reduction in concentration of aerosol due to wet scavenging effect.

TI  - Automated detection of damaged buildings in post-disaster scenarios: a case study of Kahramanmaras (Türkiye) earthquakes on February 6, 2023
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study develops a novel approach for identifying buildings that were damaged in the aftermath of the Kahramanmaras earthquakes on February 6, 2023, which were among the most devastating in the history of Turkiye. The approach involves using two pre-event and one post-event Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to detect changes in the varying-sized and shaped buildings following the earthquakes. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the radiometric characteristics of building pixels should change after an earthquake, and these changes can be detected by analysing the spectral distance between the building pixel vectors before and after the earthquake. The proposed approach examines the changes in building pixel vectors on pre-event and post-event Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument images. It also incorporates the backscattering features of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar images, as well as the variance image, a feature that is derived from a Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix, and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index image, which were derived from the optical data. The approach was tested on three sites, two of which were in Kahramanmaras and the third in Hatay city. The results showed that the proposed method was able to accurately identify damaged and undamaged buildings with an overall accuracy of 75%, 84.4%, and 73.8% in test sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to effectively identify damaged buildings in post-disaster situations.

TI  - Spatial-temporal changes in mangrove Forests for Analyzing habitat Integrity: A case of hara biosphere Reserve, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial-temporal changes in land use and land cover (LULC) patterns have led to the fragmentation of forest ecosystems and the reduction of more than one-third of mangrove forests worldwide. Environmental protection challenges and biodiversity threats in mangrove forests have attracted national and international concerns in the last three decades. Accordingly, the present study demonstrates spatial-temporal changes in mangrove forests of Hara Biosphere Reserve using Landsat images from 1989 to 2021. Moreover, habitat integrity in this area was investigated based on ecological landscape metrics. The results of LULC changes revealed that the forest area in Hara Biosphere Reserve is decreasing, while other land use (LU) such as tidal area and bare land are increasing. Likewise, in this area, the tidal area had the top increasing trend in 2021 compared to 1989, and water body revealed the top decreasing trend during the studied years. According to the results of landscape metrics change, fragmentation and patches dispersion have increased at the level of mangrove forest and water body classes, and these results at the level of tidal area and bare land classes have decreased from 1989 to 2021. The obtained results indicate that habitat integrity has decreased at the level of mangrove forest and water body classes due to the increase of LULC spatial-temporal changes and human activities development. Therefore, planners and decision-makers should strive to reduce the human causes that have led to rapid LULC changes.

AB  - Research suggests that worldviews define our relationship to the environment, including our responsibility to the environment and our planet. This paper examines two specific worldviews and their potential environmental impact: the materialist worldview, considered to be the dominant worldview of Western society, and the socalled post-materialist worldview. We believe that changing the worldview of both individuals and society is key to changing environmental ethics, specifically attitudes, beliefs, and actions towards the environment. Recent neuroscience research suggests that brain filters and networks contribute to concealing an expanded nonlocal awareness. This creates self-referential thinking and contributes to the limited conceptual framework characteristic of a materialist worldview. We discuss the underlying concepts of both materialist and postmaterialist worldviews including their impact on environmental ethics, then explore the various types of neural filters and processing networks that contribute to a materialist worldview, and finally explore methods for modifying neural filters and changing worldviews.

TI  - Monitoring regional soil organic matter content using a spatiotemporal model with time-series synthetic Landsat images
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring soil organic matter (SOM) content is crucial for food and soil security. Current methods of monitoring are expensive and existing sparse data cannot provide detailed spatial information about SOM content changes in an area. This study proposes using a spatiotemporal model with time-series synthetic Landsat images to monitor SOM content dynamics at the regional scale. The approach was implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and tested in Jiangsu province, China, using the soil survey data from 2006 to 2007 and synthetic Landsat images from 1986 to 2007. The model generated SOM maps every three years between 1986 and 2007 and was evaluated using another soil survey from 2000 in southern Jiangsu. The model associated with 20 covariates derived from the synthetic Landsat image explained 70% of the variation in SOM content with root mean squared error (RMSE) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 5.17 g/kg and 0.57, respectively. The results showed that the model could reveal regional spatial and temporal differences in SOM content distribution. The SOM content in Jiangsu increased in the north, while decreasing in the central and southern areas. Temporally, the mean SOM contents increased from 1986 to 1992 by 0.17 g/kg, decreased in 1995, and increased again from 1998 to 2000 before decreasing from 2004 to 2007 by 0.14 g/kg. The validation based on the soil data in 2000 showed that the approach generated an RMSE of 5.97 g/kg, accounting for 22.77% of the average SOM content of the data. The study concluded that this approach could be used for monitoring SOM content and other soil properties. This approach had a relatively better accuracy than a previous study using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach with the same soil data but 4 times more samples.

TI  - Multi-criteria analysis using satellite images and the GIS for mapping groundwater recharge zones in Saudi Arabia: a case study of the Riyadh Region
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity is well pronounced in arid and semiarid regions where potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation. Saudi Arabia is one of the most water-scarce regions worldwide where there are only 2 billion m(3) of annual renewable freshwater resources, besides 24 billion m(3) of freshwater withdrawal, especially from the aquifers with fossil water. In Saudi Arabia, floods often occur and the harvest of flood water for groundwater recharge became an issue of discussion; however, this requires determining groundwater recharge potential (GWRP) zones where water naturally percolates and feeds the depleted aquifers. This study aims to produce a detailed (digital) map for GWRP zones for the iyadh Region by using a multicriteria approach where datasets were derived from satellite images (Landsat 7 ETM+, Spot-5, and Aster) associated with thematic maps and field surveys. The geo-information system (GIS) was also used to manipulate and integrate the geospatial data layers which represent the controlling factors on GWRP. Results show five classes of GWRP zones, where about 36,448 km(2) (89.2% of the Riyadh Region) belong to high and very high GWRP. The resulting map will be key information for decision-makers to select suitable localities for groundwater artificial recharge techniques as an adaptive measure for the changing climate.

TI  - Impact of industrial logging concession on deforestation and forest degradation in the DRC
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo Basin is home to the second largest tropical humid forest in the world and an important participant in climate change mitigation. While the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) boasts the largest proportion of Congo basin forests, it is also the main contributor to forest loss. Industrial logging concession is a forest man-agement model that is likely to expand in the DRC in the coming years as the Government recently announced the probable end of the 2002 moratorium on logging concessions. It is thus crucial to understand whether this model can further the DRC's deforestation reduction efforts. The literature suggests that the effect of titling forestland on avoided deforestation and forest degradation is generally limited, unless environmental restrictions are enforced. The DRC's 2002 forest code introduced a new logging concession model that includes requirements to submit and implement Forest Management Plans (FMP) and increase benefit-sharing with communities. Our paper evaluates the impact of this new model of concession contracts signed in 2011 and 2014 on deforestation and forest degradation. We use remotely sensed data series to estimate difference-in-difference models. We ensured baseline parallel trends in deforestation and similarity in baseline characteristics between control and treated units. We find no evidence that deforestation and forest degradation is significantly different between logging concessions and control areas, even for concessions that had their FMP accepted. Our study highlights the need for evaluating the impact of FMPs once they are fully implemented, the importance to improve degradation outcome variables and to conduct complementary studies analyzing impact pathways.

T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS) are electronic medical alert devices that help people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) receive assistance in emergencies. According to research on older adults, PERS improve health outcomes, provide people with a sense of security and peace of mind, promote independence, and prevent institutionalization. The aim of this study was to examine if, and how, states provided PERS to people with IDD in their Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waiver programs in fiscal year (FY) 2021. To do so, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed HCBS data on participant services and cost-neutrality demonstrations to examine thematic trends in how and why states offered PERS, as well as total unduplicated participants, total projected spending, projected spending per participant, reimbursement rates, and annual service provision per participant. In FY 2021, 42 waivers (39.25%) from 25 states and the District of Columbia (57.78%) projected spending $9.87 million on PERS services for 9538 people with IDD. PERS services included the installation of devices (77.78%), monthly service fees (73.61%), equipment maintenance (44.44%), and training of people with IDD or their caregivers about the equipment (41.67%). States said they provided PERS in order to prevent institutionalization (23.61%), promote independence (16.67%), and maximize mobility (11.11%). Given the potential benefits for independent living, independence, and reducing costs, as well as the disparities unearthed in this study, we believe states should expand how they provide PERS to people with IDD in HCBS and do so in a more consistent manner. This may be especially beneficial as PERS can be cost-prohibitive for many people with IDD, who frequently live in poverty, and HCBS reimbursement for technology is the top barrier to implementing technology according to IDD providers.

TI  - Synergetic inversion of leaf area index and leaf chlorophyll content using multi-spectral remote sensing data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Individual inversions of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) have problems due to the mutual interference between these two vegetation parameters on remote sensing signals. We therefore explore synergetic inversion of these two parameters to improve their inversion accuracy. We selected subtropical forest plantations, where canopy reflectance data were collected using a DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) every month during 2021-2022. Monthly in-situ observations of LAI and Clumping Index (CI) were also made in 23 broadleaf tree plots of dimension 12 m x 12 m. Vegetation Indices (VI) were calculated with the mean reflectance of all pixels at 0.06 m resolution within each sampling plot, and only those VIs with highest sensitivities to LAI or LCC were selected and correlated to LAI and LCC. An empirical model in the form of VI = f(LAI, LCC) was constructed for synergetic inversion of LAI and LCC. For the purpose of comparison, two models VI = f(LAI) and VI = f(LCC) were also constructed and used for the inversions of LAI and LCC, separately. The synergetic inversion model yields R2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 2.80 cm2/cm2 for LAI and R2 = 0.45 and RMSE = 32.71 & mu;g/cm2 for LCC, whereas the separate inversion models result in R2 = 0.59 and RMSE = 2.82 cm2/cm2 for LAI and R2 = 0.35 and RMSE = 35.86 & mu;g/cm2 for LCC. Moreover, we found that the inclusion of VIs containing a red edge band in the synergetic inversion can effectively improve the inversion accuracy. The proposed synergetic inversion method based on multiple VIs would be an effective way to separate the mutual interference between LAI and LCC and improve the accuracy of LCC inversion from remote sensing data.

TI  - Accuracy and consistency of space-based vegetation height maps for forest dynamics in alpine terrain
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and understanding forest dynamics is essential for environmental conservation and management. This is why the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) provides countrywide vegetation height maps at a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. Its long update time of 6 years, however, limits the temporal analysis of forest dynamics. This can be improved by using spaceborne remote sensing and deep learning to generate large-scale vegetation height maps in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of these methods for operational application in Switzerland. We generate annual, countrywide vegetation height maps at a 10-m ground sampling distance for the years 2017-2020 based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In comparison to previous works, we conduct a large-scale and detailed stratified analysis against a precise Airborne Laser Scanning reference dataset. This stratified analysis reveals a close relationship between the model accuracy and the topology, especially slope and aspect. We assess the potential of deep learning-derived height maps for change detection and find that these maps can indicate changes as small as 250 m2. Larger-scale changes caused by a winter storm are detected with an F1-score of 0.77. Our results demonstrate that vegetation height maps computed from satellite imagery with deep learning are a valuable, complementary, cost-effective source of evidence to increase the temporal resolution for national forest assessments.

TI  - Glacier melt detection at different sites of Greenland ice sheet using dual-polarized Sentinel-1 images
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Synectic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter coefficient is sensitive to glacier surface physical characteristic changes, including the states of melting and refreezing, but it is also sensitive to incidence angle variation. This study explores the capability of monitoring Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) melting status with Sentinel-1 dual-polarized images by referring to Automatic Weather Station (AWS) records. Sentinel-1 SAR images at five coastal regions of the GrIS are obtained from 2017 to 2021. The backscatter coefficients are normalized to an incidence angle of 30 & DEG; with an empirical model. Time series of five backscatter coefficients profiles covering AWS illustrates different patterns of the ice surface dielectric constant dynamics in different elevations. The wet snow radar zone shows clear backscatter coefficients decreasing during the melting seasons, but the bare ice radar zone behaves more complexly during the melting seasons. The numbers of melting days at different elevations are also derived for each profile based on -3 dB backscatter coefficient decrease of HH and/or HV polarization, showing the heterogeneous ablation processes over the GrIS. The daily maximum 2 m air temperature on two consecutive days (before and on the SAR acquisition day) exceeds 0 & DEG;C, and the daily average 2 m air temperature exceeds -0.5 & DEG;C on the SAR acquisition day that was recorded by the AWS finds good agreements with the -3 dB decrease of the backscatter coefficients, suggesting the GrIS surface melting can be well captured by dual-polarized Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images. The overall agreement and Kappa coefficients are mostly better than 0.85 and 0.70, respectively, for HH images and 0.80 and 0.60, respectively, for HV images, suggesting a better performance of the co-polarized image. High temporal resolution and wide-swath SAR sequence imagery provide suitable data sources for monitoring glacier surface melting-refreezing stats; further analysis is requested to quantitatively link the volume of melting with backscatter coefficient and other SAR data sources.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Inorganic Carbon at Multiple Depths Using Quantile Regression Forest and Digital Soil Mapping Technique in the Thar Desert Regions of India
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is important carbon reservoirs in desert ecosystems. However, little attention was paid to estimate carbon stock in these regions. In the present study, the distribution of SIC stock was investigated using digital soil mapping in Bikaner district, Rajasthan, India. A total of 187 soil profiles were used for SIC estimation by Quantile regression forest model. Landsat data, terrain attributes and bioclimatic variables were used as environmental variables. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model. Equal-area quadratic splines were fitted to soil profile datasets to estimate SIC at six standard soil depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 and 100-200 cm). The SIC in the study area ranged from 0.27 to 27.85 g kg-1 in 0-5 cm and 0.31 to 27.84 g kg-1 in 5-15 cm, respectively. The model could capture reasonable variability (R2 = 11-21%) while predicting SIC for different depths. The Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.20 to 0.32, indicating poor relationship between the predicted and observed values. The values of prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) recorded 86.4-91.1% for SIC at different depths. Annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality were the most important covariates in soil below the 30 cm depth. The predicted SIC stocks were 10.3 & PLUSMN; 0.01, 81.6 & PLUSMN; 0.07 and 186.7 & PLUSMN; 0.13 Mg ha-1 at 0-15, 0-100 and 0-200 cm, depth, respectively. The uncertainty analysis suggests that there is room to improve the current spatial predictions of SIC. It is anticipated that this digital mapping of SIC will be useful for assessment of carbon cycle in arid regions.

TI  - Watershed scale modeling of Dissolved organic carbon export from variable source areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water influences the global carbon cycle, ecosystem productivity, and water quality in potable water supply systems. Few physically based watershed models can simulate carbon cycling and predict DOC in surface waters under the influence of natural and anthropogenic drivers. In this work we transform the SWAT-Carbon (C) model to simulate DOC from variable source runoff areas in a humid forested watershed in the northeastern United States. Remotely sensed data were used to parameterize and simulate forest growth and evapotranspiration. The calibrated model accurately simulated streamflow and DOC flux at six sites across the watershed compared to measured data. The DOC predictions across sites showed model sensitivity to soil properties, particularly soil depth and available water capacity. The spatial distribution of DOC export across the watershed followed the pattern of surface runoff from variable source areas. Model sensitivity of DOC flux showed greater sensitivity to changes in precipitation than temperature. The overall good performance of the model makes it a valuable tool for watershed-scale modeling of DOC to understand the influence of climate and watershed management towards developing mitigation strategies. The methods presented in this study can be used in forested watersheds in regions where runoff from variable source areas is important for water quality predictions.

TI  - Characterising the regional growth of on-farm storages and their implications for water resources under a changing climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water demand for agricultural activities has caused a growth in small on-farm storages (i.e., > 0.1 ha to < 10 ha) in many areas worldwide, thereby increasing the capture of landscape runoff which otherwise would enter the catchment drainage system. The cumulative effects of these on-farm storages (colloquially known as farm ponds or farm dams) can result in reduced mean annual flows, particularly during dry years. Climate change, which will very likely exacerbate extreme weather conditions including droughts, may accelerate the growth of farm dams in semi-arid agricultural areas with limited access to surface water. The aim of this study is to evaluate farm dam development and total farm dam water volumes at regional scales using Landsat water indices (WIs). The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB, 1.061 million km2) in south and eastern Australia, which has experienced a sustained growth in farm dams in the 1990s and early 2000s, is used as a case study. Using a pixel validation dataset, four WIs were trialled for their capabilities to detect the presence of water in farm dams. Of the WIs tested here, AWEIshadow showed the best performance. As a result, AWEIshadow was used to establish the year in which water was first observed (i.e., its year of commission) in 727,081 farm dams across the MDB and to calculate the total farm dam volume in the region. Farm dams' volume in the MDB increased more than twofold between 1990 and 2020, from 1241.0 MCM (million cubic meters) to 2,629.5 MCM. The growth differed across MDB regions, generally accelerating during the 'Millennium Drought' (2001-2009). In the entire MDB, there was rapid development in the 1990s with 3.1% growth. Growth was 2.5% from 2000 to 2010, tapering off to 0.6% from 2010 to 2020.In Robertson et al. (this issue), the year-by-year growth in farm dams' volume were used in a rainfall-runoff model thereby incorporating the time-varying effects of farm dams. Robertson et al. (this issue) show that explicitly modelling farm dams improves the model's performance relative to a traditional rainfall-runoff model that ignores the effects of farm dams. Hence, this improves the capability of assessing the direct impacts of farm dams and their potential growth in climate change studies.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imagery for Mapping Sugarcane Varieties
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mapping different varieties of sugarcane is vital for estimating yields and assessing crop damage risks. Different biophysical and chemical characteristics of sugarcane varieties at different ages lead to distinct electromagnetic spectral behaviors. Remote sensing images can be useful in mapping sugarcane varieties. Multispectral imagery was evaluated and compared with hyperspectral imagery for mapping different varieties of sugarcane crops in this study. A set of field data on various varieties of sugarcane farms in Khuzestan Province, Iran was used alongside satellite imagery from Landsat ETM+ and EO-1 Hyperion sensors to achieve this objective. In order to determine the most optimal spectral bands from a Hyperion hyperspectral image for classification of sugarcane varieties, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was employed as the primary optimization algorithm. Several spectral indices and a principal component analysis (PCA) were also applied for extracting surface biophysical properties. The training dataset was then used to classify hyperspectral and multispectral images at a variety and variety-age scales using various supervised classification methods. Further comparisons with field data were conducted to determine the accuracy of classification results per classification method, as well as for both types of images. According to the study findings, selecting ETM+ and optimal Hyperion bands to map sugarcane varieties was most effective with 69 and 81% accuracy, respectively. As a result, accuracy was further improved to 76 and 82%, respectively. This was due to the incorporation of vegetation indices, PCA components, and soil salinity indices contributing to these improvements. In addition, using sugarcane age as a classification feature resulted in an increase in accuracy of 3 and 6% for ETM+ and Hyperion images, respectively. In the study, the support vector machine (SVM) demonstrated the highest accuracy among different classification techniques. These results indicate the value of employing surface biophysical properties in conjunction with multispectral images. As an alternative to hyperspectral images for agricultural varieties classification, this approach can be suggested.

TI  - Application of a two source energy balance model coupled with satellite based soil moisture and thermal infrared data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of thermal infrared data from the Earth's surface when combined with the surface energy balance equation are widely used to monitor land surface evapotranspiration (ET). Unfortunately thermal infrared based models using this approach have a systematic positive bias with ET during soil water stress conditions. The Two-source Energy Balance model using information on Soil Moisture as another key constraint (TSEB-SM) improves model performance and utility. Here, high resolution satellite soil moisture data from SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) were used to provide soil water boundary conditions for the TSEB-SM model. This SMAP driven TSEB-SM approach was applied in the Heihe river basin in China across a wide range of soil moisture conditions using MODIS thermal infrared land surface temperature (LST) data. The ET estimates from TSEB-SM were validated using flux tower measurements over the main land cover types in the study area and compared with the results from the original TSEB model. The comparison showed that the TSEB-SM approach reduced the RMSE error in latent heat flux estimates by 5 % to 20 % at satellite overpass time, and TSEB-SM outperformed the original TSEB model in daily ET estimates (RMSE values of 1.0 mm/d versus 1.5 mm/d, respectively) across all validation sites. The magnitude of the TSEB-SM improvements were larger early and late in the growing season and in arid areas, consistent with soil moisture improving estimates of ET particularly under times of higher water stress. The use of SMAP satellite soil moisture data with the TSEB-SM model increased the reliability of ET estimation and provides an improved capacity for continuos monitoring of drought effects on the global water cycle.

TI  - A Multitask Network for Joint Multispectral Pansharpening on Diverse Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Despite the rapid advance in multispectral (MS) pansharpening, existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods require training on separate CNNs for different satellite datasets. However, such a single-task learning (STL) paradigm often leads to overlooking any underlying correlations between datasets. Aiming at this challenging problem, a multitask network (MTNet) is presented to accomplish joint MS pansharpening in a unified framework for images acquired by different satellites. Particularly, the pansharpening process of each satellite is treated as a specific task, while MTNet simultaneously learns from all data obtained from these satellites following the multitask learning (MTL) paradigm. MTNet shares the generic knowledge between datasets via task-agnostic subnetwork (TASNet), utilizing task-specific subnetworks (TSSNets) to facilitate the adaptation of such knowledge to a certain satellite. To tackle the limitation of the local connectivity property of the CNN, TASNet incorporates Transformer modules to derive global information. In addition, band-aware dynamic convolutions (BDConvs) are proposed that can accommodate various ground scenes and bands by adjusting their respective receptive field (RF) size. Systematic experimental results over different datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.

TI  - Doubling of surface oceanic meridional heat transport by non-symmetry of mesoscale eddies
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic transport of heat by ubiquitous mesoscale eddies plays a critical role in regulating climate variability and redistributing excess heat absorbed by ocean under global warming. Eddies have long been simplified as axisymmetric vortices and their influence on heat transport remains unclear. Here, we combine satellite and drifter data and show that oceanic mesoscale eddies are asymmetric and directionally-dependent, and are controlled by their self-sustaining nature and their dynamical environment. Both the direction and amplitude of eddy-induced heat fluxes are significantly influenced by eddy's asymmetry and directional dependence. When the eddy velocity field is decomposed into asymmetric and symmetric components, the eddy kinetic energy exhibits a nearly equal partition between these two components. The total eddy-induced meridional heat flux similarly doubles the heat flux induced by the symmetric components, highlighting the crucial contribution of eddy asymmetry on the magnitude of eddy-induced oceanic heat transport.Ocean eddies are known to induce global heat transport but how this is influenced by their shape is unknown. Here the authors combine in-situ drifter and satellite data to show that eddy-induced heat transport can be doubled due to their elongated shape.

TI  - Changes in compound drought-heat events over Brazil's Pantanal wetland: an assessment using remote sensing data and multiple drought indicators
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Brazil's Pantanal wetland is one of the most threatened Brazilian ecosystems from direct anthropogenic pressures and climate change. In this study, the overarching research question is to explore whether compound drought-heat events (CDHEs) have become more recurrent, intense, and widespread over Brazil's Pantanal wetland in recent decades. For this, we purpose and tested two different approaches using validated long-term time series of monthly precipitation, temperature, and the satellite-based Vegetation Health Index (VHI) to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of CDHEs over Pantanal. Firstly, we assessed global gridded precipitation and temperature data sets against ground measurements to choose an appropriate dataset for this study. Then, we calculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Temperature Index (STI), and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from 1981 to 2021. The results showed that using both approaches (CDHE-M1 and CDHE-M2), the frequency of events is higher considering the moderate category, which is expected since the criteria are less restrictive. In addition, the highest frequency of CDHE events occurs between September and November (the end of the dry season). The results also indicated that CDHE events have been more recurrent and widespread since 2000 in Pantanal. Besides, considering all methods for identifying the CDHEs, the probability density function indicates a shift pattern to warmer and drier conditions in the last 40 years. The Mann-Kendall tests also confirmed the assumption that there is a significantly increasing trend in the compound drought-heat events in the Pantanal. Developing methodologies for monitoring compound climate events is crucial for assessing climate risks in a warming climate. Besides, it is expected that our results contribute to the convincing of the urgent need for environmental protection strategies and disaster risk reduction plans for the Pantanal.

TI  - To Dissect or Not to Dissect: Can We Predict the Presence of Four or More Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Postmenopausal Women with Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundAxillary lymph node (ALN) involvement is important for prognosis and guidance of multidisciplinary treatment of breast cancer patients. This study sought to identify preoperative clinicopathologic factors predictive of four or more pathologically positive ALNs in patients with cN0 disease and to develop a predictive nomogram to inform therapy recommendations.MethodsUsing an institutional prospective database, the study identified postmenopausal women with cN0 invasive breast cancer undergoing upfront sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with or without completion ALND (cALND) between 1993 and 2007. Logistic regression analyses identified factors predictive of four or more positive nodes in the cN0 population and patients with one, two, or more SLNs.ResultsThe study identified 2532 postmenopausal women, 615 (24.3%) of whom underwent cALND. In the univariate analysis, tumor size, lymphovascular (LVI), histology, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive status, and multifocality/multicentricity were predictive of four or more positive nodes (n = 63; p < 0.05), and all except ER status were significant in the multivariate analysis. Of the 2532 patients, 1263 (49.2%) had hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease, and 30 (2.4%) were found to have four or more positive nodes. Of the 130 patients with exactly one positive SLN who underwent cALND (n = 130, 5.4%), 7 had four or more positive nodes, with grade as the only predictive factor (p = 0.01). Of the 33 patients with two or more positive SLNs who underwent cALND, 9 (27.3%) had four or more positive nodes after cALND, but no factors were predictive in this subset.ConclusionPostmenopausal women with early-stage cN0 HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with a single positive SLN had a very low risk (5%) of having four or more positive nodes on final pathology. With such a low risk of N2 disease, limited staging with SLNB may be sufficient to guide therapy decisions for this subset of patients.

TI  - Complex reconstruction of the clavicle with a prefabricated medial femur condyle chimeric flap including a superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator flap: A case report
T2  - MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The medial femur condyle (MFC) cortico-periosteal flap is a popular flap for bone reconstruction. The use of a chimeric version of this flap with a skin island has been described, but anatomical arterial variation can occur that prevent its harvest. Furthermore, the donor area of the skin paddle has been debated as poor because of the scarring in a visible area and because of the difficulty in obtaining pliable thin skin. We present a fabricated chimeric MFC cortico-periosteal flap joined with a superficial inferior epigastric perforator (SCIP) flap to reconstruct and augment a sclerotic and insufficient small clavicula with the skin paddle acting as a monitor and as a substitute for the overlying skin. A 52-year-old female patient had a history of multiple refractures of the right hypoplastic clavicle with a diameter of 7 mm, resulting in a sclerotic bone with a fibrotic scar. The reconstruction was done in one surgical session using a cortico-periosteal flap from the left medial condyle and a thin SCIP flap from the left groin. The area of the clavicle to be reconstructed was 3 cm, and the direct overlying skin (approximately 6 x 3 cm) was severely scarred and painful. The MFC flap was 5 x 4 cm, while the SCIP flap was 7 x 3.5 cm. The SCIP flap artery was anastomosed on the table end-to-side to the descending genicular (DG) artery of the MFC, and the vein was anastomosed end-to-end to a comitans vein of the DG artery. The flap fully survived after an initial congestion. At 12 months, we observed a satisfactory reconstruction of the clavicle with an enhanced diameter of 12 mm. The patient recovered full function of the shoulder with no pain. Using a fabricated chimeric flap composed of a medial femoral condyle and a superficial circumflex artery perforator flap may be an additional option for tailored reconstruction of complex osteo-cutaneous defect of clavicle.

TI  - Fluorescent Guided Sentinel Lymph Mapping of the Oral Cavity with Fluorescent-Labeled Tilmanocept
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: With the shift toward utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in oral cavity cancer, improved techniques for intraoperative sentinel node identification are needed. This study investigates the feasibility of fluorescently labeled tilmanoscept in SLNB in an oral cancer rabbit model.Methods: An animal study was designed using 21 healthy male New Zealand rabbits. Gallium-68-labeled tilmanocept labeled with IRDye800CW was injected submucosally into the buccal mucosa (n = 6) or lateral tongue (n = 7) followed by PET imaging. One hour after injection, SLNB was performed using fluorescence imaging followed by a bilateral neck dissection and sampling of non-nodal surrounding tissue. All tissues were measured for radioactivity and fluorescence. In addition, eight rabbits were injected with delayed SLNB performed 48 h after injection.Results: Buccal injections all had ipsilateral SLN drainage and tongue injections exhibited 18.2% contralateral drainage. An average of 1.9 +/- 1.0 SLN (range 1-5) were identified. In addition, an average of 16.9 +/- 3.3 non-sentinel lymph nodes were removed per animal. SLNs had an average of 0.69 +/- 0.60 percent-of-injected dose (%ID) compared with non-sentinel nodes with 0.012 +/- 0.025 %ID and surrounding tissue with 0.0067 +/- 0.015 %ID. There was 98.0% agreement between sentinel lymph nodes identified using fluorescence compared to radioactivity with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.879. In 48-h delayed SLNB, results were consistent with 97.8% agreement with radioactivity and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.884. Fluorescence identified additional lymph nodes that were not identified by radioactivity, and with one false negative.Conclusion: Fluorescent-labeled Tc-99 m-tilmanocept represents a highly accurate adjunct to enhance SLNB for oral cavity cancer.

TI  - Mapping oak wilt disease from space using land surface phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting the future of forests relies on our ability to observe changes in forest health. Thus, developing tools for sensing diseases in a timely fashion is critical for managing threats at broad scales. Oak wilt -a disease caused by a pathogenic fungus (Bretziella fagacearum)- is threatening oaks, killing thousands yearly while negatively impacting the ecosystem services they provide. Here we propose a novel workflow for mapping oak wilt by targeting temporal disease progression through symptoms using land surface phenology (LSP) from spaceborne observations. By doing so, we hypothesize that phenological changes in pigments and photosynthetic activity of trees affected by oak wilt can be tracked using LSP metrics derived from the Chlorophyll/Carotenoid Index (CCI). We used dense time-series observations from Sentinel-2 to create Analysis Ready Data across Minnesota and Wisconsin and to derive three LSP metrics: the value of CCI at the start and end of the growing season, and the coefficient of variation of the CCI during the growing season. We integrate high-resolution airborne imagery in multiple locations to select pixels (n = 3872) from the most common oak tree health conditions: healthy, symptomatic for oak wilt, and dead. These pixels were used to train an iterative Partial Least Square Discriminant (PLSD) model and derive the probability of an oak tree (i.e., pixel) in one of these conditions and the associated uncertainty. We assessed these models spatially and temporally on testing datasets revealing that it is feasible to discriminate among the three health conditions with overall accuracy between 80 and 82%. Within conditions, our models suggest that spatial variations among three CCI-derived LSP metrics can identify healthy (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.98), symptomatic (AUC = 0.89), and dead (AUC = 0.94) oak trees with low false positive rates. The model performance was robust across different years as well. The predictive maps were used to guide local stakeholders to locate disease hotspots for ground verification and subsequent decision-making for treat-ment. Our results highlight the capabilities of LSP metrics from dense spaceborne observations to map diseases and to monitor large-scale change in biodiversity.

TI  - Impacts of meteorological variables and machine learning algorithms on rice yield prediction in Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As crop productivity is greatly influenced by weather conditions, many attempts have been made to estimate crop yields using meteorological data and have achieved great progress with the development of machine learning. However, most yield prediction models are developed based on observational data, and the utilization of climate model output in yield prediction has been addressed in very few studies. In this study, we estimate rice yields in South Korea using the meteorological variables provided by ERA5 reanalysis data (ERA-O) and its dynamically downscaled data (ERA-DS). After ERA-O and ERA-DS are validated against observations (OBS), two different machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are trained with different combinations of eight meteorological variables (mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, diurnal temperature range, solar irradiance, mean wind speed, and relative humidity) obtained from OBS, ERA-O, and ERA-DS at weekly and monthly timescales from May to September. Regardless of the model type and the source of the input data, training a model with weekly datasets leads to better yield estimates compared to monthly datasets. LSTM generally outperforms SVM, especially when the model is trained with ERA-DS data at a weekly timescale. The best yield estimates are produced by the LSTM model trained with all eight variables at a weekly timescale. Altogether this study shows the significance of high spatial and temporal resolution of input meteorological data in yield prediction, which can also serve to substantiate the added value of dynamical downscaling.

TI  - Mapping and analysis of structural lineaments using Landsat 8-OLI images and multivariate statistical methods in Tarfaya coastal basin, Southwest Morocco
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The coastal basin of Tarfaya is part of the Meso-Cenozoic basins of the Moroccan Atlantic margin which developed following the bursting of Pangea. In this study, Landsat-8 OLI/TIR images were used as a tool for the extraction of geological lineaments. A more detailed statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of the lineaments was applied by comparing the means of their lengths and their orientations in four areas of the basin using the Kruskal-Wallis test. In addition, an ascending hierarchical classification was used to group individuals according to lineament orientation. The results showed that the basin is fractured by a network of 1603 lineaments. The variance analysis of the lineament orientation means proved the subdivision of the basin into four structural zones. The ascending hierarchical classification (CHA) classified the lineaments in the coastal basin of Tarfaya into six groups high-frequency orientations organized into three directions classes (ENE-WSW, NW-SE to NNW-SSE and NE-SW to NNE-SSW) with proportions of 29%, 28% and 43% respectively. These directions reveal the fracturing of the studied area by the reactivation of pre-existing structures during the Variscan and Atlasic tectonic episodes. Thus, during the Hercynian Orogeny, the basin underwent NNW-SSE directed compression and rotation related to late Variscan deformation that led to the partial stress reversal that became NE-SW to NNE-SSW. The ENE-WSW directions represent the reactivation of the Alpine orogeny in the Meso-Cenozoic formations of the basin. The application of multivariate statistical methods for analyzing lineaments in the basin introduces an innovative approach to fracture analysis.

TI  - Heidegger's Worldview - Freedom, Control and Affectivity
T2  - HUMAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The tendency of individuals to protect their own worldview by rejecting information and phenomena that cannot be reconciled with it is a significant issue in today's polarised society. This paper aims to gain a deeper insight into this tendency towards exclusion and the impact it has on worldview by examining a particular interpretation of worldview developed in the late 1930s by Martin Heidegger. It is a radical account that portrays a highly restrictive and extremely closed-off model of worldview, within which exclusion plays a key role. The impact of this exclusion on the nature and shape of worldview is explored by analysing worldview from three distinct perspectives focusing on (1) its appearance, marked by freedom and safety, (2) its inner dynamic, marked by absolute control, and (3) its affective background, marked by frantic struggle and dread. The analysis reveals a dread-fuelled, highly reactionary, and thus extremely fragile structure that is fundamentally shaped by the endless effort to conceal the exclusion on which it is built, resulting in a complete inability to engage with that which is excluded without severely endangering the very existence of that worldview.

TI  - Assessment of above ground biomass and soil organic carbon in the forests of Nepal under climate change scenario
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionMany factors, such as climate, topography, forest management, or tree/forest attributes, influence soil organic carbon (SOC) and above-ground tree biomass (AGTB). This study focuses on assessing relationship between various predictor variables and response variables (SOC and AGTB) in the perspective of climate change scenario. The study was conducted throughout in Nepal using forest resource assessment data (2010-2014).MethodsOur study applied a random forest model to assess the status of SOC and AGTB under future climate change scenarios using 19 bioclimatic variables accompanied by other variables such as altitude, aspect, basal area, crown cover development status, distance to settlement forest types, number of trees, macro-topography, management regime, physiographic zones, slope, and soil depth. The study used 737 (70%) samples as a training data for model development while 312 (30%) samples as a testing data for model validation.Results and discussionThe respective RMSE, RMSE% and adjusted R2 of the Random Forest Model for SOC estimation were found to be 9.53 ton/ha, 15% and 0.746 while same for the AGTB were 37.55 ton/ha, 21.74% and 0.743. Particularly, changes in temperature and precipitation showed an effect on the amount of SOC and AGTB in the projected scenario i.e., CMIP6, SSP2 4.5 for 2040-2060. The study found the amount of SOC decreased by 3.85%, while AGTB increased by 2.96% in the projected scenario. The proposed approach which incorporates the effect of bioclimatic variables can be a better option for understanding the dynamics of SOC and AGTB in the future using climatic variables.

TI  - Remote sensing of phytoplankton community composition in the northern Benguela upwelling system
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine phytoplankton in the northern Benguela upwelling system (nBUS) serve as a food and energy source fuelling marine food webs at higher trophic levels and thereby support a lucrative fisheries industry that sustain local economies in Namibia. Microscopic and chemotaxonomic analyses are among the most commonly used techniques for routine phytoplankton community analysis and monitoring. However, traditional in situ sampling methods have a limited spatiotemporal coverage. Satellite observations far surpass traditional discrete ocean sampling methods in their ability to provide data at broad spatial scales over a range of temporal resolution over decadal time periods. Recognition of phytoplankton ecological and functional differences has compelled advancements in satellite observations over the past decades to go beyond chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass to distinguish phytoplankton taxa from space. In this study, a multispectral remote sensing approach is presented for detection of dominant phytoplankton groups frequently observed in the nBUS. Here, we use a large microscopic dataset of phytoplankton community structure and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer of aqua satellite match-ups to relate spectral characteristics of in water constituents to dominance of specific phytoplankton groups. The normalised fluorescence line height, red-near infrared as well as the green/green spectral band-ratios were assigned to the dominant phytoplankton groups using statistical thresholds. The ocean colour remote sensing algorithm presented here is the first to identify phytoplankton functional types in the nBUS with far-reaching potential for mapping the phenology of phytoplankton groups on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales towards advanced ecosystem understanding and environmental monitoring.

TI  - Fine-scale classification and mapping of subalpine-alpine vegetation and their environmental correlates in the Himalayan global biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Subalpine-alpine vegetation of Himalayan global biodiversity hotspot forms the highest and unique ecosystem of the world. These ecosystems inhabit diverse cold adapted plants, which are currently threatened by global warming. Deciphering vegetation forms and their ecological niches is pre-requisite for evolving conservation strategies. Emerging remote sensing datasets, processing techniques and platforms offer potential to map fine-scale vegetation patterns at ecoregion level. We conceptualised a four-fold classification scheme considering climate, vegetation physiognomy, floristics, and gregarious formations for the subalpine-alpine vegetation of the Western Himalaya spanning over 45,202 km2. Sentinel-2 satellite images were classified using a combination of rule-based and machine learning approach i.e. Random Forest in Google Earth Engine to generate vegetation map at regional scale. Reflectance bands alone provided an overall classification accuracy of 76.46% (kappa 0.78), while, the addition of vegetation indices improved the accuracy to 84.43%. (kappa 0.79). When topographical variables were also considered, the accuracy increased to 91.71% (kappa 0.81). The vegetation map at 10 m resolution represents in total 23 vegetation classes covering subalpine zone (9 coniferous forests, 4 broad-leaved forests, 2 scrubs, bamboo brake and grassland) and alpine zone (2 scrubs and 4 herbaceous). Study enhances knowledge on the coverage, distribution, abundance, diversity of subalpine and alpine vegetation and ecological amplitudes with respect to temperature, precipitation, elevation and aspect. The study outcomes are useful for developing landscape as well as species specific conservation planning and bioresource utilization.

TI  - Forms and Functions of Description in the (New) Weird
T2  - ANGLIA-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ENGLISCHE PHILOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay discusses how and to what effect Weird and New Weird fiction use description in unique and genre-defining ways. Using H. P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu" and China Mieville's The City & The City as examples, it shows how the Weird relegates a comparatively large part of the text to description and attempts to elicit dread as an aesthetic effect. The essay argues that the Weird breaks with the traditional use of description by employing formally realist tendencies which it defies functionally, and by combining over-description with the failure to describe, whereas the New Weird is more concise in its use of description, ties it more closely to the narrative, and is less reliant on descriptive failures. Both the Weird and the New Weird demand more active reader participation in their creation of aesthetic illusion, which they encourage through the frames they create around their descriptions, thus preparing readers for the potential of aesthetic distance in the reception process and diminishing its effect. The analysis emphasizes the potential of description to be more than a subordinate to the narrative mode and to be a central component in the formation of a text's implied worldview.

TI  - Homoleptic Transition Metal Carbonyl Cations: Synthetic Approaches, Characterization and Follow-Up Chemistry
T2  - ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Carbon monoxide, CO, is one of the most important ligands in organometallic chemistry. It is an excellent if-acceptor and a moderate tr-donor. Therefore, most of the known transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) exhibit a zerovalent or even negative metal oxidation state (OS) of up to -4. However, given the right conditions, the carbonyl ligand also forms homoleptic cationic complexes with one or more transition metal atoms, the transition metal carbonyl cations (TMCCs), known with an OS of lap to +3. Despite their_long-standing history upon discovery of the first[NI(C0)61+ examples ( -Mn, Tc, Re) by E O. Fischer in 1962 as well as their very fundamental nature, it took until the 1990s for the scope to be widened by Aubke, Strauss and Winner.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fusion methods for spectral remote sensing: a comprehensive technical review and comparative analysis
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - For many years, spectral remote sensing has been essential for research on the Earth's surface. The data from a single satellite sensor is sometimes insufficient to fulfil the expanding needs of remote sensing applications. Spatial-temporal fusion techniques have become an effective way for merging spectral data from many sources and times, enabling improved data analysis and interpretation. The goal of this review paper is to offer a thorough examination of the historical growth of spatio-temporal fusion techniques for spectral remote sensing. The classification of all currently used fusion approaches, such as Unmixing, Weight-based, Bayesian-based, machine learning-based, and hybrid methods, is covered in detail. Additionally, it evaluates pixel-level, decision-level, and feature-level-based data fusion techniques and compares and contrasts their advantages and disadvantages. The report also discusses spatiotemporal fusion's difficulties and recommends future advances. For those working in remote sensing research and practice, it offers an invaluable resource. In conclusion, this review paper provides a comprehensive overview of spatio-temporal fusion systems for spectral remote sensing, including an analysis of their comparative benefits and drawbacks and a description of their historical development. It aims to stimulate further research and development of spatio-temporal fusion methods for spectral remote sensing. In summary, this review paper presents a comprehensive overview of spatio-temporal fusion methods for spectral remote sensing, including their historical development, categorization of existing techniques and applications, and a comparative analysis of their strengths and limitations. It also discusses the current challenges and future research directions, providing a valuable resource for the remote sensing community.

TI  - An independent framework-based evapotranspiration model (IFEM) for dual-source: From field to regional scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The triangle/trapezoid framework model (TFM) is a widely used approach for mapping regional evapotranspiration (ET) based on thermal infrared remote sensing imagery. However, the homogeneity assumption for meteorological forcing and surface properties involved in TFM contradicts the characteristics of heterogeneous regions, leading to high uncertainty at regional scale, especially under energy-limited or strong advection conditions. Therefore, this study examined the linear relationship between soil moisture availability (Lambda SM), evapotranspiration efficiency (Lambda ET) and radiation surface temperature (Trad), and developed an Independent Framework-based dual-source ET Model (IFEM) for heterogeneous regions. By fixing two key meteorological forcing variables, air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and three surface characteristic parameters, aerodynamic resistance (ra), albedo (alpha) and the ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation (Gamma), the IFEM constructs a uniform fractional vegetation cover (fc)- Trad space. In this uniform fc-Trad space, isolines of Lambda SM and Lambda ET are aligned with those of Trad, and an independent trapezoid framework is constructed for each pixel of RS images. It avoids the systematic bias caused by the distorted trapezoid space involved in traditional TFMs. The proposed model was applied in a hydrologically semi-enclosed irrigation area, the Hetao Irrigation District, with Landsat and MODIS datasets from 2016 to 2020 to evaluate its performance at the field and region scales. Firstly, the IFEM was capable of retrieving latent heat with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 34.43 W m- 2 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.68%, compared with the measurements from flux towers. Secondly, the IFEM reasonably separated the soil (MAPE = 21.33%) and canopy (MAPE = 14.33%) components from ET, compared with the soil evaporation observed by micro-lysimeters and the plant transpiration calculated by sap velocity upscaling technology. Thirdly, the IFEM showed high accuracy in estimating annual total ET with a percentage error range within +/- 3.0%, compared against the regional water balance calculations. Overall, the IFEM demonstrated high robustness and accuracy for field-scale and regional-scale applications, validating its potential as a reliable method for mapping regional ET in heterogeneous regions.

TI  - Land-Use Change and Driving Force Analysis of Wetland in Poyang Lake Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Poyang Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes in China and the only two remaining lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It is an internationally important wetland with important ecological value. In recent years, due to the influence of natural and human factors, the ecology of Poyang Lake International Wetland has been greatly damaged. Using relevant research models and methods to study and predict land-use change can provide a scientific basis for relevant departments to manage land and has important demonstration significance for biodiversity conservation and ecological function restoration of wetlands with important ecological value. Based on Landsat remote sensing images from 1986 to 2020, land-use information data were obtained by supervised classification interpretation, and five land-use type maps with an interval of about 8 years were generated by ENVI and ArcGIS software. The land-use change of Poyang Lake wetland was analyzed by using land-use transfer matrix and land-use dynamic attitude. The land-use distribution in 2030 was predicted by the FLUS model. Based on the gray correlation model, the driving force of land-use change was discussed. The results show that the wetland land-use types in Poyang Lake will change greatly from 1986 to 2020: construction land, mudflat, paddy field, and dry land changed significantly and showed an increasing trend. The area of water and grassland decreased on the whole, and the transferred area was large, which was mainly transferred to construction land, paddy field, and dry land. The area of woodland increased slowly, but the change range was not large from the perspective of dynamic attitude. The change of wetland area of reed flat decreased first and then increased, and the overall land-use change was relatively gentle. Through the FLUS model prediction, it is found that the water area of the study area will be greatly reduced in 2030, the area of woodland and reed flat will be greatly increased, and the ecological situation will gradually improve. According to the gray correlation analysis, the total population and annual precipitation are the main driving factors of land-use change in the Poyang Lake wetland. This study studies the land-use change and driving force from the regional wetland scale, which can provide a theoretical basis for the future international important wetland protection and land resource management of Poyang Lake. At the same time, it provides a reference for further regional wetland habitat protection and ecological network construction.

TI  - Human impacts on vegetation carbon sequestration capacity in the Qilian Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau since 2000
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Vegetation carbon sequestration in alpine areas of West China, such as the Qilian Mountains on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, has been subject to long-term human intervention under a warming climate since the launch of the western development strategy (WDS) in 2000. However, the human impacts on vegetation carbon sequestration capacity during this period remain unclear. In this study, the magnitude and direction of human impacts on vegetation carbon sequestration capacity (defined as net primary production, NPP) were assessed by the deviation of remote-sensing-estimated actual NPP data from the simulated potential NPP. The potential value was derived from natural system coupling under the assumption that human activities ceased during the assessment period. The impacts of natural forces and historic human activities were then effectively exfoliated in our final assessment using a process-based IBISi model. The results indicate that the total actual vegetation carbon sequestration capacity in the Qilian Mountains has reduced compared with its potential value since the WDS launched. This reduction was mainly attributed to grazing in the grasslands. However, deforestation, mineral resource exploitation, and the construction of hydropower facilities have also caused a reduction in vegetation carbon sequestration capacity at the local scales. In contrast, forestry protections and afforestation, and agricultural activities associated with recla-mation, cultivation, irrigation, and fertilization, have resulted in local increases in the vegetation carbon sequestration capacity in the corresponding forest lands, shrublands, and croplands. These findings highlight the importance of ecological protections for vegetation carbon sequestration and were expected to provide evidence to verify the improvement of ecological management and the increasing of carbon sinks in West China.

TI  - Using remote sensing data within an optimal spatiotemporal model for invasive plant management: the case of <i>Ailanthus altissima</i> in the Alta Murgia National Park
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We tackle the problem of coupling a spatiotemporal model for simulating the spread and control of an invasive alien species with data coming from image processing and expert knowledge. In this study, we implement a spatially explicit optimal control model based on a reaction-diffusion equation which includes an Holling II type functional response term for modeling the density control rate. The model takes into account the budget constraint related to the control program and searches for the optimal effort allocation for the minimization of the invasive alien species density. Remote sensing and expert knowledge have been assimilated in the model to estimate the initial species distribution and its habitat suitability, empirically extracted by a land cover map of the study area. The approach has been applied to the plant species Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle within the Alta Murgia National Park. This area is one of the Natura 2000 sites under the study of the ongoing National Biodiversity Future Center (NBFC) funded by the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), and pilot site of the finished H2020 project ECOPOTENTIAL, which aimed at the integration of modeling tools and Earth Observations for a sustainable management of protected areas. Both the initial density map and the land cover map have been generated by using very high resolution satellite images and validated by means of ground truth data provided by the EU Life Alta Murgia Project (LIFE12 BIO/IT/000213), a project aimed at the eradication of A. altissima in the Alta Murgia National Park.

TI  - Erector spinae plane block versus local infiltration anaesthesia for transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic discectomy: A prospective randomised controlled trial.
T2  - Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Around 60%-80% of the population suffers from back pain, making it one of the most common health complaints. Transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (TPED) is an effective treatment for low back pain that can be performed using different anaesthesia techniques. Our primary objective was to test the hypothesis that bilateral Erector spinae plane block (ESP) plus sedation is equally effective as traditional local infiltration anaesthesia plus sedation in TPED.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients undergoing TPED were randomly assigned to 2 groups: G1 - intravenous sedation with local infiltration anaesthesia; G2 - intravenous sedation with bilateral ESP.PRIMARY OUTCOME: volume of fentanyl and propofol administered during surgery.SECONDARY OUTCOMES: adverse events during sedation reported using the World Society of Intravenous Anaesthesia (SIVA) adverse sedation event tool, level of postoperative sedation measured on the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), intensity of postoperative pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS), mechanical pain threshold (MPT) measured with von Frey monofilaments on both lower extremities, patient satisfaction with analgesia on 5-point Likert scale.RESULTS: Volume of fentanyl, propofol, and level of postoperative sedation was significantly lower in G2 (p < 0.001). There was no difference between groups in intensity of pain, patient satisfaction with analgesia, and mechanical pain threshold after surgery. There were no adverse events in G2, but in G1 2 patients presented minimal risk descriptors, 5 presented minor risk descriptors, and 1 presented sentinel risk descriptors that required additional medication or rescue ventilation.CONCLUSIONS: The ESP was equal to local infiltration anaesthesia in terms of intensity of pain, mechanical pain threshold after surgery, and patient satisfaction; however, ESP reduced the volume of intraoperative fentanyl and propofol, thereby reducing the adverse effects of sedation.

AB  - Basal ganglia and thalamus (BGT) hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury is currently the most contentious issue in cerebral palsy (CP) litigation in South Africa (SA), and merits a consensus response based on the current available international literature. BGT pattern injury is strongly associated with a preceding perinatal sentinel event (PSE), which has a sudden onset and is typically unforeseen and unpreventable. Antepartum pathologies may result in fetal priming, leading to vulnerability to BGT injury by relatively mild hypoxic insults. BGT injury may uncommonly follow a gradual-onset fetal heart rate deterioration pattern, of duration ≥1 hour. To prevent BGT injury in a clinical setting, the interval from onset of PSE to delivery must be short, as little as 10 - 20 minutes. This is difficult to achieve in any circumstances in SA. Each case needs holistic, multidisciplinary, unbiased review of all available antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum and childhood information, aiming at fair resolution without waste of time and resources.

TI  - Preparing the assimilation of the future MTG-IRS sounder into the mesoscale numerical weather prediction AROME model
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The infrared sounder (IRS) instrument is an infrared Fourier-transform spectrometer that will be on board the Meteosat Third Generation series of the future European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellite's geostationary satellites. It will measure the radiance emitted by the Earth at the top of the atmosphere using 1,960 channels. The IRS will provide high spatial- and temporal-frequency four-dimensional information on atmospheric temperature and humidity, winds, clouds, and surfaces, as well as on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The assimilation of these new observations represents a great challenge and opportunity for the improvement of numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast skill, especially for mesoscale models such as the Applications de la Recherche a l'Operationnel a Meso-Echelle (AROME) at Meteo-France. The objectives of this study are to prepare for the assimilation of the IRS in this system and to evaluate its impact on the forecasts when added to the currently assimilated observations. By using an observing system simulation experiment constructed for a mesoscale NWP model. This observing system simulation experiment framework makes use of synthetic observations of both IRS and the currently assimilated observing systems in AROME, constructed from a known and realistic state of the atmosphere. The latter, called the "nature run", is derived from a long and uninterrupted forecast of the mesoscale model. These observations were assimilated and evaluated using a 1 hr update cycle three-dimensional variational data assimilation system over 2-month periods, one in the summer and one in the winter. This study demonstrates the benefits that can be expected from the assimilation of IRS observations into the AROME NWP system. The assimilation of only 75 channels over oceans increases the total amount of observations used in the AROME three-dimensional variational data assimilation system by about 50%. The IRS impact in terms of forecast scores was evaluated and compared for the summer and winter periods. The main findings are as follows: (a) over both periods the assimilation of these observations leads to statistically improved forecasts over the whole atmospheric column; (b) for the summer-season experiment, the forecast ranges up to >$$ > $$48 hr are improved; (c) for the winter-season experiment, the impact on the forecasts is globally positive but is smaller than the summer period and extends only to 24 hr. Based on these results, it is foreseen that the addition of future IRS observations in the AROME NWP systems will significantly improve mesoscale weather forecasts.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of Satellite-Based Models for Crop Yield Estimation in the Canadian Prairies
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely monitoring of crop production using a remote sensing-based approach offers promise toward enhancing food security. Statistical models developed using satellite data typically employ a single vegetation index from a single sensor for yield estimation. With the increasing availability of satellite datasets, there is now an opportunity to investigate the potential of available vegetation indices from different sensors in estimating yields. The key objective of this study was to develop a best-performing satellite-based yield model for the Canadian Prairies for wheat, barley, and canola, trained using municipality-level data from 2009 to 2019. We tested the statistical performance of models built using (a) indices from different sensors (Landsat and Sentinel-2), (b) indices sensitive to different yield properties, and (c) single versus multiple vegetation indices. Results showed Landsat-NDWI as the best performing single-index across all indices and sensors for each crop. Sentinel-2-EVI performed best for wheat and canola and Sentinel-2-SR for barley; but these models were built using only 4 years of data. We found that best-performing single-index models recorded similar predictive accuracy as multi-index models during model validation. The results from this work suggest that satellite-based yield estimation can be improved by selecting the right index related to different crop properties.La surveillance en temps voulu de la production agricole a l'aide d'une approche basee sur la teledetection est prometteuse pour l'amelioration de la securite alimentaire. Les modeles statistiques developpes a partir de donnees satellitaires utilisent generalement un seul indice de vegetation provenant d'un seul capteur pour l'estimation des rendements. Avec la disponibilite croissante des ensembles de donnees satellitaires, il est desormais possible d'etudier le potentiel des indices de vegetation disponibles provenant de differents capteurs pour l'estimation des rendements. L'objectif principal de cette etude etait de developper un modele de rendement base sur les donnees satellitaires les plus performantes pour les Prairies canadiennes pour le ble, l'orge et le canola, entraine a l'aide de donnees au niveau des municipalites de 2009 a 2019. Nous avons teste la performance statistique des modeles construits en utilisant (a) des indices provenant de differents capteurs (Landsat et Sentinel-2), (b) des indices sensibles a differentes proprietes de rendement, et (c) un seul indice de vegetation par rapport a plusieurs. Les resultats ont montre que Landsat-NDWI etait l'indice unique le plus performant parmi tous les indices et capteurs pour chaque culture. Sentinel-2-EVI a donne les meilleurs resultats pour le ble et le canola et Sentinel-2-SR pour l'orge; mais ces modeles ont ete construits en utilisant seulement 4 annees de donnees. Nous avons constate que les modeles a indice unique les plus performants ont enregistre une precision predictive similaire a celle des modeles multi-index lors de la validation du modele. Les resultats de ce travail suggerent que l'estimation du rendement par satellite peut etre amelioree en selectionnant le bon indice lie aux differentes proprietes des cultures.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study investigates the performance of the DiffMag handheld probe (nonlinear magnetometry), to be used for sentinel lymph node detection. Furthermore, the performance of DiffMag is compared with a gamma probe and a first-order magnetometer (Sentimag & REG;, linear magnetometry).MethodsThe performance of all three probes was evaluated based on longitudinal distance, transverse distance, and resolving power for two tracer volumes. A phantom was developed to investigate the performance of the probes for a clinically relevant situation in the floor of the mouth (FOM).ResultsConsidering the longitudinal distance, both DiffMag handheld and Sentimag & REG; probe had comparable performance, while the gamma probe was able to detect at least a factor of 10 deeper. Transverse distances of 13, 11, and 51 mm were measured for the small tracer volume by the DiffMag handheld, Sentimag & REG;, and the gamma probe, respectively. For the large tracer volume this was 21, 18, and 55 mm, respectively. The full width at half maximum, at 7 mm probe height from the phantom surface, was 14, 12, and 18 mm for the small tracer volume and 15, 18, and 25 mm for the large tracer volume with the DiffMag handheld, Sentimag & REG;, and gamma probe, respectively.ConclusionsWith a high resolving power but limited longitudinal distance, the DiffMag handheld probe seems suitable for detecting SLNs which are in close proximity to the primary tumor. In this study, comparable results were shown using linear magnetometry. The gamma probe reached 10 times deeper, but has a lower resolving power compared with the DiffMag handheld probe.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This paper describes the dataset associated with the paper "Product-Specific Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP) in US Counties"(Paudel et al., 2023). This dataset comprises human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) values for 3101 counties in the conterminous US for the years 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. For this dataset, HANPP is the carbon content of specific crop, timber, and livestock grazing products appropriated by humans in a county in a year. To calculate HANPP, raw agricultural data were downloaded from public databases such as USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service Quick Stats and Crop-land Data Layer, US Forest Service Timber Product Output, and NPP data from MODIS. These data were processed in Microsoft Excel using stoichiometry derived from established scientific literature. HANPP was partitioned by year, county, product, used and unused and above- and below-ground. This complete dataset is published in Mendeley Data and the methods used to compile them are included to make our research well documented, reproducible, and useful for future studies.

TI  - Systematic analysis of the flash drought research: contribution, collaboration, and challenges
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Compound extreme events, such as flash drought, have received wide attention in recent decades due to their far-reaching effects on the ecosystem. Thus, a new concept of flash drought has begun to spread globally in the scientific community, and it is continuously being developed. This study offers for the first time an overview of the global trends in flash drought research from 2000 to 2021. The analysis was based on the Scopus database in order to investigate the publication trends, contributions, collaborations, and challenges on a global scale. Furthermore, collaboration analysis was performed to detect collaboration networks within the flash drought research field. A total of 76 studies were published during the study period. The research output grew exponentially with an average growth rate of 30% per year. The challenging issues in the field of flash drought research are the search for appropriate definition of flash drought, the development of effective early warning systems and the scarcity of high-resolution data. By presenting the details of the evolution of this new conceptualization in drought research, our study highlights the main pathways of scientific progress and stimulates future research.

TI  - Warming and increasing precipitation induced greening on the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has a fragile ecosystem that is sensitive to climate change. Due to the amplifying effect of climate change, the QTP has experienced rapid warming and shifting precipitation in recent decades, profoundly impacting the local ecosystem. However, the specific details of how vegetation responds to these changes were unclear, and the corresponding contributions were poorly quantified. Here, we employed an elastic net regression model to investigate the sensitivity of vegetation to climate factors across multiple time scales and various seasons. The vegetation activity was represented by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), while climate change was represented by temperature, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and soil moisture fraction (SMF). During 2000-2020, approximately 50 % of the QTP area showed greening, mainly concentrated in the northern region. Climate change explained approximately 70 % of the variation in vegetation during the growing season, 39 % in spring and 66 % in autumn. Grasslands exhibited the highest sensitive to climate change, with a relative contribution of 83 %, followed by mixed forests (70 %), forests (53 %) and deserts (52 %). Both temperature and precipitation significantly affected vegetation, with relative contributions of 29 % and 22 %, respectively, during the growing season. PAR and SMF had less impact on vegetation, with relative contributions of 8 % and 12 %, respectively. In the greening region, precipitation (26 %) was more important for vegetation growth compared to temperature (25 %). These findings emphasize the importance of precipitation on vegetation on the QTP, providing valuable insights for improving regional ecosystem assessment model and promoting the restoration of fragile ecosystems.

TI  - Past and future trends of diurnal temperature range and their correlation with vegetation assessed by MODIS and CMIP6.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Temperature anomalies and changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) are expected to pose physiological challenges to biota; hence, both spatial and temporal variations in DTR provide important insights into temperature-induced stress in humans, animals, and vegetation. Furthermore, vegetation could dampen temperature variability. Here, we use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data of Land Surface Temperature (LST) to evaluate the global variation in DTR and its rate of change in spatial and temporal scales for the two decades spanning from 2001 to 2020. We show that North America, Africa, and Antarctica, as well as the global mean, experienced statistically significant DTR rates of change over the last 20years in either summer, winter, or the annual mean. The rates were all negative, indicating the day-night temperature differences are decreasing in those regions because night temperatures are increasing at a faster rate than day temperatures. MODIS data of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) revealed a strongly negative correlation with DTR, with a spatial correlation coefficient of -0.61. This correlation demonstrates a prominent dampening effect of vegetation on diurnal temperature oscillations. For future DTR projections, we used 19 models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) to predict global DTR trends from 2021 to 2050 with low and high CO2 concentration scenarios. The high CO2 emission scenario projects significant decreases in DTR in circumpolar regions, central Africa, and India compared to the low CO2 scenario. This difference in the two scenarios underscores the substantial influence of increased global temperatures and elevated CO2 concentration on DTR and, consequently, on the ecosystems in certain regions.

TI  - Monitoring of deforestation events in the tropics using multidimensional features of Sentinel 1 radar data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries and regions are currently developing new forest strategies to better address the challenges facing forest ecosystems. Timely and accurate monitoring of deforestation events is necessary to guide tropical forest management activities. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is less susceptible to weather conditions and plays an important role in high-frequency monitoring in cloudy regions. Currently, most SAR image-based deforestation identification uses manually supervised methods, which rely on high quality and sufficient samples. In this study, we aim to explore radar features that are sensitive to deforestation, focusing on developing a method (named 3DC) to automatically extract deforestation events using radar multidimensional features. First, we analyzed the effectiveness of radar backscatter intensity (BI), vegetation index (VI), and polarization feature (PF) in distinguishing deforestation areas from the background environment. Second, we selected the best-performing radar features to construct a multidimensional feature space model and used an unsupervised K-mean clustering method to identify deforestation areas. Finally, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results in Paraguay, Brazil, and Mexico showed that (1) the overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score (F1) of 3DC were 88.1-98.3% and 90.2-98.5%, respectively. (2) 3DC achieved similar accuracy to supervised methods without the need for samples. (3) 3DC matched well with Global Forest Change (GFC) maps and provided more detailed spatial information. Furthermore, we applied the 3DC to deforestation mapping in Paraguay and found that deforestation events occurred mainly in the second half of the year. To conclude, 3DC is a simple and efficient method for monitoring tropical deforestation events, which is expected to serve the restoration of forests after deforestation. This study is also valuable for the development and implementation of forest management policies in the tropics.

T2  - Canadian journal of diabetes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of 5 interconnected factors, is the main contributor to cardiovascular disease. Although sex- and gender-related elements have been linked to MetS and its components, this association has not been explored among Canadians with or without MetS. In this study we aimed to identify sex and gender differences in characteristics of MetS in the Canadian population.METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) database. The CPCSSN contains de-identified electronic health records of >1.5 million Canadians (2010-2019). Individuals 35 to 75 years of age who had a primary care encounter formed the study sample (N=37,813). Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for sex and gender differences among the Canadians with and without MetS, which was the primary outcome variable.RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of MetS was 41.9%. The risk of developing MetS was significantly lower among females compared with males (odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.76). However, the risk was higher in females who used antidepressants (odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 1.65). An equal distribution of deprivation indexes was observed between males and females with MetS, with risk slightly higher for those with material deprivation. Females were found to be the most socially deprived.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important sex- and gender-specific differences in MetS among Canadians. Targeting sex- and gender-specific risk factors could assist in reversing the trend of adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with MetS.

TI  - Intertwined impacts of urbanization and land cover change on urban climate and agriculture in Aurangabad city (MS), India using google earth engine platform
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Devastation possibility of disenfranchising poor people of emerging countries like India is due to urban climate change. Hence, an urgent and efficient urban planning strategy shall be adopted for the creation/making of sustainable and amicable cities. This research is focused on the interlinked impacts of urbanization and land cover change on urban climate for Aurangabad city, India using Google Earth Engine. Aurangabad city areas are occupied by industrial areas and historical places and thus the city can be converted into a metropolitan city in the future through well planning. Important indicators such as land cover, change detection, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST) are used for the research assessment. Machine learning (ML) model (i.e., random forest (RF)) is developed using google earth engine (GEE) platform and satellite datasets for Land use and land cover (LULC) classification. GEE platform is used for the computation of LST and NDVI (2015-2020) based on Landsat-8 satellite. The vegetation "agriculture land" is observed to be covered more than half of the total area under study (113.48 km2) followed by Wasteland (61.70 km2), Built-up land (34.68 km2), and Water body (3.44 km2). Significantly, over for the years of 2015 and 2020, an increment in the water body area noticed by 11.24 km2 followed by Wasteland (66.30 km2) and urban area (36.70 km2). Whereas the vegetation covered is decreased during period of 2020 with area ratio of 98.95 km2. Study of vegetation's index for the years of 2015 and 2020 revealed NDVI values are decreased. Interlinked land cover vegetation area and NDVI values is showed vegetation land decreased in the city. The LST is identified in the urban area about 2 degrees C in rising in comparison to the year of 2015. The major highlight of this research that LST, NDVI and land cover classes are dramatically changed over the last five years due to built-up land expansion, pollution increase, vegetation land decrease and pollution.

TI  - Analysis of spectral indices-based downscaled land surface temperature in a humid subtropical city
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyses the seasonal influence of error estimated in downscaled land surface temperatures (LSTs) in a humid subtropical city using Landsat 8 data of summer and winter seasons in 2021. Thermal sharpening (TsHARP) algorithm is one of the most frequently used downscaling techniques which is originally based on normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study assesses the capability of the TsHARP technique with a separate combination of four selected spectral indices (modified normalised difference water index, normalised difference bareness index, normalised difference built-up index [NDBI], and NDVI), and by determining the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean error produced by the sharpened LST. Besides, sharpened LST has also been estimated by combining the four spectral indices. It is observed that NDBI provides the most effective output (RMSE is 1.11 [30 m], 1.05 [120 m], 1.02 [240 m], and 0.99 [480 m] in summer, whereas RMSE is 0.61 [30 m], 0.59 [120 m], 0.57 [240 m], and 0.56 [480 m] in winter). NDBI-based sharpened LST generates the best relationship (R = 0.565 in summer and R = 0.537 in winter) with surface features. Fallow land generates the best relationship (R = 0.512 in summer and R = 0.530 in winter) with sharpened LST. The summer season (R = 0.438) generates a better relationship between surface features and sharpened LST than the winter season (R = 0.409).

TI  - Efficient active contours with optical physical parameters for shoreline extraction: a general method and novel framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate shoreline extraction is important for global climate change, land-sea interactions, and ocean dynamics. However, many current shoreline extraction methods have limitations in accuracy and efficiency when applied to different data, resulting from either empirical model parameters or limited image types. Considering the advantages of active contour in applying variational ideas to solve energy generalizations and the universal adaptability of optical physical parameters, an active contours with optical physical parameters (ACOPP) method that rapidly converges for shoreline extraction is proposed in this study. This model uses active contours to calculate the pixel-level energy generalization function of the image and combines the energy of the optical physical parameters to accelerate the process of contour curve approximation to the target edge by energy confrontation through iterative fitting, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the target curves. Different images with multiple time phases in different regions were selected as experimental data, including GF2, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8, to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and universality, while shoreline complexity coefficient was proposed for the study area division, which was used for shoreline extraction by ACOPP. Finally, the extraction results were analysed and validated, and the conclusions are as follows: ACOPP has a faster convergence speed in the extraction process than traditional methods, and the extraction results have a higher spatial resolution. The extraction results were highly accurate, and the mean absolute error (MAE) compared with the validation sets was < 2 pixels. The model is applicable to remote sensing images in which the normalized difference water index (NDWI) can be calculated, that is, optical remote sensing images containing green and near-infrared (or mid-infrared) bands. The experimental results prove the feasibility of ACOPP and a novel framework that combines ACOPP to extract target feature edge information for remote sensing images is proposed, the feasible and extensible of the frame have been verified.

TI  - Enhancing sea ice segmentation in Sentinel-1 images with atrous convolutions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the growing volume of remote sensing data and the low latency required for safe marine navigation, machine learning (ML) algorithms are being developed to accelerate sea ice chart generation, currently a manual interpretation task. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the freely available Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, the ambiguity of backscatter signals for ice types, and the scarcity of open-source high-resolution labelled data makes automating sea ice mapping challenging. We use Extreme Earth version 2, a high-resolution benchmark dataset generated for ML training and evaluation, to investigate the effectiveness of ML for automated sea ice mapping. Our customized pipeline combines ResNets and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling for SAR image segmentation. We investigate the performance of our model for: i) binary classification of sea ice and open water in a segmentation framework; and ii) a multiclass segmentation of five sea ice types. For binary ice-water classification, models trained with our largest training set have weighted F1 scores all greater than 0.95 for January and July test scenes. Specifically, the median weighted F1 score was 0.98, indicating high performance for both months. By comparison, a competitive baseline U-Net has a weighted average F1 score of ranging from 0.92 to 0.94 (median 0.93) for July, and 0.97 to 0.98 (median 0.97) for January. Multiclass ice type classification is more challenging, and even though our models achieve 2% improvement in weighted F1 average compared to the baseline U-Net, test weighted F1 is generally between 0.6 and 0.80. Our approach can efficiently segment full SAR scenes in one run, is faster than the baseline U-Net, retains spatial resolution and dimension, and is more robust against noise compared to approaches that rely on patch classification.

TI  - Improvement of quad-polarized velocity bunching modulation transfer function by C-band Gaofen-3 SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of our work is to improve the modulation transfer function (MTF) of velocity bunching by the quad-polarized GF-3 synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In total, more than 10,000 Gaofen-3 (GF-3) images acquired in wave mode (WV) in quad-polarization are collocated with ocean waves simulated from WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) model and ocean currents from the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The validation of WW3-simulated significant wave height (SWH) against the measurements from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) yields a 0.48 m root-mean-square error (RMSE) of SWH with a 0.88 correlation coefficient (r). The winds are inverted using the geophysical model function (GMF), denoted as CSARMOD-GF, which is specially for the re-calibrated GF-3 SAR in vertical-vertical (VV) polarization. The azimuthal cut-off wavelength ?(c) caused by velocity bunching is theoretically calculated by wave spectrum from WW3 model and practically estimated from SAR intensity image, respectively. It is found that the velocity bunching is independent with polarization; however, the bias (theoretic minus SAR-derived ?(c) ) increases with sea state growing and has no obvious relationship with current. Following this rationale, the MTF of velocity bunching is empirically constructed by including the term of wind speed and the analysis shows a 3.76 m RMSE with a 0.92 r through comparing the SAR-derived ?(c) in VV polarization and simulated values. Under this circumstance, the accuracy of wave retrieval is anticipated to be improved when using the proposed MTF of velocity bunching.

TI  - Comparing hydrologic impacts on recreational trails to remotely sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Trails systems have impacts on the surrounding hydrology and vegetation health. Trails not only remove and disturb vegetation but also compact the soil. This may result in water pooling and flowing along the trail which may result in changes to the watershed. This paper explores whether readily available remotely sensed data can be used to detect hydrologic and geomorphic changes on the ground. We collected data about areas of deposition and paths of transportation along the trails. Two 3-m resolution aerial images were acquired from Planet Labs and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) band combinations were calculated. We also acquired the most recent lidar data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This lidar data was used to construct a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the trail system followed by a flow accumulation, slope, and curvature raster. Statistical analysis was used to determine a relationship between the intensity of on the ground observa- tions of hydrologic change and the remote sensing raster using box plots and nominal logistic regression. Results varied depending on the raster layer evaluated and the inclusion of a buffer around the deposition areas and transportation paths.

TI  - Assessment and Analysis of Crop Irrigation by the Combination of Modelling and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Crop irrigation should be properly monitored to plan the use of land water resources and their repartition among competing activities. Appropriate statistical approaches can be applied to infer the irrigation water (IW) supplied over a cropped area relying on ground observations and the outputs of calibrated crop development models. The collection of such reference samples over relatively large areas and multiyear periods, however, is often hampered by practical problems that limit the possibility of obtaining precise estimates of the IW actually supplied. One of the possible ways to overcome these issues and increase the precision of the IW observations is through a regression correction versus wall-to-wall IW covariates obtained from remotely sensed images. Specifically, the correction of the reference IW observations can be performed using mapped IW estimates yielded by the combination of meteorological data and Sentinel-2 NDVI images. This strategy was tested in a 10 x 10 km2 agricultural area in Southern Tuscany (Central Italy) during 2018-2022. The high correlations found between the reference and remotely sensed IW values allowed us to obtain satisfactory results for all years. The regression corrections applied had very high relative efficiencies (> 30) and notably enhanced the IW precisions obtained from the reference samples. The dynamics of the corrected IW observations were finally analysed versus the possible drivers, yielding useful indications for the management of local water resources.

TI  - Enhancing Landsat image based aboveground biomass estimation of black locust with scale bias-corrected LiDAR AGB map and stratified sampling
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There is a growing interest in leveraging LiDAR-generated forest Aboveground Biomass (LG-AGB) data as a reference to retrieve AGB from satellite observations. However, the biases arising from the upscaling process and the impact of the sampling strategy on model accuracy still need to be resolved. In this study, we first corrected the bias arising from upscaling the LG-AGB map to match the spatial resolution of Landsat observations. Subsequently, the stratified random sampling method was used to select training samples from the corrected LG-AGB map (cLG-AGB) for the Random Forest (RF) regression model. The RF model features were extracted from the Landsat observations and auxiliary data. The impact of strata numbers on model accuracy was explored during the sampling process. Finally, independent validation was conducted using in situ measurements. The results indicated that: (1) about 68% of the biases can be corrected in the up-scale transformation; (2) compared to no stratification, a three-strata model achieved a 6.5% improvement in AGB estimation accuracy while requiring a 37.8% reduction in sample size; (3) the black locust forest had a low saturation point at 60.52 & PLUSMN; 4.46 Mg/ha AGB and 72.4% AGB values were underestimated and the remaining were overestimated. In summary, our study provides a framework to harmonize near-surface LiDAR and satellite data for AGB estimation in plantation forest ecosystems with small patch sizes and fragmented distribution.

TI  - Estimation of tropical forest aboveground biomass in Nepal using multiple remotely sensed data and deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the prediction accuracy of the forest aboveground biomass (AGB) model using remotely sensed data sources (i.e. airborne laser scanning (ALS), RapidEye, Landsat), and the combination of ALS with RapidEye/Landsat using parametric weighted least squares (WLS) regression. We also analysed the AGB model using random forests, extremely randomized trees, and deep learning stacked autoencoder (SAE) network from nonparametric statistics to compare the performance with WLS regression. We also compared the widths of the 95% confidence intervals for estimates of the mean AGB per unit area using the model-based estimator. The study site in the Terai Arc Landscape, Nepal, comprised 14 protected areas extending from the southern part of Nepal to India and encompassed mosaics of continuous dense forest and tall grassland. The ALS data provided the largest prediction accuracy (0.30-0.35 relative root mean squared error (rRMSE)), whereas RapidEye and Landsat had smaller prediction accuracies (0.48-0.54 and 0.47-0.55 rRMSE, respectively) for the estimation of AGB. The combined use of ALS and RapidEye predictors in the AGB model reduced the rRMSE and narrowed the confidence interval compared with ALS alone, but the improvements were minor. The SAE prediction technique provided the largest prediction accuracy, with inputs of combined ALS and RapidEye predictors that yielded an R-2 of 0.80, an rRMSE of 0.30, and a confidence interval of 176-184 compared to other tested prediction techniques. The SAE prediction technique can become more powerful than other tested prediction techniques if properly adjusted and tuned for accurate forest AGB mapping applications. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the performance of the SAE in AGB modelling with a range of hyper-parameter values.

TI  - Historical and projected evolutions of glaciers in response to climate change in High Mountain Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier changes are regarded as the conspicuous icon of climate change in High Mountain Asia (HMA) alpine environments. Multi-temporal glacier coverage is essential for mass balance estimations and understanding glacial changes in response to climate variability. However, consistent multi-temporal glacier area datasets across the HMA are limited due to challenges posed by seasonal snow and cloud cover in remote sensing satellite images. In this study, a new method is proposed to estimate glacier and nonseasonal snow (GNS) areas by combining the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and bright temperature bands from Landsat remote sensing images in 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. Meanwhile, the integrated ice dynamic Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) is applied to simulate nine typical glaciers and project their changes using 15 general circulation models (GCMs) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The results showed that total GNS areas in HMA were estimated at 71.26 x 103 km2 in the 1990s, and decreased to 53.17 x 103 km2 in the 2020s. Massive proportions of GNS were mainly distributed in the southeast and northwest region. Tipping points of GNS indicating a transition from mass balance gain to loss during four periods were detected in the Upper Tarim basin, Inner Tibetan Plateau, Upper Yangtze river basin, Upper Brahmaputra river basin, and Upper Salween river basin. The reduction of total GNS area was attributed to significantly rising temperature and decreasing solid precipitation. The projections indicate that glacier shrinkages will be the dominant trend in the future, and most typical glaciers will experience a mass loss of 60% under SSP245 (SSP2-RCP4.5) and over 90% under SSP585 (SSP5-RCP8.5) by the end of the century. The response of glaciers to climate change is also found to be influenced by factors including local topography and elevation ranges. The findings of this study provides a better understanding of glacial dynamics in response to climate change and highlights the importance of making water resources management strategies to mitigate the influence of glacier retreat.

TI  - Decadal decrease in Los Angeles methane emissions is much smaller than bottom-up estimates.
T2  - Nature communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has a short atmospheric lifetime (~12 years), so that emissions reductions will have a rapid impact on climate forcing. In megacities such as Los Angeles (LA), natural gas (NG) leakage is the primary atmospheric methane source. The magnitudes and trends of fugitive NG emissions are largely unknown and need to be quantified to verify compliance with emission reduction targets. Here we use atmospheric remote sensing data to show that, in contrast to the observed global increase in methane emissions, LA area emissions decreased during 2011-2020 at a mean rate of (-1.57±0.41) %/yr. However, the NG utility calculations indicate a much larger negative emissions trend of -5.8 %/yr. The large difference between top-down and bottom-up trends reflects the uncertainties in estimating the achieved emissions reductions. Actions taken in LA can be a blueprint for COP28 and future efforts to reduce methane emissions.

TI  - A practically feasible transfer learning method for deep-temporal urban change monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Neural networks have shown their potential to monitor urban changes with deep-temporal remote sensing data, which simultaneously considers a large number of observations within a given window. However, training these networks with supervision is a challenge due to the low availability of third-party sources with sufficient spatio-temporal resolution to label each window individually. To remedy this problem, we developed a novel approach utilizing transfer learning (TL) on a set of deep-temporal windows. We demonstrate that labelling of multiple windows simultaneously can be practically viable, even with a low amount of high spatial resolution third-party data. The overall process provides a trade-off between labour resources and the ability to train a network on existing systems, despite its intensive memory requirements. As a demonstration, an existing previously trained (pre-trained) network was used to transfer knowledge to a new target location. We demonstrate our method with combined Sentinel 1 and 2 observations for the area of Liege (Belgium) for the time period spanning 2017-2020. This is underpinned by our use of common metrics in machine learning and remote sensing, and in our discussion of selected examples. Three independent transfers of the same pre-trained model and their combination were carried out, all of which showed an improvement in terms of these metrics.

TI  - Developing a near-seamless tidal datum by integrating tidal and satellite altimetry data with a Digital Elevation Model for maritime boundary delimitation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The delimitation of maritime boundaries plays a significant role in preserving the country's sovereignty and jurisdiction. The maritime baseline was established based on the combination of maritime basepoints, which represents the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) along the coast. However, the current approach still relies on the limited and sparsely distributed tide gauge stations for the determination of LAT. Therefore, this study aims to develop the Peninsular Malaysia Near-Seamless Tidal Datum (PMNSTD) by integrating tide gauge, satellite altimetry, and Tide Model Driver (TMD) data. PMNSTD was further integrated with Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for the delimitation of maritime boundaries. This study methodology includes data acquisitions of 12 tide gauge stations along the coast of Peninsular Malaysia, satellite altimetry data for TOPEX, Jason-1, Jason-2, and GEOSAT Follow-On (GFO) from Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS), TMD, and TerraSAR-X add on for Digital Elevation Measurement 30 m (TanDEM-X) data. The tide gauge, satellite altimetry, and TMD data encompass 23 years of tidal observation data from 1993 to 2015. For the derivation of the tidal datum, the tide gauge and satellite altimetry data were analysed using harmonic analysis in UTide, whereas, for the TMD data, the tidal datum was determined based on tidal prediction. For compatibility in data integration, the derived Lowest and Highest Astronomical Tide (LAT and HAT) from tide gauge, satellite altimetry, and TMD data were referenced to the Mean Sea Level (MSL), denoted as ${\rm{LA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}{\rm{ }}$LATmsl and ${\rm{HA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$HATmsl respectively. Next, the ${\rm{LA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}{\rm{ }}$LATmsl and ${\rm{HA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$HATmsl was interpolated using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to develop the PMNSTD (${\rm{LA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}{\rm{ }}$LATmsl and ${\rm{HA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$HATmsl) using ArcGIS. The statistical assessment indicates that the PMNSTD (${\rm{LA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}{\rm{ }}$LATmsl and ${\rm{HA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$HATmsl) established from the integration of tide gauge, satellite altimetry, and TMD has a better agreement with the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) tide gauges with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (STD) of 0.228 m and 0.175 m for ${\rm{LA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$LATmsl, as well as 0.159 m and 0.079 m for ${\rm{HA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$HATmsl. Next, the PMNSTD (${\rm{LA}}{{\rm{T}}_{{\rm{msl}}}}$LATmsl) was integrated with TanDEM-X using ArcGIS and SURFER for the delimitation of maritime boundaries. The reliability assessment illustrated a significant improvement in the continuation of 201 maritime basepoints in comparison to the 95 maritime basepoints by the DSMM. In conclusion, the proposed approach has shown a continuous, consistent, and wider establishment of the country's maritime baseline for the Peninsular Malaysia region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of water hyacinth dynamics as a response to seasonal climate variability in Lake Tana, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana, which is the largest Lake in Ethiopia, has been invaded by water hyacinths since 2011. Although the government and the community have devoted considerable time and energy over a long period to removing the invasive weed mechanically and manually, the weed has been increasing significantly. Accurate, reliable, and timely information on the spatiotemporal distribution and extent of water hyacinth is crucial to determine its evolution, propagation, and potentially vulnerable areas of the Lake. Therefore, comprehensive information on the spatial distribution of water hyacinths and their annual and seasonal variability is essential for Lake Tana's water resource planning, development, and management. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal pattern of water hyacinth and its dynamics with seasonal climate variability and impact on evapotranspiration. Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel 2 and meteorological datasets were employed. Supervised and manual digitization image classification methods were applied to prepare Land-use/ Land-cover in the Lake. The Mann-Kendall trend test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the trend of water hyacinth and the impact of climate variability on water hyacinth distribution respectively. Besides, the evapotranspiration and water losses were estimated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method. The surface extent of the water hyacinth in Lake Tana has increased by 96% in 2019 from 2011. However, the surface area of the Lake has declined. That means 1603 ha of water surface area has been changed to land surface from 2011 to 2019. The average volume of water loss in Lake Tana was 0.21% of the volume of the Lake from September 2016 to December 2018.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Evapotranspiration and Its Driving Factors in the Urumqi River Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key indicator of arid and semi-arid ecosystem processes and hydrological cycles. The study of basin-scale ET characteristics and drivers can provide a better understanding of regional water balance and energy cycles. This study used the Pixel Information Expert Engine platform based on MODIS (MOD16A2) data to extract the separate spatial and temporal characteristics of interannual and seasonal ET in the Urumqi River Basin in Xinjiang, China, over a 20-year period, from 2000 to 2020, and to analyze the influence of land-use data and altitude on ET in the basin. The average interannual ET in the watershed has had an increasing trend over the past two decades, varying from 126.57 mm to 247.66 mm, with the maximum ET in July and the minimum in December. On the seasonal scale, the ET trend is greatest in summer, followed by spring, and it is the least in winter. Spatially, the surface ET in the Urumqi River Basin is generally high in the upstream area and low in the downstream area, with the average multi-year ET throughout the basin falling within the range of 22.74-479.33 mm. The average ET for each type of land use showed that forest land had the highest ET and unused land the lowest. Analysis found that the effect of altitude on ET was more pronounced, with a significant increase in ET as altitude increases. Analysis of the drivers of ET change from 2000 to 2020 using the Optimal Parameters-based Geographical Detector model (OPGD) showed that the natural factors that had the greatest influence were, in descending order, temperature > vegetation cover > precipitation. Among the interacting factors, vegetation index with temperature, elevation, and precipitation and land use with elevation had a relatively greater influence on ET in the basin, and the effects of interacting factors were all greater than those of single factors.

These occurrences, their contexts, and fields of meaning demonstrate its distinctive place within the Qur'anic moral worldview, at the nexus between private virtue ethics and collective praxis. Qist is presented not merely as an abstract ideal, but as a specific, concrete social and economic goal for the marginalized and disempowered of any community. Especially in the domains of gender relations, poverty conditions, and authorial power, the divine injunction for applying equality in lived contexts becomes a call for liberation from "zulm" (injustice) and "taghut" (false deities). Can the examination of this concept and its affiliates form the basis for a scriptural theorization on an Islamic theology of social and economic justice, of resistance to tyranny and unjust constructions of privilege and superiority? Towards an answer to this inquiry, one can argue that qist directs attention to the practical ways of applying the overarching, comprehensive value of shari'ah, al-'adl (justice), as well as to its defining features of collectivity and distributiveness.

TI  - Unveiling Nature's Resilience: Exploring Vegetation Dynamics during the COVID-19 Era in Jharkhand, India, with the Google Earth Engine
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to global health and economic stability. Intriguingly, the necessary lockdown measures, while disruptive to human society, inadvertently led to environmental rejuvenation, particularly noticeable in decreased air pollution and improved vegetation health. This study investigates the lockdown's impact on vegetation health in Jharkhand, India, employing the Google Earth Engine for cloud-based data analysis. MODIS-NDVI data were analyzed using spatio-temporal NDVI analyses and time-series models. These analyses revealed a notable increase in maximum vegetation greenery of 19% from April 2019 to 2020, with subsequent increases of 13% and 3% observed in March and May of the same year, respectively. A longer-term analysis from 2000 to 2020 displayed an overall 16.7% rise in vegetation greenness. While the maximum value remained relatively constant, it demonstrated a slight increment during the dry season. The Landsat data Mann-Kendall trend test reinforced these findings, displaying a significant shift from a negative NDVI trend (1984-2019) to a positive 17.7% trend (1984-2021) in Jharkhand's north-west region. The precipitation (using NASA power and Merra2 data) and NDVI correlation were also studied during the pre- and lockdown periods. Maximum precipitation (350-400 mm) was observed in June, while July typically experienced around 300 mm precipitation, covering nearly 85% of Jharkhand. Interestingly, August 2020 saw up to 550 mm precipitation, primarily in Jharkhand's southern region, compared to 400 mm in the same month in 2019. Peak changes in NDVI value during this period ranged between 0.6-0.76 and 0.76-1, observed throughout the state. Although the decrease in air pollution led to improved vegetation health, these benefits began to diminish post-lockdown. This observation underscores the need for immediate attention and intervention from scientists and researchers. Understanding lockdown-induced environmental changes and their impact on vegetation health can facilitate the development of proactive environmental management strategies, paving the way towards a sustainable and resilient future.

TI  - Application of Sustainability Index of Tidal River Management (SITRM) in the Lower Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability index (SI) is a relatively new concept for measuring the performance of water resource systems over long time periods. The purpose of its definition is to provide an indication of the integral behavior of the system with regard to possible undesired consequences if a misbalance in available and required waters occurs. Therefore, the tidal river management (TRM) approach has been implemented for the past three decades (from 1990 to 2020) within the polder system in Southwest Bangladesh to achieve water sustainability. TRM plan and watershed management plan (WMP) have commonalities as both are aimed at ensuring the sustainable use of watershed resources with the management of land, water, and the wider ecosystem of the watershed in an integrated way. The TRM plan focuses mostly on coastal regions, whereas the WMP focuses on both coastal and non-coastal regions. According to this, the aim of this study was to explore the application of the sustainability index of tidal river management (SITRM) in measuring the sustainability of tidal river management in the coastal area of the Lower Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta. In order to quantify the sustainability of tidal river management, this research first provided the components and indicators of SITRM for the coastal region. The study follows a 5-point Likert scale for opinion survey of key informants and comprises households' survey of farmers. In addition, it includes Landsat satellite images from Earth Explorer of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and direct field observation to collect information regarding the indicators of SITRM. The study measures the index value of SITRM for identifying the water sustainability of Beel East Khukshia-TRM. The index value was 71.8 out of 100, showing good tidal river management for the Hari-Teka-Bhadra catchment. To achieve water sustainability and aid stakeholders and water managers in decision making, it may be possible to include the SITRM framework in tidal river management projects. In addition, the SITRM is more capable of facing drainage congestion, waterlogging, and climate change issues than watershed sustainability index (WSI), Canadian water sustainability index (CWSI), West Java water sustainability index (WJWSI), and water poverty index (WPI). Therefore, water professionals and policymakers can apply SITRM to assess the resilience of specific TRM schemes for greater sustainability in different coastal regions of the world.

TI  - Management of clinically node-negative early-stage oral cancer: network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
T2  - International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The best treatments for the clinically node-negative (cN0) neck in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients are a subject of ongoing debate and there is no consensus. A network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was conducted to determine the most effective treatment and to rank treatments based on their effectiveness. A systematic search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines to retrieve RCTs that compared therapeutic neck dissection (TND), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and elective neck dissection (END). The outcomes analysed were overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and nodal recurrence. Hazard ratios and risk ratios were calculated by direct meta-analysis and NMA. Ten RCTs with a total of 1858 patients were eligible for inclusion. Direct meta-analysis showed END to be superior to TND and comparable to SLNB. The NMA revealed no statistically significant difference between END and SLNB (very low quality evidence) regarding OS, DSS, DFS, and nodal recurrence. However, END was found to significantly improve OS and DFS, and reduce nodal recurrence when compared to TND (moderate quality evidence). END ranked as probably the top treatment option for maximizing OS and DSS, and reducing nodal recurrence in early-stage OSCC, followed by SLNB and TND. There was very low quality evidence supporting SLNB as non-inferior to END for patients with early-stage OSCC. This NMA yielded favourable results for the use of END (with moderate quality evidence) in early-stage OSCC patients, although excellent results have also been obtained with SLNB. However, data in the literature for SLNB are scarce, as this technique has not yet been formalized in many countries. There is a need to further explore SLNB for early-stage OSCC patients, as well as its value in detecting occult lymph node metastases on the contralateral side. More studies comparing morbidity, quality of life, and costs between the different management strategies for the clinically negative neck in early-stage OSCC patients are needed.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Mapping and Fire Potential Severity Assessment: A Case Study for Eucalypts and Shrubland Areas in the Central Inland Region of Portugal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrubland and forestland covers are highly prone to fire. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used for biomass quantitative assessment. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to compute the NDVI annual curve for two types of land cover eucalypts and shrubland areas; (2) to collect field data in these two types of land cover to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB); and (3) to produce AGB maps for eucalypts and shrubland areas by modelling AGB with NDVI, validate them with other data sources, and to compare fuel loads with fire severity levels. A study area in the central inland region of Portugal was considered. The wildfire on 4 August 2023 was considered for burn severity levels assessment using the Normalized Burn Index (NRB). The Sentinel-2 MSI imagery was used to compute the NDVI for the years of 2022 and 2023 and the NBR for the pre-fire and post-fire dates. The NDVI annual curve for 2022 showed a minimum observed between July and August, in accordance with the climatological data, and allowed differentiating eucalypts from shrubland areas. Spectral signatures also confirmed this differentiation. The fitted linear models for AGB prediction using the NDVI imagery showed good fitting performances (R2 of 0.76 and 0.77). The AGB maps provided a relevant decision support tool for forest management and for fire hazard and fire severity mitigation. Further research is needed using more robust datasets for an independent validation of the model.

TI  - Remotely Incorrect? Accounting for Nonclassical Measurement Error in Satellite Data on Deforestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research relying on remotely sensed data on land use and deforestation has exploded in recent years. While satellite-based measures have clear advantages in terms of coverage, the presence of measurement error within these products is often overlooked. Here, we detail the econometric implications of these errors when analyzing the determinants of binary measures of deforestation or forest cover. We then discuss estimators that exploit knowledge of the remote-sensing process to obtain consistent estimates. Finally, we assess our estimators via simulation and an impact evaluation of a conservation program in Mexico. We find that both geography and characteristics of the raw data can lead to systematic underreporting of deforestation. However, accounting for these sources of error, which are common across many satellite-based metrics, can limit the bias from misclassification.

TI  - Machine Learning Techniques in Predicting Bottom Hole Temperature and Remote Sensing for Assessment of Geothermal Potential in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global demand for energy is increasing rapidly due to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as to meet the desire for a higher standard of living. However, environmental concerns, such as air pollution from fossil fuels, are becoming limiting factors for energy sources. Therefore, the appropriate and sustainable solution is to transition towards renewable energy sources to meet global energy demands by using environmentally friendly sources, such as geothermal. The Harrat Rahat volcanic field, located in the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), gets more attention due to its geothermal potential as a viable site for geothermal energy exploration due to its high enthalpy. The prime objective of this study is to present up-to-date and comprehensive information on the utilization of borehole temperature and remote sensing data to identify the most prospective zones with significant geothermal activity favorable for exploration and drilling. A brief description of the selected wells and the methodology used to determine the petrophysical parameters relevant to the geothermal potential assessment are presented. Special emphasis is given to gamma-ray ray and temperature logs for calculating heat production and the geothermal gradient. The effectiveness of various machine learning techniques are assessed throughout this study for predicting the temperature-at-depth to evaluate the suitability of employing machine learning models for temperature prediction, and it is found that XG Boost provided excellent results. It can be observed that some linear anomalies can be traced in the NW, trending on the west side of the Harrat volcanic field based on magnetic data interpretation. The land surface temperature in 2021 exhibited higher temperatures compared to 2000, suggesting potential volcanic activity in the subsurface. It is concluded that the integration of remote sensing data with subsurface data provides the most reliable results.

TI  - Assessing the Hazard Degree of Wadi Malham Basin in Saudi Arabia and Its Impact on North Train Railway Infrastructure
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Train Railway in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) extends over vast areas, crossing various terrains, including valleys, sand veins, plateaus, and hills. Therefore, the railway was designed and implemented to suit this environmental diversity under the highest safety standards. However, the railway may be subject to hazards for various reasons. In general, the possibility of direct surface runoff disasters increases if there are residential areas and facilities within the boundaries of drainage basins. Therefore, these areas should be studied, and the degree of hazard in drainage basins should be accurately determined. Hence, this study analyzed the degree of risk of 14 drainage basins affecting the North Train Railway within the Wadi Malham drainage basin. The risk degree model was used with eight parameters that have hydrological indications to give an idea of the behavior of direct surface runoff and alter the risk of direct surface runoff. We found that 28.57% of the total basins in the study area have overall score values indicating they are high-risk basins, namely basins 6, 7, 13, and 14. It is recommended to estimate the rainfall depth during different return periods, analyze soil permeability and land use classification in the study area, and apply hydrological modeling of drainage basins, which contributes to estimating the volume and peak of direct surface runoff in such arid and semi-arid environments that do not contain hydrometric stations to monitor the runoff.

AB  - Changes in land use and cover (LULC) are now considered as a significant concern because they have a great impact on biodiversity loss and climate changes. Therefore, the present study was applied to assess the effect of land use dynamic on land surface temperature (LST). LULC maps of years; 1991, 2001, 2014, and 2022 were applied using Maximum likelihood classification MLC) while the LST was developed using thermal bands of Landsat images. LULC maps showed a considerable development and improvement in vegetation cover and urbanization. Results showed a negative and positive correlation between LST with NDVI and NDBI respectively. It was revealed that the estimated and predicted LST confirm the reliability of the present model with R2 = 0.95. The study calculated that the maximum LST in 2022 to simulate current state of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and the results were 32.1, 45.5, 38.7 and 41.3 in winter, summer, autumn and spring respectively. We are now sounding the alarm because the state must act quickly and decisively to stop intensive forestation if it is to avoid very high temperatures by 2030. Our findings point to the need for environmental protection in response to the study area's quick conversion of LULC and increasing trend of LST. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of COSPAR.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: 85-90% of local recurrences after breastconserving surgery occurs within the index quadrant. Intraoperative radiotherapy may be a good alternative for eligible patients avoiding long course of adjuvant radiation.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were early stage node negative at least 50 years at time of inclusion, unicentric less than 30mm in diameter any hormone receptor status. 21 Gy was delivered intraoperatively, biologically equivalent to 58 to 60 Gy in standard fractionation using electron beam to 90% isodose line. Cosmetic, Oncological and Patient Satisfaction Evaluation of treated Patients between March 2018 and August 2020 at the King Khalid university hospital, using the IOeRT (Mobetron ). Evaluation done at a combined clinic between surgical and radiation oncology teams at the end of the follow up period before publication.RESULTS: 15 female patients were evaluable with mean follow up period 33.8 months (19-48 months). Mean Age 56.4 years (50-65 years). Mean tumor size 1.213 cm. Majority of patients were T1. 2 patients showed Sentinel lymph node positive.21 Gy was delivered intraoperatively.4 Patients (26.7%) received adjuvant postoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). 2 patients due to being in Caution group due to positive extensive Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). External beam radiation was 40 Gy/15 fractions/3 weeks using three dimensional radiation therapy (3DCRT). Cosmetically, Apart from one patient score 9 due to presence of keloid scar formation, most patients were in range of 0-3 according to physician evaluation and Modified Hollander's score otherwise, No more than score 3 in any of the patients was detected. Oncologically, Till the time of publication no local or distant relapses was detected. As a patient experience, 100 % of patients were satisfied.CONCLUSION: Breast IOERT is a convenient, safe and a valid treatment modality as an option for patients who are otherwise appropriate candidates for APBI. Proper patient selection should focus on clinicopathologic factors predictive of negative nodes and negative margins. Careful assessment of preoperative mammographic and other imaging studies for features, such as extent of calcifications, may be helpful.

AB  - We maintain the thesis that the concept of hegemony developed by Gramsci is deficient in two key points: in terms of explaining the modes of integration characteristic of complex societies, and in its projection regarding the construction of future society. The two aspects are related in that both refer to the conception of an ethical totality (Hegel), vertebrated by a worldview. The concept of hegemony, according to this, should overcome in a radical way its deep ethicist dimension, its substantial ethos. For the exposition of this thesis, we make a confrontation of the Gramscian position with the observations of the great classical sociology (Durkheim, Weber) and particularly with the approaches of Habermas and Rawls.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Mapping of Habitats Using Remote-Sensing Data and Machine-Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Progress toward habitat protection goals can effectively be performed using satellite imagery and machine-learning (ML) models at various spatial and temporal scales. In this regard, habitat types and landscape structures can be discriminated against using remote-sensing (RS) datasets. However, most existing research in three-dimensional (3D) habitat mapping primarily relies on same/cross-sensor features like features derived from multibeam Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), hydrographic LiDAR, and aerial images, often overlooking the potential benefits of considering multi-sensor data integration. To address this gap, this study introduced a novel approach to creating 3D habitat maps by using high-resolution multispectral images and a LiDAR-derived Digital Surface Model (DSM) coupled with an object-based Random Forest (RF) algorithm. LiDAR-derived products were also used to improve the accuracy of the habitat classification, especially for the habitat classes with similar spectral characteristics but different heights. Two study areas in the United Kingdom (UK) were chosen to explore the accuracy of the developed models. The overall accuracies for the two mentioned study areas were high (91% and 82%), which is indicative of the high potential of the developed RS method for 3D habitat mapping. Overall, it was observed that a combination of high-resolution multispectral imagery and LiDAR data could help the separation of different habitat types and provide reliable 3D information.

AB  - In a volcanic context, the spectral response of lava flows depends on several endogenous and exogenous factors, like chemical composition, passing of years and weathering. A deeper knowledge about lava properties can be inferred by investigating their spectral response in satellite images. Here, we compare the spectral response of lava in time, physical, and chemical characteristics, inspecting visible to infrared high spatial resolution ESA Sentinel-2 satellite images of different volcanoes. Our results show increasing and decreasing patterns of the lava spectral response as a function of time and physicochemical composition.

TI  - LiDAR Data and HRSI to Evaluate the Mitigating Effect of Forests into Rockfall Risk Analysis Using SOM: <i>Mt San Liberatore</i> Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of our work is to develop a methodology to identify the areas most prone to natural rockfall retention through the integrated use of remote sensing data. The area chosen as a case study is located in Campania (Italy) nearby Mount San Liberatore. In this area, which is itself geomorphologically predisposed to landslide risk, there are several rockfall risk hotspots, so defined because of the high exposed value constituted by an articulated infrastructure network located along the northwest slope of the mountain. The area is largely covered by dense vegetation, of which holm oak is the most representative type, characterized by a taproot apparatus that, giving it strength and stability, makes it an ideal tree for slope protection. Based on high-resolution multispectral satellite images, vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated to estimate health status, approximate age, average height, robustness, and vigor. Morphometric parameters suitable for describing slope dynamics were also calculated, derived from LiDAR data. The classification of areas with similar characteristics was carried out using Self-Organizing Maps. The results made it possible to identify all those areas where there is a greater contribution of protective forests in the mitigation of rockfall risk and, consequently, to identify areas to carry out a combined strengthening of protective actions.

The 5-level hierarchical classification scheme implemented by MCRMP identified at Level 2 'Atolls' as one of the main types of coral reef complexes. In this review, the qualitative criteria used by MCRMP to identify atolls are presented. Then, we report on the global census of atolls, from which a consistent geomorphologic GIS database is provided. A total of 598 atolls are identified and mapped. The quantitative database provides surface areas for all geomorphologic units at Level 4 and 5 of the MCRMP classification scheme. It allows further work on atoll and coral reef classifications, regionally and globally, in order to identify geomorphic trends and outliers. It is also a convenient database to use in multivariate analyses with ancillary biodiversity, fishery, socio-economic or climate data.

TI  - Estimation of air pollution removal capacity by urban vegetation from very high-resolution satellite images in Lithuania
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In cities, particulate matter (PM10), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ground level ozone (O3) are some of the most significant air pollutants that have negative effects on human health, vegetation, and biodiversity. The city of Kaunas (Lithuania) represents the geographical region of north-eastern Europe and the Humid continental climate zone. By using a satellite-based approach with Worldview-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery at the very-high spatial and spectral resolution, we have detected and classified the most common tree species (a total of 284,305 trees) in Kaunas with an overall accuracy of about 88% e.g., Acer spp. (10%), Aesculus hippocastanum (11%), Pinus spp. (9%), Quercus spp. (24%), and Tilia spp. (5%) in both private (e. g., residential gardens) and public areas over a large study area (56 km2). The green cover of Kaunas city represents 64% of the total study area. In 2022, the 284,305 trees detected in Kaunas city center and surrounding areas have removed approximately 2084 tons of NO2, 217 tons of PM10, and 22,938 tons of CO2 while dominant trees formed more O3 than they absorbed (1204 tons released) mainly due to the high ozone formation potential of Quercus spp.

TI  - Trends in the application of remote sensing in blue carbon science
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), such as mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, are increasingly recognized as natural climate solutions. Evaluating the current extent, losses, and gains of BCEs is crucial to estimating greenhouse gas emissions and supporting policymaking. Remote sensing approaches are uniquely suited to assess the factors driving BCEs dynamics and their impacts at various spatial and temporal scales. Here, we explored trends in the application of remote sensing in blue carbon science. We used bibliometric analysis to assess 2193 published papers for changes in research focus over time (1990 - June 2022). Over the past three decades, publications have steadily increased, with an annual growth rate of 16.9%. Most publications focused on mangrove ecosystems and used the optical spaceborne Landsat mission, presumably due to its long-term, open-access archives. Recent technologies such as LiDAR, UAVs, and acoustic sensors have enabled fine-scale mapping and monitoring of BCEs. Dominant research topics were related to mapping and monitoring natural and human impacts on BCEs, estimating vegetation and biophysical parameters, machine and deep learning algorithms, management (including conservation and restoration), and climate research. Based on corresponding author affiliations, 80 countries contributed to the field, with United States (27.2%), China (15.0%), Australia (7.5%), and India (6.0%) holding leading positions. Overall, our results reveal the need to increase research efforts for seagrasses, saltmarshes, and macroalgae, integrate technologies, increase the use of remote sensing to support carbon accounting methodologies and crediting schemes, and strengthen collaboration and resource sharing among countries. Rapid advances in remote sensing technology and decreased image acquisition and processing costs will likely enhance research and management efforts focused on BCEs.Our findings highlight the various applications of remote sensing technologies to further our understanding of blue carbon ecosystems and their carbon stocks, greenhouse gas fluxes, changes in extent through space and time, and support ecosystem management, including restoration and conservation efforts.image

TI  - Delineating reservoir area using geologic remote sensing analysis, Jizan (Saudi Arabia): Implications for geothermal exploration
T2  - GEOENERGY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Jizan Province is considered one of the potential geothermal areas in Southwest Saudi Arabia. However, the prospective geothermal reservoir is still not delineated and the geothermal energy reserve is not estimated properly. Therefore, this study aims to delineate the geothermal prospect area using remote sensing-based analysis. Permeable areas, the high anomaly of Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the existence of granitic rock were the parameters used in the remote sensing analysis. Digital Elevation Models (DEM) SRTM and Landsat 8 images were used as the data source. Automatically- and manually-extracted structural lineaments supported by fractures/faults interpretation were integrated to generate a final map of the permeable areas defined in the study area (with three main permeable zones; Zones 1, 2 and 3). The average value of five LST maps and the Natural Different Building Index (NDBI) were used to investigate the high anomaly of LST. Final fuzzy logic integration of the defined permeable area, high LST anomaly, and the existence of granitic rock allowed a unique opportunity for the delineation of the prospective geothermal reservoir area. Remote sensing results were validated using the field-based studies performed in the same area. Three zones are suggested as prospective geothermal potential areas (Zones A, B, and C), where Zone A is the most favourable due to its estimated largest area and is interpreted to belong to the same geothermal system as Zone C. This study improves the understanding of the prospective geothermal reservoir area in Jizan based on the delineation of high permeable zones, and high anomaly LST. The spatial distribution of radiogenic elements in the rock units is also considered an indicator of the heat source of the geothermal system.

TI  - Integrating forest structural diversity measurement into ecological research
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of forest structure has evolved steadily due to advances in technology, methodology, and theory. Such advances have greatly increased our capacity to describe key forest structural elements and resulted in a range of measurement approaches from traditional analog tools such as measurement tapes to highly derived and computationally intensive methods such as advanced remote sensing tools (e.g., lidar, radar). This assortment of measurement approaches results in structural metrics unique to each method, with the caveat that metrics may be biased or constrained by the measurement approach taken. While forest structural diversity (FSD) metrics foster novel research opportunities, understanding how they are measured or derived, limitations of the measurement approach taken, as well as their biological interpretation is crucial for proper application. We review the measurement of forest structure and structural diversity-an umbrella term that includes quantification of the distribution of functional and biotic components of forests. We consider how and where these approaches can be used, the role of technology in measuring structure, how measurement impacts extend beyond research, and current limitations and potential opportunities for future research.

TI  - A New Land Cover Map of Two Watersheds under Long-Term Environmental Monitoring in the Swedish Arctic Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A land cover map of two arctic catchments near the Abisko Scientific Research Station was obtained based on a classification from a Sentinel-2 satellite image and a ground survey performed in July 2022. The two contiguous catchments, Miellajokka and Stordalen, are covered by various ecotypes, from boreal forest to alpine tundra and peatland. Two classification algorithms, support vector machine and random forest, were tested and gave very similar results. The percentage of correctly classified pixels was over 88% in both cases. The developed workflow relies solely on open-source software and acquired ground observations. Space organization was directed by the altitude as demonstrated by the intersection of the land cover with the topography. Comparison between this new land cover map and previous ones based on data acquired between 2008 and 2011 shows some trends in vegetation cover evolution in response to climate change in the considered area. This land cover map is key input data for permafrost modeling and, hence, for the quantification of climate change impacts in the studied area.

TI  - Prioritizing Melanoma Surgeries to Prevent Wait Time Delays and Upstaging of Melanoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prompt diagnosis and surgical management of melanoma strongly impact prognosis. Considering the limited resources, emergency closures, and staffing shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, our institution implemented a dedicated care pathway to prioritize cancer surgeries. We aim to assess whether this strategy was effective at preventing surgical wait time delays and upstaging of melanoma. We retrospectively collected data of patients aged & GE;18 years with biopsy-proven primary melanoma who underwent wide local excision (WLE) & PLUSMN; sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 1 March 2018-29 February 2020 (pre-pandemic) and 1 March 2020-22 March 2022 (pandemic). Patients with distant metastasis, recurrence, in situ disease, and unknown primary were excluded. Wait time from consult to surgery, tumour (T) and nodal (N) stage, and overall stage were collected. Results: We included 419 patients [pre-pandemic (n = 204) and pandemic (n = 215)]. Median wait time (days) [interquartile range] to surgery was 36 [22-48] pre-pandemic and 35 [24-49] during the pandemic (p = 0.888). There were no differences found in T stage (p = 0.060), N stage (p = 0.214), or overall melanoma stage (p = 0.192). We highlight the importance of streamlining melanoma surgery during a pandemic. As the need arises to meet surgical backlogs including benign surgery, dedicated cancer surgery should maintain a priority to not negatively affect cancer outcomes.

TI  - Nonaccidental Pediatric Trauma: Which Traditional Clues Predict Abuse?
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine which of the child abuse clues quoted in the literature predict nonaccidental trauma (NAT): history incongruent with injuries found on examination or imaging, old injuries present, history of trauma denied by caregivers, multiple fractures present, changing history, fractures of varied duration, metaphyseal fracture, ear bruise, neck bruise, different history (second historian), and metaphyseal fracture.Methods: This is a 4-year retrospective study of all suspected NAT cases referred to our medical center. In addition to the index visit, medical records were searched for visits before the index visit with patient historical or physical findings that might have suggested NAT but were not investigated. The association of diagnostic clues and the outcome were assessed by chi-square and logistic regression analysis.Results: For 48 months, there were 109 cases of suspected NAT referred for evaluation (age range, 1 week to 15 years). After formal investigation by an abuse specialist, 79.3% of the cases were considered "likely abuse". Those historical or physical findings with a univariate association with a final conclusion of likely abuse included history incongruent with injuries, old injuries present, trauma history denied, changed history, and retinal hemorrhage. In multivariate logistic regression, only a history incongruent with injures remained an independent predictor of likely abuse (odds ratio, 8.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.74-43.07; P = 0.0151). After review of prior records, in only 2 of 109 cases (1.8%) was there a prior visit where NAT could have been suspected; however, history was thought to be congruent with the injury at the original visits.Conclusion: In this 4-year study of NAT, the clinical clue that best predicted likely abuse after expert investigation was a history that was incongruent with the injuries found on emergency department evaluation. The incidence of possible early recognition from a prior emergency department visit in this group was very low, <2% of cases.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Random Forest Classifier for Identifying Burned Areas in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima Region Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires have become a major concern in the northern parts of Morocco, particularly in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (TTA) region, causing significant damage to the environment and human lives. To address this pressing issue, this study proposes an approach that utilizes remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML) techniques to detect burned areas in the TTA region within the Google Earth Engine platform. The study focuses on burned areas resulting from forest fires in three specific locations in the TTA region that have experienced such fires in recent years, namely Tangier-Assilah in 2017, M'diq Fnideq in 2020, and Chefchaouen in 2021. In our study, we extensively explored multiple combinations of spectral indices, such as normalized burn ratio (dNBR), normalized difference vegetation index (dNDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (dSAVI), and burned area index (dBAI), in conjunction with Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite images. These combinations were employed within the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, allowing us to draw important conclusions. Initially, we assess the individual effectiveness of the dNBR index, which yields accuracy rates of 83%, 90%, and 82% for Tangier-Assilah, Chefchaouen, and M'diq Fnideq, respectively. Recognizing the need for improved outcomes, we expand our analysis by incorporating spectral indices and S2 bands. However, the results obtained from this expanded combination lack consistency and stability across different locations. While Tangier-Assilah and M'diq Fnideq experience accuracy improvements, reaching 95% and 88%, respectively, the inclusion of Sentinel bands has an adverse effect on Chefchaouen, resulting in a decreased accuracy of 87%. To achieve optimal accuracy, our focus shifted towards the combination of dNBR and the other spectral indices. The results were truly remarkable, with accuracy rates of 96%, 97%, and 97% achieved for Tangier-Assilah, Chefchaouen, and M'diq Fnideq, respectively. Our decision to prioritize the spectral indices was based on the feature importance method, which highlights the significance of each feature in the classification process. The practical implications of our study extend to fire management and prevention in the TTA region. The insights gained from our analysis can inform the development of effective policies and strategies to mitigate the impact of forest fires. By harnessing the potential of RS and ML techniques, along with the utilization of spectral indices, we pave the way for enhanced fire monitoring and response capabilities in the region.

TI  - Evaluating agricultural activity dynamics over the Uttar Pradesh state of India using satellite-based datasets
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities (changes in rainfall and temperature pattern) activities have significantly affected agricultural activity and crop production. So, studying cropland greenness and crop yield trends is essential to understand their impacts and to ensure food security. The present study attempted to depict the cropland greenness and wheat yield trends in Uttar Pradesh (UP) state, India, during 2001-2019. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset was used to decipher the cropland greenness trends through the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Furthermore, the wheat yield dataset from Baghel and Sharma (2022) was used to depict the wheat yield trends using the Thiel-Sen slope test from 2001 to 2019. The study's results showed that similar to 37.3% (82,041 km(2)) area of the total agricultural land was with positive cropland greenness (NDVI) trend, and 1.67% (3673 km(2)) area was under a negative cropland greenness trend. On the other hand, similar to 8463 km(2) (at 99% significance level) and 160,557 km(2) (90% significance level) area corresponding to the similar to 4% and 73%, respectively, of the total agricultural land has shown positive (increasing) wheat yield trends during 2001-2019. In conclusion, the findings of this study emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and a comprehensive understanding of cropland greenness and wheat yield trends over different agroclimatic zones. By gaining insights into these trends, policymakers and stakeholders can develop and implement effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on agricultural systems.

TI  - A study of urban heat island effects using remote sensing and GIS techniques in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aspects of ecological issues arising from rapid urbanization are investigated in this paper using Land Surface Temperature (LST) in terms of radiation budgets studied by heat conduct balance using a geospatial approach. It uses the data from USGS Landsat ETM+ 4-5 and Landsat-8 OLI imagery acquired on February 6, 1988 and October 14, 2021. The geospatial technique examines the effects of changes in Land Use/Land Cover (LSLC) in terms of NDVI classification on the distribution of surface temperature. The remote sensing approach identifies changes in land use, their influence on surface temperature, and variations in average LST caused by these hotspots. This study examines the distribution of LST in Kancheepuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. The LSTs ranged from 14 & DEG;C to 31 & DEG;C in 1985, from 25 & DEG;C to 39 & DEG;C in 2005, and from 31 & DEG;C to 47 & DEG;C in 2021. The results show a 152% increase in the mean LST in 4 decades. The LST high values were observed in urban and industrial regions with buildings, impervious sidewalks, and sparse vegetation. The intensity at hotspots was highest in urbanized and sparsely vegetated regions. The low Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect was measured in vegetated areas. Industrial areas and parking lots were commonly classified as high-intensity hotspots. The elevated temperatures are attrib-utable to the materials used in the construction at these locations. Further research is needed to better understand the reflectance of thermal radiations by certain materials used in urban regions and how to minimize temperatures in such locations.

TI  - Mountain Forest Type Classification Based on One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their efficacy in remote sensing applications for mountain forest classification. However, two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D CNNs) require a significant manual involvement in the visual interpretation to obtain continuous polygon label data. To reduce the errors associated with manual visual interpretation and enhance classification efficiency, it is imperative to explore alternative approaches. In this research, we introduce a novel one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) methodology that directly leverages field investigation data as labels for classifying mountain forest types based on multiple remote sensing data sources. The hyperparameters were optimised using an orthogonal table, and the model's performance was evaluated on Mount Emei of Sichuan Province. Comparative assessments with traditional classification methods, namely, a random forest (RF) and a support vector machine (SVM), revealed superior results obtained by the proposed 1D CNN. Forest type classification using the 1D CNN achieved an impressive overall accuracy (OA) of 97.41% and a kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9673, outperforming the U-Net (OA: 94.45%, Kappa: 0.9239), RF (OA: 88.99%, Kappa: 0.8488), and SVM (OA: 88.79%, Kappa: 0.8476). Moreover, the 1D CNN model was retrained using limited field investigation data from Mount Wawu in Sichuan Province and successfully classified forest types in that region, thereby demonstrating its spatial-scale transferability with an OA of 90.86% and a Kappa of 0.8879. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed 1D CNN in utilising multiple remote sensing data sources for accurate mountain forest type classification. In summary, the introduced 1D CNN presents a novel, efficient, and reliable method for mountain forest type classification, offering substantial contributions to the field.

TI  - -penile Surgical templates for inguinal lymph node dissection in cN0 penile cancer: A comparative study
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Modified and superficial inguinal lymph node dissection (MILD and SILD) are the 2 widely used templates for surgical staging of clinically node negative (cN0) penile cancer (PeCa); however, no previous reports have compared their outcomes. We compared these 2 surgical templates for oncological outcomes and complications.Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of cN0 PeCa patients who underwent MILD/SILD at our cancer care center from January 2013 to December 2019. Patients who developed a penile recurrence during follow up were excluded from analysis of oncological outcomes. The 2 groups (MILD and SILD) were compared for baseline clinicopathological characteristics. The primary out-come was the groin recurrence free survival (gRFS). Secondary outcomes included the false negative rate (FNR) and disease free survival (DFS) for both templates and also the post-operative wound related complication.Results: Of the 146 patients with intermediate and high risk N0 PeCa, 74 (50.7%) and 72 (49.3%) underwent MILD and SILD respectively. The 2 groups were comparable with regards to the distribution of T stage, tumor grade and the proportion of intermediate and high-risk patients. At a median follow up of 34 months (47 for SILD and 23 for MILD), a total of 5 groin recurrences were encountered; all of them occurred in the MILD group. The gRFS and DFS for the MILD group was 93.2% and 91.8% respectively; while that for the SILD group was 100% and 94.4% respectively. Too few events had occurred to determine any statistically significant difference. The FNR for MILD and SILD was 26.3% and 0% respectively. The overall complication rate was significantly higher in the SILD group (46% vs 20.3%, p=0.001), especially for Clavien Dindo 3A complications.Conclusion: MILD can fail to pick up micrometastatic disease in a small proportion of cN0 PeCa patients, while SILD provides better oncological clearance with no groin recurrences. This oncological superiority comes at the cost of a higher incidence of wound-related com-plications.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - Journal of health monitoring
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: UV radiation can cause serious skin and eye diseases, especially cancers. UV-related skin cancer incidences have been increasing for decades. The determining factor for this development is the individual UV exposure. Climate change-induced changes in atmospheric factors can influence individual UV exposure.Methods: On the basis of a topic-specific literature research, a review paper was prepared and supplemented by as yet unpublished results of the authors' own studies. The need for scientific research and development is formulated as well as primary prevention recommendations.Results: Climate change alters the factors influencing UV irradiance and annual UV dose in Germany. First evaluations of satellite data for Germany show an increase in mean peak UV irradiance and annual UV dose for the last decade compared to the last three decades.Conclusions: The climate change-related influences on individual UV exposure and the associated individual disease incidence cannot yet be reliably predicted due to considerable uncertainties. However, the current UV-related burden of disease already requires primary preventive measures to prevent UV-related diseases.

TI  - Investigating a Technologist-Driven Injection Technique in Lymphoscintigraphy at a Single Rural Center: A Retrospective Audit.
T2  - Journal of nuclear medicine technology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of the technologist-driven injection technique of lymphoscintigraphy used at a rural hospital in Australia to identify the correct lymph node for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early-stage breast cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective audit was conducted using imaging and medical record data from 145 eligible patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for SLNB at a single center throughout 2013 and 2014. The lymphoscintigraphy technique included a single periareolar injection with subsequent dynamic and static images as required. Descriptive statistics, sentinel node identification rates, and imaging-surgery concordance rates were generated from the data. Additionally, chi2 analysis was used to examine the relationships between age, previous surgical intervention, and injection site and time until a sentinel node is visualized. The technique and statistical results were directly compared against multiple similar studies in the literature. Results: The sentinel node identification rate was 99.3%, and the imaging-surgery concordance rate was 97.2%. The identification rate was significantly higher than those of similar studies in the literature, and concordance rates were similar across studies. The findings demonstrated that age (P = 0.508) and previous surgical intervention (P = 0.966) did not influence the time it takes to visualize a sentinel node. Injection site did appear to have a statistically significant effect (P = 0.001), with injections in the upper outer quadrant correlating with increased times between injection and visualization. Conclusion: The reported lymphoscintigraphy technique for identifying sentinel lymph nodes for SLNB in early-stage breast cancer patients can be justified as an accurate and effective method that is time-sensitive and has outcomes comparable to those of successful studies in the literature.

TI  - Effect of urbanization on aerosol optical depth over Beijing: Land use and surface temperature analysis
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the progress of the urbanization process, the air pollution problem has become more serious. To improve air quality, it is necessary to study the correlation between haze weather and local climate, as well as the causes of local climate, such as surface temperature, land use, and social development factors. In this paper, we have taken Beijing as the study area, and remote sensing and data mining has been used as study methods. First, the correlation between local haze weather and surface temperature has been discussed. It was found that the studied regional aerosol optical thickness is positively correlated with the regional surface temperature. Second, the correlation analysis of land use and surface temperature showed a significant positive correlation between them. Finally, this paper used grey correlation analysis to analyze the impact of social development factors on air quality. The results showed that among the 16 identified social factors, energy consumption per 10,000-yuan GDP and exhaust emissions contribute the most to the haze composition. Therefore, this study believes that human activities brought about by urbanization affect the formation of haze, and the analysis of formative factors can provide a reference for government departments to formulate relevant policies.

TI  - Vegetation descriptors from Sentinel-1 SAR data for crop growth monitoring
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing technology has the advantage of all-weather observation and can acquire time-series images with crop growth period, which has great potential for applications such as crop phenology analysis. However, available studies primarily focus on conducting statistical and crop growth analyses based on the polarization or backscatter intensities of SAR images, and the exploration of polarization scattering information in SAR images is not sufficient. To comprehensively reflect the polarization characteristics and scattering mechanisms of crop at different growth stages, we propose a new method for extracting vegetation descriptors from Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric SAR data. The method combines the backscattering intensity and polarization decomposition information to construct a normalized index q, which is used to generate three vegetation descriptors: the co-pol purity parameter (mcp), the pseudo-scattering angle (t9cp), and the pseudoscattering entropy (Hcp). Further, a novel unsupervised clustering framework, founded on Hcp and t9cp, has been proposed. This framework establishes six zones (named as Z1 to Z6) representing distinct physical scattering mechanisms, and by statistically sampling point data, it can determine the growth stage of the crops For validating the performance of the proposed vegetation descriptors and clustering framework, we conducted a three-year experiment using four crops from two publicly available datasets, namely wheat and canola from the Carman in Canada (Test site-1), corn and soybeans from Iowa in the United States (Test site-2). The experimental results indicate that mcp,t9cp, and Hcp exhibit regular changes at different growth stages of crops from planting to maturity, with mcp and t9cp gradually decreasing while Hcp gradually increasing. Within the entire phenology window, t9cp changes by approximately 42 degrees, while both mcp and t9cp varies by about 0.9, and the sampling points shift from the Z2 to the Z5 zone. The vegetation descriptors are highly sensitive to the growth status of crops, and the clustering framework can also effectively respond to different growth stages of vegetation. Furthermore, the vegetation descriptors and clustering framework proposed in this study have the potential for extended application to different crop types and other polarimetric SAR data sources.

TI  - Predicting soil organic carbon in cultivated land across geographical and spatial scales: Integrating Sentinel-2A and laboratory Vis-NIR spectra
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) is essential for visualizing the spatial distribution at different re-gions and scales. However, existing studies using remote sensing are limited by the low spectral resolution of multispectral data for accurate estimation of SOC, and the failure of laboratory visible and near-infrared and shortwave infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to perform pixel-level mapping. To address these limitations, this study proposes a SOC mapping framework that integrates satellite earth observations and proximal sensing spectral data to reconstruct images having a spectral resolution of 400-2500 nm and a spatial resolution of 10 m, then the clustering probability analysis was applied on the reconstructed images, to develop a high accuracy SOC prediction model and demonstrate its effectiveness across geographical and spatial scales. Specifically, a total of 324 topsoil samples were collected from Baoqing and Suiling counties in northeast China, whose laboratory Vis-NIR reflectance spectra and SOC were measured. Sentinel-2A images of bare soils averaged over three years before and after the samples collection (i.e., 2018 to 2021) were collected. A total of 264 samples from eight fields in Belgium were used to evaluate the performance of the model at the field scale. Then, two models were developed (i) a global regression model with direct prediction using random forest and (ii) a clustering proba-bility model with Gaussian Mixture Model-random forest. Results demonstrated that (1) reconstructed images produced more accurate prediction results than the individual laboratory Vis-NIR spectroscopy and Sentinel-2A models. (2) At the regional scale, clustering probability model achieved better performance in quantification of SOC (coefficient of determination [R2] = 0.78, and root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.78 %) than global regression model (R2 = 0.65, and RMSE = 1.06 %). (3) For field scale, the reconstructed image-based clustering probability SOC prediction model was shown to be effective when using the Belgium data, providing a R2 of 0.67, and RMSE of 0.15 %. (4) Integrating remote sensing multispectral and proximal Vis-NIR information can lead to a smoother and more continuous SOC distribution within the region, and can better show its spatial heteroge-neity within the field. This study highlights the advantages of integrating remote sensing with proximal sensing for improving the accuracy of SOC prediction and mapping, enabling applicability of the model across geographical and spatial scales with appreciable accuracy.

TI  - Changing Land Use and Urban Dynamics around an Industrial Zone in Bangladesh: A Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the adverse effect of rapid industrialization around Bangladesh's Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ) by analyzing Landsat satellite images captured between 1989 and 2019. Image classification was performed to separate built-up areas with machine learning algorithms in Google Earth Engine. Image analysis was conducted using ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro. Field observations, interviews, and the literature review provided information for explanations about the phenomenon observed from satellite image analyses. The findings reveal that when DEPZ started its operation in 1993, there was hardly any built-up area in the vicinity. Within three decades, over 25% of the land within a 5 km radius of DEPZ has been converted into a built-up area, triggering an almost seven-fold increase in population. Industrial and urban growth in the DEPZ area has caused significant soil and water pollution in the broader region. As a result, the quantity and quality of agricultural land has degraded. In the long run, the planned industrial development initiative has contributed to unsustainable urban growth and environmental consequences. Insights drawn from this article can guide policymakers to re-evaluate their policy for rapid and large-scale industrialization.

T2  - Ecotoxicology (London, England)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The St. Lawrence River in Eastern Ontario, Canada, has been a designated an area of concern due to past industrial contamination of sediment in some areas and transport of mercury from tributaries. Previous research using bats as sentinel species identified elevated concentrations of total mercury (THg) in fur of local bats and species-specific variation between little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Here, we investigated the mercury exposure pathways for these two species by testing the hypothesis that diet variation, particularly the reliance on aquatic over terrestrial insects, is a determinant of local bat mercury concentrations. We analyzed THg concentration and stable isotope ratios of delta15N and delta13C in fur of little and big brown bats, and in aquatic and terrestrial insects. Big brown bats, especially males, accumulated significantly higher THg concentrations in their fur compared to little brown bats. However, this difference was not related to diet because big brown bats consumed terrestrial insects, which were lower in mercury than aquatic insects, the primary prey for little brown bats. We also evaluated whether fur THg concentrations translate into molecular changes in tissues linked to (methyl)mercury toxicity by quantifying tissue changes in global DNA methylation and mitochondrial DNA abundance. No significant changes in DNA molecular markers were observed in relation to fur THg concentration, suggesting mercury exposure to local bats did not impact molecular level changes at the DNA level. Higher mercury in bats was not associated with local aquatic contamination or genotoxicity in this study area.

TI  - Radiometric Response Evaluation of FY-3D/MERSI-II Reflective Solar Bands Based on Deep Convective Cloud
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The FY-3D medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI-II) has been in orbit for more than five years. Quantitative application inversion shows that the radiometric response of some channels has deteriorated significantly, seriously affecting the accuracy of satellite quantitative remote sensing products. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the radiometric response of the MERSI-II and update the operation calibration according to the evaluation results. Compared with traditional targets such as deserts and glaciers, deep convective cloud (DCC) features a higher signal-to-noise ratio, isotropic reflection characteristics close to Lambertian, and minimum water vapor absorption. In-orbit calibration methods based on DCC target are widely employed to monitor the radiation performance of satellite sensors. However, the uncertainty factors in the DCC calibration method will affect the accuracy and stability, such as DCC bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction model, reflectivity probability density function (PDF) eigenvalues, and seasonal fluctuations. In this study, the basic DCC calibration method is optimized. Firstly, the BRDF correction effects of the Hu model and CERES thick ice cloud model are compared, as well as the stability of PDF mode and the mean of DCC reflectivity. Secondly, a deseasonal method based on reflectivity fitting residual and the moving average is proposed as the BRDF correction model of DDC is invalid in the SWIR band. Finally, the radiation performance of FY-3D/MERS-I-II reflected solar bands is quantitatively evaluated by the optimization method. The evaluation results will be adopted as an important basis for the service calibration update of MERSI-II reflected solar bands.Methods We utilize DCC targets to evaluate the trend of radiometric response changes in most of the MERSI-II reflected solar bands. Firstly, the DCC target pixels are identified according to the infrared 10. 8 mu m channel brightness temperature threshold, observation geometric conditions (latitude, solar zenith angle, observation zenith angle), and spatial homogeneity conditions. Secondly, the solar zenith angle and earth-sun distance corrections are performed on the identified reflectivity of each DCC pixel to obtain the apparent reflectivity of the DCC. Then, two DCC BRDF models are leveraged to correct the anisotropy of apparent reflectance and compare the correction effects. Thirdly, the monthly DCC reflectivity PDF is constructed. Finally, the radiometric response of the MERSI-II sensor is evaluated by tracking the monthly DCC reflectivity PDF mean or mode sequence. In this section, we investigate the seasonal characteristics of DCC and propose a deseasonal method to reduce the fluctuations of the reflectivity PDF mean or modal sequence.Results and Discussions For the VIS/NIR bands, the correction effect of the CERES thick ice cloud model is better than the Hu model (Fig. 2), the RSD of the reflectivity is reduced by 15%-40%, and the fluctuations are reduced by about 10%-30% (Fig. 3). However, for the SWIR band, the two BRDF models have no obvious correction effect. For the VIS/NIR band, the monthly DCC reflectivity PDF mode is more stable than the mean, while the mean is more stable in the SWIR band (Table 2). The DDC distribution area migrates from north to south seasonally, and the same month in each year has high similarity, while the distribution of different months in each year is different (Fig. 4). The annual variation range of monthly DCC reflectance in VIS/NIR and SWIR bands is about 1. 5% and 6. 4% respectively, and SWIR band has higher seasonal sensitivity (Fig. 5). The proposed deseasonal method has yielded significant results in the SWIR band (Fig. 7). The reflectance RSD of 1. 38 mu m, 1. 64 mu m, and 2. 13 mu m channels decreases by about 22. 4%, 22. 0%, and 23. 9% respectively, and the fluctuations decrease by about 52. 9%, 51. 2%, and 54. 5% respectively, which compensates for the inefficiency of the BRDF model in the SWIR band (Table 3). The optimized DCC calibration method is employed to quantitatively evaluate the radiation degradation of the MERSI-II reflected solar bands from 2018 to 2022 (Fig. 8). The annual average degradation rate of 0. 65 mu m channel is only 0. 02826% and the 0. 47 mu m blue channel is greater than 1. 3%. The annual degradation rate of the three water vapor absorption channels in the NIR band is between 0. 5% and 1%. This reveals a law that the degradation rate increases with the wavelength, and the fluctuation index is less than 3%, proving the superiority of the DCC calibration method in the water vapor absorption channel. The SWIR band has the most significant degradation, of which 1. 38 mu m has the largest degradation and the strongest fluctuation. The annual decay rates of 1. 64 mu m and 2. 13 mu m channels are 3. 114 % and 2. 134 %, respectively (Table 5).Conclusions We adopt the DCC target to evaluate the radiometric response trend of the MERSI-II reflected solar bands, and optimize the basic DCC calibration method. Firstly, the DCC BRDF correction model and the selection of monthly PDF eigenvalues (mean/mode) are optimized. Secondly, the seasonal characteristics of DCC are investigated, and a deseasonal method based on reflectivity fitting residuals and moving averages is proposed to compensate for the ineffectiveness of Hu and CERES thick ice cloud BRDF models in SWIR bands. This method significantly mitigates the RSD and fluctuations of monthly DCC reflectance in the SWIR band from 2018 to 2022, which are reduced by about 23% and 53%, respectively. This method is not only applicable to MERSI-II but also provides references for the radiometric calibration of other satellite optical remote sensors. Finally, the optimized DCC calibration method is utilized to quantitatively evaluate the attenuation of the radiometric response of the FY-3D/MERSI-II reflected solar bands. The results show that the blue channel and the four SWIR channels have significant degradation.

TI  - Developing a Hail and Wind Damage Swath Event Database from Daily MODIS True Color Imagery and Storm Reports for Impact Analysis and Applications
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hail and damaging winds are two threats associated with intense and severe thunderstorms that traverse the Midwest and Great Plains during the primary growing season. In certain severe thunderstorm events, large swaths of agricultural crops are impacted, allowing the damage to be viewed from multiple satellite remote sensing platforms. Previ-ous studies have focused on analyzing individual hail and wind damage swaths (HWDSs) using satellite remote sensing, but these swaths have never been officially archived or documented. This lack of documentation has made it difficult to an-alyze the spatial extent and temporal frequency of HWDSs from year to year. This study utilizes daily true color imagery from MODIS aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites and daily local storm reports from the Storm Prediction Center to build a database of HWDSs occurring in the months of May-August, for years 2000-20. This database identified 1646 HWDSs in 12 states throughout the Midwest and Great Plains, confirmed through a combination of archived severe weather warnings, radar information, and official storm reports. For each entry in the HWDS database, a geospatial outline is provided along with the most likely date of first visible damage from MODIS imagery as well as the physical characteris-tics and time of occurrence estimated from available warnings. This study also provides a summary of the radar characteris-tics for a portion of the database. This database will further the understanding of severe weather damage by hail and wind to agriculture to help understand the frequency of these events and assist in mapping the impacted areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Hail and wind damage swaths (HWDSs) frequently occur during the primary grow-ing season throughout the Midwest and Great Plains but are not yet officially documented or tracked like other severe weather impacts (e.g., tornadoes and derechos). This study describes the creation of a 21-yr HWDS event database us-ing archived daily storm reports and daily true color satellite imagery. Once the database was completed and underwent quality checks, the research team identified spatial and temporal trends from the confirmed swaths.

TI  - Mapping Shrimp Pond Dynamics: A Spatiotemporal Study Using Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrimp farming and exporting is the main income source for the southern coastal districts of the Mekong Delta. Monitoring these shrimp ponds is helpful in identifying losses incurred due to natural calamities like floods, sources of water pollution by chemicals used in shrimp farming, and changes in the area of cultivation with an increase in demand for shrimp production. Satellite imagery, which is consistent with good spatial resolution and helpful in providing frequent information with temporal imagery, is a better solution for monitoring these shrimp ponds remotely for a larger spatial extent. The shrimp ponds of Cai Doi Vam township, Ca Mau Province, Viet Nam, were mapped using DMC-3 (TripleSat) and Jilin-1 high-resolution satellite imagery for the years 2019 and 2022. The 3 m spatial resolution shrimp pond extent product showed an overall accuracy of 87.5%, with a producer's accuracy of 90.91% (errors of omission = 11.09%) and a user's accuracy of 90.91% (errors of commission = 11.09%) for the shrimp pond class. It was noted that 66 ha of shrimp ponds in 2019 were observed to be dry in 2022, and 39 ha of other ponds had been converted into shrimp ponds in 2022. The continuous monitoring of shrimp ponds helps achieve sustainable aquaculture and acts as crucial input for the decision makers for any interventions.

TI  - Valuing the Accessibility of Green Spaces in the Housing Market: A Spatial Hedonic Analysis in Shanghai, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As a crucial determinant of urban livability, the importance of access to high-quality green spaces has long been recognized for achieving sustainable urbanization. In urban areas, higher values are usually placed in residential properties with higher accessibility to green spaces. Using housing transaction data from as many as 3388 residential communities in Shanghai coupled with high-resolution satellite data of urban green spaces, we comprehensively examine the relationship between residential property values and the accessibility of both community-owned and public green spaces. We find, in instrumental-variable estimations, that: (1) home prices, on average, increase by 0.17% if the overall green space accessibility rises by 1%; and that (2) a 1% increase in the green ratio within a community raises property values by 0.46%. Moreover, the number of accessible green spaces, area of accessible green spaces, and distance to the nearest green spaces have positive impacts on home values separately. We also find strong spatial dependence in urban green spaces and unobserved price determinants, as well as heterogeneity by location, property value, and housing type. Our empirical findings provide valuable guidance for real estate developers and local governments in valuing environmental amenities and urban planning in the context of a residential housing market.

M3  - Article
AB  - At the heart of the 2030 Agenda, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been adopted by the United Nations. SDG 15 aims to implement sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems by preserving biodiversity and soils and limiting the long-term impacts of disasters. SDG 15.3.1 (proportion of degraded land over a total area) is based on the fight against desertification, the restoration of degraded land and soil, in particular land affected by desertification, it thus remains a major priority for states taking of the UNCCD convention. Land degradation is a large-scale phenomenon, of anthropogenic or natural origin, its measurement via the calculation of indicator 15.3.1 is an effective solution for sustainable management at the planet level. In this contribution, we assessed the change in land cover between 2007 and 2018, one of the sub-indicator of SDG 15.3.1, for the north-west and south-west region of Algeria which occupies 43% of the national territory and includes 15 wilayas while adopting the axes of the methodology proposed by the UNCCD with adaptations to the local geography. The methodology proposed in this work is based on a multi-source/multi-sensor approach while respecting the class nomenclature standardized by the UNCCD. This is a multi-date (2007-2018) supervised classification specific to Algeria known for its significant geographical and bioclimatic diversity, optimized through a multi-scale hierarchical approach based on MODIS images and a hierarchy under a tree multi-sources (NDVI-slope-altitude-land cover from ESA CCI and MODIS MODQ13C1). The output results compared with Trend-Earth data and evaluated via very high and medium resolution spatial data (Alsat 2 "2.5 m" and Landsat "30 m"). This document thus presents a model methodological approach for the production of quality small-scale occupancy maps in semi-arid zones. According to the results obtained, 7905 km2 or 0.9% of the territory studied suffered degradation and 14,738 km2 or 1.64% were improved during 2007 to 2018. To achieve neutrality by 2030, developments and monitoring must be undertaken in these areas. Responsive and implement effective and sustainable management practices. Policy makers must strike a balance between development and environmental protection to restore degraded lands.

TI  - FIGO staging of endometrial cancer: 2023
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Many advances in the understanding of the pathologic and molecular features of endometrial cancer have occurred since the FIGO staging was last updated in 2009. Substantially more outcome and biological behavior data are now available regarding the several histological types. Molecular and genetic findings have accelerated since the publication of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and provide improved clarity on the diverse biological nature of this collection of endometrial cancers and their differing prognostic outcomes. The goals of the new staging system are to better define these prognostic groups and create substages that indicate more appropriate surgical, radiation, and systemic therapies.Methods: The FIGO Women's Cancer Committee appointed a Subcommittee on Endometrial Cancer Staging in October 2021, represented by the authors. Since then, the committee members have met frequently and reviewed new and established evidence on the treatment, prognosis, and survival of endometrial cancer. Based on these data, opportunities for improvements in the categorization and stratification of these factors were identified in each of the four stages. Data and analyses from the molecular and histological classifications performed and published in the recently developed ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines were used as a template for adding the new subclassifications to the proposed molecular and histological staging system.Results: Based on the existing evidence, the substages were defined as follows: Stage I (IA1): non-aggressive histological type of endometrial carcinoma limited to a polyp or confined to the endometrium; (IA2) non-aggressive histological types of endometrium involving less than 50% of the myometrium with no or focal lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) as defined by WHO criteria; (IA3) low-grade endometrioid carcinomas limited to the uterus with simultaneous low-grade endometrioid ovarian involvement; (IB) non-aggressive histological types involving 50% or more of the myometrium with no LVSI or focal LVSI; (IC)aggressive histological types, i.e. serous, high-grade endometrioid, clear cell, carcinosarcomas, undifferentiated, mixed, and other unusual types without any myometrial invasion.Stage II (IIA): non-aggressive histological types that infiltrate the cervical stroma; (IIB) non aggressive histological types that have substantial LVSI; or (IIC) aggressive histological types with any myometrial invasion.Stage III (IIIA): differentiating between adnexal versus uterine serosa infiltration; (IIIB) infiltration of vagina/parametria and pelvic peritoneal metastasis; and (IIIC) refinements for lymph node metastasis to pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, including micrometastasis and macrometastasis.Stage IV (IVA): locally advanced disease infiltrating the bladder or rectal mucosa; (IVB) extrapelvic peritoneal metastasis; and (IVC) distant metastasis. The performance of complete molecular classification (POLEmut, MMRd, NSMP, p53abn) is encouraged in all endometrial cancers. If the molecular subtype is known, this is recorded in the FIGO stage by the addition of "m" for molecular classification, and a subscript indicating the specific molecular subtype. When molecular classification reveals p53abn or POLEmut status in Stages I and II, this results in upstaging or downstaging of the disease (IICmp53abn or IAmPOLEmut).Summary: The updated 2023 staging of endometrial cancer includes the various histological types, tumor patterns, and molecular classification to better reflect the improved understanding of the complex nature of the several types of endometrial carcinoma and their underlying biologic behavior. The changes incorporated in the 2023 staging system should provide a more evidence-based context for treatment recommendations and for the more refined future collection of outcome and survival data.

TI  - Trend analysis, past dynamics and future prediction of land use and land cover change in upper Wabe-Shebele river basin
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing population has led to extensive farming at the expense of a natural environment. Changes in land use and cover have caused land degradation, and problematic groundwater recharge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the historical trend, simulations, and predictions of land use land cover change in the Upper Wabe-Shebele River Basin. The study accounted for 1992, 2007 and 2022 as well as it will predict the change for 2037 and 2052. Landsat TM for 1992, ETM + for 2007, and Landsat-8 OLI for 2022 were used. In QGIS 3.16, the maximum likelihood method was utilized for supervised image classification. Using CA-Markov and the Land Change Modeler land use and land cover change for 2037 and 2052 were predicted. Validity and accuracy of the model was evaluated using actual and predicted land use and land cover changes of 2022. Topography, proximity to a town, stream, roads, and population density were used as input for the model. The results showed that between 1992 and 2007, cultivated land increased by 17.07% on average at a rate of 1.05%, while settlement increased by 17.51% at a rate of 1.08% per year. Agricultural and settlement land increased by 22.97% and 30.12%, respectively. Between 1992 and 2022, the transition area matrix showed 2,330.25 and 1,145.77 km2 of forest and grazing land were changed to settlement and cultivated land, respectively. Meanwhile, from 2022 to 2037, the quantity of land used for cultivated, grazing, and settlement is predicted to increase by 0.19, 3.66, and 23.8% in order. For 2037 and 2052, settlement and cultivated land were increased by 1.3 and 7.32% respectively. Finally, since natural ecosystem had been significantly disturbed by change in the study area, comprehensive rehabilitation and management is demanded.

TI  - Integration of an Innovative Atmospheric Forecasting Simulator and Remote Sensing Data into a Geographical Information System in the Frame of Agriculture 4.0 Concept
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a world in continuous evolution and in which human needs grow exponentially according to the increasing world population, the advent of new technologies plays a fundamental role in all fields of industry, especially in agriculture. Optimizing times, automating machines, and guaranteeing product quality are key objectives in the field of Agriculture 4.0, which integrates various innovative technologies to meet the needs of producers and consumers while guaranteeing respect for the environment and the planet's resources. In this context, our research aims to propose an integrated system using data coming from an innovative experimental atmospheric and forecasting simulator (capable of predicting some characteristic climate variables subsequently validated with local sensors), combined with indices deriving from Remote Sensing and UAV images (treated with the data fusion method), that can give fundamental information related to Agriculture 4.0 with particular reference to the subsequent phases of system automation. These data, in fact, can be collected in an open-source GIS capable of displaying areas that need irrigation and fertilization and, moreover, establishing the path of an automated drone for the monitoring of the crops and the route of a self-driving tractor for the irrigation of the areas of interest.

TI  - Enhanced beam shifts mediated by bound states in continuum
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction of light beams with resonant structures has led to the development of various optical platforms for sensing, particle manipulation, and strong light-matter interaction. In the current study, we investigate the manifestations of the bound states in continuum (BIC) on the in plane and out of plane shifts (referred to as Goos-Hanchen (GH) and Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shifts, respectively) of a finite beam with specific polarization incident at an arbitrary angle. Based on the angular spectrum decomposition, we develop a generic formalism for understanding the interaction of the finite beam with an arbitrary stratified medium with isotropic and homogeneous components. It is applied to the case of a Gaussian beam with p and circularly polarized light incident on a symmetric structure containing two polar dielectric layers separated by a spacer layer. For p-polarized plane wave incidence one of the coupled Berreman modes of the structure was recently shown to evolve to the bound state with infinite localization and diverging quality factor coexisting with the other mode with large radiation leakage (Remesh et al 2021 Opt. Commun. 498 127223). A small deviation from the ideal BIC resonance still offers resonances with very high quality factors and these are exploited in this study to report giant GH shifts. A notable enhancement in the IF shift for circularly polarized light is also shown. Moreover, the reflected beam is shown to undergo distortion leading to a satellite spot. The origin of such a splitting of the reflected beam is traced to a destructive interference due to the left and right halves of the corresponding spectra.

TI  - Snow Albedo Reduction in the Colombian Andes Mountains Due to 2000 to 2020 Saharan Dust Intrusions Events
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the snow albedo changes in Colombian tropical glaciers, namely, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), Sierra Nevada del Cocuy (NSC), Nevado del Ruiz (NDR), Nevado Santa Isabel (NDS), Nevado del Tolima (NDT), and Nevado del Huila (NDH). They are associated with the possible mineral dust deposition from the Sahara Desert during the June and July months using snow albedo (SA), snow cover (SC), and land surface temperature (LST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites. And mineral dust (MD) from The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), both of them during 2000-2020. Results show the largest snow albedo reductions were observed at 39.39%, 32.1%, and 30.58% in SNC, SNSM, and NDR, respectively. Meanwhile, a multiple correlation showed that the glaciers where MD contributed the most to SA behavior were 35.4%, 24%, and 21.4% in NDS, NDC, and NDR. Results also display an increasing trend of dust deposition on Colombian tropical glaciers between 2.81 x 10-3 & mu;g & BULL;m-2 & BULL;year-1 and 6.58 x 10-3 & mu;g & BULL;m-2 & BULL;year-1. The results may help recognize the influence of Saharan dust on reducing snow albedo in tropical glaciers in Colombia. The findings from this study also have the potential to be utilized as input for both regional and global climate models. This could enhance our comprehension of how tropical glaciers are impacted by climate change.

TI  - <i>Breast cancer radiation therapy: Current questions in 2023</i>
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Radiation therapy is a corner stone of breast cancer treatment as it has been shown postoperatively that it improves local control and overall survival. In recent years, multidisciplinary therapeutic strategies have evolved considerably for early-stage breast cancer, both surgically and in terms of systemic treatments or radiation therapy. Each of these developments affects other treatment components and open up new questions allowing even more personalized treatments. Essentially normofractionated a few years ago, breast radiation therapy is today very largely moderately or even ultra hypofractionated. De-escalation of the surgery of the axilla has changed the indications for lymph node radiation therapy keeping similar efficacy with reduced toxicity. Indications for radiation therapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy remain based on pre-chemotherapy staging pending the results of ongoing randomized studies. The addition of a boost to the tumor bed significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence, but the magnitude of this benefit decreases with increasing age. The main risk factors for local recurrence are young age, the associated extended ductal in situ component, hormone receptor negative and high-grade status. The results of the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) seem similar with normo-or moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy regimen.

TI  - Long-Range Transport Analysis Based on Eastern Atmospheric Circulation and Its Impact on the Dust Event over Moldavia, Romania in August 2022
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the second half of August 2022, a dust intrusion event occurred when dust that originated in the dry regions of the Kalmyk steppe (located in Russia, northeast of the Black Sea, north of Georgia, and northwest of the Caspian Sea) and the Precaspian plain was transported over the eastern region of Romania. The arid soil found in these areas can be attributed to an extended period of intense drought, with notable instances occurring in 2002, 2003, 2015, and 2018. This situation was further intensified by heatwaves experienced in May and June of 2022. The dust event was captured in MODIS images. In addition, smoke trains originating from fires in the north of the Azov were detected, but these did not reach Romania. Optical parameters from AERONET were used to confirm the dust event. To determine the trajectory of the particles, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used in this paper. The ensemble median model was used to highlight the presence and concentration of dust in the eastern part of Romania. Aerosols were detected between 0 and 4 km, according to radar and ceilometer data from the REXDAN cloud remote sensing facility in Gala ți, Romania. This dust intrusion event was the result of the dominant easterly circulation caused by the extension of the East European High to the northeast of the continent, which transported the dust towards the eastern part of Romania for more than 2 days. Moreover, the torrential rains between 22 and 24 August did not clear the atmosphere of dust, since the intense easterly circulation kept carrying the dust into the Moldavian area.

TI  - Monitoring of the Rehabilitation of the Historic World War II US Air Force Base in Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After the end of World War II, many military air bases in Greenland were abandoned with all the material left in place. One of these sites was the Bluie East Two military air base. A specific feature of this area is that it contained thousands of old barrels formerly used for fuel storage. In 2019, a rehabilitation of this area began. A few months prior to the rehabilitation, our expedition visited the area and mapped it using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This made it probably the latest documentation before the start of the sanitation. The aim of such mapping was to estimate the number of barrels in a given location. The second objective was to monitor the progress of the rehabilitation over the years. For this purpose, satellite data were acquired for the years 2019 through 2022. A supervised classification was performed to automatically detect sites with barrel occurrences, which enabled subsequent change detection. We conclude that a total of 33,786 old barrels were located in the investigated area in 2019. However, we suggest this number is a lower estimate of the actual number of barrels due to the factors we mention in our paper. The results further indicate that between the years 2019 and 2022 the barrels were removed from more than half of the area.

TI  - Wheat Yield Estimation at High Spatial Resolution through the Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Data into a Crop Growth Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring crop growth and estimating crop yield are essential for managing agricultural production, ensuring food security, and maintaining sustainable agricultural development. Combining the mechanistic framework of a crop growth model with remote sensing observations can provide a means of generating realistic and spatially detailed crop growth information that can facilitate accurate crop yield estimates at different scales. The main objective of this study was to develop a robust estimation methodology of within-field winter wheat yield at a high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m) by combining a light use efficiency-based model and Sentinel-2 data. For this purpose, Sentinel-2 derived leaf area index (LAI) time series were assimilated into the Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) model using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The study was conducted on rainfed winter wheat fields in southern Sweden. LAI was estimated using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 data with semi-empirical models. The enhanced two-band vegetation index (EVI2) was found to be a useful VI for LAI estimation, with a coefficient of determination (R2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.80 and 0.65 m2/m2, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that the assimilation of LAI derived from Sentinel-2 into the SAFY model using EnKF enhances the estimation of within-field spatial variability of winter wheat yield by 70% compared to the baseline simulation without the assimilation of remotely sensed data. Additionally, the assimilation of LAI improves the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation by decreasing the RMSE by 53%. This study demonstrates an approach towards practical applications of freely accessible Sentinel-2 data and a crop growth model through data assimilation for fine-scale mapping of crop yield. Such information is critical for quantifying the yield gap at the field scale, and to aid the optimization of management practices to increase crop production.

TI  - Geodetic/gravimetric evidence for mass loss in the subsidence area of Bandung, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence monitoring in Bandung, Indonesia, was initiated in the 2000 s. However, the monitoring has been limited to geometric observations only, which may restrict the further physical interpretation of the cause of the subsidence. In this study, we combine geometric and gravity observation methods to monitor surface subsidence in Bandung. 63 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1A covering the period of 2014-2020 were used to estimate the mean surface geometric changes. For the gravity observations, a hybrid gravity configuration that incorporates absolute (2008-2014) and relative (2011-2016) gravity observations were used to estimate the gravity changes. We estimated geometric changes of up to - 160 mm/yr, indicating rapid subsidence in the greater Bandung area. We obtained gravity changes ranging between - 56.7 and 40.1 & mu;Gal/yr. Upon subtracting the deformation-induced gravity field from the observed field, we produced a residual gravity field that was presumed to be dominated by the groundwater signal, which was then investigated further. We found that the gravity-derived groundwater signal was mainly negative, indicating subsurface mass loss. We further compared the signal with the modeled gravity effect from deep groundwater observations (1996-2008). The median difference between the observed and modeled groundwater gravity signal was estimated to be 2.8 & PLUSMN; 18.0 & mu;Gal/yr or equivalent to 0.08 & PLUSMN; 0.55 m/yr in terms of water height if we set the integration cap and groundwater depth to 1.4 km and 150 m, respectively. The discrepancy can be attributed to modeling (simple geohydrological assumption) and measurement (different observation periods and noise) factors. Nevertheless, both measurements indicate that the mass is decreasing due to groundwater depletion, demonstrating the potential of geometric-gravimetric observations to infer sub-surface mass loss.

TI  - Towards the Mitigation of Discrepancies in Sea Surface Parameters Estimated from Low- and High-Resolution Satellite Altimetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present an extension to existing numerical retrackers of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) altimetry signals. To our knowledge at the time of writing this manuscript, it offers the most consistent retrieval of geophysical parameters compared to low-resolution mode (LRM) retracking results. We achieve this by additionally estimating the standard deviation of vertical wave-particle velocities & sigma;v and a new parameter ux, linked to a residual Doppler in the returned radar echoes, which can be related to wind speed and direction. Including this new parameter into the SAR stack retracker mitigates sea surface height estimation errors by up to two centimeters for Sentinel-6MF SAR mode results. Additionally, we found a closed-form equation to describe ux as a function of eastward and northward wind variables, which allows mitigating the effects of this parameter on a SAR stack within level 1B processing and generating a lookup table to correct sea surface height estimates in SAR mode. This additionally opens up the door to estimating the wind speed and direction from SAR altimetry stacks. Additionally, we discuss how this new retracker performs with respect to different planned future baseline processor changes of Sentinel-6MF, namely F09 and F10, by attempting to imitate their level 2 processing. This is achieved by processing cycles 017 to 051 (nearly a full year) of Sentinel-6MF level 1A data on a global scale. We observe that the new retracking method is, on average, more accurate with respect to LRM. However, there is a slight increase in measurement noise due to the introduction of an additional parameter. To ensure that the results of the new retracker are not biased, we retrack using both the new method and the SINCS-OV ZSK retracker on Sentinel-6MF stack data produced in a Monte Carlo simulation. We analyze the simulation results with respect to accuracy, precision, and correlations between estimated parameters. We show that the accuracy of the new retracker is better than SINCS-OV ZSK but less precise, which could be related to higher correlation coefficients-especially with respect to the new parameter ux-between estimated parameters.

TI  - The Utilization of Satellite Data and Machine Learning for Predicting the Inundation Height in the Majalaya Watershed
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Majalaya area is one of the most valuable economic districts in the south of Greater Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, and experiences at least six floods per year. The floods are characterized by a sudden rise in the water level approximately one to two hours after the rain occurs. With the aim of reducing flood risk, this study models a data-driven method for predicting the inundation height across the Majalaya Watershed. The flood inundation maps of selected events were modeled using the HEC-RAS 2D numerical model. Extracted data from the HEC-RAS model, GSMaP satellite rainfall data, elevation, and other spatial data were combined to build an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The trained model targets inundation height, while the spatiotemporal data serve as the explanatory variables. The results from the trained ANN model provided very good R2 (0.9537), NSE (0.9292), and RMSE (0.3701) validation performances. The ANN model was tested with a new dataset to demonstrate the capability of predicting flood inundation height with unseen data. Such a data-driven approach is a promising tool to be developed to reduce flood risks in the Majalaya Watershed and other flood-prone locations.

TI  - Considering soil moisture in models of climate impacts on child health in farming-centric countries
T2  - POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture reflects the amount of water available to crops in the top layer of soil. As such, considering soil moisture provides important insight into water availability and ultimately crop yields in agricultural settings. In studies of climate change, food security, and health, however, soil moisture is rarely empirically considered despite its connection to crop health and yields. In this project, we aim to advance understanding of climate impacts on food security by incorporating soil moisture into quantitative models of child health. Combining spatially referenced health survey data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for 2005 and 2010 in Senegal and 2007, 2011, and 2014 in Bangladesh, with soil moisture data from the Famine Early Warning System Network Land Data Assimilation System, we explore the linkages between sub-annual and sub-seasonal climate conditions and child malnutrition in two rainfed agriculture dependent countries-Bangladesh and Senegal. Results suggest that soil moisture, measured on very short time scales, may be associated with reductions in anthropometric weight-for-height z-scores, but the relationship is highly dependent upon geographic context.

TI  - SatVITS-Flood: Satellite Vegetation Index Time Series Flood Detection Model for Hyperarid Regions
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the satellite vegetation index time series model for detecting historical floods in ungauged hyperarid regions (SatVITS-Flood). SatVITS-Flood is based on observations that floods are the primary cause of local vegetation expansion in hyperarid regions. To detect such expansion, we used two time-series metrics: (a) trend change detection from the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend and (b) a newly developed seasonal change metric based on Temporal Fourier Analysis (TFA) and the growing-season integral anomaly (TFA-GSI(anom)). The two metrics complement each other by capturing changes in perennial plant species following extreme, rare floods and ephemeral vegetation changes following more frequent floods. Metrics were derived from the time series of the normalized difference vegetation index, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, and the normalized difference water index, acquired from MODIS, Landsat, and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer. The timing of the change was compared with the date of the flood and the magnitude of change with its volume and duration. We tested SatVITS-Flood in three regions on different continents with 40-year-long, systematic, reliable gauge data. Our results indicate that SatVITS-Flood can predict flood occurrence with an accuracy of 78% and precision of 67% (Recall = 0.69 and F1 = 0.68; p < 0.01), and the flood volume and duration with NSE of 0.79 (RMSE = 15.4 x 10(6) m(3) event(-1)), and R-2 of 0.69 (RMSE = 5.7 days), respectively. SatVITS-Flood proved useful for detecting historical floods and may provide valuable long-term hydrological information in poorly documented areas, which can help understand the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of hyperarid regions.

TI  - Improvement of human-induced wildfire occurrence modeling from a spatial variation of anthropogenic ignition factor in the CLM5
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is an essential form of natural disturbance for the Earth system, and it is challenging for the current numerical models to accurately retrieve the spatiotemporal distributions of wildfire occurrence. One of the deficiencies could result from the parameterization of anthropogenic impact on wildfire occurrences. This study develops an approach to advance human-induced wildfire modeling by calibrating the parameter of human ignition count (HIC) in the fire module of the Community Land Model version 5. This study modifies the source code to allow a grid-scale variation of HIC. Sensitivity experiments with different grid-uniform HIC values are conducted to quantify the model biases with satellite-based observation data as the reference. The theoretically optimal HIC for each grid is obtained by linear rescaling the HIC based on the model biases in the sensitivity tests. The model evaluation takes place in southwest China where there is complex terrain and land use/land cover features. The involvement of grid-scale HIC significantly reduces the model bias in the climatology of wildfire occurrence. The pattern correlation coefficient increases from 0.57 to 0.78, and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreases from 0.58 to 0.18. The correlation coefficient of the annual sums of wildfire occurrences increases from 0.69 to 0.77, and the RMSE decreases from 560.8 to 146.4. A global-scale test verifies that such an approach can be extended to multiple regions with a reasonable scale of population density and economy.

TI  - Large-Scale Groundwater Monitoring in Brazil Assisted With Satellite-Based Artificial Intelligence Techniques
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to monitor major Brazilian aquifers. The approach combines Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and ground-based hydrogeological measurements from Brazil's Integrated Groundwater Monitoring Network at hundreds of wells distributed in 12 aquifers across the country. We tested model ensembles based on three AI approaches: Extreme Gradient Boost, Light Gradient Boosting Model and CatBoost, followed by a Linear Regression step. The approach is further boosted with wavelet and seasonal decomposition processes applied to GRACE data. To determine the AI-based model's sensitivity to data availability, we propose four experiments combining hydrogeological measurements from different aquifers. Groundwater storage (GWS) estimates from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) are used as benchmark. A sensitivity analysis shows that the LR-based model ensemble is the best suited and to reproduce GWS change in all studied Brazilian aquifers. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms GLDAS in all experiments, with an root mean square error (RMSE) value of 2.68 cm for the experiment that covers all monitored wells in Brazil. GLDAS resulted in RMSE = 6.76 cm. Using our AI model outputs, we quantified the GWS change of two major aquifers, Urucuia and Bauru-Caiu & aacute;, over the past two decades: -31 and -6 km(3), respectively. Water loss is driven by a prolonged drought across most of the country and intensification of groundwater pumping for irrigation. This study demonstrates that combining satellite data and AI can be a cost-effective alternative to monitor poorly equipped aquifers at the continental scale, with possible global replicability.

TI  - Surveillance of human Group A rotavirus in Ningxia, China (2015-2021): Emergence and prevalence of G9P[8]-E2 and G3P[8]-E2 genotypes
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the primary pathogens of acute gastroenteritis. Currently, two live attenuated RVA vaccines, LLR and RotaTeq, have been introduced into mainland China but are not included in the national immunization program. Because of the unknown genetic evolution of group A rotavirus in an all-age population in Ningxia, China, we monitored the epidemiological characteristics and circulating genotypes of RVA as a reference for developing vaccine strategies.Methods: We conducted seven years of consecutive surveillance of RVA based on stool samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis in sentinel hospitals in Ningxia, China, from 2015 to 2021. Reverse transcription quanti-tative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) was used to detect RVA in stool samples. Genotyping and phylo-genetic analysis of VP7, VP4 and NSP4 genes were performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequence determination.Results: RVA was detected in 16.58% (1436/8662) of 8662 stool samples. The positive rates were 7.17% (201/ 2805) and 21.09% (1235/5857) in adults and children, respectively. The most affected age group was infants and children aged 12-23 months, with a positive rate of 29.53% (p < 0.05). A significant winter/spring seasonality was observed. 23.29% positive rate in 2020 was the highest in 7 years (p < 0.05). The region with the highest positive rate in the adult group was Yinchuan, and the children's group was Guyuan. A total of 9 genotype combinations were found to be distributed in Ningxia. The dominant genotype combinations in this region gradually changed from G9P[8]-E1, G3P[8]-E1, G1P[8]-E1 to G9P[8]-E1, G9P[8]-E2, and G3P[8]-E2 during these seven years. Rare strains (e.g., G9P[4]-E1, G3P[9]-E3 and G1P[8]-E2) were occasionally detected during the study.Conclusions: During the study period, changes in the significant RVA circulating genotype combinations and the emergence of reassortment strains were observed, particularly the emergence and prevalence of G9P[8]-E2, G3P [8]-E2 reassortants in the region. These results indicate the importance of continuous monitoring of the mo-lecular evolution and recombination characteristics of RVA, and should not be limited to G/P genotyping but should consider multi-gene fragment co-analysis and whole genome sequencing.

TI  - MODIS observations reveal decrease in lake suspended particulate matter across China over the past two decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in the concentrations and distribution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) of lakes can be used to show the responses of lake environment to climate and landscape change. However, the shifts and trends of SPM and potential drivers have not been well investigated across large spatial and temporal dimensions. This study developed a robust machine learning model to generate SPM time series in 269 lakes across China larger than 30 km2 from 2002 to 2021 using MODIS/Aqua imagery. The support vector regression model showed satisfactory performance on SPM retrievals over four orders of magnitude (0.1-1000 mg L-1) (mean absolute percentage error = 26%). The model performance was shown to be insensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (e.g., aerosol type and thickness, viewing geometry), based on a radiative transfer simulation model. The long-term MODIS record showed a spatial pattern of lower SPM in the western lakes compared to the shallow lakes of east China. Importantly, the SPM showed a significant decrease in the 21st century (average rate of change of-0.2 mg L-1/decade). The interannual variations in SPM were aggregated into five categories, ranging from lakes with continuous changing patterns to those with reversed changing patterns. The driving factors behind the changing patterns vary between different climate zones and ecoregions. A warmer and wetter climate was associated with decreasing SPM in western lakes, while the decrease in wind speed and reduced possibility of soil erosion were the primary drivers of progressively lower SPM in the eastern shallow lakes. These results not only show a comprehensive picture of the SPM dynamics of lakes in China but also provide new insights into the complex mechanisms that drive SPM spatiotemporal dynamics.

TI  - Pathways to Enhancing Analysis of Irrigation by Remote Sensing (AIRS) in Urban Settings
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to agricultural settings, irrigation of residential properties in urban settings is typified by small and irregular areas, many untrained water users, limited end-use metering, and differing groundcover. This makes analyzing irrigation patterns to promote efficient water use challenging. We explore the use of remote sensing tools and data sets to help characterize urban irrigation use in the United States. Herein, we review available multispectral imagery datasets and discuss tradeoffs among spatial resolution, collection frequency, and historical availability. We survey options for evapotranspiration data at various spatial and temporal scales that could be paired with the multispectral imagery to estimate irrigation demand. We call the general approach Analysis of Irrigation by Remote Sensing (AIRS). We discuss the potential of drones to capture higher-resolution temporal or spatial data in study areas and/or multiple flights in a single season to provide ground truth or establish patterns. We present data and analysis options that may be suitable depending on specific project objectives. Through a case study scenario, we illustrate some tradeoffs. As a starting point, we recommend public 1 m National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images for irrigated area estimates and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculations, combined with open-source OpenET for evapotranspiration, to provide historical snapshots of water use, vegetation quality, and general irrigation efficiency in urban areas. The method is most effective when paired with optional water use data and can provide information with which to design more optimal studies.

TI  - First Identification of <i>bla</i> <sub>NDM-1</sub> Producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> ST 9499 Isolated from <i>Musca domestica</i> in the Urban Center of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study presents phenotypic and molecular characterization of a multidrug-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (Lemef26), belonging to sequence type ST9499 carrying a bla(NDM-1) carbapenem resistance gene. The bacterium was isolated from a specimen of Musca domestica, collected in proximity to a hospital in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. The strain was identified as E. coli by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (Maldi-TOF-MS) and via genotypic analysis (Whole-Genome Sequencing-WGS), followed by phylogenetic analysis, antibiotic resistance profiling (using phenotypic and genotypic methods) and virulence genotyping. Interestingly, the bla(NDM-1) was the only resistance determinant detected using a panel of common resistance genes, as evaluated by PCR. In contrast, WGS detected genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, quinolones, trimethoprim, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamide, tetracycline, lincosamide and streptogramin B. Conjugation experiments demonstrated the transfer of carbapenem resistance, via acquisition of the bla(NDM-1) sequence, to a sensitive receptor strain of E. coli, indicating that bla(NDM-1) is located on a conjugative plasmid (most likely of the IncA/C incompatibility group, in association with the transposon Tn3000). Phylogenetic analyses placed Lemef26 within a clade of strains exhibiting allelic and environment diversity, with the greatest level of relatedness recorded with a strain isolated from a human source suggesting a possible anthropogenic origin. Analysis of the virulome revealed the presence of fimbrial and pilus genes, including a CFA/I fimbriae (cfaABCDE), common pilus (ecpABCDER), laminin-bind fimbrae (elfADG), hemorrhagic pilus (hcpABC) and fimbrial adherence determinants (stjC) indicates the ability of strain Lemef26 to colonize animal hosts. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase gene in an E. coli strain isolated from M. domestica. In concordance with the findings of previous studies on the carriage of MDR bacteria by flies, the data presented herein provide support to the idea that flies may represent a convenient means (as sentinel animals) for the monitoring of environmental contamination with multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  - Assessing Shoreline Changes in Fringing Salt Marshes from Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly important wetlands; however, external pressures are causing their widespread deterioration and loss. Continuous monitoring of their extent is paramount for the preservation and recovery of deteriorated and threatened salt marshes. In general, moderate-resolution satellite remote sensing data allow for the accurate detection of salt marsh shorelines; however, their detection in narrow and fringing salt marshes remains challenging. This study aims to evaluate the ability of Landsat-5 (TM), Landsat-7 (ETM+), and Sentinel-2 (MSI) data to be used to accurately determine the shoreline of narrow and fringing salt marshes, focusing on three regions of the Aveiro lagoon in Mira, ilhavo and S. Jacinto channels. Shorelines were determined considering the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the accuracy of this methodology was evaluated against reference shorelines by computing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Once validated, the method was used to determine historical salt marsh shorelines, and rates of change between 1984 and 2022 were quantified and analyzed in the three locations. Results evidence that the 30 m resolution Landsat data accurately describe the salt marsh shoreline (RMSE similar to 15 m) and that the accuracy is maintained when increasing the spatial resolution through pan-sharpening or when using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 (MSI) data. These also show that the salt marshes of the ilhavo and S. Jacinto channels evolved similarly, with salt marsh shoreline stability before 2000 followed by retreats after this year. At the end of the four decades of study, an average retreat of 66.23 +/- 1.03 m and 46.62 +/- 0.83 m was found, respectively. In contrast to these salt marshes and to the expected evolution, the salt marsh of the Mira Channel showed retreats before 2000, followed by similar progressions after this year, resulting in an average 2.33 +/- 1.18 m advance until 2022.

TI  - Monte Carlo and experimental evaluation of a Timepix4 compact gamma camera for coded aperture nuclear medicine imaging with depth resolution
T2  - PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We designed a prototype compact gamma camera (MediPROBE4) for nuclear medicine tasks, including radio-guided surgery and sentinel lymph node imaging with a 99mTc radiotracer. We performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for image performance assessment, and first spectroscopic imaging tests with a 300 & mu;m thick silicon detector.Methods: The hand-held camera (1 kg weight) is based on a Timepix4 readout circuit for photon-counting, energy-sensitive, hybrid pixel detectors (24.6 x 28.2 mm2 sensitive area, 55 & mu;m pixel pitch), developed by the Medipix4 Collaboration. The camera design adopts a CdTe detector (1 or 2 mm thick) bump-bonded to a Timepix4 readout chip and a coded aperture collimator with 0.25 mm diameter round holes made of 3D printed 1-mm thick tungsten. Image reconstruction is performed via autocorrelation deconvolution.Results: Geant4 MC simulations showed that, for a 99mTc source in air, at 50 mm source-collimator distance, the estimated collimator sensitivity (4 x 10-4) is 292 times larger than that of a single hole in the mask; the system sensitivity is 0.22 cps/kBq (2 mm CdTe); the lateral spatial resolution is 1.7 mm FWHM. The estimated axial longitudinal resolution is 8.2 mm FWHM at 40 mm distance. First experimental tests with a 300 & mu;m thick Silicon pixel detector bump-bonded to a Timepix4 chip and a high-resolution coded aperture collimator showed time over-threshold and time-of-arrival capabilities with 241Am and 133Ba gamma-ray sources. Conclusions: MC simulations and validation lab tests showed the expected performance of the MediPROBE4 compact gamma camera for gamma-ray 3D imaging.

TI  - Analysis of Vegetation Dynamics and Driving Mechanisms on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the Context of Climate Change
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP) is susceptible to climate change and human activities, which brought about drastic alterations in vegetation on the plateau. However, the trends and driving mechanisms of vegetation changes remain unclear. Therefore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of vegetation and the consistency of dynamic trends in the TP from 2000 to 2020 in this study. The independent contributions and interactive factors of natural and human activities on vegetation changes were investigated through the Geodetector model. The drivers of vegetation under different dry-wet zones and precipitation gradients were quantitatively separated, and the internal mechanisms of vegetation changes were discussed from multiple perspectives. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, the NDVI had an overall increasing trend, with an increasing rate of 0.0027 a-1, and the spatial pattern was different, increasing gradually from the northwest to the southeast. Consistent improvement occurred in the central and southeastern parts of the TP, while the western and northern parts consistently deteriorated. The annual mean precipitation had the greatest explanatory power for vegetation changes (0.781). The explanatory power of the integrated effects between two factors was greater than that of individual factors. The integrated effects between annual mean precipitation and other driving factors had the strongest explanatory power on vegetation variations. The driving mechanisms of vegetation dynamics varied among different dry-wet zones, and the vegetation growth was more sensitive to the response of precipitation in arid and semi-arid climate zones. This study enhances our understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of vegetation changes on the plateau, which can provide a reference for ecological conservation, and has implications for further prediction and assessment of vegetation ecosystem stability.

TI  - End-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness during the Southern Hemisphere 2022 influenza season-Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study estimated the 2022 end-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalization in Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Methods: We pooled surveillance data from SARI cases in 18 sentinel surveillance hospitals in Chile (n = 9), Paraguay (n = 2), and Uruguay (n = 7) from March 16-November 30, 2022. VE was estimated using a test-negative design and logistic regression models adjusted for country, age, sex, presence of & GE;1 comorbidity, and week of illness onset. VE estimates were stratified by influenza virus type and subtype (when available) and influenza vaccine target population, categorized as children, individuals with comorbidities, and older adults, defined per countries' national immunization policies. Results: Among the 3147 SARI cases, there were 382 (12.1%) influenza test-positive case patients; 328 (85.9%) influenza case patients were in Chile, 33 (8.6%) were in Paraguay, and 21 (5.5%) were in Uruguay. In all countries, the predominant subtype was influenza A(H3N2) (92.6% of influenza cases). Adjusted VE against any influenza-associated SARI hospitalization was 33.8% (95% confidence interval: 15.3%, 48.2%); VE against influenza A(H3N2)-associated SARI hospitalization was 30.4% (95% confidence interval: 10.1%, 46.0%). VE estimates were similar across target populations. Conclusion: During the 2022 influenza season, influenza vaccination reduced the odds of hospitalization among those vaccinated by one-third. Health officials should encourage influenza vaccination in accordance with national recommendations. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Mapping and spatiotemporal dynamics of land-use and land-cover change based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform from Landsat imagery: A case study of Zhoushan Island, China.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land resources are an essential foundation for socioeconomic development. Island land resources are limited, the type changes are particularly frequent, and the environment is fragile. Therefore, large-scale, long-term, and high-accuracy land-use classification and spatiotemporal characteristic analysis are of great significance for the sustainable development of islands. Based on the advantages of remote sensing indices and principal component analysis in accurate classification, and taking Zhoushan Archipelago, China, as the study area, in this work long-term satellite remote sensing data were used to perform land-use classification and spatiotemporal characteristic analysis. The classification results showed that the land-use types could be exactly classified, with the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient greater than 94% and 0.93, respectively. The results of the spatiotemporal characteristic analysis showed that the built-up land and forest land areas increased by 90.00km2 and 36.83km2, respectively, while the area of the cropland/grassland decreased by 69.77km2. The areas of the water bodies, tidal flats, and bare land exhibited slight change trends. The spatial coverage of Zhoushan Island continuously expanded toward the coast, encroaching on nearby sea areas and tidal flats. The cropland/grassland was the most transferred-out area, at up to 108.94km2, and built-up land was the most transferred-in areas, at up to 73.31km2. This study provides a data basis and technical support for the scientific management of land resources.

TI  - Estimation of Above-Ground Biomass for <i>Pinus densata</i> Using Multi-Source Time Series in Shangri-La Considering Seasonal Effects
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is the basis of terrestrial carbon storage estimation, and making full use of the seasonal characteristics of remote sensing imagery can improve the estimation accuracy. In this study, we used multi-source time series and sample plots with the Random Forest (RF) model to estimate the AGB. The sources included Sentinel-1 (S-1), Sentinel-2 (S-2), and the S-1 and S-2 combination (S-1S-2). Time series included single season, annual, and multi-season. This study aims to (1) explore the optimal image acquisition season to estimate AGB; (2) determine whether the ability to estimate the AGB of multi-seasonal imagery exceeded that of annual and single-season imagery; (3) discover the sensitivity of different data to AGB according to phenological conditions. The results showed that: (1) images acquired in autumn were more useful for AGB estimation than spring, summer, and winter; (2) the S-1 multi-seasonal AGB model had higher accuracy than the annual or single-season one; (3) in autumn and spring, S-1 had higher estimation accuracy than S-2, and in autumn and spring, estimation accuracy from S-1S-2 was higher than that from S-1 and S-2; (4) in 16 AGB estimation models, the best estimation accuracy was achieved by the autumn AGB model from S-1S-2 (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 16.26 t/ha, p = 0.82, and rRMSE = 18.97). This study could be useful to identify the optimal image acquisition season for AGB estimation, thus reducing the economic cost of image acquisition and improving the estimation accuracy.

TI  - Targeted Therapy in Follicular Lymphoma: Towards a Chemotherapy-Free Approach
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Follicular lymphoma (FL)-a common, indolent, and usually non-curable B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma-is frequently treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy with anti-CD20 therapy. The downsides of this approach include cumulative toxicities that limit the total duration of treatment and may be prohibitive in unfit patients, as well as chemotherapy-refractory disease that develops over time. Targeted therapies in FL show promise by inhibiting key molecular pathways responsible for cancer proliferation and survival, reducing toxicity, and potentially circumventing chemotherapy refractoriness. In this review, we investigate, summarize, and critique the sentinel studies underpinning the use of targeted therapies currently available for FL in both the front-line and relapsed-refractory setting. We also detail the role of molecular markers in FL as well as future directions in targeted treatment for follicular lymphoma.Abstract Background: The treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) has previously centered on chemoimmunotherapy, which can be disadvantageous due to patient intolerance, cumulative toxicities, and disease refractoriness. Targeted therapies can produce deep responses and improve progression-free and overall survival with more tolerable adverse event profiles. Methods: We summarize the current literature and key clinical trials regarding targeted therapies in follicular lymphoma both in the front-line and in the relapsed-refractory setting. Results: Targeted therapies studied in FL include immune modulators, anti-CD20 antibodies, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, enhancers of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) therapy and bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) therapies also show promise in monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapies. These therapies exhibit high overall response rates and substantial progression-free survival and overall survival, even in high-risk patients or patients previously refractory to chemotherapy or rituximab. Adverse events vary substantially but are generally manageable and compare favorably to the cumulative toxicities of chemotherapy. Conclusion: Targeted therapies represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of FL. Further studies are needed to directly compare these targeted therapies and their combinations, as well as to investigate biomarkers predictive of response.

TI  - A review of the marine biogeochemical response to typhoons
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Typhoons are extreme weather events that can not only affect marine dynamics, but also change marine biogeochemistry, considerably impacting the climate. Based on the satellite remote sensing data, the upwelling of abundant nutrients induced by typhoons from deeper eutrophic water to the upper oligotrophic layer triggers phytoplankton blooms in the upper oceans, thereby increasing new productivity (as a carbon sink). However, field observations have shown that organic matter decomposition (as a carbon source) is the dominant process regardless of whether phytoplankton blooms occur after typhoons, resulting in oxygen consumption in the water column. Therefore, it is particularly important to comprehensively study the coupling mechanisms of biogeochemistry and dynamics in the ocean after typhoons. Here, we present a systematic overview summarizing the effects of typhoons on marine dynamics and biogeochemistry and elaborating on the characteristics and mechanisms of organic matter decomposition induced by typhoons.

TI  - Retrieval of Arctic Sea Ice Motion from FY-3D/MWRI Brightness Temperature Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice motion (SIM) has significant implications for sea-air interactions, thermohaline circulation, and the development of the Arctic passage. This research proposes an improved SIM retrieval method from Fengyun-3D's (FY-3D) microwave radiometer imager's (MWRI) brightness temperature (Tb) data based on the modified classical maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method and the multisource data merging method. This study utilized buoy data to establish the search area range, applied distinct thresholds across various Arctic regions, and merged the buoy data, reanalysis wind data, and SIM retrieved from FY-3D/MWRI Tb data. In 2019, for the final Arctic SIM results retrieved from the MWRI 89 GHz and 36.5 GHz Tb data, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean average error (MAE) in the east-west direction were 2.07 cm/s and 1.38 cm/s and those in the north-south direction were 1.96 cm/s and 1.15 cm/s, compared to the ice-tethered profiler (ITP) data. Compared with the daily average data of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the RMSE and MAE of the SIM results obtained in this study were 0.74 cm/s and 0.93 cm/s in the east-west direction, and 0.56 cm/s and 0.72 cm/s in the north-south direction, respectively. The monthly average of the SIM retrieved from the MWRI Tb data in this research also showed a good agreement with the monthly average of the NSIDC SIM product. The comparison showed that the MWRI Tb data could be used to retrieve the Arctic SIM, and the Arctic SIM retrieval method presented in this paper was accurate and general.

TI  - Satellite Imagery-Estimated Intertidal Seaweed Biomass Using UAV as an Intermediary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a supplement to satellite remote sensing to accurately assess benthic seaweed biomass in intertidal zones, in order to improve inversion accuracy results and investigate the spatial distribution patterns of seaweed. By adopting non-multicollinearity vegetation indices (feature sets) from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, and using benthic seaweed biomass inverted from multispectral UAV imagery as the label set for satellite pixel biomass values, machine learning methods (Gradient boosting decision tree, GBDT) can effectively improve the accuracy of biomass estimation results for Ulva pertusa and Sargassum thunbergii species (Ulva pertusa, RSentinel22 = 0.74, RPlanetScope2 = 0.8; Sargassum thunbergii, RSentinel22 = 0.88, RPlanetScope2 = 0.69). The average biomasses of Ulva pertusa and Sargassum thunbergii in the intertidal zone of Gouqi Island are 456.84 g/m2 and 2606.60 g/m2, respectively, and the total resources are 3.5 x 108 g and 1.4 x 109 g, respectively. In addition, based on the hyperspectral data, it was revealed that a major source of error is the patchy distribution of seaweed.

TI  - Research and Flight Test on Airborne Laser Doppler Velocimeter for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a versatile platform for a wide range of civil applications, and offer flexibility and convenience in performing various tasks, like mapping, investigation, and patrolling. Accurate navigation information such as velocity and position is required to ensure the flight safety of UAVs. However, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is easily denied in urban environments due to the occlusion of tall buildings, which results in navigation information loss. Inertial navigation systems (INSs) are also hard to be relied on for long-scale autonomous navigation as its error accumulates over time. High-precision and independent velocity measurement methods will be beneficial for the navigation of UAVs. The laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) has been applied to the integrated navigation of land vehicles improving localization accuracy. There is a bottleneck for LDV deployment on UAVs due to the limited working distance of LDV which is typically restricted to only a few meters. However, UAVs often operate at flight heights of dozens of meters, posing a challenge for LDV integration and utilization.Methods The carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of LDV is analyzed concerning coherent Doppler wind lidar since both of them are coherent detection systems. For the same LDV, the CNR can be improved by reducing the size of the probe beam spot on the target. On this basis, we propose a solution to the bottleneck of implementing airborne LDV by an optical transformation system to extend the working distance of LDV. The optical transformation system comprises a concave lens and a convex lens. By passing the Gaussian probe beam through this system, the size and location of the beam waist can be adjusted by varying the distance between the two lenses. Simulation and experiments show that the size of the transformed waist can be reduced without changing the transformed location of the waist by a probe beam with a larger waist size in the optical transformation system. Before the airborne LDV prototype is assembled, the parameters of the transformation system are optimized through simulation, while considering the size and weight of the LDV. The focuses of the concave and convex lenses are chosen to be -100 mm and 600 mm respectively. Before being input into the optical transformation system, the probe beam is expanded to 10 mm by an 8x expander. The entire LDV system is constructed with a sturdy cage structure, with four metal rods serving as the core skeleton to ensure the coaxial alignment of the optical transformation system. As the attitude of UAVs changes over time, a micro-electromechanical (MEMS) INS has been employed to measure and track these variations in UAV attitude. Additionally, the quality factor of the Doppler signal is defined as the ratio between the amplitude of the Doppler frequency and the mean amplitude of the base in the frequency domain, and it is adopted to represent the CNR in experiments.Results and Discussions After designing, a single-beam airborne LDV prototype is fabricated with a working distance of 50 m and a 10 m depth of field. The spot diameter of the probe beam at 50 m is 0.34 mm. The quality factor has been measured to be 3685 at the working distance of 50 m and remains above 800 throughout the entire depth of field. The depth of field is enough to prevent signal loss and a 110-second flight experiment is conducted with a UAV as the carrier. The velocity measured by the prototype is corrected for the pitch angle recorded by MEMS INS, and the corrected velocity is basically consistent with the velocity recorded by global position system(GPS) as a reference. The entire measurement maintains a high Doppler signal quality factor. However, the accuracy of MEMS INS is insufficient. Although the airborne LDV provides highly precise velocity components along the direction of the probe beam, the accuracy of velocity worsens after correction for pitch angle. The utilization of a two-beam LDV can alleviate this problem since the two beams have different angles for the ground. The velocity can be accurately determined by measuring the Doppler frequency and the angle between the two beams.Conclusions The airborne LDV is designed and tested through simulation and experiments. We verify the feasibility of airborne LDV which has promising applications in UAV-integrated navigation. Our study lays a foundation for the development of multi-beam onboard LDV in the future. The acquisition of all accurate velocity components can significantly improve the navigation and localization of UAVs.

TI  - Development and validation of convolutional neural network-based model to predict the risk of sentinel or non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer: a machine learning study
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background For patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis and low risk of residual non-SLN (NSLN) metastasis, axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection could lead to overtreatment. This study aimed to develop and validate an automated preoperative deep learning-based tool to predict the risk of SLN and NSLN metastasis in patients with breast cancer (BC) using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) images. Methods In this machine learning study, we retrospectively enrolled 988 women with BC from three hospitals in Zhejiang, China between June 1, 2013 to December 31, 2021, June 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021, and January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2023, respectively. Patients were divided into the training set (n = 519), internal validation set (n = 129), external test set 1 (n = 296), and external test set 2 (n = 44). A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was proposed to predict the SLN and NSLN metastasis and was compared with clinical and radiomics approaches. The performance of different models to detect ALN metastasis was measured by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This study is registered at ChiCTR, ChiCTR2300070740. Findings For SLN prediction, the top-performing model (i.e., the CNN algorithm) achieved encouraging predictive performance in the internal validation set (AUC 0.899, 95% CI, 0.887-0.911), external test set 1 (AUC 0.885, 95% CI, 0.867-0.903), and external test set 2 (AUC 0.768, 95% CI, 0.738-0.798). For NSLN prediction, the CNN-based model also exhibited satisfactory performance in the internal validation set (AUC 0.800, 95% CI, 0.783-0.817), external test set 1 (AUC 0.763, 95% CI, 0.732-0.794), and external test set 2 (AUC 0.728, 95% CI, 0.719-0.738). Based on the subgroup analysis, the CNN model performed well in tumour group smaller than 2.0 cm, with the AUC of 0.801 (internal validation set) and 0.823 (external test set 1). Of 469 patients with BC, the false positive rate of SLN prediction declined from 77.9% to 32.9% using CNN model.Interpretation The CNN model can predict the SLN status of any detectable lesion size and condition of NSLN in patients with BC. Overall, the CNN model, employing ready DCE-MRI images could serve as a potential technique to assist surgeons in the personalized axillary treatment of in patients with BC non-invasively.Copyright & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Recognition of Severe Convective Cloud Based on the Cloud Image Prediction Sequence from FY-4A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe convective weather is hugely destructive, causing significant loss of life and social and economic infrastructure. Based on the U-Net network with the attention mechanism, the recurrent convolution, and the residual module, a new model is proposed named ARRU-Net (Attention Recurrent Residual U-Net) for the recognition of severe convective clouds using the cloud image prediction sequence from FY-4A data. The characteristic parameters used to recognize severe convective clouds in this study were brightness temperature values TBB9, brightness temperature difference values TBB9-TBB12 and TBB12-TBB13, and texture features based on spectral characteristics. This method first input five satellite cloud images with a time interval of 30 min into the ARRU-Net model and predicted five satellite cloud images for the next 2.5 h. Then, severe convective clouds were segmented based on the predicted image sequence. The root mean square error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and correlation coefficient (R2) of the predicted results were 5.48 K, 35.52 dB, and 0.92, respectively. The results of the experiments showed that the average recognition accuracy and recall of the ARRU-Net model in the next five moments on the test set were 97.62% and 83.34%, respectively.

TI  - Analysis and Suppression Design of Stray Light Pollution in a Spectral Imager Loaded on a Polar-Orbiting Satellite
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the non-imaging light of optical instruments, stray light has an important impact on normal imaging and data quantification applications. The FY-3D Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) operates in a sun-synchronous orbit, with a scanning field of view of 110 & DEG; and a surface imaging width of more than 2300 km, which can complete two coverage observations of global targets per day with high detection efficiency. According to the characteristics of the operating orbit and large-angle scanning imaging of MERSI, a stray light radiation model of the polar-orbiting spectrometer is constructed, and the design requirements of stray light suppression are proposed. Using the point source transmittance (PST) as the merit function of the stray light analysis method, the instrument was simulated with all stray light suppression optical paths, and the effectiveness of stray light elimination measures was verified using the stray light test. In this paper, the full-link method of "orbital stray light radiation model-system, internal and external simulation design-system analysis and actual test comparison verification" is proposed, and there is a maximum decrease in the system's PST by about 10 times after applying the stray light suppression's optimization design, which can provide a general method for stray light suppression designs for polar-orbit spectral imagers.

However, achieving high-precision classification of urban vegetation is challenging due to dramatic land changes in cities, the complexity of land cover, and hill shading. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have unique advantages in remote sensing image classification, they require a large amount of training sample data, making it difficult to adequately train the network to improve classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposed an urban vegetation classification method by combining the advantages of transfer learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning. First, three UNet++ networks (UNet++, VGG16-UNet++, and ResNet50-UNet++) were pre-trained using the open sample set of urban land use/land cover (LULC), and the deep features of Sentinel-2 images were extracted using the pre-trained three UNet++ networks. Subsequently, the optimal deep feature set was then selected by Relief-F and input into the Stacking algorithm for urban vegetation classification. The results showed that deeper features extracted by UNet++ networks were able to easily distinguish between different vegetation types compared to Sentinel-2 spectral features. The overall classification accuracy (OA) of UNet++ networks and the Stacking algorithm (UNS) was 92.74%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.8905. The classification results of UNet++ networks and the Stacking algorithm improved by 2.34%, 1.8%, 2.29%, and 10.74% in OA compared to a single neural network (UNet++, VGG16-UNet++, and ResNet50-UNet++) and the Stacking algorithm, respectively. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the method with common vegetation classification algorithms (RF, U-Net, and DeepLab V3+) indicated that the results of UNS were 11.31%, 9.38%, and 3.05% better in terms of OA, respectively. Generally, the method developed in this paper could accurately obtain urban vegetation information and provide a reference for research on urban vegetation classification.

TI  - Tracking the spatio-temporal change of the main food crop planting structure in the Yellow River Basin over 2001-2020
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of crop planting structure is the fundamental for estimating regional crop yield and crop water consumption in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). However, the planted area of the main food crops in the YRB in recent 20 years is still unclear. Therefore, the MODIS image data was used to extract the growing area of the main food crops (winter wheat, summer maize, spring wheat and spring maize) in the YRB over 2001-2020 by the combination of the differential algorithm, spectral mutation algorithm and threshold method. The results revealed that the combined method could be used to track the planted area of the main food crop in the YRB, with R2 and RMSE values ranged from 0.51 to 0.82 and 11.01 to 68.92 x 103 hm2, respectively. The planted area of winter wheat and summer maize in the down-stream irrigation district accounted for 74.7% and 86.7% of the total in the YRB, respectively. Inner Mongolia and Ningxia autonomous regions are the main producing areas for spring wheat and spring maize, accounting for 73.8% and 83.5% of the total in the YRB, respectively. The planted area of winter wheat, summer maize and spring maize had an increasing trend with the rate of 1.440 x 104 hm2 per year, 2.375 x 104 hm2 per year and 2.257 x 104 hm2 per year over 2001-2020. Whereas, the planted area of spring wheat had a decreasing trend with the rate of-2.019 x 104 hm2 per year. Implementation of water-saving irrigation measures, variations of diverted water from the Yellow River, local policies improvement and agricultural market might be the main driving forces for the changes of the planted area for food crops. The results can provide a fundamental agricultural information dataset for further study of regional crop water consumption in the YRB.

TI  - Projection of urban land surface temperature: An inter- and intra-annual modeling approach
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - An easily applied and efficiently exploited approach was proposed for the prediction of inter-and intra-annual land surface temperature (LST) in a city's central zone. Chengdu is chosen as the study area to demonstrate the applicability of the novel approach. Built-up areas were extracted using Landsat images in 2008, 2013, and 2019 and projected for 2030 using the cellular automata-Markov chain model, indicating that built-up areas grew nearly 109% during 2008-2019 in Chengdu and will continue to grow up to 2030. Employing the multiple linear regression, the LST of built-up areas in 2019 was predicted using the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and the mean LST of its surrounding pixels (LST-R3) in 2013 (R2 = 0.981). The model's intra-annual application for 2019 showed a mean LST deviation of 0.93 degrees C. According to the model's inter-annual application, the projected LST of the built-up areas in 2030 will increase to 36.5 & PLUSMN; 2.0 degrees C. The results can contribute to achieving a thermally comfortable urban envi-ronment by providing insights into the impact of urban expansion on the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon under the limited availability of continuous LST data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Glacier Mass Balance in the Tomur Peak Region Based on Multi-Source Altimetry Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine glaciers are sensitive indicators of regional climate change, which can affect regional ecological stability and social development. Variations in glacier mass balance (GMB) are an important parameter in studying glacier change. In this study, data from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-1 (ICESat-1), the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), and CryoSat-2 (Ku-band) were combined, and high-resolution ALOS DEM was employed to denoise. After that, the polynomial fitting method was used to analyze the characteristics of glacier surface elevation (GSE) variations from 2003-2020 in the Tomur Peak Region of the Central Asian Tianshan Mountains and the regional GMB was calculated. Research results showed that: (1) From 2003-2020, the GSE of the Tomur Peak Region had an overall -8.95 & PLUSMN; 4.48 m variation, the average rate of which was -0.53 & PLUSMN; 0.26 m/yr (/yr is /year). Overall, elevations of most glaciers in the Tomur Peak Region had downward trends, with a rate of change of -0.5 to 0 m/yr. The fastest rate of elevation decline in the Koxkar Glacier Tongue was -1.5 m/yr. The elevation of some altimetric points in the Eastern Tomur Peak Region showed a rising state, with a maximum rate of variation of 1.0 m/yr. (2) From 2003-2020, the average GMB in the Tomur Peak Region was -1.51 & PLUSMN; 0.04 Gt/yr. In the region of elevation below 4000 m, small glaciers dominated, with a GMB of -0.61 & PLUSMN; 0.04 Gt/yr. With increasing elevation, the melting rate of glaciers gradually slowed down, but overall, the mass balance remained in a state of decline. (3) Climate was the main driving factor of GMB change in the study area. From 2003-2020, in the Tomur Peak Region, the average annual temperature continued to increase at a rate of 0.04 & PLUSMN; 0.02 & DEG;C/yr, and this was the main influencing factor for the negative GMB in the Tomur Peak Region. In the same period, the annual precipitation showed a rising trend with a linear variation rate of 0.12 & PLUSMN; 0.06 mm/yr, and the rising precipitation was the influencing factor for the gradually slowing change in the GMB in the study area.

TI  - A Comprehensive Evaluation of Machine Learning and Classical Approaches for Spaceborne Active-Passive Fusion Bathymetry of Coral Reefs
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) techniques are increasingly valuable for deriving high-quality bathymetric maps of coral reefs. Investigating the performance of the related SDB algorithms in purely spaceborne active-passive fusion bathymetry contributes to formulating reliable bathymetric strategies, particularly for areas such as the Spratly Islands, where in situ observations are exceptionally scarce. In this study, we took Anda Reef as a case study and evaluated the performance of eight common SDB approaches by integrating Sentinel-2 images with Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). The bathymetric maps were generated using two classical and six machine-learning algorithms, which were then validated with measured sonar data. The results illustrated that all models accurately estimated the depth of coral reefs in the 0-20 m range. The classical algorithms (Lyzenga and Stumpf) exhibited a mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 0.990 m, 1.386 m, and 11.173%, respectively. The machine learning algorithms generally outperformed the classical algorithms in accuracy and bathymetric detail, with a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.94 to 0.96 and an RMSE ranging from 1.034 m to 1.202 m. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest accuracy and consistency with an RMSE of as low as 1.034 m, followed by the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) (1.070 m). Our results provide a practical reference for selecting SDB algorithms to accurately obtain shallow water bathymetry in subsequent studies.

TI  - Unexpected Expansion of Rare-Earth Element Mining Activities in the Myanmar-China Border Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining for rare earth elements is rapidly increasing, driven by current and projected demands for information and energy technologies. Following China's Central Government's 2012 strategy to shift away from mining in favor of value-added processing, primary extraction has increased outside of China. Accordingly, changes in mineral exploitation in China and Myanmar have garnered considerable attention in the past decade. The prevailing assumption is that mining in China has decreased while mining in Myanmar has increased, but the dynamic in border regions is more complex. Our empirical study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to characterize changes in mining surface footprints between 2005 and 2020 in two rare earth mines located on either side of the Myanmar-China border, within Kachin State in northern Myanmar and Nujiang Prefecture in Yunnan Province in China. Our results show that the extent of the mining activities increased by 130% on China's side and 327% on Myanmar's side during the study period. We extracted surface reflectance images from 2005 and 2010 from Landsat 5 TM and 2015 and 2020 images from Landsat 8 OLI. The Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to dense time-series imagery to enhance landcover categories. Random Forest was used to categorize landcover into mine and non-mine classes with an overall accuracy of 98% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.98, revealing an increase in mining extent of 2.56 km2, covering the spatial mining footprint from 1.22 km2 to 3.78 km2 in 2005 and 2020, respectively, within the study area. We found a continuous decrease in non-mine cover, including vegetation. Both mines are located in areas important to ethnic minority groups, agrarian livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and regional watersheds. The finding that mining surface areas increased on both sides of the border is significant because it shows that national-level generalizations do not align with local realities, particularly in socially and environmentally sensitive border regions. The quantification of such changes over time can help researchers and policymakers to better understand the shifting geographies and geopolitics of rare earth mining, the environmental dynamics in mining areas, and the particularities of mineral extraction in border regions.

TI  - Tumor Characteristics Associated with Axillary Nodal Positivity in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Larger-size primary tumors are correlated with axillary metastases and worse outcomes. We evaluated the relationships among tumor size, location, and distance to nipple relative to axillary node metastases in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, as well as the predictive capacity of imaging. We conducted a single-institution, retrospective chart review of stage I-III TNBC patients diagnosed from 1998 to 2019 who underwent upfront surgery. Seventy-three patients had a mean tumor size of 20 mm (range 1-53 mm). All patients were clinically node negative. Thirty-two patients were sentinel lymph node positive, of whom 25 underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Larger tumor size was associated with positive nodes (p < 0.001): the mean tumor size was 14.30 mm in node negative patients and 27.31 mm in node positive patients. Tumor to nipple distance was shorter in node positive patients (51.0 mm) vs. node negative patients (73.3 mm) (p = 0.005). The presence of LVI was associated with nodal positivity (p < 0.001). Tumor quadrant was not associated with nodal metastasis. Ultrasound yielded the largest number of suspicious findings (21/49), with sensitivity of 0.25 and specificity of 0.40. On univariate analysis, age younger than 60 at diagnosis was also associated with nodal positivity (p < 0.002). Comparative analyses with other subtypes may identify biologic determinants.

TI  - Lymph Node Metastases from Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer of the Head and Neck
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Skin cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancer, is the most common malignancy in the world. There are both common and uncommon types that receive treatment every day. Despite their commonality, the management of each is not perfectly defined in the scientific literature. Many require surgical removal, but the management of regional metastasis (such as lymph nodes in the neck) may or may not require surgical removal, or even anything beyond observation. Further complicating matters, some may have microscopic regional metastases that cannot be detected with a physical exam or imaging. This article seeks to summarize the current literature on this topic and to offer specific insight on how to manage non-melanoma skin cancer that has migrated away from the primary site to the regional lymph nodes.Abstract Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) represents the most common malignancy in the world, comprising exceedingly common lesions such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and rare lesions such as Merkel cell carcinoma. Risk factors are widely recognized and include ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, radiation exposure, immunosuppression, and many others. As a whole, survival and functional outcomes are favorable, but each histopathological subtype of NMSC behaves differently. Treatment regimens for the primary site usually include wide surgical excision and neck dissection in cases of clinically involved metastatic lymph nodes. The elective management of draining nodal basins, however, is a contested topic. Nearly all subtypes, excluding BCC, have a significant risk of lymphatic metastases, and have been studied with regard to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and elective neck dissection. To date, no studies have definitively established a true single standard of care, as exists for melanoma, for any of the NMSCs. As a result, the authors have sought to summarize the current literature and identify indications and management options for the management of the cervical lymphatics for each major subtype of NMSC. Further research remains critically necessary in order to develop complete treatment algorithms.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Land Degradation Studies in Drylands Using Remote Sensing Data: A 40-Year Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Drylands are vast and face threats from climate change and human activities. Traditional reviews cannot capture interdisciplinary knowledge, but bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights. Our study conducted bibliometric research of scientific production on climate change and land degradation in drylands using remote sensing. We examined 1527 Scopus-indexed publications to identify geographic and thematic hotspots, extracting leading authors, journals, and institutions. China leads in publications, followed by the US, Germany, and Australia. The US has the highest citation count. Collaboration networks involve the US, China, and European countries. There has been an exponential increase in remote sensing of land degradation in drylands (RSLDD) publications since 2011. Key journals include "International Journal of Remote Sensing" and "Remote Sensing of Environment". The analysis highlights the growing interest in the field, driven by Australia, the US, and China. Key areas of study are vegetation dynamics and land use change. Future perspectives for this scientific field involve promoting collaboration and exploring emerging technologies for comprehensive land degradation and desertification research.

TI  - Mapping Above-Ground Carbon Stocks at the Landscape Scale to Support a Carbon Compensation Mechanism: The Chocó Andino Case Study
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Tropical Mountain forests (TMF) constitute a threatened major carbon sink due to deforestation. Carbon compensation projects could significantly aid in preserving these ecosystems. Consequently, we need a better understanding of the above-ground carbon (AGC) spatial distribution in TMFs to provide project developers with accurate estimations of their mitigation potential; (2) Methods: integrating field measurements and remote sensing data into a random forest (RF) modelling framework, we present the first high-resolution estimates of AGC density (Mg C ha-1) over the western Ecuadorian Andes to inform an ongoing carbon compensation mechanism; (3) Results: In 2021, the total landscape carbon storage was 13.65 Tg in 194,795 ha. We found a broad regional partitioning of AGC density mediated primarily by elevation. We report RF-estimated AGC density errors of 15% (RMSE = 23.8 Mg C ha-1) on any 10 m pixel along 3000 m of elevation gradient covering a wide range of ecological conditions; (4) Conclusions: Our approach showed that AGC high-resolution maps displaying carbon stocks on a per-pixel level with high accuracy (85%) could be obtained with a minimum of 14 ground-truth plots enriched with AGC density data from published regional studies. Likewise, our maps increased precision and reduced uncertainty concerning current methodologies used by international standards in the Voluntary Carbon Market.

TI  - Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms in the Classification of Multispectral Images from the Sentinel-2A/2B Orbital Sensor for Mapping the Environmental Dynamics of Ria Formosa (Algarve, Portugal)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing availability of remote sensing orbital spatial data, the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been leveraging the field of process automation in image classification. The present work aimed to evaluate the precision and accuracy of ML algorithms in the classification of Sentinel 2A/2B images from an area of high environmental dynamics, such as Ria Formosa (Algarve, Portugal). The images were submitted to classification by groups of ML algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). The Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) open-source programming package made the algorithms available. Ten samples were collected for each of the 14 land use and cover classes in the Ria Formosa area, totaling 140 samples. Of these, 70% were for training and 30% for validating the classification. The evaluation metrics used were the class discrimination measures: Recall (R), the Global Kappa Index (k), and the General Accuracy Index (OA). The results showed that the KNN and DT algorithms demonstrated a greater discrimination capacity for most classes. SVM and RF significantly improved class discrimination when using larger samples for training. Merging the classified images significantly improved the classification accuracy, ranging from 71% to 81%. This evaluation made it possible to define sets of ML algorithms sensitive to change detection for mapping and monitoring dynamic environments.

TI  - Detecting agricultural drought risks: A case study of the rice crop (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and the TAMSAT-ALERT system in Guyana
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought-related risks pose a threat to the agricultural sector of Guyana despite the country's wealth of freshwater resources. As a result, the advancement of the understanding of soil moisture deficits as a means of forecasting agricultural drought is needed to aid farmers, extension officers, and other agricultural decision-makers. Hence, this study has been motivated by the following research question: Can the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data-AgriculturaL Early waRning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT) be used to assess the meteorological risk to cultivation at key points in the growing season? Due to the absence of in situ soil moisture data for the area of study, the Joint UK Land and Environment Simulator (JULES) model was used to model the historical soil moisture, based on gauge precipitation data and NCEP reanalysis data. A case study approach during the 1997 growing seasons of the rice crop was taken to determine whether the TAMSAT-ALERT can be used to detect drought-related risks during the growing season of the crop. Additionally, the skill of the TAMSAT-ALERT drought forecasting system was highly dependent on the land surface state at the initialization of the forecast period. Therefore, the meteorological conditions over the area of interest mainly precipitation in the months or weeks leading up to the initialization of the forecast will have a strong influence on the soil moisture at that period.

TI  - Influence assessment of urban expansion on groundwater level fluctuations in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Being the state capital of Gujarat, Gandhinagar is snowballing urban population, resulting in overexploitation of groundwater resources and consequent decline in local groundwater level. The key objective of the current research is to understand the impact of urban expansion on the groundwater level of Gandhinagar district for the last 3 decades. Long-term land use/land cover (LULC) alterations using Landsat images (1991-2021) reveal a 234% increase in overall built-up area and it is more prominent in western and southern parts than the eastern part of study area till 2021 due to urban sprawl of adjacent Ahmedabad City. Spatial distribution of groundwater levels exhibits the same pattern of groundwater level drop as that of the urban expansion and the drop of maximum depth of the groundwater level has also observed during study tenure. Rapid population growth indicates inevitable urban densification which may lead to increase in groundwater abstraction and consequent groundwater level depletion of Gandhinagar City in near future. The scenario may be worsened due to the reduction in groundwater recharge area owing to enhancement of impervious surfaces. A negative correlation is established between groundwater level and respective built-up areas from 1991 to 2011. After 2001, groundwater levels in some areas showed a rising trend and the number of those locations have increased from 2001 to 2021, indicating a sufficient supply of surface water, meeting the escalating water demand and subsequent reduction in groundwater abstraction. High fluoride content was found in many groundwater samples collected from Gandhinagar's shallow unconfined aquifer. In lieu of almost unperturbed natural groundwater recharge, built-up expansion, rising population, and over-exploitation result in groundwater level depletion in both shallow and deeper aquifers. To replenish the already depleted groundwater level and for sustainable water supply, an integration of rainwater-surface water-groundwater management plan and sustainable urban management plan is highly required. The future sustainable urban-groundwater management plan of Gandhinagar City must emphasized on the expansion of green and permeable spaces for groundwater recharge, mandatory rainwater harvesting system in every building possible, suitable area demarcation for artificial recharge, and identification of areas which are less prone to groundwater level depletion for city expansion. The outcomes of the present study will help the decision-makers to prepare inclusive and resilient urban management plan to accomplish the 6th and 11th Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations by 2030.

TI  - Hillslope-Channel Transitions and the Role of Water Tracks in a Changing Permafrost Landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change, and the effect on hydrologic processes and resulting geomorphic changes to hillslopes and channels is unclear because we lack quantitative models and theory for rapid changes resulting from thawing permafrost. The presence of permafrost modulates water flow and the stability of soil-mantled slopes, implying that there should be a signature of permafrost processes, including warming-driven disturbance, in channel network extent. To inform understanding of hillslope-channel dynamics under changing climates, we examined soil-mantled hillslopes within a & SIM;300 km2 area of the Seward Peninsula, western Alaska, where discontinuous permafrost is particularly susceptible to thaw and rapid landscape change. In this study, we pair high-resolution topographic and satellite data to multi-annual observations of InSAR-derived surface displacement over a 5-year period to quantify spatial variations in topographic change across an upland landscape. We find that neither the basin slope nor the presence of knickzones controls the magnitude of recent surface displacements within the study basin, as may be expected under conceptual models of temperate hillslope evolution. Rather, the highest displacement magnitudes tended to occur at the broad hillslope-channel transition zone. In this study area, this zone is occupied by water tracks, which are zero-order ecogeomorphic features that concentrate surface and subsurface flow paths. Our results suggest that water tracks, which appear to occupy hillslope positions between saturation and incision thresholds, are vulnerable to warming-induced subsidence and incision. We hypothesize that gullying within water tracks will outpace infilling by hillslope processes, resulting in the growth of the channel network under future warming.

TI  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Applicability Analysis for Potential Landslide Identification in Steep Mountainous Areas with C/L Band Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides frequently occur in the mountainous area of southwest China, resulting in infrastructure damage, as well as a loss of life and property. The use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has become increasingly popular due to its wide coverage, high precision, and efficiency in identifying potential landslides in steep mountainous regions to mitigate risks. This study focused on the Mao County region in China and utilized a small baseline subset of InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology with Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data to identify the potential landslides and analyze their applicability. To ensure accuracy, the findings were verified using optical image and field surveys. Additionally, a comparative analysis was performed on C-band and L-band SAR data to examine differences in the coherence, geometric distortion, and displacement results, revealing that the L-band has clear advantages in the coherence, suitable observation coverage, and displacement results, while C-band can detect relatively slight displacements. This study aimed to determine the applicability of different SAR satellites for early landslide identification in steep mountainous areas, which can serve as a technical reference for selecting appropriate SAR data and enhancing InSAR identification abilities for potential landslides in the future.

TI  - Quad-Pol SAR Data Reconstruction from Dual-Pol SAR Mode Based on a Multiscale Feature Aggregation Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) is widely used in remote sensing applications due to its ability to obtain full-polarization information. Compared to the quad-pol SAR, the dual-pol SAR mode has a wider observation swath and is more common in most SAR systems. The goal of reconstructing quad-pol SAR data from the dual-pol SAR mode is to learn the contextual information of dual-pol SAR images and the relationships among polarimetric channels. This work is dedicated to addressing this issue, and a multiscale feature aggregation network has been established to achieve the reconstruction task. Firstly, multiscale spatial and polarimetric features are extracted from the dual-pol SAR images using the pretrained VGG16 network. Then, a group-attention module (GAM) is designed to progressively fuse the multiscale features extracted by different layers. The fused feature maps are interpolated and aggregated with dual-pol SAR images to form a compact feature representation, which integrates the high- and low-level information of the network. Finally, a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with a 1 x 1 convolutional kernel is employed to establish the mapping relationship between the feature representation and polarimetric covariance matrices. To evaluate the quad-pol SAR data reconstruction performance, both polarimetric target decomposition and terrain classification are adopted. Experimental studies are conducted on the ALOS/PALSAR and UAVSAR datasets. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The reconstructed quad-pol SAR data can better sense buildings' double-bounce scattering changes before and after a disaster. Furthermore, the reconstructed quad-pol SAR data of the proposed method achieve a 97.08% classification accuracy, which is 1.25% higher than that of dual-pol SAR data.

TI  - Extraction of farmland shelterbelts from remote sensing imagery based on a belt-oriented method
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionFarmland shelterbelts play a positive role in ensuring food security and ecological safety. The absence or degradation of shelterbelt structures can lead to fragmentation of the remotely extracted results. Conversely, shelterbelt maintenance and management system considers these shelterbelts as entire units, even if they are divided into several parts by the gaps in them. It is essential to propose a remote extraction method to fill in fragmented results and accurately represent the distribution of farmland shelterbelts.MethodsIn this study, random forest algorithm was employed to classify land cover from ZY-3 (ZiYuan-3 satellite from China) imagery. Then, a thinning algorithm of mathematical morphology was applied to extract farmland shelterbelts, and the straight-line connection algorithm was used to connect central lines belonging to the same belt. Finally, the result was validated using nine uniformly distributed training sample areas across the entire region.Results and discussionThis method achieved a correct identification rate of 94.9% within the training areas. Among the different regions, the highest identification accuracy recorded was 98.4% and the lowest was 87.7%. In conjunction with cropland information and the shape index of forest patches, it was possible to remove information for non-farmland shelterbelts without introducing external information. This approach achieved a more refined extraction of forestland information. The combination of the thinning algorithm and straight-line connection algorithm addressed the issue of fragmented results in farmland shelterbelt extraction, compensating for the limitations of relying solely on mathematical morphology for belt connectivity. The research method can provide technical support for the monitoring and management of farmland shelterbelts.

TI  - Modeling global indices for estimating non-photosynthetic vegetation cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) includes plant litter, senesced leaves, and crop residues. NPV plays an essential role in terrestrial ecosystem processes, and is an important indicator of drought severity, ecosystem disturbance, agricultural resilience, and wildfire danger. Current moderate spatial resolution multispectral satellite systems (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2) have only a single band in the 2000-2500 nm shortwave infrared "SWIR2" range where non-pigment biochemical constituents of NPV, including cellulose and lignin, have important spectral absorption features. Thus, these current systems have suboptimal capabilities for characterizing NPV cover. This research used simulated spectral mixtures accounting for variability among NPV and soils to evaluate globally-appropriate hyperspectral and multispectral indices for estimation of fractional NPV cover. The Continuum Interpolated NPV Depth Index (CINDI), a weighted ratio index measuring lignocellulose absorption near 2100 nm, was found to produce the lowest error in estimating NPV cover. CINDI was less sensitive to variability in soil spectra and green vegetation cover than competing indices. While CINDI was sensitive to the relative water content of soil and NPV, this sensitivity allowed for correcting error in estimated NPV cover as water content increased. CINDI bands were less capable than Dual Absorption NPV Index (DANI) bands for maintaining continuity with the heritage Landsat SWIR2 band, but combining multiple CINDI bands demonstrated adequate continuity. Three SWIR2 bands with band centers at 2038, 2108, and 2211 nm can provide superior capabilities for future moderate resolution multispectral/superspectral systems targeting NPV monitoring, including the next generation Landsat mission (Landsat Next). These bands and the associated CINDI index provide potential for global NPV monitoring using a constellation of future superspectral sensors and imaging spectrometers, with applications including improving soil management, preventing land degradation, evaluating impacts of drought, mapping ecosystem disturbance, and assessing wildfire danger.

TI  - An assessment of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar, geophysical and topographical covariates for estimating topsoil particle-size fractions
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are widely employed to predict soil properties, particularly soil moisture and soil carbon content. However, few studies address the use of microwave sensors for soil texture retrieval and those that do are typically constrained to bare soil conditions. Here, we test two statistical modelling approaches-linear (with and without interaction terms) and tree-based models, namely compositional linear regression model (LRM) and random forest (RF)-and both nongeophysical (e.g., surface soil moisture, topographic, etc) and geophysical-based (electromagnetic, magnetic and radiometric) covariates to estimate soil texture (sand %, silt % and clay %), using microwave remote sensing data (ESA Sentinel-1). The statistical models evaluated explicitly consider the compositional nature of soil texture and were evaluated with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Our findings indicate that both modelling approaches yielded better estimates when fitted without the geophysical covariates. Based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), LRM slightly outperformed RF, with NSE values for sand, silt and clay of 0.94, 0.62 and 0.46, respectively; for RF, the NSE values were 0.93, 0.59 and 0.44. When interaction terms were included, RF was found to outperform LRM. The inclusion of interactions in the LRM resulted in a decrease in NSE value and an increase in the size of the residuals. Findings also indicate that the use of radar-derived variables (e.g., VV, VH, RVI) alone was not able to predict soil particle size without the aid of other covariates. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering the compositional nature of soil texture information in statistical analysis and regression modelling. As part of the continued assessment of microwave remote sensing data (e.g., ESA Sentinel-1) for predicting topsoil particle size, we intend to test surface scattering information derived from the dual-polarimetric decomposition technique and integrate that predictor into the models in order to deal with the effects of vegetation cover on topsoil backscattering.

TI  - Modeling and Unsupervised Unmixing Based on Spectral Variability for Hyperspectral Oceanic Remote Sensing Data with Adjacency Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a previous paper, we introduced (i) a specific hyperspectral mixing model for the sea bottom, based on a detailed physical analysis that includes the adjacency effect, and (ii) an associated unmixing method that is supervised (i.e., not blind) in the sense that it requires a prior estimation of various parameters of the mixing model, which is constraining. We here proceed much further, by first analytically showing that the above model can be seen as a specific member of the general class of mixing models involving spectral variability. Therefore, we then process such data with the IP-NMF unsupervised (i.e., blind) unmixing method that we proposed in previous works to handle spectral variability. Such variability especially occurs when the sea depth significantly varies over the considered scene. We show that IP-NMF then yields significantly better pure spectra estimates than a classical method from the literature that was not designed to handle such variability. We present test results obtained with realistic synthetic data. These tests address several reference water depths, up to 7.5 m, and clear or standard water. For instance, they show that when the reference depth is set to 7.5 m and the water is clear, the proposed approach is able to distinguish various classes of pure materials when the water depth varies up to +/- 0.2 m around this reference depth, over all pixels of the analyzed scene or over a "subscene": the overall scene may first be segmented, to obtain smaller depths variations over each subscene. The proposed approach is therefore effective and can be used as a building block in performing the subpixel classification of the sea bottom for shallow water.

TI  - Annual Field-Scale Maps of Tall and Short Crops at the Global Scale Using GEDI and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type maps are critical for tracking agricultural land use and estimating crop production. Remote sensing has proven an efficient and reliable tool for creating these maps in regions with abundant ground labels for model training, yet these labels remain difficult to obtain for many regions and years. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR instrument, originally designed for forest monitoring, has shown promise for distinguishing tall and short crops. In the current study, we leverage GEDI to develop wall-to-wall maps of short vs. tall crops on a global scale at 10 m resolution for 2019-2021. Specifically, we show that (i) GEDI returns can reliably be classified into tall and short crops after removing shots with extreme view angles or topographic slope, (ii) the frequency of tall crops over time can be used to identify months when tall crops are at their peak height, and (iii) GEDI shots in these months can then be used to train random forest models that use Sentinel-2 time series to accurately predict short vs. tall crops. Independent reference data from around the world are then used to evaluate these GEDI-S2 maps. We find that GEDI-S2 performed nearly as well as models trained on thousands of local reference training points, with accuracies of at least 87% and often above 90% throughout the Americas, Europe, and East Asia. A systematic underestimation of tall crop area was observed in regions where crops frequently exhibit low biomass, namely Africa and South Asia, and further work is needed in these systems. Although the GEDI-S2 approach only differentiates tall from short crops, in many landscapes this distinction is sufficient to map individual crop types (e.g., maize vs. soy, sugarcane vs. rice). The combination of GEDI and Sentinel-2 thus presents a very promising path towards global crop mapping with minimal reliance on ground data.

TI  - First Insights Into INTUIT: An INteractive Tactile Physicalization for User Interpretation of RADAR Technology
T2  - IEEE COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The changing climate and increasingly unpredictable sea ice conditions have created life-threatening risks for Inuit, the residents of the Arctic, who depend on the ice for transportation and livelihood. In response, they are turning to technology (e.g., RADAR imagery from the Canadian RADARSAT satellite) to augment their traditional knowledge of the ice and to map potential hazards. The difficulty lies in the actual RADAR interpretation process. In order to support understanding of the RADAR image content, we introduce a work-in-progress (WIP), INTUIT, a physicalization that represents the RADAR reflection strength, which is highly influenced by surface roughness, as a tactile texture. Such tactile texture is made by resampling the RADAR imagery to a number of UV cells and mapping the average brightness value of each cell to a physical variable. A proof of concept was designed for a region in Baffin Island (Nunavut) and sent to the Arctic for initial feedback. Preliminary study results are promising: it is expected that INTUIT will facilitate the interpretation learning process for RADAR imagery.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in global temperatures undesirably affects the ever-growing world population and reveals the significance of hydrology science. Hydrological models might estimate spatial and temporal variability in hydrological components at the basin scale, which is critical for efficient water resource management. Satellite data sets with enhanced snow mapping with high spatial and temporal resolutions have been developed. The potential of these satellite data sets is evaluated in this study for multi-criteria evaluation of a conceptual hydrological model to improve model performance and reduce uncertainty.The upstream part of the transboundary Coruh River is selected for this study because snowmelt contributes a significant portion of the streamflow feeding major reservoirs during the spring and early summer months. The region's snow cover dynamic has been analyzed using a combination of two satellite products. Hydrologic modeling is performed using the HBV model for the 2003-2015 water years (01 Oct-30 Sep). The Monte Carlo method is used for multi-criteria optimization exploiting satellite snow cover data besides runoff data. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis on the model parameters indicate that multi-criteria calibration effectively reduces the uncertainty of the parameters and increases the model performance. Moreover, ensemble runoff forecasts are generated with several best model parameters using 1-day and 2-day lead time numerical weather prediction data for the snowmelt period (March-June) of the 2015 water year.The results indicate that the use of multiple remote sensing products in combination better represents the snow-covered area for the region. Additionally, including these data sets into hydrological models enhances the representation of hydrological components while reducing runoff prediction uncertainty.

M3  - Article
AB  - The proposed novel "BathySent" approach for coastal bathymetric mapping, using the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, as well as the assessment and specification of the uncertainties of the derived depth results, are the objectives of this research effort. For this reason, Sentinel-2 bathymetry retrieval results for three different pilot sites in Greece (islands of Kos, Kasos, and Crete) were compared with ground-truth data. These data comprised high-resolution swath bathymetry measurements, single-beam echosounder measurements at very shallow waters (1-10 m), and the EMODnet DTM 2018 release. The synthetic tests showed that the "BathySent" approach could restitute bathymetry in the range of 5-14 m depth, showing a standard deviation of 2 m with respect to the sonar-based bathymetry. In addition, a comparison with the "ratio model" multispectral technique was performed. The absolute differences between conventional Earth Observation-based bathymetry retrieval approaches (i.e., linear ratio model) and the suggested innovative solution, using the Sentinel-2 data, were mainly lower than 2 m. According to the outcome evaluation, both models were considered to provide results that are more reliable within the depth zone of 5-25 m. The "ratio model" technique exhibits a saturation at similar to 25 m depth and demands ground calibration. Though, the "BathySent" method provides bathymetric data at a lower spatial resolution compared to the "ratio model" technique; however, it does not require in situ calibration and can also perform reliably deeper than 25 m.

TI  - Historical Attributions and Future Projections of Gross Primary Productivity in the Yangtze River Basin under Climate Change Based on a Novel Coupled LUE-RE Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Attributions and predictions of gross primary productivity (GPP) under climate change is of great significance for facilitating a deeper understanding of the global and regional terrestrial carbon cycle and assessing ecosystem health. In this study, we have designed a novel approach to simulate GPP based on the satellite and meteorological data compiling the advantages of the light use efficiency model with regression methods (LUE-RE model), which overcomes the limitation of the satellite-based method in GPP simulation and projection in the future time without satellite data. Based on the proposed method, results show that GPP in the Yangtze River Basin shows a significant increase trend in the historical period. Elevated CO2 dominates the changes of GPP in the Yangtze River Basin. In the future, with the increase in elevated CO2 and climate change, the trend of GPP growth is more obvious. The growth slopes under different scenarios are 2.65 gCm-2year-1a-1, 12.34 gCm-2year-1a-1, 24.91 gCm-2year-1a-1, and 39.62 gCm-2year-1a-1. There are obvious seasonal differences in the future changes of GPP in the Yangtze River Basin, of which the GPP changes mostly in spring. The spatial patterns show that higher GPP is concentrated in the upper stream, while the low values are mainly concentrated in the middle reaches. This study contributes a new method to project GPP and highlights that stakeholders should pay more attention to the significant GPP increases in spring in the future.

TI  - Effects of Habitat Change on the Wintering Waterbird Community in China's Largest Freshwater Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake wetland in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain provides important wintering sites for migratory waterbirds. Extreme climatic events and human activities have resulted in the degradation and redistribution of habitat over the last few decades. However, the effects of habitat changes on the abundance of waterbirds remain unclear. We used long-term waterbird monitoring data and Landsat remote-sensing data to characterize changes in abundance and the relationship between habitat variation and abundance. A total of 113 waterbird species were recorded in the wintering period between 1999 and 2021, including 23 globally threatened species. Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons), Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), Bean Goose (Anser fabalis), and Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus) were the dominant species. A total of 46 species with more than 6 annual surveys and average abundance >100 were recorded between 1999 and 2021. For most species, the mean abundance across all sub-lakes was higher in the first year than in the last year, and no obvious changes were observed over the last 20 years. The mean abundances of the vulnerable species Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) and White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) significantly declined between 1999 and 2021. No significant changes in the mean abundance of all foraging groups were observed. The area of water bodies increased, and the area of mudflats decreased. For most species with significant changes in abundance, habitat change did not greatly contribute to variation in mean abundance. The reduction in the area of mudflats greatly contributed to declines in the mean abundance of the gray heron (Ardea cinerea) and gadwall (Anas strepera).

TI  - A Five-Component Decomposition Method with General Rotated Dihedral Scattering Model and Cross-Pol Power Assignment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The model-based polarimetric decomposition is extensively studied due to its simplicity and clear physical interpretation of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. Though there are many fine basic scattering models and well-designed decomposition methods, the overestimation of volume scattering (OVS) may still occur in highly oriented buildings, resulting in severe scattering mechanism ambiguity. It is well known that not only vegetation areas but also oriented buildings may cause intense cross-pol power. To improve the scattering mechanism ambiguity, an appropriate scattering model for oriented buildings and a feasible strategy to assign the cross-pol power between vegetation and oriented buildings are of equal importance. From this point of view, we propose a five-component decomposition method with a general rotated dihedral scattering model and an assignment strategy of cross-pol power. The general rotated dihedral scattering model is established to characterize the integral and internal cross-pol scattering from oriented buildings, while the assignment of cross-pol power between volume and rotated dihedral scattering is achieved by using an eigenvalue-based descriptor DOOB. In addition, a simple branch condition with explicit physical meaning is proposed for model parameters inversion. Experiments on spaceborne Radarsat-2 C band and airborne UAVSAR L band PolSAR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in the quantitative characterization of scattering mechanisms, especially for highly oriented buildings.

TI  - Cropland Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Data in the Southern Part of the Russian Far East
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop identification is one of the most important tasks in digital farming. The use of remote sensing data makes it possible to clarify the boundaries of fields and identify fallow land. This study considered the possibility of using the seasonal variation in the Dual-polarization Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI), which was calculated based on data acquired by the Sentinel-1B satellite between May and October 2021, as the main characteristic. Radar images of the Khabarovskiy District of the Khabarovsk Territory, as well as those of the Arkharinskiy, Ivanovskiy, and Oktyabrskiy districts in the Amur Region (Russian Far East), were obtained and processed. The identifiable classes were soybean and oat crops, as well as fallow land. Classification was carried out using the Support Vector Machines, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The training (848 ha) and test (364 ha) samples were located in Khabarovskiy District. The best overall accuracy on the test set (82.0%) was achieved using RF. Classification accuracy at the field level was 79%. When using the QDA classifier on cropland in the Amur Region (2324 ha), the overall classification accuracy was 83.1% (F1 was 0.86 for soybean, 0.84 for fallow, and 0.79 for oat). Application of the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and VV/VH ratio enabled an overall classification accuracy in the Amur region of 74.9% and 74.6%, respectively. Thus, using DpRVI allowed us to achieve greater performance compared to other SAR data, and it can be used to identify crops in the south of the Far East and serve as the basis for the automatic classification of cropland.

TI  - ENSO effects in the southern Gulf of California estimated from satellite data
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the impact of ENSO events in the seasonal and interannual variability of the sea surface temperature (SST) and phytoplankton biomass (expressed as chlorophyll-a, Chl-a levels) obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products from June 2002 to December 2018, in two contrasting regions of the southern Gulf of California, the connection between the gulf and the Pacific Ocean, and the coastal region off Mazatl & PRIME;an. The generated dataset was compared with the El Nin & SIM;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices and a local wind-derived coastal upwelling index (CUI) computed in the coastal region off Mazatl & PRIME;an from the ERA5 monthly average wind. In this region, the results showed that the prevailing northwesterly winds reached 4 m s  1; however, southwesterly winds were observed during summer, mainly from June to August. The CUI showed values of up to 35 m3 s  1 per 100 m of coastline. The prevailing winds induce upwelling most of the year, with peaks in winter more intense during La Nin & SIM;a than during the El Nin & SIM;o event. Regarding SST and Chl-a levels, changes were observed with clear seasonal, semiannual, annual, and interannual variability, with 2.8 and 3.7 years of periodicities. In the coastal zone, seasonal values were maximum SST values (30-31 degrees C) during the summer and minimum values (20-22 degrees C) during the winter. The Chl-a levels showed an inverse trend, with minimum values (0.1-1.00 mg m  3) during summer and maximum values (>2 mg m  3) during winter. In the P1 site, in the connection between the gulf and the Pacific Ocean, the results showed during summer maximum SST values (29.5-31 degrees C) and minimum Chl-a (<0.2 mg m  3), while during winter minimum SST values (21-23 <degrees>C) and maximum Chl-a (0.3-2.0 mg m  3). Changes were also observed in both parameters owing to El Nin & SIM;o (high SST, low Chl-a levels) and La Nin & SIM;a (low SST, high Chl-a levels) conditions, which were confirmed by spectral and wavelet analyses. During the study period, La Nin & SIM;a conditions occurred during 2005/ 2006, 2007/2008, a multiyear event in 2010/2012, and 2017/2018, while El Nin & SIM;o conditions occurred during 2002/2003, 2006/2007, 2009/2010, and a multiyear event 2014/2016. Regarding their frequency, La Nin & SIM;a event occurred twice with a frequency corresponding to two years, and El Nin & SIM;o had a recurrence interval of between three and four years.

TI  - Coastal Erosion Caused by River Mouth Migration on a Cuspate Delta: An Example from Thanh Hoa, Vietnam
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion poses a significant threat to the infrastructure of the coastal community at the mouth of the Ma River in Thanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. In response, emergency solutions such as hard, protective structures are often implemented. However, this approach exacerbates the problem as the underlying mechanisms of coastal erosion are not adequately investigated and understood. In this study, the long-term configuration of the mouth of the Ma River in Thanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam, is investigated using Landsat imagery spanning from 1987 to 2023. An analytical solution of a one-line model for shoreline change was also used to examine the sand discharge from the Ma River and the diffusion coefficient for the sand transported along the shore by breaking waves. The results showed an asymmetric configuration of the mouth of the Ma River over the past 37 years. The supply of sand from the Ma River is around 350,000 m3/year. The majority of sand (ranging from 55% to 75%) is mainly transported to the northern beach of the Ma River delta. This uneven distribution of sand from the Ma River has led to the asymmetrical morphology of the delta apex in which the northern part of the Ma River delta is experiencing northward movement while the southern part of the Ma River Delta is moving southward and landward. The asymmetrical morphology of the delta at the mouth of the Ma River has recently been identified as the cause of severe coastal erosion. The diffusion coefficient value determined for the transportation of longshore sand along the deltaic lobes of the Ma River delta corresponds to 90 m2/day. This study offers a practical method for investigating morphological changes in cuspate deltas, especially when measured field data are limited.

T2  - SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nowadays, land use and land cover (LULC) change is a major problem for decision-makers and ecologists on account of its impact on natural ecosystems. In this manuscript, LU/LC change classification and prediction using deep convolutional spiking neural network (DCSNN) and enhanced Elman spike neural network (EESNN) (LU/LC-DCSNN-EESNN) is proposed. The input images are gathered from IRS Satellite Resourcesat-1 LISS-III with Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (DEM) satellite imagery of the Javadi Hills, Tamil Nadu. After that, the images are pre-processed using the fast discrete curvelet transform and wrapping (FDCT-WRP) method is used for extracting the region of interest (ROI) coordinates of Javadi Hills satellite image. Then, for categorizing the area of forest and non-forest, the DCSNN is used. The categorized images are given to post-classification process for eradicating the noise and misclassification errors by Markov chain random field (MCRF) co-simulation approach. The LU/LC changes are predicted using EESNN method. The performance metrics, like precision, accuracy, f1 score, error rate, specificity, recall, kappa coefficient and ROC, are analyzed. The proposed LU/LC-DCSNN-EESNN method has attained 19.45%, 20.56% and 23.67% higher accuracy, 19.45%, 32.56% and 17.45% higher F-measure, and 16.78%, 22.09% and 32.39% lower error rate compared with the existing methods.

TI  - Light Absorption by Optically Active Components in the Arctic Region (August 2020) and the Possibility of Application to Satellite Products for Water Quality Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2020, during the 80th cruise of the R/V "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh", the chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) and spectral coefficients of light absorption by phytoplankton pigments, non-algal particles (NAP) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured in the Norwegian Sea, the Barents Sea and the adjacent area of the Arctic Ocean. It was shown that the spatial distribution of the three light-absorbing components in the explored Arctic region was non-homogenous. It was revealed that CDOM contributed largely to the total non-water light absorption (a(tot)(?) = a(ph)(?) + a(NAP)(?) + a(CDOM)(?)) in the blue spectral range in the Arctic Ocean and the Barents Sea. The fraction of NAP in the total non-water absorption was low (less than 20%). The depth of the euphotic zone depended on atot(?) in the surface water layer, which was described by a power equation. The Arctic Ocean, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea did not differ in the Chl-a-specific light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton. In the blue maximum of phytoplankton absorption spectra, Chl-a-specific light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton in the upper mixed layer (UML) were higher than those below the UML. Relationships between phytoplankton absorption coefficients and Chl-a were derived by least squares fitting to power functions for the whole visible domain with a 1 nm interval. The OCI, OC3 and GIOP algorithms were validated using a database of co-located results (day-to-day) of in situ measurements (n = 63) and the ocean color scanner data: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites, the Visible and Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and JPSS-1 satellites (also known as NOAA-20), and the Ocean and the Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites. The comparison showed that despite the technological progress in optical scanners and the algorithms refinement, the considered standard products (chlor_a, chl_ocx, aph_443, adg_443) carried little information about inherent optical properties in Arctic waters. Based on the statistic metrics (Bias, MdAD, MAE and RMSE), it was concluded that refinement of the algorithm for retrieval of water bio-optical properties based on remote sensing data was required for the Arctic region.

TI  - A review on advancements in lithological mapping utilizing machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Review
AB  - Lithological mapping is a fundamental undertaking in geological research, mineral resource exploration, and environmental management. However, conventional methods for lithological mapping are often laborious and challenging, particularly in remote or inaccessible areas. Fortunately, a transformative solution has emerged through the integration of remote sensing and machine learning algorithms, providing an efficient and accurate means of deciphering the geological features of the Earth's crust. Remote sensing offers vast and comprehensive data across extensive geographical regions, while machine learning algorithms excel at recognizing intricate patterns and features in the data, enabling the classification of different lithological units. Compared to traditional methods, this approach is faster, more efficient, and remarkably accurate. The combination of remote sensing and machine learning presents numerous advantages, including the ability to amalgamate multiple data sources, provide up-to-date information on rapidly changing regions, and manage vast volumes of data. This review article delves into the invaluable contributions of remote sensing and machine learning algorithms to lithological mapping. It extensively explores diverse remote sensing datasets, such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, ASTER, and Hyperion data, which can be effectively harnessed for this purpose. Additionally, the study investigates a range of machine learning algorithms, including SVM, RF, and ANN, specifically tailored for lithological mapping. By scrutinizing practical use cases, the review underscores the strengths, limitations, and potential future developments of remote sensing and machine learning algorithms in the context of lithological mapping. Practical use cases have demonstrated the immense potential of machine learning algorithms, with the SVM classifier emerging as a reliable and accurate option for lithological mapping. Moreover, the choice of the most appropriate data source depends on the specific objectives of the application.Overall, the transformative potential of remote sensing and machine learning in lithological mapping cannot be overstated. This integrated approach not only enhances our understanding of geological features but also enables diverse applications in geological research and environmental management. With the promise of a more informed and sustainable future, the utilization of remote sensing and machine learning in lithological mapping represents a pivotal advancement in the field of geological sciences.

TI  - Multiscale hydrodynamics modeling reveals the temperature moderating role of the Northern Red Sea Islands
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing interest in the hydrodynamics of the Red Sea has been observed since the beginning of the 21st century. However, the interaction between the Gulf of Suez (GOS) and the Red Sea along with possible natural mitigation mechanisms of heat stress on its southern coral reef zones have not been adequately investigated. This study evaluated different Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations of the Red Sea using a nesting approach in the southern parts of the GOS to elucidate the three-dimensional nature of thermal variability. The developed regional ROMS model simulated the general circulation patterns and sea surface temperature on the TSUBAME 3.0 supercomputer operated by the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Ultimately, remotely sensed satellite data of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) spanning the period 2016-2020 were used to validate the regional model results. A further challenge posed by the scarcity of distributed depth-varying temperature data on the northern islands' region was overcome by using an offline nesting approach (i.e., incorporating boundary conditions from the parent domain) to simulate the local 3-D thermal regimes. Intriguingly, the results of the nested model scenarios confirmed unique northern islands-enhanced thermal moderating mechanisms where islands act as barriers to the impacts of the relatively warmer water originating from the eastern boundary current. Additionally, this study introduces a new approach to applying higher-resolution models to the precise spatial and temporal representation of thermal indices in a way that surpasses the widely adopted remote sensing approaches. In short, multiscale modeling provides a valuable approach for assessing the thermal regimes around one of the most precious marine ecosystems in the world.

TI  - Continuity of Global MODIS Terrestrial Primary Productivity Estimates in the VIIRS Era Using Model-Data Fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Terra and Aqua satellites have been successfully operating for over two decades, exceeding their original design life. However, the era of NASA's Earth Observing System may be coming to a close as early as 2023. Similarities between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), aboard Aqua and Terra, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors aboard the Suomi NPP, NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 satellites enable potential continuity of long-term earth observational records in the VIIRS era. We conducted a comprehensive calibration and validation of the MODIS MOD17 product, which provided the first global, continuous, weekly estimates of ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) and annual estimates of net primary productivity (NPP). Using Bayesian model-data fusion, we combined 18 years of tower fluxes with prior data on plant traits and hundreds of field measurements of NPP to benchmark MOD17 and to develop the first terrestrial productivity estimates from VIIRS. The updated mean global GPP (NPP) flux from the future MOD17 Collection 7 product and new VNP17 product for 2012-2018 is 127 & PLUSMN; 2.8 Pg C year-1 (58 & PLUSMN; 1.1 Pg C year-1), which compares well with independent top-down and bottom-up estimates. MOD17 and VNP17 depict upward productivity trends over recent decades, with 2000-2018 MOD17 GPP (NPP) rising by 0.47 (0.25) Pg C year-2 but slowing to 0.35-0.44 (0.11-0.13) Pg C year-2 over 2012-2021, with a greater reduction in the NPP growth rate. The new VIIRS VNP17 product has the potential to extend these estimates of global, terrestrial primary productivity beyond 2030.The NASA Terra and Aqua satellites have been successfully operating for over two decades, far longer than their original 5-year design life. However, both satellites may be unable to maintain their original orbits as early as 2023. These satellites carry the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors, which are very similar to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors aboard newer satellites. The long record of MODIS data collected so far may therefore be extended by the VIIRS sensors, particularly the global estimates of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere taken up and stored by plants. We used multiple independent data sets to figure out if and how the MODIS MOD17 computer model should be changed to improve its accuracy and to use data from VIIRS. The new VIIRS VNP17 data could extend our record of plant-atmosphere carbon exchange beyond the year 2030.Over two decades of global productivity estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cannot be continued without use of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) dataWe performed a comprehensive calibration and validation, and sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of MODIS MOD17 and new VIIRS VNP17Both MOD17 and new VNP17 depict upward productivity trends and mean and interannual variability consistent with independent data

TI  - Combining Field Observations and Remote Sensing to Forecast Fine Fuel Loads
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective wildfire management requires accurate information about the spatial distribution of fuels. While static maps work well for coarse forest fuels with slow turnover, fine fuels-the driver of rangeland fires- often vary dramatically from year to year. Our goal was to develop a fine fuel forecast to help managers optimally allocate fire suppression resources and funding before the start of the fire season and to identify critical gaps in understanding or data that limit forecast skill. We compiled a historical record of fine fuel loads collected in the Great Basin and combined it with remotely sensed data on herbaceous productivity. Using a Bayesian State-Space approach to account for both process and observation error, we built a "Fuels Model" in which the predicted fuel load at a location depends on the fuel load in the previous year and productivity of the current year. Next, we built a "productivity model" to predict current year production based on remotely sensed data available in early spring. Finally, we combined these two models to generate early spring forecasts for summer fuel loads from 1987 to 2020 and quantified the associated uncertainty. We found that current year productivity contributed twice as much as the previous year's fuel load to the current fuel load. Our productivity predictions reduced mean absolute predictive error by 11% compared with a strong null model without early-season weather covariates. However, when we fed the productivity predictions into our fuel model, the resulting fuel load forecasts had too much uncertainty to inform management decisions, with most uncertainty coming from the process error of the Fuels Model. Reducing this uncertainty will require higher-quality observations of fuel loads. Until those are available, our results suggest that managers could rely on productivity forecasts as a reasonable proxy for fuel load forecasts.(c) 2023 The Society for Range Management.

TI  - Propagation in the Drought Cascade: Observational Analysis Over the Continental US
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent deficits in meteorological, hydrological and ecological variables define different types of drought that are often linked together in a cascade. The drought cascade is an emergent phenomenon in the climatic system. A quantitative evaluation of the drought cascade based on observations is both a rigorous test of how different components of numerical Earth System models interact with one-another and a useful tool for practitioners concerned with drought impacts on water resource and ecosystem services. In this study the drought cascade is characterized over the continental US using remote sensing data and in situ observations. Remote sensing fields of coincident vegetation photosynthesis and above-ground biomass anomalies are introduced into the cascade to assess the role of the terrestrial biosphere within the cascade. The propagation of the diverse drought types, in terms of amplitude-dampening and phase-delays, are quantified. It is shown that woody and herbaceous vegetation have contrasting responses to prolonged soil moisture deficit that is traceable to access and storage of water as well as the dual effects of water- and light-limitation. The observations also show that prolonged precipitation deficit in itself is not adequate to trigger the intense soil moisture and vegetation stress responses and that excessive atmospheric evaporative demand needs to be coincident with the precipitation anomalies.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy and immediate two-stage implant-based breast reconstruction: A propensity score-matched analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are important differences between patients requiring sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and those who do not require axillary surgery at the time of breast reconstruction. We aimed to perform a propensity score-matched analysis to evaluate the impact of SLNB at the time of immediate implant-based breast reconstruction (IBBR) with tissue expanders compared with IBBR alone.Methods: Consecutive female patients undergoing total mastectomy and immediate two-stage IBBR between January 2011 and May 2021 were included. A 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching method without replacement was implemented with a caliper width of 0.01. Patients were matched for age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, premastectomy radiotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the plane of prosthesis placement, mastectomy specimen weight, number of drains, and radiation of the expander.Results: We included 320 two-stage immediate IBBRs after propensity score matching, 160 reconstructions per group. Relevant surgical variables were comparable between groups. A higher rate of 30-day seroma formation was reported in immediate reconstructions that had SLNB at the time of mastectomy compared with reconstructions that did not have axillary surgery (16.3% versus 8.1%, p = 0.039). The time to complete outpatient expansions and time for expander-to-implant exchange were comparable between patients who underwent IBBRs with SLNB and those who did not.Conclusion: SLNB performed at the time of mastectomy and IBBR with tissue expander in- creased the risk of seroma formation compared with reconstructions that did not have axillary surgery. The rate of infection, hematoma, and unplanned procedures to manage complications did not differ between groups.& COPY; 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

TI  - Circulating miRNA Expression Is Inversely Correlated with Tumor Tissue or Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with the various steps of the metastatic process. In addition, circulating miRNAs are remarkably stable in peripheral blood, making them ideal noninvasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Here, we performed a proof-of-principle study to determine whether tumor-tissue-derived miRNAs are traceable to plasma in ER-positive early breast cancer patients. We performed RNA-sequencing on 30 patients for whom plasma, sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and tumor tissue were available. We carried out differential expression, gene ontology and enrichment analyses. Our results show that circulating miRNAs are inversely expressed compared with tumor tissue or SLNs obtained from the same patients. Our differential expression analysis shows the overall downregulation of circulating miRNAs. However, the expression of miR-643a-3p and miR-223 was up-regulated in patients with positive SLNs. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis showed the significant enrichment of biological processes associated with the regulation of epithelial cell proliferation and transcriptional regulation commonly involved in the promotion of metastases. Our results suggest the potential role of several circulating miRNAs as surrogate markers of lymph node metastases in early breast cancer patients. Further preclinical and clinical studies are required to understand the biological significance of the most significant miRNAs and to validate our results in a larger cohort of patients.

TI  - Interpretation Center for the Revaluation of Flora and Fauna in Cusco, Perú
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research is to propose an architectural design for an Interpretation Center aimed at the revaluation of the flora and fauna of Cusco, Peru, in 2023. Due to the lack of awareness spaces, deforestation, water pollution, and the planting of introduced species in the area, there is a loss of endemic flora and fauna. The methodologies used in this study included climatic analysis of the location, characterization of the flora and fauna, and the application of bioclimatic design strategies supported by the use of software (AutoCAD, Revit, and 3D Sun-path). Additionally, urban design strategies were employed based on the Inca worldview and the Sustainable Development Goals. The feasibility of implementing this urban and architectural proposal was compared with other projects such as the Sydney Water Restoration Project and the Ataria Nature Interpretation Center. As a result, an ecological network was designed for the preservation of endemic species. The project also includes green spaces, which account for 51% of the total area. These green spaces will facilitate carbon dioxide absorption and contribute to the revaluation of the Huantanay River and the creation of microclimates in the area.

TI  - Unsupervised machine learning detection of iceberg populations within sea ice from dual-polarisation SAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of iceberg populations is essential to inform estimates of Southern Ocean freshwater and heat balances as well as shipping hazards. The automated operational monitoring of icebergs remains challenging, largely due to a lack of generality in existing approaches. Previous efforts to map icebergs have often exploited synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data but the majority are designed for open water situations, require significant operator input, and are susceptible to the substantial spatial and temporal variability in backscatter that characterises SAR time-series. We propose an adaptive unsupervised classification procedure based on Sentinel 1 SAR data and a recursive Dirichlet Process implementation of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach is robust to inter-scene variability and can identify icebergs even within complex environments containing mixtures of open water, sea ice and icebergs of various sizes. For the study area in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, close to the calving front of Thwaites Glacier, our classifier achieved a mean pixel-wise F1 score against manual iceberg delineations from the SAR scenes of 0.960 & PLUSMN; 0.018 with a corresponding object-level F1 score of 0.729 & PLUSMN; 0.086. The method provides an excellent basis for estimation of total near-shore iceberg populations and has inherent potential for scalability that other approaches lack.

TI  - Remote Sensing, Petrological and Geochemical Data for Lithological Mapping in Wadi Kid, Southeast Sinai, Egypt
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wadi Samra-Wadi Kid district in southeastern Sinai, Egypt, has undergone extensive investigation involving remote sensing analysis, field geology studies, petrography, and geochemistry. The main aim of this study is the integration between remote sensing applications, fieldwork, and laboratory studies for accurate lithological mapping for future mineral exploration in the study region. The field relationships between these coincident rocks were studied in the study area. Landsat-8 (OLI) data that cover the investigated area were used in this paper. The different rock units in the study area were studied petrographically using a polarizing microscope, in addition to major and trace analysis using ICP-OES tools. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used with several processing methods, such as false color composite (FCC), band ratio (BR), principal component analysis (PCA), and minimum noise fraction (MNF) techniques for detecting the different types of rock units in the Wadi Kid district. This district mainly consists of a volcano-sedimentary sequence as well as diorite, gabbro, granite, and albitite. Geochemically, the metasediments are classified as pelitic graywackes derived from sedimentary origin (i.e., shales). The Al2O3 and CaO contents are medium-high, while the Fe2O3 and TiO2 contents are very low. Alkaline minerals are relatively low-medium in content. All of the metasediment samples are characterized by high MgO contents and low SiO2, Fe2O3, and CaO contents. The granitic rocks appear to have alkaline and subalkaline affinity, while the subalkaline granites are high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonite series. The alkaline rocks are classified as albitite, while the calc-alkaline series samples vary from monzodiorites to granites. The outcomes of this study can be used for prospecting metallic and industrial mineral exploration in the Wadi Kid district.

TI  - Assessment of soil erosion risk using RUSLE model, SATEEC system, remote sensing, and GIS techniques: a case study of Navroud watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a major environmental threat to soil health, natural resources, and sustainable agriculture. Appropriate knowledge of dynamic factors affecting soil erosion is crucial for effective decision-making in watershed management and soil conservation practice. The present study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of annual soil loss (SL) and sediment yield (SY) in the Navroud watershed from the years 2000 to 2018 using remotely-sensed data, GIS-integrated RUSLE Model, and the GIS-based SATEEEC model. For this purpose, models' factors including rainfall erosivity factor (R), crop management factor (C), soil erodibility factor (K), and topographic factor (LS) were prepared. In addition, to boost the performance of the models, the R factor was modified by applying the effect of the snowmelt-runoff erosivity factor (SR). Long-term suspended sediment load records were used to validate the models' results at the outlet of the watershed. RUSLE model showed that mean annual SL rates in the Navroud basin ranged from 0 to over 100 ton ha(-1) year(-1) with average values of 5.39 and 14.95 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and total rainfall-runoff erosivity (TR) factor as the sum of R and SR factors, respectively. However, for the SATEEC model, SL ranged from 0 to 144 and 0 to 461 with slightly higher average values of 6.2, and 16.76 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and TR factor, respectively. In general, the performance of the RUSLE and SATEEC models was low (R-2 = 0.39-0.44, NSE = - 0.05, 0.15) when the R factor was used as the only erosive factor in simulating SL. However, a notably better estimation of SL and SY was observed when the TR factor was used instead of the R factor (R-2 = 0.77-0.75, NSE = 0.33-0.36). It can be concluded that RUSLE showed slightly better results than SATEEC in the Navroud watershed, and also the use of the SR factor in calculating the erosive factor has led to a notable improvement in the models' simulation. In conclusion, these findings highlight not only the need to consider the SR factor in the models' simulation, especially in mountainous regions but these results can also assist in the implementation of effective conservation practices to reduce soil erosion risk in the Navroud watershed.

TI  - Satellite Data Reveal Concerns Regarding Mangrove Restoration Efforts in Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration projects are often evaluated based on the increase in mangrove forest (MF) area, but the reliability of this indicator as a measure of successful restoration is questionable. Considering both numerical and quality dimensions, this study assessed mangrove restoration efforts in the Leizhou Peninsula and Beibu Gulf (LP-BG) in China. The hypothesis was that due to the limited social capital investment in mangrove restoration, there exist hierarchical differences in the urgency of mangrove restoration. Time-series Landsat imagery from the Google Earth Engine platform was used to analyze the MF distribution from 2000 to 2020. A resilience indicator, incorporating resistance and adaptive capacity, was constructed to assess MF quality within identified mangrove boundaries. The results revealed an increase in MF area from 6655.87 ha in 2000 to 14,607.93 ha in 2020. However, the majority (79.6%) of MF patches exhibited low resilience (values < 3), with only a minority (51 patches) demonstrating high resilience. Interestingly, MFs within the mangrove reserve displayed higher resilience, but these areas did not exhibit a significant spatial expansion of MFs. These findings highlight the limitation of relying solely on the net growth in the MF area as an indicator of successful restoration. Instead, an ecologically optimal solution is recommended, focusing on expanding conservation boundaries to include remnant MFs outside protected areas, rather than creating new planting areas. This study provides an assessment framework to evaluate the efficiency of mangrove restoration efforts and offers insights for local decision makers to guide future restoration endeavors.

TI  - Land Cover Classification of Remote Sensing Images Based on Hierarchical Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have gained improved results in remote sensing image data classification. Multispectral image classification can benefit from the rich spectral information extracted by these models for land cover classification. This paper proposes a classification model called a hierarchical convolutional recurrent neural network (HCRNN) to combine the CNN and RNN modules for pixel-level classification of multispectral remote sensing images. In the HCRNN model, the original 13-band information from Sentinel-2 is transformed into a 1D multispectral sequence using a fully connected layer. It is then reshaped into a 3D multispectral feature matrix. The 2D-CNN features are extracted and used as inputs to the corresponding hierarchical RNN. The feature information at each level is adapted to the same convolution size. This network structure fully leverages the advantages of CNNs and RNNs to extract temporal and spatial features from the spectral data, leading to high-precision pixel-level multispectral remote sensing image classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall accuracy of the HCRNN model on the Sentinel-2 dataset reaches 97.62%, which improves the performance by 1.78% compared to the RNN model. Furthermore, this study focused on the changes in forest cover in the study area of Laibin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which was 7997.1016 km2, 8990.4149 km2, and 8103.0020 km2 in 2017, 2019, and 2021, respectively, with an overall trend of a small increase in the area covered.

TI  - Environmental Characteristics of High Ice-Content Permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost areas are sensitive to climate change and have a significant impact on energy and water cycles. Ground ice is a crucial component on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Understanding the environmental characteristics of ground ice is vital for accurately modeling its distribution and evolution. In this study, we analyzed 15 environmental characteristics of high ice-content permafrost sites. These attributes were extracted from 400 high ice-content permafrost datasets including 300 drilling boreholes and 100 thaw slumps collected throughout the entire plateau using large-scale remote sensing data and their products. The results are as follows: The mean annual air temperature in areas where high ice-content permafrost exists ranges from -5 to -3.5 & DEG;C, with an average warming rate of 0.08 & DEG;C/a. Additionally, there was an average increase in precipitation of about 25 mm/10a and an increase in soil moisture of about 4%/10a. Geomorphology strongly influences the occurrence of high ice content permafrost, with 85% of high ice-content permafrost development at altitudes between 4400 and 5100 m. Approximately 86% of high ice-content permafrost were developed in lowland or relatively flat areas, preferably in gently sloping and shady slope regions. Soils exhibit less variability in clay particles and more variability in silt and sand. Key indicators in the high ice content permafrost region include warming rate, active layer thickness, elevation, bulk density, soil thickness, clay content, precipitation, soil moisture, and NDVI. High ice-content permafrost is the result of a combination of environmental factors and is expected to undergo significant changes in the future. This study provides a foundation for comprehending the environmental changes in the high ice-content permafrost areas and modeling the distribution of ground ice. It underscores the urgent need to address the significant environmental changes faced by high ice-content permafrost regions.

TI  - Design and Sensing Performance of T-Shaped Quartz Tuning Forks
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In recent years, harmful gases in the atmosphere have gradually become an important issue of concern for people. Gas sensing technology can perform highly sensitive monitoring of trace gas concentrations, obtaining information on the composition, knowing the concentration changes of gases, and understanding the distribution changes of gases. Quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) technology based on quartz tuning fork detection has the advantages of simple structure, low cost, and strong anti-noise ability, which is a hot spot in the field of gas sensing. In common QEPAS technology, commercial quartz tuning forks are generally used with a resonance frequency of 32. 768 kHz, but the performance of QEPAS systems is limited due to high resonance frequency, short energy accumulation time, and small interfinger spacing.Methods In this paper, the finite element analysis method is used to simulate the stress and charge distribution of quartz tuning forks. A T-shaped quartz tuning fork is designed, and the resonance frequency of the T- shaped quartz tuning fork is 8930. 93 Hz, with a Q value of 11164 and a cross interfinger spacing of 1. 73 mm. In the experimental verification phase, by using water vapor in the atmosphere as the measurement object, the QEPAS water vapor detection system is built. Under the same conditions, we test two types of quartz tuning forks. One is a commercial quartz tuning fork, and the other is a T- shaped quartz tuning fork. A comparison of experimental results between these two quartz tuning forks is performed to verify their detection performance.Results and Discussions The T-shaped quartz tuning fork has a length of 9. 4 mm, a width of 1. 2 mm, and a thickness of 0. 25 mm (Table 1). By using the optical excitation method, firstly, the performance of commercial quartz tuning forks and T-shaped quartz tuning forks is tested separately, so as to obtain the resonance frequency curves of two types of quartz tuning forks. The resonance frequency f(0) of a commercial quartz tuning fork is 32767. 76 Hz, and the quality factor is 9128. f(0) of the T-shaped quartz tuning fork is 8930. 93 Hz, and the quality factor is 11164. The resonance frequency of the T-shaped quartz tuning fork is reduced by 73%, and the quality factor is improved by 22% compared with the widely used commercial quartz tuning fork (Fig. 4). The signal level of the QEPAS system is related to the laser incidence position. The optimal laser incidence position for commercial quartz tuning forks is 0. 7 mm from the top, and the optimal laser incidence position for T- shaped quartz tuning forks is 1. 6 mm from the top (Fig. 6). The amplitude of the 2f signal using a commercial quartz tuning fork is 16. 44 mu V, and the noise level and the signal-to- noise ratio are 58. 86 nV and 279. 31, respectively. The amplitude of the 2f signal measured using a T-shaped quartz tuning fork is 25. 37 mu V, and the noise level and the signal-to-noise ratio are 56. 54 nV and 448. 71, respectively. Compared with commercial quartz tuning forks, the signal amplitude detected by T-shaped quartz tuning forks has increased by 54. 32%, and the signal-to-noise ratio has increased by 60. 65% (Fig. 7).Conclusions The commercial quartz tuning forks widely used in QEPAS technology currently have certain limitations. For example, the high resonance frequency makes the system unable to detect gases with low molecular relaxation rates, short energy accumulation time leads to weak collection ability of acoustic signals, and small interdigital spacing is not conducive to coupling transmission of laser beams and reducing system noise. We use finite element analysis to simulate a T-shaped quartz tuning fork with low resonance frequency, high Q value, and large interdigital gap. After actual measurement, the resonance frequency of this T-shaped quartz tuning fork is 8930. 93 Hz with a Q value of 11164 and interdigital spacing of 1. 73 mm. Compared with the widely used commercial quartz tuning fork, the resonance frequency of the T-shaped quartz tuning fork is reduced by 73%, and the quality factor is increased by 22%. Finally, this quartz tuning fork is applied to the near-infrared QEPAS water vapor detection system to further verify its sensing performance. Compared with commercial quartz tuning forks, the signal-to-noise ratio of the water vapor QEPAS system based on the T-shaped quartz tuning fork has increased by 60. 65%, proving the superiority of the sensing performance of this quartz tuning fork. However, the equivalent resistance value of this quartz tuning fork is still too high, which has an impact on the overall detection performance. Further optimization will be carried out to reduce the equivalent resistance value and further improve the sensing performance of the system.

TI  - Eco-Environmental Quality Assessment Using the Remote Sensing Ecological Index in Suzhou City, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilizes four environmental indicators derived from six-phase Landsat images (TM, OLI, and TIRS) to construct a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and to quantitatively and comprehensively assess the spatiotemporal changes in the eco-environmental quality (EEQ) of Suzhou City, China. The environmental indicators consist of the wetness index (WI), greenness index (GI), dryness index (DI), and heat index (HI). The obtained results showed: (1) positive effects of the WI and GI, as well as negative effects of the DI and HI, on the EEQ of Suzhou City in the 2002-2022 period. The GI was observed to have the greatest impact on the RSEI of Suzhou City. (2) The average RSEI values of Suzhou City exhibit a "W" shape pattern in the 2002-2022 period. The lowest and highest average RSEI values were 0.632 and 0.746, respectively, while the average annual RSEI value was 0.702. The EEQ of Suzhou City was observed to be at a relatively good level. (3) The EEQ of Suzhou City exhibits sharp declines in the periods of 2006-2010 and 2014-2018, for which the degraded RSEI area covers 440.60 and 404.16 km2, while the area ratios are 56.13% and 51.48%, respectively. The EEQ of Suzhou City has substantially increased during the periods of 2010-2014, 2018-2022, and 2002-2022, showing improved RSEI areas of 583.7, 390.13, and 347.02 km2 and area ratios of 74.36%, 49.70%, and 44.21%, respectively. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for the protection, utilization, and development of the ecological environment (EE) of Suzhou City. They also provide valuable references and data support for the sustainable development, the high-quality development of the EE, and the construction of the ecological civilization of Suzhou City. The policymakers of environmental protection departments in Suzhou City can use this study's inferences to devise local environmental protection policies.

TI  - Improving Runoff Prediction Accuracy in a Mountainous Watershed Using a Remote Sensing-Based Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limited number and sparse distribution of meteorological and hydrometric stations in most watersheds, the runoff estimation based on these stations may not be accurate. However, the accurate determination of the Antecedent Soil Moisture (ASM) in watersheds can improve the accuracy of runoff forecasting. The objective of this study is to utilize the ASM derived from satellite imagery to enhance the accuracy of runoff estimation in a mountainous watershed. In this study, a range of Remote Sensing (RS) data, including surface biophysical and topographic features, climate data, hydrometric station flow data, and a ground-based measured SM database for the Balikhli-Chay watershed in Iran, were utilized. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method was employed to estimate runoff. Two approaches were used for estimating the ASM: (1) using the precipitation data recorded in ground stations, and (2) using the SM data obtained from satellite images. The accuracy of runoff estimation was then calculated for these two scenarios and compared. The mean Nash-Sutcliffe statistic was found to be 0.63 in the first scenario and 0.74 in the second scenario. The inclusion of ASM derived from the satellite imagery in the precipitation-runoff model resulted in a 51% increase in the accuracy of runoff estimation compared to using precipitation data recorded in ground stations. These findings have significant implications for improving the accuracy of ASM and runoff modeling in various applications.

TI  - Transport of the Tumen River water to the Far Eastern Marine Reserve (Posyet Bay) based on in situ, satellite data and Lagrangian modeling using ROMS current velocity output.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We study physical mechanisms of the Tumen River water transport in the area of the Posyet Bay (Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan). This study is based on the satellite and in situ measurements, and numerical simulation of advection of river water by the current velocity simulated by Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS). The importance of this study is in identification of the reasons of the transport of pollutants into the area of the Far Eastern Marine Reserve. The results of the study showed that such reasons are wind currents and mesoscale cyclonic eddies. These eddies were originally detected on satellite imagery and CTD and bio-optical measurements. The anomalies in the form of spots of the chlorophyll a (CHL) increased concentration were detected on satellite images in fall 2009. The oceanographic sections of CTD and bio-optical measurements through the anomalies show that they are cyclonic eddies. These eddies consist of two cores - upper and lower. The upper core is filled with river waters with low salinity, high values of CHL and colored dissolved organic matter content (CDOM). The lower core is filled with cold saline waters. The ROMS results show that eddies are generated as a result of symmetrical and centrifugal instabilities.

TI  - Estimation of Potato Above-Ground Biomass Based on VGC-AGB Model and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Potato is an important food crop after rice, wheat, and corn, and its optimal cultivation and production are essential to ensure food security. Crop above-ground biomass (AGB) is widely considered to be closely related to crop growth status and is often directly involved in crop yield prediction and health status parameter assessment. Existing studies show that the remote sensing vegetation index loses sensitivity to crop parameters at medium to high crop cover, i. e., the "saturation phenomenon", which limits accurate monitoring studies of AGB at mid to late crop growth. The main work of this study is to use a new vertically growing crop AGB model (VGC-AGB) combined with hyperspectral remote sensing for AGB estimation of potatoes at multiple growth stages. In response to the "saturation problem" of remote sensing spectral indices for crop biomass monitoring in multiple growth periods, VGC-AGB defined two parameters, leaf dry matter content (C-m) and vertical organ dry matter content (C-sm), to describe the average dry matter content of potatoes leaves and stems, respectively. The aboveground biomass of leaves (AGB1) was calculated by leaf area index (LAI) X C-m, and aboveground biomass of vertical organs (AGB) was calculated by the product of planting density (C-d) potato plant height (C-h) and Csm, i. e. C-d X C-h X C-sm. Based on the 2019 potato field experiment at the National Precision Agriculture Research Demonstration Base, ground-based ASD hyperspectral data, measured plant height, AGB, and LAI data were obtained for four critical growth periods of potato. Hyperspectral reflectance data were used to construct hyperspectral feature parameters and compare the performance of three potato AGB estimation models of (1) hyperspectral feature parameters + plant height, (2) ground-based measurement parameters + VGC-AGB model and (3) hyperspectral feature parameters+ VGC-AGB model, respectively. The results show that the new VGC-AGB model combined with hyperspectral remote sensing data can provide higher performance estimation results of potato AGB(1), AGB(v), and total AGB than the traditional AGB estimation method of hyperspectral remote sensing vegetation index + plant height, and the technique can provide technical support for rapid and nondestructive monitoring of potato AGB.

TI  - Prevalence of colistin-resistant <i>mcr-1-positive Escherichia col</i>i isolated from children patients with diarrhoea in Shanghai, 2016-2021
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The emergence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance 1 ( mcr-1 ) of Escherichia coli has become a global health concern. This study reports the prevalence of mcr-1 among E. coli isolates from patients with diarrheal disease in Shanghai and the genetic characterization of mcr-1 -harbouring plasmids. Methods: A total of 1723 E. coli strains were collected from the faeces of patients with diarrheal disease in all sentinel hospitals in Shanghai from 2016 to 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution and plasmid conjunction transfer assay was carried out using E. coli C600 as the recipient. The mcr-1 -positive E. coli strains (MCRPEC) were subjected to molecular characterization and bioinformatic analysis of the mcr-1 -bearing plasmids that they harboured. Results: Only 5 (0.28%) strains were found to harbour the mcr-1 gene using PCR screening. Plasmid conjugation assay and whole-genome sequencing indicated that EC16500, one MCRPEC strain that co-exhibited mcr-1, bla TEM-1 , bla OXA-1 , qnrS1, qnrS2, arr-3, and catB3 , could be conjugated to EC C600 by horizontal transfer with an average efficiency of 3.2 x 10 -5 . The plasmid pEC16500 harboured similar backbones as p70_2_15, pECGD-8-33, pNCYU-29-19-1_MCR1, and pIBMC_mcr1, and was shown to be encoded within a type IV secretion system (T4SS)-containing 32.6 kbp IncX4, next to the pap 2-like membrane-associated gene, to form a 2.4-kb cassette. Furthermore, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed a similarity between other MCR-1-homolog proteins, indicating that the five E. coli isolates were colistin-resistant. Conclusion: Our data represents a significant snapshot of colistin resistance mcr-1 genes and highlights the need to increase active surveillance, especially among children under five years of age, in Shanghai. Great effort needs to be taken to avoid further dissemination of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance among clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Differentiation Characteristics and Driving Factors of Urban Thermal Environment: A Case Study in Shaanxi Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and global warming have led to a series of ecological and health problems caused by the deterioration of urban thermal environment (UTE). Using a comprehensive analysis of meteorological and remote sensing data for Shaanxi Province, a model of urban thermal differentiation (UTD) was developed, and the spatio-temporal characteristics of UTE in different regions were analyzed. Using the Geo-explore model, natural and socio-economic factors were chosen to explain the spatio-temporal distribution changes in UTE. The results showed that the UTD and Geo-explore models can be used to estimate spatio-temporal differentiation characteristics and change patterns of UTE. This method can describe UTE's spatial distribution and change characteristics well, making it suitable for multiple-perspective evaluations. In Shaanxi Province, the spatio-temporal distribution of UTE shows a decreasing trend from south to north and east to west. After 2000, the UTD showed a relatively stable performance in the Southern, Central, and Northern regions. The atmospheric temperature (AT) varied greatly across regions due to different factors. UTE mitigation and improved urban design can be achieved using this method.

TI  - Calibrating Nighttime Satellite Imagery with Red Photometer Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The data retrieved from satellite imagery and ground-based photometers are the two main sources of information on light pollution and are thus the two main tools for tackling the problem of artificial light pollution at night (ALAN). While satellite data offer high spatial coverage, on the other hand, photometric data provide information with a higher degree of temporal resolution. Thus, studying the proper correlation between both sources will allow us to calibrate and integrate them to obtain data with both high temporal resolution and spatial coverage. For this purpose, more than 15,000 satellite measurements and 400,000 measurements from 72 photometers for the year 2022 were used. The photometers used were the Sky-Glow Wireless Autonomous Sensor (SG-WAS) and Telescope Encoder and Sky Sensor WIFI (TESS-W) types, located at different ground-based locations, mainly in Spain. These photometers have a spectral sensitivity closer to that of VIIRS than to the Sky Quality Meter (SQM). In this study, a good correlation of data from the Day-Night Band (DNB) from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with a red photometric network between 19.41 mag/arcsec2 and 21.12 mag/arcsec2 was obtained.

TI  - On the ability of dual-polarimetric SAR measurements to observe lava flows under different volcanic environments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we discuss the extra-value of polarimetric information in observing the lava flow. Dualpolarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements are processed using a polarimetric change detector that, instead of looking at the variation of the backscatter intensity between a pair of images collected before and after the event, looks at changes in the polarimetric scattering behavior. We demonstrate that the scattering changes detected by the proposed polarimetric approach well-correlate with the footprint of the lava flow provided by external sources. In addition, we also compare the performance of the polarimetric change detector with conventional single-polarization metrics showing that the former one always outperforms the incoherent single-polarization measurements. To further demonstrate the robustness of the polarimetric change detectors, we selected two test cases that refer to vulcanic eruptions calling for completely different environments. The first one, related to the Etna volcano, calls for a lava flow over a vegetation-free environment; the second one is related to the Nyiragongo volcano and calls for a lava flow in a vegetated environment. Experimental results show that the polarimetric change detectors automatically adapt to the changing environment outperforming the single-polarization detectors.

TI  - Changes in Snow Surface Albedo and Radiative Forcing in the Chilean Central Andes Measured by In Situ and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow-covered regions are the main source of reflection of incident shortwave radiation on the Earth's surface. The deposition of light-absorbing particles on these regions increases the capacity of snow to absorb radiation and decreases surface snow albedo, which intensifies the radiative forcing, leading to accelerated snowmelt and modifications of the hydrologic cycle. In this work, the changes in surface snow albedo and radiative forcing were investigated, induced by light-absorbing particles in the Upper Aconcagua River Basin (Chilean Central Andes) using remote sensing satellite data (MODIS), in situ spectral snow albedo measurements, and the incident shortwave radiation during the austral winter months (May to August) for the 2004-2016 period. To estimate the changes in snow albedo and radiative forcing, two spectral ranges were defined: (i) an enclosed range between 841 and 876 nm, which isolates the effects of black carbon, an important light-absorbing particle derived from anthropogenic activities, and (ii) a broadband range between 300 and 2500 nm. The results indicate that percent variations in snow albedo in the enclosed range are higher than in the broadband range, regardless of the total amount of radiation received, which may be attributed to the presence of light-absorbing particles, as these particles have a greater impact on surface snow albedo at wavelengths in the enclosed band than in the broadband band.

TI  - Seasonal and daily effects of the sea on the surface urban heat island intensity: A case study of cities in the Caspian Sea Plain
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explore the effect of the sea on the spatial and temporal changes in surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity. Therefore, 11 cities located along the Caspian Sea Plain were selected as the case studies. Firstly, the SUHI intensity of both coastal and non-coastal cities was calculated for different seasons and times of day and night. Finally, the effect of distance from the sea on the SUHI intensity was calculated by modeling the relationship between the SUHI intensity and a set of independent parameters such as urban surface biophysical properties, population density, and distance from the coastline. The results showed that by increasing the distance of cities from the sea, the daily SUHI intensity increased, while it reversed during the night. The RMSE values between the actual and simulated SUHI intensities based on population density and surface biophysical properties in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 0.9, 1.1, 0.5, and 0.3 degrees C, respectively. By factoring in the distance from the sea in the modeling, the RMSE values for different seasons were obtained at 0.7, 0.8, 0.3, and 0.2 degrees C, respectively. The results show that distance from the sea has a significant effect on UHI intensity.

TI  - Analysis of past and future urban growth on a regional scale using remote sensing and machine learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in the Porto Alegre Metropolitan Region (RMPA). A 30-year historical analysis using Landsat satellite imagery was made and used to develop LULC scenarios for the next 20 years using a Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) model through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These maps analyze the urban area's expansion over the years and project their potential development in the future. This research considered several critical factors influencing urban growth, including shaded relief, slope, distances from main roadways, railway stations, urban centers, and the state capital, Porto Alegre. These spatial variables were incorporated into the model's learning processes to generate future urbanization scenarios. The LULC historical maps precision showed excellent performance with a Kappa index greater than 88% for the studied years. The results indicate that the urbanization class witnessed an increase of 236.78 km2 between 1990 and 2020. Additionally, it was observed that the primary concentration of urbanized areas since 1990 has predominantly occurred around Porto Alegre and Canoas. Lastly, the future forecasts for LULC changes in 2030 and 2040 indicate that the urban area of the RMPA is projected to reach 1,137.48 km2 and 1,283.62 km2, respectively. In conclusion, based on the observed urban perimeter in 2020, future projections indicate that urban areas are expected to increase by more than 443.29 km2 by 2040. The combination of remote sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIS) enables the monitoring and modeling the metropolitan area expansion. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers to develop more informed and conscientious urban plans, as well as enhance management techniques for urban development.

TI  - Sampling Strategies in PRRS Elimination in Hungary: An Observational Study Involving Four Farrow-to-Finish Swine Herds
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (PRRS), a viral cause of morbidity and mortality, seriously affects the productivity of the swine industry. Although the economic losses due to PRRS can be controlled by vaccination, disease eradication is challenging that requires concerted efforts. Hungary initiated a national PRRS eradication program in the mid-2010s and achieved significant countrywide success in all herd types by the early 2020s. Farrow-to-finish herds are particularly challenging from the perspective of disease control and prevention due to the simultaneous rearing of pigs of different ages. In this study, we present data about different sampling strategies of large farrow-to-finish swine farms. We demonstrate that our sampling strategy, where it was systematically applied, was successful, and these successes should guide future efforts of PRRS elimination programs in other regions.Abstract PRRS elimination strategies often rely on depopulation-repopulation. However, this approach is accompanied by a long-term loss of production. With adequate control measures, such as well-designed immunization programs and technological changes along with prevalence-based laboratory testing, the virus-free status of the most vulnerable age groups in swine herds can be achieved. The most common reason for acquiring PRRSV at large farrow-to-finish swine farm units is that the previously settled fattening pigs serve as a source of infection for the newly reared PRRS-free animals. Following such unwanted events, PRRSV may persist in an affected establishment for several years. In this observational study, we selected four farrow-to-finish type swine herds. We implemented different laboratory testing protocols to find the most optimal solution for a successful PRRS elimination program. To aid our objectives, we used a DIVA PCR technique. The PRRS DIVA PCR assay is a fast, reliable method to identify sows shedding farm-specific PRRSV strain(s). As a result of elimination efforts at the sentinel pig herds, we found that reliable detection of wild-type PRRSV shedding among sows requires sampling at least three weaned piglets per litter. The strict adherence to this sampling protocol, the systematic use of laboratory methods that quickly detect the presence of wild virulent virus in the herd during the rearing period and the culling of DIVA PCR positive litters and their sows decreased the presence of the resident virus markedly. These procedures at Hungarian farrow-to-finish type farms successfully inhibited the wild-type PRRSV infection of different age groups. The results of this study demonstrate that applying this methodology together with strict biosecurity measures enabled us to reach PRRS-vaccinated-free status in large, farrow-to-finish herds within two years.

TI  - Long-term healthcare use after postoperative complications: an analysis of linked primary and secondary care routine data.
T2  - BJA open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Postoperative complications are associated with reduced long-term survival. We characterise healthcare use changes after sentinel postoperative complications.Methods: We linked primary and secondary care records of patients undergoing elective surgery at four East London hospitals (2012-7) with at least 90 days follow-up. Complication codes (wound infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, new stroke, and new myocardial infarction) recorded within 90 days of surgery were identified from primary or secondary care. Outcomes were change in healthcare contact days in the 2 yr before and after surgery, and 2 yr mortality. We report rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals and adjusted for baseline healthcare use and confounders using negative binomial regression.Results: We included 49 913 patients (median age 49 yr [inter-quartile range {IQR}: 34-64]), 27 958 (56.0%) were female. Amongst 3883 (7.8%) patients with complications (median age 58 [IQR: 43-72]), there were 18.4 days per year in contact with healthcare before surgery and 25.3 days after surgery (RaR: 1.38 [1.37-1.39]). Patients without complications (median age 48 [IQR: 33-63]) had 12.3 days per year in contact with healthcare before surgery and 14.0 days after surgery (RaR: 1.14 [1.14-1.15]). The adjusted incidence rate ratio of days in contact with healthcare associated with complications was 1.67 (1.49-1.87). More patients (391; 10.1%) with complications died within 2 yr than those without (1428; 3.1%).Conclusions: Patients with postoperative complications are older with greater healthcare use before surgery. However, their absolute and relative increases in healthcare use after surgery are greater than patients without complications.

TI  - Aggregating Sea Surface Hydrodynamic Forecasts From Multi-Models for European Seas
T2  - TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Maritime information services supporting European agencies such as the FRONTEX require European-wide forecast solutions. Following a consistent approach, regional and global forecasts of the sea surface conditions from Copernicus Marine Service and national met-ocean services are aggregated in space and time to provide a European-wide forecast service on a common grid for the assistance of Search and Rescue operations. The best regional oceanographic model solutions are selected in regional seas with seamless transition to the global products covering the Atlantic Ocean. The regional forecast models cover the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea and combine the North Sea - Baltic Sea at the Danish straits. Two global models have been added to cover the entire model domain, including the regional models. The aggregated product is required to have an update frequency of 4 times a day and a forecasting range of 7 days, which most of the regional models do not provide. Therefore, smooth transition in time, from the shorter time range, regional forecast models to the global model with longer forecast range are applied. The set of parameter required for Search and Rescue operations include sea surface temperature and currents, waves and winds. The current version of the aggregation method was developed for surface temperature and surface currents but it will be extended to waves in latter stages. The method relies on the calculation of aggregation weights for individual models. For sea surface temperature (SST), near real-time satellite data at clear-sky locations for the past days is used to determine the aggregation weights of individual forecast models. A more complicated method is to use a weighted multi-model ensemble (MME) approach based on best forecast features of individual models and possibly including near real time observations. The developed method explores how satellite observations can be used to assess spatially varying, near real time weights of different forecasts. The results showed that, although a MME based on multiple forecasts only may improve the forecast, if the forecasts are unbiased, it is essential to use observations in the MME approach so that proper weights from different models can be calculated and forecast bias can be corrected. It is also noted that, in some months, e.g., June in Baltic Sea, even SST was assimilated, the forecast still show quite high error. There are also visible difference between different Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) satellite products, e.g. OSTIA and regional SST products, which can lead different forecast quality if different SST observation products are assimilated.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations in Ozone Pollution and Sensitivity Characteristics in Hainan Island
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Base on ambient air quality data, meteorological observation data, and satellite remote sensing data, the temporal and spatial variations in ozone (O-3) pollution, the sensitivity of O-3, and its relationship with meteorological factors in Hainan Island were analyzed in this study. The results showed that the maximum daily 8-h moving mean (O-3-8h) in western and northern cities in Hainan Island was higher than that in the central, eastern, and southern cities. O-3-8h was the highest in 2015, and O-3-8h exceeding the standard proportion was the largest in 2019. In addition, O-3-8h was positively correlated with average temperature (P<0.1), sunshine duration (P<0.01), total solar radiation (P<0.01), atmospheric pressure, and average wind speed and was negatively correlated with precipitation (P<0.05) and relative humidity. The satellite remote sensing data showed that the tropospheric NO2 column concentration (NO2-OMI) and HCHO column concentration (HCHO-OMI) displayed opposite trends in Hainan Island from 2015 to 2020. Compared with those in 2015, NO2-OMI increased by 7.74% and HCHO-OMI decreased by 10.2% in 2020. Moreover, Hainan Island belongs to the NOx control area, and the FNR value exhibited a fluctuating downward trend in the past 6 years, with a trend coefficient and climatic trend rate of -0.514 and -0.123 a(-1), respectively. A strong correlation was observed between meteorological factors and the FNR value of Hainan Island.

TI  - Analysis of Mesoscale Eddy Merging in the Subtropical Northwest Pacific Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous in the ocean, yet our understanding of their evolutions, particularly eddy merging processes, remains enigmatic. In this study, the merging processes of two cyclonic-cyclonic and two anticyclonic-anticyclonic eddies are analyzed in the Subtropical Northwest Pacific using satellite remote sensing altimetry data. The results reveal that, as eddies approach each other, their contours become connected, leading to the formation of multi-core eddies. Simultaneously, the merging process prompts substantial exchanges of energy and vorticity, resulting in the dissipation of one eddy and the emergence of a more extensive merged eddy. Throughout the merging process, the eddy contours elongate upwards along the centerline (the line connecting eddy centers) and there are distinct changes in both the horizontal and vertical morphology of the eddies. Notably, after the merging, the eddies distinctly exhibit intensified signals of sea surface temperature and vertical temperature anomaly, an outcome of their transformative fusion. The findings of this study significantly enhance our understanding of mesoscale eddy dynamics, particularly in the intricate eddy merging process. However, it is important to note that, due to limitations in vertical observational data, this study does not provide a quantitative portrayal of the vertical mechanisms of eddy merging, which also underscores a pivotal avenue for future research in the field.

TI  - TCNet: A Transformer-CNN Hybrid Network for Marine Aquaculture Mapping from VHSR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise delineation of marine aquaculture areas is vital for the monitoring and protection of marine resources. However, due to the coexistence of diverse marine aquaculture areas and complex marine environments, it is still difficult to accurately delineate mariculture areas from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images. To solve such a problem, we built a novel Transformer-CNN hybrid Network, named TCNet, which combined the advantages of CNN for modeling local features and Transformer for capturing long-range dependencies. Specifically, the proposed TCNet first employed a CNN-based encoder to extract high-dimensional feature maps from input images. Then, a hierarchical lightweight Transformer module was proposed to extract the global semantic information. Finally, it employed a coarser-to-finer strategy to progressively recover and refine the classification results. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCNet in accurately delineating different types of mariculture areas, with an IoU value of 90.9%. Compared with other state-of-the-art CNN or Transformer-based methods, TCNet showed significant improvement both visually and quantitatively. Our methods make a significant contribution to the development of precision agricultural in coastal regions.

TI  - Quantitative Characterization of Coastal Cliff Retreat and Landslide Processes at Portonovo-Trave Cliffs (Conero, Ancona, Italy) Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of multiple data sources, including satellite imagery, aerial photography, and ground-based measurements, represents an important development in the study of landslide processes. The combination of different data sources can be very important in improving our understanding of geological phenomena, especially in cases of inaccessible areas. In this context, the study of coastal areas represents a real challenge for the research community, both for the inaccessibility of coastal slopes and for the numerous drivers that can control coastal processes (subaerial, marine, or endogenic). In this work, we present a case study of the Conero Regional Park (Northern Adriatic Sea, Ancona, Italy) cliff-top retreat, characterized by Neogenic soft rocks (flysch, molasse). In particular, the study is focused in the area between the beach of Portonovo and Trave (south of Ancona), which has been studied using aerial orthophoto acquired between 1978 and 2021, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photographs (and extracted photogrammetric model) surveyed in September 2021 and 2012 LiDAR data. Aerial orthophotos were analyzed through the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) tool Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to identify and estimate the top-cliff erosion. The results were supported by the analysis of wave data and rainfall from the correspondent period. It has been found that for the northernmost sector (Trave), in the examined period of 40 years, an erosion up to 40 m occurred. Furthermore, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Difference (DoD) between a 2012 Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and a UAV Digital Surface Model (DSM) was implemented to corroborate the DSAS results, revealing a good agreement between the retreat areas, identified by DSAS, and the section of coast characterized by a high value of DoD.

TI  - Advancing Agricultural Crop Recognition: The Application of LSTM Networks and Spatial Generalization in Satellite Data Analysis
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the challenge of accurate crop detection using satellite data, focusing on the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The research employs a "spatial generalization" approach, where a model trained on one geographic area is applied to another area with similar vegetation conditions during the growing season. LSTM networks, which are capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies, are used to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning techniques. The results indicate that LSTM networks, although more computationally expensive, provide a more accurate solution for crop recognition compared with other methods such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest algorithms. The accuracy of LSTM networks was found to be 93.7%, which is significantly higher than the other methods. Furthermore, the study showed a high correlation between the real and model areas of arable land occupied by different crops in the municipalities of the study area. The main conclusion of this research is that LSTM networks, combined with a spatial generalization approach, hold great promise for future agricultural applications, providing a more efficient and accurate tool for crop recognition, even in the face of limited training data and complex environmental variables.

TI  - Automated Mapping of Cropland Boundaries Using Deep Neural Networks
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately identifying the boundaries of agricultural land is critical to the effective management of its resources. This includes the determination of property and land rights, the prevention of non-agricultural activities on agricultural land, and the effective management of natural resources. There are various methods for accurate boundary detection, including traditional measurement methods and remote sensing, and the choice of the best method depends on specific objectives and conditions. This paper proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an efficient and effective tool for the automatic recognition of agricultural land boundaries. The objective of this research paper is to develop an automated method for the recognition of agricultural land boundaries using deep neural networks and Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The Buinsky district of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, which is known to be an agricultural region, was chosen for this study because of the importance of the accurate detection of its agricultural land boundaries. Linknet, a deep neural network architecture with skip connections between encoder and decoder, was used for semantic segmentation to extract arable land boundaries, and transfer learning using a pre-trained EfficientNetB3 model was used to improve performance. The Linknet + EfficientNetB3 combination for semantic segmentation achieved an accuracy of 86.3% and an f1 measure of 0.924 on the validation sample. The results showed a high degree of agreement between the predicted field boundaries and the expert-validated boundaries. According to the results, the advantages of the method include its speed, scalability, and ability to detect patterns outside the study area. It is planned to improve the method by using different neural network architectures and prior recognized land use classes.

TI  - Dust sources over the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the characteristics of crucial dust sources and changes in their emissions over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) over the 2000-2022 period using high-resolution dust aerosol optical depth data from the Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol measurements onboard Terra and Aqua platforms. The MODIS dust retrievals successfully unravel the hitherto-unexplored key dust source regions and spatial heterogeneity in dust emissions. Critically, MODIS-defined dust sources display a robust geomorphological signature. In Iraq, the Tigris and Euphrates River basins contain extensive dust sources; the Euphrates dust sources are stronger and more widespread. Localized dust sources are noticed over Syria. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the eastern province particularly facilitates extensive dust activity. Oman is the prominent dust source in the southern AP due to the presence of intruding sand dunes. Dust emissions in the Iraq and KSA regions exhibit a significant negative correlation with the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, a drought index, establishing that the local droughts enhance the dust emissions in these regions. The recent sustained droughts from 2008 to 2013 caused a remarkable escalation in the dust emissions in these regions through the modification of land surface conditions.

TI  - A New Approach for Ocean Surface Wind Speed Retrieval Using Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the capability to observe ocean surface winds with a high spatial resolution, even under extreme conditions. The purpose of this work was to develop a new method for wind speed retrieval with the combination of SAR dual-polarized signals. In this study, we collected 28 tropical cyclone imageries observed using the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization mode. These imageries were collocated with radiometer wind speed measurements and reanalysis of wind vector products. In the new method, the wind speed was set as the output. VV-polarized (vertical transmitting-vertical receiving polarized) normalized radar cross section (NRCS), incident angle, VH-polarized (vertical transmitting-horizontal receiving polarized) NRCS, and wind direction were set as the inputs. Based on different output combinations, wind retrieval models were developed with multiple linear regression (MLR). According to the validation and comparison, the proposed models performed better than the traditional piecewise VH-polarization geophysical model functions (GMFs). The impact of thermal noise on the retrieval of low wind speeds (<10 m/s) could be partially reduced. The input of wind direction is unnecessary if the combination of VV- and VH-polarized imageries has been utilized. These results suggest that the use of MLR and the dual-polarization combination can improve SAR wind retrieval accuracy. Compared with SMAP measurements, our SAR retrievals can provide fine structures of TC wind fields.

T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, and motivated by a substantial growth of the population, a considerable expansion of urban areas is taking place through the modification of land uses. These changes, together with global warming and extreme weather events, produce increases in the temperature of the earth's surface and a deterioration of the environment that affects people's quality of life. The green areas of cities are upheld as one of the best for adapting to such phenomena, since they help lower outdoor temperatures. In this research, using high-resolution Sentinel 3 satellite images and the TsHARP algorithm, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Park Cool Island (PCI) were obtained at a resolution of 10 m over green areas in the city of Granada. The objective was to analyze the relationship between surface, PCI effect and cooling distance. In turn, for each of the eight green areas studied, the following variables were taken into account and included in a statistical analysis known as data panel: normalized difference vegetation index, vegetal proportion, sky view factor, landscape shape index, model digital elevation, wind and solar radiation. Our results report diurnal LST decreases of 1 K and night LST of 0.6 K in green areas as compared to urban areas. There is moreover a correlation between the size of the green areas, the decrease in temperature they generate, and distance of the minimizer effect.

TI  - Analysis of Deformation Dynamics in Guatemala City Metropolitan Area Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of deformation dynamics in Guatemala city and its surrounding region presented in this paper holds significant relevance due to the high vulnerability of this area to natural disasters, combined with its rapid urbanization, similar to most Central American cities, contrasting with a lack of InSAR and deformation studies in the region. A total of 226 SAR images from Sentinel-1 A and B satellites in both ascending and descending geometries were processed with the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique employing the SNAP-StaMPS integrated processing chain. The study area encompasses the Metropolitan Region of Guatemala, which is characterized by a diverse and active geological framework, with a historical record of earthquakes, intense groundwater extraction, and local subsidence phenomena, causing fissures and sinkholes. Four active areas were identified in the study area, each covering more than 50 hectares, with subsidence velocities greater than 10 mm/yr. This study provides valuable insights into fostering the sustainable development of this region by identifying deformation patterns, characterizing main active areas, and evaluating associated risks for disaster management and prevention. The results can also aid informed decision-making processes and guide urban planning and resource management strategies in other Central American countries. The application of InSAR studies is crucial for improving safety and sustainability in urban environments and natural resource management in vulnerable regions.

TI  - Machine and deep learning approaches to understand and predict habitat suitability for seabird breeding
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The way animals select their breeding habitat may have great impacts on individual fitness. This complex process depends on the integration of information on various environmental factors, over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. For seabirds, breeding habitat selection integrates both land and sea features over several spatial scales. Seabirds explore these features prior to breeding, assessing habitats' quality. However, the information-gathering and decision-making process by seabirds when choosing a breeding habitat remains poorly understood. We compiled 49 historical records of larids colonies in Cuba from 1980 to 2020. Then, we predicted potentially suitable breeding sites for larids and assessed their breeding macrohabitat selection, using deep and machine learning algorithms respectively. Using a convolutional neural network and Landsat satellite images we predicted the suitability for nesting of non-monitored sites of this archipelago. Furthermore, we assessed the relative contribution of 18 land- and marine-based environmental covariates describing macrohabitats at three spatial scales (i.e. 10, 50 and 100 km) using random forests. Convolutional neural network exhibited good performance at training, validation and test (F1-scores >85%). Sites with higher habitat suitability (p > .75) covered 20.3% of the predicting area. Larids breeding macrohabitats were sites relatively close to main islands, featuring sparse vegetation cover and high chlorophyll-a concentration at sea in 50 and 100 km around colonies. Lower sea surface temperature at larger spatial scales was determinant to distinguish the breeding from non-breeding sites. A more comprehensive understanding of the seabird breeding macrohabitats selection can be reached from the complementary use of convolutional neural networks and random forest models. Our analysis provides crucial knowledge in tropical regions that lack complete and regular monitoring of seabirds' breeding sites.

TI  - Assessing ground predation by invertebrates in crops: Camera observations clarify the relevance of aphid cards and coleopteran sentinel prey
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Redesigning cropping systems to promote natural pest control requires a sound understanding of the regulation potential of natural enemies. Sentinel preys are useful to quantify biological control, but the use of aphid cards (aphids glued to a sandpaper card) is controversial for their lack of realism. The objectives here were: (1) to compare aphid cards to non-fixed beetle larvae resembling coleopteran pests, with respect to the consumers attracted; and (2) to ascertain whether predation on coleopteran prey larvae responds to different invertebrates communities. We used cameras to identify the consumers of two types of sentinel prey on the ground, and compared aphid cards to an original sentinel prey, bruchid beetle larvae. Aphids glued to predation cards attracted opportunistic consumers and scavengers with very long handling times, and even scavengers, including harvestmen (33% of consumption events), spiders and slugs, and a very few carabid beetles. Unattached bruchid beetle larvae were consumed largely by carabids (64%), and secondarily by rove beetles, ants and chilopods. As the sentinel prey were not consumed by the same organisms, these findings demonstrate the importance of the choice of organisms exposed to estimate pest predation. Knowing the identity of the bruchid larvae consumers from the images, we investigated whether the assemblages of epigeic arthropods could explain their predation rates under contrasting field conditions. Accounting for all the expected consumers, sentinel prey disappearance rates could be explained statistically with a satisfactory goodness-of-fit. Slugs and ants contributed more strongly to the disappearance of sentinel prey than carnivorous carabids and chilopods. Finally, alternative prey (especially Collembola) reduced consumption by diverting consumers from their usual prey. Camera observations were valuable to assess the relevance of two different sentinel preys and of the consumers involved. With this knowledge, it is possible to estimate the pest control potential from the ground-dwelling communities present.

TI  - Remote sensing the evolution of debris-covered Panchi Nala-A glacier, India (1971-2021) from satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial debris influences the glacier-climate relationship by altering the ablation patterns of the debris-covered glaciers. The intricate surface morphology of debris-covered glaciers renders difficulties in their assessment through satellite remote sensing alone. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantage of providing ultra-high-resolution maps of the debris-covered glacier surfaces, thus, aid in inferring the complexity in their behavior. Considering the limitations and to help elucidate the morpho-dynamic evolution of the debris-covered glacier surface, an in-depth investigation is conducted on the Panchi Nala-A glacier (area: 3 km(2); debris percentage: 60%; and thickness: 4-60 cm), Bhaga basin, western Himalaya, using hybrid remote sensing data (declassified Corona, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI, Planetscope, and UAV-based optical images) during 1971-2021. The results indicate shrinkage (0.3 & PLUSMN; 0.03%a(-1)) and terminal retreat (3 & PLUSMN; 0.6 ma(-1)) of the glacier, with increasing debris extent (0.1 & PLUSMN; 0.0001%a(-1)) during 1971-2021, in sync with the temperature increase and snowfall reduction during 1983-2016. The glacier velocity has reduced, however, trivially (0.6 & PLUSMN; 6 ma(-1)) during 1993-2021, with stagnation in the lower ablation zone (velocity < 5ma(-1)). The glacier thinned consistently during 2000-2018 (- 0.5 & PLUSMN; 0.055 ma(-1)) and 2019-2021 (- 0.48 & PLUSMN; 0.013 ma(-1)) in the lower ablation zone, with glacier-wide thinning rates of - 0.12 & PLUSMN; 0.055 ma(-1) during 2000-2018. The comprehensive picture suggests that the glacier changes are possibly influenced by debris distribution, however, are not substantial and have remained consistent, indicative of its near-stable condition. This glacier response may further change depending on ice cliffs and supraglacial pond dynamics, which have shown a rise of 3.8 times and 86%, respectively, during the recent period between 2019 and 2021.

TI  - The Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes in the Este District, South Gondar Zone, Northwestern Ethiopia, in the Last Four Decades (the 1980s to 2020s)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental transformations are the results of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. This study aims to investigate the LULC changes and associated factors in the Este District in northwestern Ethiopia, for the last four decades (the 1980s to 2020s). The land-use and land-cover classes were analyzed using supervised classification techniques in ERDASS IMAGINE 2015 and ArcGIS 10.3.1, categorizing the Landsat satellite images for 1984, 2000, and 2018 into six cover classes: settlement, forests-shrublands, cropland, grassland, bare land, and water body. We used a historical Google map, topo-sheets, and ancillary data to verify the classification accuracies for 1984, 2000, and 2018, respectively. The climate and demographic data were obtained from the Ethiopian Meteorological Station and Ethiopian Statistical Agency, respectively. In addition, data from key informant interviews and focus group discussions were also used to understand the local community experiences and perceptions toward LULC changes. The values of each LULC class were correlated with the demographic and climatic variables, using simple correlation analysis to evaluate the impact of demographic and climatic conditions on LULC changes. The analysis indicated that the least and largest classes of LULC in Este District were water bodies (mean cover = 1.9 km2) and croplands (mean cover = 791.7 km2), respectively. Cropland coverage increased by 2% in 2000, then decreased by 11% in 2018. Between 1984 and 2018, the grasslands and settlements increased by 22% and 0.5%, respectively. Half of the bare land and one-tenth of the forests-shrublands also decreased over the last four decades (the 1980s to 2020s). As a result, the original croplands and forests-shrublands classes (11% each) before 2000 were converted into new grasslands and croplands after 2018, respectively. The study indicated that precipitation, solar radiation, and population growth are the potential drivers, and the perceptions of local communities are nearly in line with the statistical analysis results. Alternative income sources, such as tourism and carbon trading and the participation in afforestation programs, could reverse the situation in the study area.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change study can provide a scientific ground for species conservation. The present study aimed to analyze the effect of LULC change on Black Crowned Crane (Balearica pavonina), and public perception of species conservation. A Landsat 7 ETM +2000, and Landsat 8 OLI of 2020 were used to analyze the LULC change. Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was employed to classify the LULC types. Besides geospatial technologies, 151 household heads, key informant interviews (n = 6) and field observation were conducted. Results showed that agricultural land was increased from 74.24% in 2000 to 81.66% in 2020. Settlement and grazing land cover classes show a slight increased. Agricultural expansions on the expense of forest, grassland and wetlands substantial affect the conservation of B. pavonina. Wetland ecosystem declined slightly from 0.69% in 2000 to 0.58% in 2020. The decline of wetland ecosystems significantly threats B. pavonina, as the species used for feeding, breeding, and roosting. A household survey showed that 93.4% perceived that environmental changes had a significantly impact on B. pavonina. About 44.4% of the respondents perceived that the population of B. pavonina declined, while about 25.8%, 25.2%, and 4.6% perceived increasing, no change, and don't know, respectively. About 53.6% and 27.8% of the respondents perceived that the species is currently vulnerable and endangered, respectively. This study provides a baseline data on the threat of B. pavonina conservation. Other threats to this species, namely climate change, predators, and poaching can be studied by other scholars.

TI  - Creating an art therapy research strategic plan: A community participatory approach
T2  - ARTS IN PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - A sequential mixed methods multi-phasic project focused on designing and developing an art therapy research strategic plan for the sustainability and advancement of the field. The project consisted of three sequential, emergent, and cumulative multi-phasic processes. The three phases included: a scoping review, a survey and focus group, and a working symposium. This article focuses primarily on the third phase-the working symposium. During the third phase of the project, it became apparent that central to all phases the project was the contributions of multiple communities. These communities represented varied perspectives which generated diverse and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data enriching the final result. When organized, categorized, integrated, and synthesized, the data from all three phases yielded six interactive categories forming the basis for a community-driven art therapy research strategic plan. Each category has a mission, goals, and action items. The categories are: building community, art therapy worldview, art therapy evidence, research methods, clinical theory and practice, and education, advocacy, and policy. An implementation strategy for the plan is proposed including using the categories as a structure for community-driven workgroups that will review, revise, actualize, and evaluate the plan.

TI  - Flood-Prone Zones of Meandering Rivers: Machine Learning Approach and Considering the Role of Morphology (Kashkan River, Western Iran)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We utilized the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, along with nine topographical/morphological factors, namely aspect, slope, geomorphons, plan curvature, profile curvature, terrain roughness index, surface texture, topographic wetness index (TWI), and elevation. Our objective was to identify flood-prone areas along the meandering Kashkan River and investigate the role of topography in riverbank inundation. To validate the flood susceptibility map generated by the random forest algorithm, we employed Sentinel-1 GRDH SAR imagery from the March 2019 flooding event in the Kashkan river. The SNAP software and the OTSU thresholding method were utilized to extract the flooded/inundated areas from the SAR imagery. The results showed that the random forest model accurately pinpointed areas with a "very high" and "high" risk of flooding. Through analysis of the cross-sections and SAR-based flood maps, we discovered that the topographical confinement of the meander played a crucial role in the extent of inundation along the meandering path. Moreover, the findings indicated that the inner banks along the Kashkan river were more prone to flooding compared to the outer banks.

TI  - Multi-sensor detection of spring breakup phenology of Canada's lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice phenology of freshwater lakes throughout the Northern Hemisphere has undergone important climateinduced shifts over the past century. In Canada's North, where freshwater lakes and wetlands cover 15 to 40% of the landscape, monitoring ice phenology is vital to understand its impacts on climate, socio-economic, ecological, and hydrological systems. The rapid and dynamic nature of ice phenology events has restricted monitoring efforts to the use of satellite sensors with frequent revisit times (e.g., MODIS, AVHRR), but their low resolution (e.g., > 500 m) limits observations to larger water bodies. However, the increased abundance of highresolution open-access satellite imagery combined with the rise of cloud-computing technologies has provided opportunities to reduce the trade-off between temporal (i.e., revisit time) and spatial (i.e., pixel size) resolution allowing for lake ice monitoring over broad scales. In this study, we present the Open Pixel-based Earth eNgine Ice (OPEN-ICE) algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), which classifies imagery from multiple open-access optical sensors, then combines them to construct dense annual time series of ice-water observations and estimate pixel spring breakup dates at a 30-m resolution. Using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI scenes over lakes spanning northern latitudes, we build reference datasets to train decision trees that discriminate between ice, water, and clouds. We combine ice-water classifications from each sensor into annual time series and remove misclassifications with a temporal filter applied using a pixel-wise logistic regression. We then detect the sequence of transition from ice to water in each pixel's time series to estimate the occurrence of breakup each year. We deploy the OPEN-ICE algorithm over all freshwater pixels of Canada for the period of 2013 to 2021. Spring ice phenology events estimated by OPEN-ICE show high accuracy when compared to whole-lake breakup dates measured by the Canadian Ice Service in 105 lakes across 9 years, with mean bias errors of -1.10 and - 0.69 days for breakup start and end, respectively. We apply the OPEN-ICE algorithm to 4000 lakes across Canada and evaluate differences in breakup dates across ecozones and lake sizes. Our new OPEN-ICE tool provides accurate estimates of annual spring breakup events applicable across all boreal and arctic regions to monitor the rapid changes taking place in these vulnerable ecosystems.

TI  - Assessment of forest fire emissions in Uttarakhand State, India, using Open Geospatial data and Google Earth Engine.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the recent past, forest fires have increased due to the changing climate pattern. It is necessary to analyse and quantify various gaseous emissions so as to mitigate their harmful effects on air pollution. Satellite remote sensing data provides an opportunity to study the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The multispectral sensor of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (Sentinel-5) is capable of recording the reflectance of wavelengths vital for measuring the atmospheric concentrations of methane, formaldehyde, aerosol, carbon monoxide, etc., at a spatial resolution of 0.01°. The present study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to study the emissions caused by forest fires in four districts of Uttarakhand State of India, which witnessed unprecedented fires in April-May 2021. All the datasets were ingested in GEE, which has the capability to analyse large datasets without the need to download them. The pre-fire period chosen was September 2020; the fire period was February-May 2021, and the post-fire period was June 2021. The variables chosen were aerosol absorbing index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The climate parameter temperature (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Surface Temperature) and precipitation (from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRPS) Pentad) were also studied for the period mentioned. The results indicate a different trend for emissions in each district. For AAI, maximum emissions were noted in district Nainital followed by Almora, Tehri Garhwal and Garhwal. For CO emissions, the most affected district was Almora followed by Nainital, Garhwal and Tehri Garhwal. For NO2 emissions, the most affected district was Garhwal, followed by Nainital, Tehri Garhwal and Almora. Delta Normalized Burn Ratio was computed from Sentinel data (difference of pre-fire and post-fire images) to assess the burnt area severity. The Delta Normalized Burn Ratio values observed that the district with the most burnt area is Garhwal, followed by Nainital, Almora and Tehri Garhwal. The elevated temperatures and scanty rainfall patterns regulated the intensity and duration of forest fire. Monitoring the gaseous emissions as a consequence of forest fire in the GEE platform is much easier and more convenient at a regional level. Such data is much needed for mitigation measures to be implemented in time.

TI  - Unpaired spatio-temporal fusion of image patches<i> (USTFIP)</i> from cloud covered images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal image fusion aims to increase the frequency and resolution of multispectral satellite sensor im-ages in a cost-effective manner. However, practical constraints on input data requirements and computational cost prevent a wider adoption of these methods in real case-studies. We propose an ensemble of strategies to eliminate the need for cloud-free matching pairs of satellite sensor images. The new methodology called Unpaired Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) is tested in situations where classical requirements are progressively difficult to meet. Overall, the study shows that USTFIP reduces the root mean square error by 2-to-13% relative to the state-of-the-art Fit-FC fusion method, due to an efficient use of the available information. Implementation of USTFIP through parallel computing saves up to 40% of the computational time required for Fit-FC.

TI  - A Generalized Area-Based Framework to Quantify River Mobility From Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are the primary conduits of water and sediment across Earth's surface. In recent decades, rivers have been increasingly impacted by climate change and human activities. The availability of global-coverage satellite imagery provides a powerful avenue to study river mobility and quantify the impacts of these perturbations on global river behavior. However, we lack remote sensing methods for quantifying river mobility that can be generally applied across the diversity of river planforms (e.g., meandering, braided) and fluvial processes (e.g., channel migration, avulsion). Here, we upscale area-based methods from laboratory flume experiments to build a generalized remote sensing framework for quantifying river mobility. The framework utilizes binary channel-mask time series to determine time- and area-integrated rates and scales of river floodplain reworking and channel-thread reorganization. We apply the framework to numerical models to demonstrate that these rates and scales are sensitive to specific river processes (channel migration, channel-bend cut-off, and avulsion). We then apply the framework to natural migrating and avulsing rivers with meandering and braided planforms. Results show that our area-based framework provides an objective and accurate means to quantify river mobility at reach- to floodplain-scales, which is largely insensitive to spatial and temporal biases that can arise in traditional mobility metrics. Our work provides a framework for investigating global controls on river mobility, testing hypotheses about river response to environmental gradients, and quantifying the timescales of terrestrial organic carbon cycling.

TI  - Improved Gaussian mixture model to map the flooded crops of VV and VH polarization data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely monitoring of flooded crop areas is crucial for disaster rescue and loss assessment. However, most flooded crop monitoring methods based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery were developed for rice, which is probably inappropriate for crops with complex canopy structures that strongly attenuate SAR signals. Additionally, these methods often rely on empirical thresholds and region-specific reference samples, limiting their reliability and applicability on a larger spatial scale. To address these issues, we developed a novel flooded crop mapping approach at a regional scale using Sentinel-1 time-series data and an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our approach leverages a Flood Separability Index (FSI) derived from the fitted prob-ability density function of flooded and non-flooded crop areas in a GMM. This allows us to overcome the limi-tations of manual input selection in previous studies. The multi-temporal GMM was constructed using the time-series images with optimal polarization to estimate the flooded crop extents on a regional scale. We also investigated the scattering mechanisms of three typical crop disaster structures within an agricultural landscape area. Our results indicate that the proposed multi-temporal GMM is robust in crop planting areas with complex canopy structures. The performance of both single-temporal and multi-temporal GMMs surpasses that of baseline methods such as Otsu and K-means. Compared with VV polarization, VH polarization exhibits greater potential for accurately mapping flooded crops in complex agricultural regions. Our approach does not require labeled samples or many predefined parameters, making it fast and feasible for mapping flooded crops with complex canopy structures in large spatial areas.

TI  - A General Method to Improve Runoff Prediction in Ungauged Basins Based on Remotely Sensed Actual Evapotranspiration Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of remotely sensed (RS) actual evapotranspiration (ET) provides a possibility for improving runoff prediction in ungauged basins. To develop a general practical method to improve runoff prediction by directly incorporating RS-ET into rainfall-runoff (RR) models, two modeling schemes are proposed: (i) using RS-ET as direct input; and (ii) using RS-ET as partial direct input. The principle is to use RS-ET in cases where the runoff prediction can be improved. The two schemes are compared in over 200 basins using three RR models (Xinanjiang model, SIMHYD, and GR4J) and RS-ET inverted from AVHRR, and the modeling results in ungauged basins are assessed using the spatial proximity method. Results show that: (i) it is beneficial to incorporate RS-ET into the Xinanjiang model for over 85% of the basins, but this is not the case for SIMHYD and GR4J models; (ii) further model improvements can be obtained by using RS-ET as partial direct input, and are achieved in 91.1%, 59.0%, and 53.2% of the basins for Xinanjiang, SIMHYD, and GR4J, respectively; and (iii) incorporation of RS-ET is more applicable for Xinanjiang while less so for GR4J, and the efficacy is superior for basins that are relatively arid and were originally poorly simulated. Overall, using RS-ET as partial direct input is recommended.

TI  - Profile of cardiac lesions among laboratory confirmed congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) infants: a nationwide sentinel surveillance, India, 2016-22.
T2  - The Lancet regional health. Southeast Asia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: The phenotypical profile of cardiovascular malformations in patients with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is varied. We aimed to describe the profile of cardiac defects among CRS patients detected in the sentinel CRS surveillance in India during 2016-22.Methods: Sentinel sites enrolled infants with suspected CRS based on presence of cardiac defects, hearing impairment, eye signs, or maternal history of febrile rash illness. Suspected CRS cases underwent detailed systemic examination, including echocardiography and serological investigation for rubella. Cardiac defects were categorized as 'Simple' or 'Complex' as per the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute classification. We compared the distribution of cardiac defects among laboratory confirmed CRS cases and seronegative discarded cases.Findings: Of the 4578 suspected CRS cases enrolled by 14 sites, 558 (12.2%) were laboratory confirmed. 419 (75.1%) laboratory confirmed cases had structural heart defects (simple defects: n=273, 65.2%, complex defects: n=144, 34.4%), with ventricular septal defect (42.7%), atrial septal defect (39.4%), patent ductus arteriosus (36.5%), and tetralogy of Fallot as the commonest defects (4.5%). Laboratory confirmed CRS cases had higher odds of left to right shunt lesions (OR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.15-2.17). This was mainly on account of a significant association of PDA with CRS (OR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.42-2.21). Mortality was higher among CRS patients with complex heart defects (HR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.26-3.30).Interpretation: Three-fourths of the laboratory confirmed CRS cases had structural heart defects. CRS patients with complex cardiac defects had higher mortality. Detecting CRS infection early and providing timely intervention for cardiovascular defects is critical for the management of CRS patients.Funding: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India, through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

TI  - Exploring the Detection Accuracy of Remote Sensing Spectrometer with Slit Homogenizer
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In a satellite-based spectroscopic instrument, the telescope system forms the ground-based image on the slit, which is divided by a dispersive element and finally imaged on a surface detector, with the spectral information represented in one dimension and the spatial information in the other. The spectral and spatial information together is used to quantify the changes in the composition of the atmosphere. In the spectrometer system, the telescope system forms the image of the detection section at the slit, which is spectroscopically separated by the dispersive elements and finally re-imaged by the imaging system on the focal plane array (FPA). The intensity pattern in the spectral direction produced is called the instrumental spectral response function (ISRF). However, changes in the atmosphere and below (clouds, aerosol layer, and ground height) can cause changes in ground albedo or a large number of measured gas emission points. Such changes may lead to inhomogeneous illumination at the slit, which will cause the ISRF distortion and then the detection data deviation. As a result, the detection accuracy of content in atmospheric composition is affected. With the increasing requirements for atmospheric exploration and monitoring, the spectral accuracy of high-resolution spectrometers for Earth observation has increased significantly, but detection data deviation is more obvious when the spectral resolution of the instrument is higher. The concept of slit homogenizer is proposed during the Sentinel-5/UVNS imaging spectrometer development, and it can reduce the date error brought by the spectral signal distortion in the heterogeneous calibration scene.Methods The main work of this study is to analyze and study the principle of slit homogenizers and the systematic factors and external causes influencing ISRF. In addition, a geometric model and near-field diffraction principle are combined to establish the model structure from the telescope system to the slit homogenizer and from the slit homogenizer to the detector image plane. The equivalent simulation of parallel light is proposed to establish a more concise optical model, which reduces unnecessary calculations while retaining accuracy. Firstly, the rationality of the established model is briefly demonstrated. Based on the optical model, this paper analyzes the optical properties of the slit homogenizer. Through mathematical software and optical software simulation and mathematical analysis, the paper made concrete representations of the homogenizing effect of the slit homogenizer and the influence of the parameters of the slit homogenizer in a homogeneous incoherent scene and makes clearer the working principle and influencing factors of slit homogenizers. Then, the effect of the slit homogenizer is comprehensively evaluated from the entrance pupil scene: Analysis is made on the location of the strong emission point of trace gas and the influence of the coverage area on the ability of the slit homogenizer to maintain ISRF stability. The homogenization effect of the slit homogenizer is studied in different scenes under 25% illumination. The influence of different scenes on the spectrometer system ISRF is quantified. Finally, a method is proposed to improve detection accuracy.Results and Discussions The rationality of the optical model of the slit homogenizer and the ability of the slit homogenizer to calibrate the contrast of different scene cases are demonstrated from the simulation and experimental points of view (Figs. 8 and 11). In the mathematical model, the factors influencing ISRF can be summarized as the spectrograph pupil intensity distribution and the spectrometer system. On the one hand, the object-image relationship of different systems influences the point spread function (PSF), which also has a corresponding effect on the final result of ISRF (Table 1). On the other hand, the spectrograph pupil intensity distribution influences slit illumination, and the homogenization effect of the slit homogenizer based on the established optical model greatly depends on the entrance pupil scene. The difference in cloud and rain positions, the difference in the emission point position, and the size of the coverage area in the entrance pupil scene will affect the ISRF stability (Fig. 13), thus affecting the ability of the slit homogenizer to improve data detection accuracy (Table 2). To improve the ability of the slit homogenizer to calibrate the contrast of the different scene cases, this paper proposes a solution of adjusting the tilt angle of the extension mirror below the slit homogenizer (Fig. 14).Conclusions As the new generation of spectroscopic instruments have higher requirements in terms of spatial resolution and radiation accuracy, slit homogenizers are employed to reduce the errors of measurement data from the imaging spectrometers for Earth observation. In this paper, the principle of the slit homogenizer is elaborated using the principle of near-field diffraction. In addition, a simple and reasonable optical model is established, and a more concise and calculable mathematical expression is given. The systematic factors and external causes influencing ISRF are discussed. The ability of the slit homogenizer to keep ISRF stability is found to be limited in the investigation with different positions of emission points and changes in the size of the coverage area, and the error of ISRF may affect data inversion accuracy. Finally, this paper proposes a solution of adjusting the tilt angle of the extension mirror below the slit homogenizer to make up for the deficiency of the slit homogenizer in reducing the influence of extreme scene cases.

TI  - Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass Combining Pléiades Satellite Imagery and Field Inventory Data in the Peak-Cluster Karst Region of Southwestern China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous region of southwest China has the largest karst geomorphology in China and in the world. Quantifying the forest aboveground biomass in this karst region is of great significance for the investigation of carbon storage and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the actual measured aboveground biomass was calculated based on the allometric functions of 106 quadrats from 2012 to 2015. A backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN) inversion model was constructed by combining very high-resolution satellite imagery, field inventory data, and land use/land cover data to estimate the forest aboveground biomass in the Banzhai watershed, a typical peak-cluster karst basin in southern Guizhou Province. We used 70% of the actual measured aboveground biomass for training the BPANN model, 20% for accuracy verification, and 10% to prevent overtraining. The results show that the absolute root mean square error of the BPANN model was 11.80 t/ha, which accounted for 9.92% of the mean value of aboveground biomass. Based on the BPANN inversion model, the average value of the forests' aboveground biomass was 135.63 t/ha. The results showed that our study presented a quick, easy, and relatively high-precision method for estimating forest aboveground biomass in the Banzhai watershed. This indicates that the Pleiades image-based BPANN model displayed satisfactory results for estimating the forests' aboveground biomass in a typical peak-cluster karst basin. This method can be applied to the estimation of forest AGB in the karst mountainous areas of southwest China.

TI  - Estimating Maize Yield from 2001 to 2019 in the North China Plain Using a Satellite-Based Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is one of the main food crops and is widely planted in China; however, it is difficult to get timely and precise information on yields. Because of the benefits of remote sensing technology, satellite-based models (e.g., eddy covariance light use efficiency, EC-LUE) have a lot of potential for monitoring crop productivity. In this study, the gross primary productivity (GPP) of maize in the NCP was estimated using the EC-LUE model, and the GPP was subsequently transformed into yield using the harvest index. Specifically accounting for the spatiotemporal variation in the harvest index, the statistical yield and estimated GPP from the previous year were used to generate region-specific harvest indexes at the county scale. The model's performance was assessed using statistical yield data. The results demonstrate that the increase in the total GPP in the summer maize-growing season in the NCP is directly related to the increase in the planting area, and the harvest index has significant heterogeneity in space, and the fluctuation in time is small, and the estimated yield can simulate 64% and 55%, respectively, of the variability in the yield at the county and city scales. The model also accurately captures the inter-annual changes in yield (the average absolute percentage errors are less than 20% for almost all years), but model performance varies by region. It performs better in continuous areas of maize-growing. The results from this study demonstrate that the EC-LUE model can be applied to estimate the yield from a variety of crops (other than winter wheat) and that it can be used in conjunction with a region-specific harvest index to track the production of large-scale crops.

TI  - Analysis of Groundwater Depletion in the Saskatchewan River Basin in Canada from Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW and Satellite Gravimetry
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Saskatchewan River Basin (SRB) of central Canada plays a crucial role in the Canadian Prairies. Yet, climate change and human action constitute a real threat to its hydrological processes. This study aims to evaluate and analyze groundwater spatial and temporal dynamics in the SRB. Groundwater information was derived and compared using two different approaches: (1) a mathematical modeling framework coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Modular hydrologic model (MODFLOW) and (2) gravimetric satellite observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its follow-on (GRACE-FO). Both methods show generalized groundwater depletion in the SRB that can reach -1 m during the study period (2002-2019). Maximum depletion appeared especially after 2011. The water balance simulated by SWAT-MODFLOW showed that SRB could be compartmented roughly into three main zones. The mountainous area in the extreme west of the basin is the first zone, which is the most dynamic zone in terms of recharge, reaching +0.5 m. The second zone is the central area, where agricultural and industrial activities predominate, as well as potable water supplies. This zone is the least rechargeable and most intensively exploited area, with depletion ranging from +0.2 to -0.4 m during the 2002 to 2011 period and up to -1 m from 2011 to 2019. Finally, the third zone is the northern area that is dominated by boreal forest. Here, exploitation is average, but the soil does not demonstrate significant storage power. Briefly, the main contribution of this research is the quantification of groundwater depletion in the large basin of the SRB using two different methods: process-oriented and satellite-oriented methods. The next step of this research work will focus on the development of artificial intelligence approaches to estimate groundwater depletion from a combination of GRACE/GRACE-FO and a set of multisource remote sensing data.

TI  - Collaborative Self-Supervised Transductive Few-Shot Learning for Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of deep learning and the accessibility of massive data, scene classification algorithms based on deep learning have been extensively researched and have achieved exciting developments. However, the success of deep models often relies on a large amount of annotated remote sensing data. Additionally, deep models are typically trained and tested on the same set of classes, leading to compromised generalization performance when encountering new classes. This is where few-shot learning aims to enable models to quickly generalize to new classes with only a few reference samples. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative self-supervised transductive few-shot learning (CS2TFSL) algorithm for remote sensing scene classification. In our approach, we construct two distinct self-supervised auxiliary tasks to jointly train the feature extractor, aiming to obtain a powerful representation. Subsequently, the feature extractor's parameters are frozen, requiring no further training, and transferred to the inference stage. During testing, we employ transductive inference to enhance the associative information between the support and query sets by leveraging additional sample information in the data. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art few-shot scene classification algorithms on the WHU-RS19 and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS2TFSL. More specifically, CS2TFSL ranks first in the settings of five-way one-shot and five-way five-shot. Additionally, detailed ablation experiments are conducted to analyze the CS2TFSL. The experimental results reveal significant and promising performance improvements in few-shot scene classification through the combination of self-supervised learning and direct transductive inference.

TI  - Cost-efficient bathymetric mapping method based on massive active-passive remote sensing data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric mapping is critical for island reef research, coastal ecosystem monitoring, and nearshore engineering. Increasing amounts of remote sensing data have promoted the development of optical bathymetric remote sensing. However, large-scale and efficient bathymetric mapping of shallow oceanic islands is difficult due to the limited availability of high-quality optical remote sensing images. In this study, we propose a costefficient method for bathymetric mapping based on a quadratic polynomial ratio model (QPRM) of massive active-passive remote sensing data. Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data represent active data and a priori data, and Sentinel-2 data from the Google Earth Engine represent passive data. The key step is to build a QPRM based on the median value of the blue-green band logarithmic ratio from massive Sentinel-2 data. The method is applied to six typical areas located in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and South China Sea, and the results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of bathymetric mapping in the water depth range of 0-20 m were 0.49-0.71 m and 0.29-0.49 m, respectively. In addition, the RMSE decreased with an increase in the number of Sentinel-2 images, and the results were relatively stable when the number reached approximately 150. The QPRM results were also compared with that of the classical linear ratio model (CLRM) and multiple fitting methods to calculate the median water depth, and the findings showed that the QPRM method has a slight advantage in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method, which does not depend on in situ data, effectively calculates precise water depths and removes the effects of complex underwater optical paths and surface instabilities, such as waves, boats, and clouds. Therefore, it has great potential for bathymetric mapping of oceanic islands and reefs worldwide.

TI  - Long-Term Results of Intraoperative Radiation Therapy for Early Breast Cancer Using a Nondedicated Linear Accelerator
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To present the long-term results of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for early breast cancer using a nondedicated linear accelerator.Methods and Materials: The eligibility criteria were biopsy-proven invasive carcinoma, age >= 40 years, tumor size <= 3 cm, and N0M0. We excluded multifocal lesions and sentinel lymph node involvement. All patients had previously undergone breast magnetic resonance imaging. Breast-conserving surgery with margins and sentinel lymph node evaluation using frozen sections were performed in all cases. If there were no margins or involved sentinel lymph nodes, the patient was transferred from the operative suite to the linear accelerator room, where IORT was delivered (21 Gy).Results: A total of 209 patients who were followed up for >= 1.5 years from 2004 to 2019 were included. The median age was 60.3 years (range, 40-88.6), and the mean pT was 1.3 cm (range, 0.2-4). There were 90.5% pN0 cases (7.2% of micrometastases and 1.9% of macrometastases). Ninety-seven percent of the cases were margin free. The rate of lymphovascular invasion was 10.6%. Twelve patients were negative for hormonal receptors, and 28 patients were HER2 positive. The median Ki-67 index was 29% (range, 0.1-85). Intrinsic subtype stratification was as follows: luminal A, 62.7% (n = 131); luminal B, 19.1% (n = 40); HER2 enriched 13.4% (n = 28); and triple negative, 4.8% (n = 10). Within the median follow-up of 145 months (range, 12.8-187.1), the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year overall survival rates were 98%, 94.7%, and 88%, respectively. The 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year disease-free rates were 96.3%, 90%, and 75.6%, respectively. The 15-year local recurrence-free rate was 76%. Fifteen local recurrences (7.2%) occurred throughout the follow-up period. The mean time to local recurrence was 145 months (range, 12.8-187.1). As a first event, 3 cases of lymph node recurrence, 3 cases of distant metastasis, and 2 cancer-related deaths were recorded. Tumor size >1 cm, grade III, and lymphovascular invasion were identified as risk factors.Conclusions: Despite approximately 7% of recurrences, we may infer that IORT may still be a reasonable option for selected cases. However, these patients require a longer follow-up as recurrences may occur after 10 years. (c) 2023TheAuthor(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

TI  - Validation of Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring Data against Simulation by Simulating Waves Nearshore and Wave Retrieval from Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese-French Oceanography SATellite (CFOSAT) jointly developed by the Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) of France carries a wave spectrometer (Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring, SWIM). SWIM has one nadir and five off-nadir beams to measure ocean surface waves. These near-nadir beams range from 0 degrees to 10 degrees at an interval of 2 degrees. In this work, we investigated the performance of wave parameters derived from wave spectra measured by SWIM at off-nadir beams during the period 2020 to December 2022, e.g., incidence angles of 6 degrees, 8 degrees and 10 degrees, which were collocated with the wave simulated by Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN). The validation of SWAN-simulated significant wave heights (SWHs) against National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) exhibited a 0.42 m root mean square error (RMSE) in the SWH. Our results revealed a RMSE of 1.02 m for the SWIM-measured SWH in the East Pacific Ocean compared with the SWH simulated by SWAN, as well as a 0.79 correlation coefficient (Cor) and a 1.17 squared error (Err) for the wave spectrum at an incidence angle of 10 degrees, which are better than those (i.e., the RMSEs were > 1.1 m with Cors < 0.76 and Errs > 1.2) achieved at other incidence angles of SWH up to 14 m. This analysis indicates that the SWIM product is a relevant resource for wave monitoring over global seas. The collocated wave retrievals for more than 300 cases from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in China Seas were also used to verify the accuracy of SWIM-measured wave spectra. The energy of the SWIM-measured wave spectra represented by SWH was found to decrease with an increasing incidence angle in a case study. Moreover, the SWIM-measured wave spectra were most consistent with the SAR-derived wave spectra at an incidence angle of 10 degrees, yielding a 0.77 Cor and 1.98 Err between SAR-derived and SWIM wave spectra under regular sea state conditions (SWH < 2 m). The error analysis indicates that the difference in SWH between SWIM at an incidence angle of 10 degrees and SWAN has an increasing tendency with the growth in sea surface wind and sea state and it stabilizes to be 0.6 m at SWH > 4 m; however, the current and sea level have less influence on the uncertainties of the SWIM product.

TI  - Spatial Mapping of Soil Salinity Using Machine Learning and Remote Sensing in Kot Addu, Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accumulation of salt through natural causes and human artifice, such as saline inundation or mineral weathering, is marked as salinization, but the hindrance toward spatial mapping of soil salinity has somewhat remained a consistent riddle despite decades of efforts. The purpose of the current study is the spatial mapping of soil salinity in Kot Addu (situated in the south of the Punjab province, Pakistan) using Landsat 8 data in five advanced machine learning regression models, i.e., Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Partial Least Squares Regression and Ridge Regressor. For this purpose, spectral data were obtained between 20 and 27 of January 2017 and a field survey was carried out to gather a total of fifty-five soil samples. To evaluate and compare the model's performances, the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) were used. Spectral data of band values, salinity indices and vegetation indices were employed to study the salinity of soil. The results revealed that the Random Forest Regressor outperformed the other models in terms of prediction, achieving an R2 of 0.94, MAE of 1.42 dS/m, MSE of 3.58 dS/m and RMSE of 1.89 dS/m when using the Differential Vegetation Index (DVI). Alternatively, when using the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Random Forest Regressor achieved an R2 of 0.93, MAE of 1.46 dS/m, MSE of 3.90 dS/m and RMSE of 1.97 dS/m. Hence, remote sensing technology with machine learning models is an efficient method for the assessment of soil salinity at local scales. This study will contribute to mitigating osmotic stress and minimizing the risk of soil erosion by providing early warnings regarding soil salinity. Additionally, it will assist agriculture officers in estimating soil salinity levels within a shorter time frame and at a reduced cost, enabling effective resource allocation.

TI  - Primary Basal Cell Carcinoma Masquerading as Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma in the Left Axilla.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is considered the most common malignancy in Caucasians. Despite its high prevalence, BCC has extremely low rates of metastasis. The patient was a 71-year-old male with extensive BCC and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) skin cancer history who had an extensive, palpable left axillary mass concerning enlarged lymph nodes. No skin lesions were visualized. A lymph node biopsy revealed a sclerosing/infiltrative BCC with perineural invasion extending to the inked margins of the excision and one of four lymph nodes involved by BCC through direct extension. Sectioning revealed a 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.9 cm, ill-defined, fibrotic pink-white mass within the soft tissue. Two tan to pink possible lymph nodes were also identified within the soft tissue, measuring 0.7cm and 0.9cm. There was no definite direct invasion noted, making metastatic BCC suspicious. A left axillary lymph node dissection was performed. In short, he had a nonmobile tumor that showed evidence of invasion of the adjacent pectoralis muscle near the chest wall, abutting the left axillary vein, with extension. In July 2022, approximately one year after diagnosis, the patient received a PET scan and had no remote sites of disease. Every follow-up PET scan since has shown stable disease, most recently in May 2023. The patient continues dermatology follow-ups every three months for clinical surveillance. This case is unique because metastatic disease was never confirmed, though it is still a possibility. The affected lymph nodes were in the regional basin, where the patient had had extensive skin cancers in the past. Their involvement could have been secondary to direct invasion, though this could not be confirmed histologically, making the definitive characterization of this particular tumor difficult. As the PET CT scans have remained stable without evidence of distant disease, we favor that this is a recurrent primary tumor with direct extension to the underlying pectoralis and axillary lymph nodes. As common as BCCs are, this case highlights the importance of diligent treatment and follow-up to avoid the potential for tumor-related morbidity and, rarely, mortality.

TI  - A Simulation Optimization Approach for Wetland Conservation and Management in an Agricultural Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decreasing water quantity and growth in water demand have increased the competition between satisfying societal water needs and protecting ecosystem requirements. Wetlands are some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They provide various services to people's livelihoods, in addition to being suitable habitats for many plant and wildlife species. However, wetlands are under threat of loss and degradation due to anthropogenic activities, particularly the diversion of water for irrigation. The flow regime is usually considered the most crucial ecological factor and a key component of wetland management. So, determining the allocation of environmental requirements is a main factor for managing, restoring, and protecting wetlands, and it is crucial to reach a compromise for optimal water allocation between different sectors. For this purpose, in this research, a new approach is developed to achieve the optimal environmental flow of the wetland in an agricultural-dominated basin using a combination of remote sensing and the simulation optimization method. Waterbirds and vegetation are used as bioindicators of wetland ecosystems. First, using remote sensing data and analyses, we obtained the interrelation between the wetland water regime, vegetation, and waterbird characteristics using different time series of Landsat spectral indices. Then, by employing the long-term simulation optimization (WEAP-MOPSO) model, the optimal e-flow of the wetland is evaluated in such a way that the suitable ecological condition of the wetland is achieved and the wetland is able to provide its functions and services.

TI  - Advantages of Using Transfer Learning Technology with a Quantative Measurement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of people living in cities is continuously growing, and the buildings in topographic maps are in need of frequent updates, which are costly to perform manually. This makes automatic building extraction a significant research subject. Transfer learning, on the other hand, offers solutions in situations where the data of a target area are scarce, making it a profitable research subject. Moreover, in previous studies, there was a lack of metrics in quantifying the accuracy improvement with transfer learning techniques. This paper investigated various transfer learning techniques and their combinations with U-Net for the semantic segmentation of buildings from true orthophotos. The results were analyzed using quantitative methods. Open-source remote sensing data from Poland were used for pretraining a model for building segmentation. The fine-tuning techniques including a fine-tuning contracting path, a fine-tuning expanding path, a retraining contracting path, and a retraining expanding path were studied. These fine-tuning techniques and their combinations were tested with three local datasets from the diverse environment in Finland: urban, suburban, and rural areas. Knowledge from the pretrained model was transferred to the local datasets from Helsinki (urban), Kajaani (suburban), and selected areas in Finland (rural area). Three models with no transfer learning were trained from scratch with three sets of local data to compare the fine-tuning results. Our experiment focused on how various transfer learning techniques perform on datasets from different environments (urban, suburban, and rural areas) and multiple locations (southern, northern, and across Finland). A quantitative assessment of performance improvement by using transfer learning techniques was conducted. Despite the differences in datasets, the results showed that using transfer learning techniques could achieve at least 5% better accuracy than a model trained from scratch with several different transfer learning techniques. In addition, the effect of the sizes of training datasets was also studied.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of urban development intensity on the surface urban heat island across building climate zones
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) has gradually been a critical issue in the context of global environmental change and regional sustainability. The urban development intensity (UDI) increases with rapid urbanization and exacerbates the UHI problem, but the effects and contributions of UDI on UHI remain unclear. Based on Landsat 8 satellite images, this study quantified the effects of UDI on surface UHI intensity (SUHII) in 20 important cities across 5 building climate zones of China by using regression analysis, correlation analysis and boosted regression tree (BRT), and analyzed their potential influence mechanisms. Results indicated that there was apparent spatial heterogeneity of SUHII in different building climate zones (ranging from 3.26 degrees C to 4.43 degrees C) and cities (ranging from 1.44 degrees C to 6.61 degrees C). The effect of UDI on SHUII in cities of north was stronger than that in south, the average R2 values of the UDI-SUHII relationship in severe cold zone and cold zone were higher than the other climate zones. Building density, as the most critical predictor of SUHII among UDI metrics in all cities, was significantly positively correlated with SUHII. The R2 values showed significant positive correlation with annual average sunshine duration and aridity, and significant negative correlation with annual average precipitation, humidity and soil clay content. Our findings can offer new insights and decision-support in climate-adapted urban planning and heat-related risk management across different building climate zones.

TI  - Satellite Sensors and Retrieval Algorithms of Atmospheric Methane
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance Global climate governance and greenhouse gas emission reduction are of great urgency. The volume fraction of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been rising continuously since the industrial revolution and is now averaging about 1895.7x10(-9) globally. In addition, since the global warming potential of CH4 is about 27-30 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), the monitoring of atmospheric CH4 becomes the focus and hotspot of carbon emission reduction.Satellite remote sensing features fast detection speed, wide coverage, and rich information. It can conduct continuous and stable observations of atmospheric CH4 with high temporal and spatial resolution and high precision on a global scale and can provide verification and support for the "bottom-up" emission inventory.Relying on the rapid development of satellite detection technology and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a large number of satellites with CH4 detection capabilities have emerged in the past two decades. The detection technology has become more mature with increasingly higher detection accuracy. Additionally, corresponding algorithms of various satellite sensors have also made a huge leap forward. Rapid advances in both sensors and algorithms enable us to better monitor the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric CH4 and its impact on climate change.With the purpose to promote the further development of CH4 satellite remote sensing and retrieval research and realize the dual carbon target, it is necessary to summarize and discuss the existing research progress and future development trends, which can provide scientific and technological support for China's low-carbon sustainable development.Progress Firstly, the development of atmospheric CH4 satellites and sensors is reviewed and introduced. Early sensors mainly rely on the thermal infrared band of about 8 mu m for CH4 detection, and typical representatives include IMG, AIRS, and IASI (Table 1). Subsequently, a series of passive short-wave infrared sensors represented by SCIAMACHY, TANSO-FTS, and TROPOMI are developed. They rely on CH4 characteristic bands near 1.6 mu m and 2.3 mu m for detection and are more sensitive to changes in near-surface CH4 concentration. Among them, the high-resolution imaging spectral sensors and platforms represented by GHGSat, AHSI, and MethaneSAT also take advantage of their high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution to monitor the CH4 point source emissions. There is no doubt that new energy is injected into the development of CH4 satellite remote sensing (Table 2). In recent years, active detection represented by the methane remote sensing lidar mission (MERLIN) has also developed rapidly, effectively making up for the shortcomings of passive remote sensing detection with improved detection efficiency. Subsequently, the principles, application conditions, and retrieval accuracy of different sensor algorithms are summarized. From the early DOAS algorithm, proxy algorithm, and PPDF algorithm, to the most commonly employed full-physical algorithm with the highest precision at this stage, the physical algorithms have been continuously improved with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. The full-physical algorithms represented by NIES-FP, UoL-FP, RemoTeC, RemoTAP, IAPCAS, and FOCAL have an accuracy of 6x10(-9). At the same time, with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence, various new algorithms, such as neural network algorithms, are also emerging, which can almost complete the real-time retrieval of CH4. These methods have also brought breakthroughs to CH4 retrieval.Conclusions and Prospects In the future, CH4 detection satellite sensors will continue to develop toward the goal of high temporal and spatial resolution, high precision, high accuracy, and continuous observation. Many high- performance satellites such as MethaneSAT, Sentinel-5, and CO2M are under planning (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the construction of the satellite network should be stepped up to meet the demands of CH4 global high-precision detection. Correspondingly, new requirements are put forward for the accuracy, coverage, and calculation speed of CH4 observation data and retrieval products. For the most accurate full- physical algorithm at present, the adoption of more accurate forward radiative transfer models and prior information, collaborative retrieval and correction of clouds and aerosols, and multi-satellite joint retrieval and verification are all important means for algorithm improvement.With the accelerated global climate governance and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, more and more countries have formulated and implemented a series of CH4 emission reduction measures, and China has also proposed the dual carbon target, which is steadily advancing. However, the issues of climate governance and carbon emissions are very complex, and to some extent have even become the focus of competition among countries. In this context, the development of China's atmospheric CH4 satellite remote sensing cannot be slackened and should be highly valued and vigorously developed to seize opportunities. China has deployed the launch of the next-generation carbon satellite task, which will implement the main passive observation, and significantly broaden the range of detection time and space. Finally, the spatial and temporal resolution is improved to promote an effective amount of data and realize the full range of high-precision detection, thus providing a solid foundation and strong support for realizing a dual carbon target.

TI  - On-farm soybean seed protein and oil prediction using satellite data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean [Glycine max L. (Merr.)] seed composition is receiving increased attention among farmers, agronomists, and commodity traders. Increasing the ability to predict seed quality traits such as protein and oil at the field level before harvest will provide a competitive ability to segregate quality and create an economic advantage to position the production at both domestic and global markets. Therefore, this study aims to use remote sensing satellite data to spatially predict soybean seed protein and oil concentrations at the field level before harvest time. The dataset consisted of 47 fields located in Kansas and Iowa, United States, from the 2019 to 2021 seasons. Six machine-learning approaches (ElasticNet, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and an ensemble) were tested evaluating different vegetation indices and spectral bands to predict before harvest seed protein and oil concentrations from satellite imagery. The optimal timing for training prediction models was identified within a week after the peak of the green chlorophyll vegetation index, with different spectral indices and bands of importance for each seed quality component. The XGBoost outperformed the rest of the algorithms for both seed quality traits. Overall, models reported an absolute error of 1.80 % for protein and 1.04 % for oil concentrations. Our research describes a pipeline that combines on-farm data, open access satellite imagery, an intensive use of spectral bands, and machine learning to forecast seed quality before harvest. Future research guiding crop management interventions should be directed to i) integrating major drivers of spatial variation of seed quality traits such as soil and weather data, and ii) exploring satellite data-fusion approaches and iii) assesing alternatives models such as deep learning methods.

TI  - Grassland mowing event detection using combined optical, SAR, and weather time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Habitats Directive aim to improve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Both policies require enormous monitoring, which can be facilitated by remote sensing. Use intensity, measured by mowing frequency is an important indicator of biodiversity in permanent grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing can be determined using satellite remote sensing because photosynthetically active biomass changes rapidly in response to mowing. However, the rapid regrowth of grasses requires very dense satellite time series for reliable detection. Radar time series can complement optical time series and fill in cloud-related gaps to overcome this problem. Additional weather data can support the detection of grassland mowing events, as mowing events are associated with specific meteorological conditions. However, previous studies have not fully exploited both potentials or different machine learning approaches for mowing event detection.This study presents a new transferable two-step approach to detect grassland mowing events using combined optical and SAR data and additional weather data. First, we filled cloud-related gaps in optical time series using a supervised machine learning regression with optical and SAR data. We then classified time series sequences of optical, SAR and weather data into mown and unmown using four different machine learning algorithms. We used time series of NDVI and EVI (combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), SAR backscatter, six-day interferometric coherence, backscatter radar vegetation index, backscatter cross-ratio (Sentinel-1), and temperature and precipitation sums. Our test sites are distributed across Germany and cover the entire gradient of grassland use intensities.Mowing events could be detected with F1 values of up to 89%, first cut with up to 94%. Our results show no structural advantage of infilling time series with machine learning over linearly interpolated time series. The combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 time series provided dense time series with mostly median gaps less than 20 days, which proved sufficient to reliably detect mowing events. SAR data were not essential for mowing event detection in our study, but weather data improved classification results for models trained on all areas and years. However, when the model was transferred to unknown years or areas that were not used for training, SAR data improved detection accuracy, whereas weather data degrade it. Models trained on all years but not all study sites detected mowing events with an accuracy of up to F1 = 76%. Models trained with all regions but not all years detected mowing events in untrained years with F1 up to 80%.

TI  - Earth-Observation-Based Monitoring of Forests in Germany-Recent Progress and Research Frontiers: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - One-third of Germany's land surface area is covered by forest (around 11.4 million hectares), and thus, it characterizes the landscape. The forest is a habitat for a large number of animal and plant species, a source of raw materials, important for climate protection, and a well-being refuge for people, to name just a few of its many functions. During the annual forest condition surveys, the crown condition of German forests is assessed on the basis of field samples at fixed locations, as the crown condition of forest trees is considered an important indicator of their vitality. Since the start of the surveys in 1984, the mean crown defoliation of all tree species has increased, now averaging about 25% for all tree species. Additionally, it shows a strong rise in the rate of dieback. In 2019, the most significant changes were observed. Due to the drastic changes in recent years, efforts are being made to assess the situation of the forest using different remote sensing methods. There are now a number of freely available products provided to the public, and more will follow as a result of numerous projects in the context of earth-observation (EO)-based monitoring and mapping of the forests in Germany. In 2020, the situation regarding the use of remote sensing for the German forest was already investigated in more detail. However, these results no longer reflect the current situation. The changes of the last 3 years are the content of this publication. For this study, 84 citable research publications were thoroughly analyzed and compared with the situation in 2020. As a major result, we found a shift in the research focus towards disturbance monitoring and a tendency to cover larger areas, including national-scale studies. In addition to the review of the scientific literature, we also reviewed current research projects and related products. In congruence to the recent developments in terms of publications in scientific journals, these projects and products reflect the need for comprehensive, timely, large-area, and complementary EO-based information around forests expressed in multiple political programs. With this review, we provide an update of previous work and link it to current research activities. We conclude that there are still gaps between the information needs of forest managers who usually rely on information from field perspectives and the EO-based information products.

TI  - Irrigation Cooling Effect on Local Temperatures in the North China Plain Based on an Improved Detection Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation has excellent potential for altering surface characteristics and the local climate. Although studies using site observations or remote sensing data have demonstrated an irrigation cooling effect (ICE) on the air temperature (Tem) and land surface temperature (LST), it is difficult to eliminate other stress factors due to different backgrounds. We characterized the irrigation effect as the differences (Delta) of LST and DCT (DCT = LST Tem) between irrigated and adjacent non-irrigated areas. An improved method was proposed to detect it over the North China Plain (NCP) based on satellite observations. We also investigated the effects of irrigation on Tem, precipitation, NDVI, and ET, and explored the relationships between them. The results show that irrigation induced a decrease in the daytime/nighttime LST and DCT ( 0.13/ 0.09 and 0.14/ 0.07 degrees C yr(-1)), Tem (-0.023 degrees C in spring), and precipitation (-1.461 mm yr(-1)), and an increase in NDVI (0.03 in spring) and ET (0.289 mm yr(-1)) across the NCP. The effect on nighttime LST and NDVI increased by 0.04 degrees C 10 yr(-1) and 0.003 10 yr(-1), and that on ET weakened by 0.23 mm 10 yr(-1) during 2000-2015. The ICE on the LST had evident spatiotemporal heterogeneity, which was greater in the daytime, in the spring, and in the northern area of the NCP (dry-hot conditions). The daytime ICE in the NCP and northern NCP was 0.37 and 0.50 degrees C during spring, respectively, with the strongest ICE of 0.60 degrees C in Henan; however, the ICE was less evident (<0.1 inverted perpendicular C) in the southern NCP throughout the year. The DNDVI, DET, and DTem were the main factors driving ICE, explaining approximatively 22%, 45%, and 25% of the daytime ICE, respectively. For every unit of these measures that was increased, the daytime ICE increased by about 7.3, 4.6, and 1.5 degrees C, respectively. This study highlights the broad irrigation effect on LST, ET, NDVI, and the climate, and provides important information for predicting climate change in the future. The improved method is more suitable for regions with uneven terrain and a varying climate.

TI  - A Sound Velocity Prediction Model for Seafloor Sediments Based on Deep Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The acoustic properties of seafloor sediments have always been important parameters in sound field analyses and exploration for marine resources, and the accurate acquisition of the acoustic properties of sediments is one of the difficulties in the study of underwater acoustics. In this study, sediment cores were taken from the northern South China Sea, and the acoustic properties were analyzed. Since traditional methods (such as regression equations or theoretical models) are difficult to apply in practical engineering applications, we applied remote sensing data to sound velocity prediction models for the first time. Based on the influencing mechanism of the acoustic properties of seafloor sediments, the sediments' source, type and physical properties have a great influence on the acoustic properties. Therefore, we replaced these influencing factors with easily accessible data and remote sensing data, such as parameters of granularity, distance to the nearest coast, decadal average sea surface productivity, water depth, etc., using deep neural networks (DNN) to develop a sound velocity prediction model. Compared with traditional mathematical analyses, the DNN model improved the accuracy of prediction and can be applied to practical engineering applications.

However, in the case of pT1a-b HER2-positive breast cancers, a negative impact on recurrence-free survival was observed specifically for patients with pN0(i+) and pN1mi diseases, particularly among those with pT1b tumors without adjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the pN0(i+) and pN1mi status in the decision-making process when discussing trastuzumab-based adjuvant chemotherapy for these patients.Abstract (1) Background: The independent negative prognostic value of isolated tumor cells or micro-metastases in axillary lymph nodes has been established in triple-negative breast cancers (BC). However, the prognostic significance of pN0(i+) or pN1mi in HER2-positive BCs treated by primary surgery remains unexplored. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the impact of pN0(i+) or pN1mi in HER2-positive BC patients undergoing up-front surgery on their outcomes. (2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 23,650 patients treated in 13 French cancer centers from 1991 to 2013. pN status was categorized as pN0, pN0(i+), pN1mi, and pNmacro. The effect of pN0(i+) or pN1mi on outcomes was investigated both in the entire cohort of patients and in pT1a-b tumors. (3) Results: Of 1771 HER2-positive BC patients included, pN status distributed as follows: 1047 pN0 (59.1%), 60 pN0(i+) (3.4%), 118 pN1mi (6.7%), and 546 pN1 macro-metastases (30.8%). pN status was significantly associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection, age, ER status, tumor grade, and size, lymphovascular invasion, adjuvant systemic therapy (ACt), and radiation therapy. With 61 months median follow-up (mean 63.2; CI 95% 61.5-64.9), only pN1 with macro-metastases was independently associated with a negative impact on overall, disease-free, recurrence-free, and metastasis-free survivals in multivariate analysis. In the pT1a-b subgroup including 474 patients, RFS was significantly decreased in multivariate analysis for pT1b BC without ACt (HR 2.365, 1.04-5.36, p = 0.039) and for pN0(i+)/pN1mi patients (HR 2.518, 1.03-6.14, p = 0.042). (4) Conclusions: Survival outcomes were not adversely affected by pN0(i+) and pN1mi in patients with HER2-positive BC. However, in the case of pT1a-b HER2-positive BC, a negative impact on RFS was observed specifically for patients with pN0(i+) and pN1mi diseases, particularly among those with pT1b tumors without ACt. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the pN0(i+) and pN1mi status in the decision-making process when discussing trastuzumab-based ACt for these patients.

TI  - Insight into the 1 December 2016 Mw 6.2 Juliaca Earthquake, Southern Peru, by InSAR Observations and Field Investigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 1 December 2016, an Mw 6.2 earthquake characterized by normal faulting occurred in the highlands of the central Andes in southern Peru, marking the region's largest shallow event. The occurrence of the earthquake provides a significant chance to gain insight into the regional tectonic deformation and the seismogenic mechanism of the shallow normal-faulting earthquake, as well as the regional potential seismic risk. Here, we first utilize Sentinel-1A interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to extract the coseismic and postseismic deformation associated with this earthquake and then determine the detailed coseismic slip and postseismic afterslip distribution of this event. Coseismic modeling results indicate that the coseismic rupture is mainly characterized by normal faulting with some dextral strike-slip components. Most coseismic slip is confined to a depth range of 2-12 km, indicating an obvious slip deficit area in the shallow fault part. Further postseismic modeling reveals that the majority of afterslip is concentrated at depths of 0 to 5.4 km. The relatively shallow postseismic afterslip makes up for the coseismic slip deficit area to some extent. Through a joint analysis of the inversions, seismic data, and regional geology and geomorphology, we infer that the occurrence of this 2016 normal-faulting event is a result of regional gravitational collapse. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the 2016 earthquake and great historical earthquakes near the subduction zone of the central Andes and find that the 2016 event is likely promoted in advance by these events through our calculations of the coseismic and postseismic Coulomb stress changes. Finally, we should pay more attention to the nearby Falla Huaytacucho-Condoroma fault and the western segment of the Vilcanota Fault because of their relatively high stress loading.

TI  - Research on Soil Moisture Inversion Method for Canal Slope of the Middle Route Project of the South to North Water Transfer Based on GNSS-R and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil moisture from the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project is assessed in this study. Complex and variable geological conditions complicate the prediction of soil moisture in the study area. To achieve this aim, we carried out research on soil moisture inversion methods for channel slopes in the study area using massive monitoring data from multiple GNSS observatories on channel slopes, incorporating GNSS-R techniques and deep learning algorithms. To address the issue of low accuracy in linear inversion when using a single satellite, this study proposes a multi-satellite and multi-frequency data fusion technique. Furthermore, three soil moisture inversion models, namely, the linear model, BP neural network model, and GA-BP neural network model, are established by incorporating deep learning techniques. In comparison with single-satellite data inversion, with the data fusion technique proposed in this study, the correlation is improved by 12.7%, the root mean square error is reduced by 0.217, the mean square error is decreased by 0.884, and the mean absolute error is decreased by 0.243 with the linear model. With the BP neural network model, the correlation is increased by 15.4%, the root mean square error is decreased by 0.395, the mean square error is decreased by 0.465, and the mean absolute error is reduced by 0.353. Moreover, with the GA-BP neural network model, the correlation is improved by 6.3%, the root mean square error is decreased by 1.207, the mean square error is decreased by 0.196, and the mean absolute error is reduced by 0.155. The results indicate that performing data fusion by using multiple satellites and multi-frequency bands is a feasible approach for improving the accuracy of soil moisture inversion. These research findings provide new technical means for the risk analysis of deformation disasters in the expansive soil channel slopes of the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project.

TI  - Retrieving Surface Deformation of Mining Areas Using ZY-3 Stereo Imagery and DSMs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring surface deformation is crucial for a better understanding of spatial-temporal evolution and the mechanism of mining-induced deformation, thus effectively assessing the mining-related geohazards, such as landslides or damage to surface infrastructures. This study proposes a method of retrieving surface deformation by combining multi-temporal digital surface models (DSMs) with image homonymous features using China's ZY-3 satellite stereo imagery. DSM is generated from three-line-array images of ZY-3 satellite using a rational function model (RFM) as the imaging geometric model. Then, elevation changes in deformation are extracted using the difference of DSMs acquired at different times, while planar displacements of deformation are calculated using image homonymous features extracted from multi-temporal digital orthographic maps (DOMs). Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) points and line band descriptor (LBD) lines are selected as two kinds of salient features for image homonymous features generation. Cross profiles are also extracted for deformation in typical regions. Four sets of stereo imagery acquired in 2012 to 2022 are used for deformation extraction and analysis in the Fushun coalfield of China, where surface deformation is quite distinct and coupled with rising and descending elevation together. The results show that 21.60% of the surface in the study area was deformed from 2012 to 2017, while a decline from 2017 to 2022 meant that 17.19% of the surface was deformed with a 95% confidence interval. Moreover, the ratio of descending area was reduced to 6.44% between 2017 and 2022, which is lower than the ratios in other years. The slip deformation area in the west open pit mine is about 1.22 km2 and the displacement on the south slope is large, reaching an average of 26.89 m and sliding from south to north to the bottom of the pit between 2012 and 2017, but elevations are increased by an average of about 16.35 m, involving an area of about 0.86 km2 between 2017 and 2022 due to the restoration of the open pit. The results demonstrate that more quantitative features and specific surface deformation can be retrieved in mining areas by combining image features with DSMs derived from ZY-3 satellite stereo imagery.

TI  - Mapping and Characterizing Rock Glaciers in the Arid Western Kunlun Mountains Supported by InSAR and Deep Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers (RGs) manifest the creep of mountain permafrost occurring in the past or at present. Their presence and dynamics are indicators of permafrost distribution and changes in response to climate forcing. There is a complete lack of knowledge about RGs in the Western Kunlun Mountains, one of the driest mountain ranges in Asia, where extensive permafrost is rapidly warming. In this study, we first mapped and quantified the kinematics of active RGs based on satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Google Earth images. Then, we trained DeepLabv3+, a deep learning network for semantic image segmentation, to automate the mapping task. The well-trained model was applied for a region-wide extensive delineation of RGs from Sentinel-2 images to map the landforms that were previously missed due to the limitations of the InSAR-based identification. Finally, we mapped 413 RGs across the Western Kunlun Mountains: 290 of them were active RGs mapped manually based on InSAR and 123 of them were newly identified and outlined by deep learning. The RGs are categorized by their spatial connection to the upslope geomorphic units. All the RGs are located at altitudes between 3,390 and 5,540 m with an average size of 0.26 km(2) and a mean slope angle of 17 degrees. Characteristics of the inventoried RGs provided insights into permafrost distribution in the Western Kunlun Mountains. The median and maximum surface downslope velocities of the active ones are 17 +/- 1 and 127 +/- 6 cm yr-1, respectively.

TI  - Improving the Potential of Coniferous Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation by Integrating C- and L-Band SAR Data with Feature Selection and Non-Parametric Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a significant role in terrestrial ecosystems by sequestering carbon, and forest biomass is a crucial indicator of carbon storage potential. However, the single-frequency SAR estimation of forest biomass often leads to saturation issues. This research aims to improve the potential for estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by feature selection based on a scattering mechanism and sensitivity analysis and utilizing a non-parametric model that combines the advantage of dual-frequency SAR data. By employing GF-3 and ALOS-2 data, this study explores the scattering mechanism within a coniferous forest by using results of target decomposition and the pixel statistics method. By selecting an appropriate feature (backscatter coefficients and polarization parameters) and using stepwise regression models and a non-parametric model (the random forest adaptive genetic algorithm (RF-AGA)), the results revealed that the RF-AGA model with feature selection exhibited excellent AGB estimation performance without obvious saturation (RMSE = 10.42 t/ha, R2 = 0.93, leave-one-out cross validation). The & sigma;HV, & sigma;VH, Pauli three-component decomposition, Yamaguchi three-component decomposition, and VanZyl3 component decomposition of thee C-band and & sigma;HV, & sigma;VH, & sigma;HH, Yamaguchi three-component decomposition, and VanZyl3 component decomposition of the L-band are suited for estimating the AGB of coniferous forests. Volume scattering was the dominant mechanism, followed by surface scattering, while double-bounce scattering had the smallest proportion. This study highlights the potential of investigating scattering mechanisms, sensitivity factors, and parameter selection in the C- and L-band SAR data for improved forest AGB estimation.

TI  - An autonomous task assignment and decision-making method for coverage path planning of multiple pesticide spraying UAVs
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the approaching of Agriculture 4.0 era and advancements of new technologies of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and particularly quadcopter UAVs, plant protection quadcopters are becoming increasingly popular and practical in pesticide spraying, fertilization, pollination, seeding, and other agricultural activities. One of the main problems for plant protection quadcopters is completing planning tasks efficiently and quickly. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous task assignment and decision-making method for coverage path planning by multiple cooperative quadcopters. The Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method is adopted to acquire the optimal solution for the proposed problem. Then, a simulation platform by MATLAB Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is established using the Stateflow technique, and multiple ZY-UAV-680 quadrotor UAVs are employed to carry out the actual flight tests. Finally, simulations and actual flight tests are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the autonomous optimal task assignment and decision-making method. The final results show that: the proposed method can divide multiple UAVs reasonably to several blocks; the time differences between the simulation test and real flight test are only 39.8 sec and 20.6 sec, and accounts for 6.6% and 3.9% of the spraying time spent on real flight test by three cooperative quadrotors, respectively; the optimal scheme can save 60.8 sec and 80.0 sec in the simulation tests and the real flight tests, which accounts for 10.8% and 13.2% of the time spent on average scheme, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the simulation results can match the real flight test results quite well regardless of average scheme or optimal scheme, and the optimal scheme is more efficient and timesaving than the average scheme.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Segmentation Algorithm Based on Improved Feature Extraction and Hybrid Attention Mechanism
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images is one of the hottest topics in deep learning. Compared to ordinary images, high-resolution remote sensing images possess characteristics such as higher intra-class diversity and lower inter-class separability. Additionally, the objects in these images are complex and have smaller sizes. Aiming at the classical segmentation network in remote sensing images, there are some problems, such as inaccurate edge object segmentation, inconsistent segmentation of different types of objects, low detection accuracy, and a high false detection rate. This paper proposes a new hybrid attention model (S-CA), a new coordinate efficient channel attention module (C-ECA), and a new small-target feature extraction network (S-FE). The S-CA model enhances important spatial and channel features in shallow layers, allowing for more detailed feature extraction. The C-ECA model utilizes convolutional layers to capture complex dependencies between variations, thereby better capturing feature information at each position and reducing redundancy in feature channels. The S-FE network can capture the local feature information of different targets more effectively. It enhances the recognition and classification capabilities of various targets and improves the detection rate of small targets. The algorithm is used for segmentation in high-resolution remote sensing images. Experiments were conducted on the public dataset GID-15 based on Gaofen-2 satellite remote sensing images. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved DeepLabV3+ segmentation algorithm for remote sensing images achieved a mean intersection over union (mIoU), mean pixel accuracy (mPA), and mean precision (mP) of 91.6%, 96.1%, and 95.5%, respectively. The improved algorithm is more effective than current mainstream segmentation networks.

TI  - Comparing Algorithms for Estimation of Aboveground Biomass in <i>Pinus yunnanensis</i>
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing algorithms are crucial for enhancing the accuracy of remote sensing estimations of forest biomass in regions with high heterogeneity. Herein, Sentinel 2A, Sentinel 1A, Landsat 8 OLI, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were selected as data sources. A total of 12 algorithms, including 7 types of learners, were utilized for estimating the aboveground biomass (AGB) of Pinus yunnanensis forest. The results showed that: (1) The optimal algorithm (Extreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) was selected as the meta-model (referred to as XGBoost-stacking) of the stacking ensemble algorithm, which integrated 11 other algorithms. The R-2 value was improved by 0.12 up to 0.61, and RMSE was decreased by 4.53 Mg/ha down to 39.34 Mg/ha compared to the XGBoost. All algorithms consistently showed severe underestimation of AGB in the Pinus yunnanensis forest of Yunnan Province when AGB exceeded 100 Mg/ha. (2) XGBoost-Stacking, XGBoost, BRNN (Bayesian Regularized Neural Network), RF (Random Forest), and QRF (Quantile Random Forest) have good sensitivity to forest AGB. QRNN (Quantile Regression Neural Network), GP (Gaussian Process), and EN (Elastic Network) have more outlier data and their robustness was poor. SVM-RBF (Radial Basis Function Kernel Support Vector Machine), k-NN (K Nearest Neighbors), and SGB (Stochastic Gradient Boosting) algorithms have good robustness, but their sensitivity was poor, and QRF algorithms and BRNN algorithm can estimate low values with higher accuracy. In conclusion, the XGBoost-stacking, XGBoost, and BRNN algorithms have shown promising application prospects in remote sensing estimation of forest biomass. This study could provide a reference for selecting the suitable algorithm for forest AGB estimation.

TI  - Data-Driven Soil Analysis and Evaluation for Smart Farming Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Food shortage issues affect more and more of the population globally as a consequence of the climate crisis, wars, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing crop output has become one of the urgent priorities for many countries. To raise the productivity of the crop product, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate farmland soil quality by analyzing the physical and chemical properties of soil since the soil is the base to provide nutrition to the crop. As a result, soil analysis contributes greatly to maintaining the sustainability of soil in producing crops regularly. Recently, some agriculture researchers have started using machine learning approaches to conduct soil analysis, targeting the different soil analysis needs separately. The optimal method is to consider all those features (climate, soil chemicals, nutrition, and geolocations) based on the growing crops and production cycle for soil analysis. The contribution of this project is to combine soil analysis, including crop identification, irrigation recommendations, and fertilizer analysis, with data-driven machine learning models and to create an interactive user-friendly system (Soil Analysis System) by using real-time satellite data and remote sensor data. The system provides a more sustainable and efficient way to help farmers harvest with better usages of land, water, and fertilizer. According to our analysis results, this combined approach is promising and efficient for smart farming.

TI  - Anthropogenic Object Localization: Evaluation of Broad-Area High-Resolution Imagery Scans Using Deep Learning in Overhead Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Too often, the testing and evaluation of object detection, as well as the classification techniques for high-resolution remote sensing imagery, are confined to clean, discretely partitioned datasets, i.e., the closed-world model. In recent years, the performance on a number of benchmark datasets has exceeded 99% when evaluated using cross-validation techniques. However, real-world remote sensing data are truly big data, which often exceed billions of pixels. Therefore, one of the greatest challenges regarding the evaluation of machine learning models taken out of the clean laboratory setting and into the real world is the difficulty of measuring performance. It is necessary to evaluate these models on a grander scale, namely, tens of thousands of square kilometers, where it is intractable to the ground truth and the ever-changing anthropogenic surface of Earth. The ultimate goal of computer vision model development for automated analysis and broad area search and discovery is to augment and assist humans, specifically human-machine teaming for real-world tasks. In this research, various models have been trained using object classes from benchmark datasets such as UC Merced, PatternNet, RESISC-45, and MDSv2. We detail techniques to scan broad swaths of the Earth with deep convolutional neural networks. We present algorithms for localizing object detection results, as well as a methodology for the evaluation of the results of broad-area scans. Our research explores the challenges of transitioning these models out of the training-validation laboratory setting and into the real-world application domain. We show a scalable approach to leverage state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks for the search, detection, and annotation of objects within large swaths of imagery, with the ultimate goal of providing a methodology for evaluating object detection machine learning models in real-world scenarios.

TI  - Role of the neck dissection in early-stage lower lip cancers.
T2  - Nigerian journal of clinical practice
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: In early-stage lip cancer, spread to cervical lymph nodes is extremely rare. Elective neck treatment options include suprahyoid or supraomohyoid neck dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or close follow-up. Aim: In this study, our aim was to investigate the effect of elective surgery on survival in patients operated for early-stage lip cancer.Methods: Patients who underwent surgical treatment for lower lip squamous cell carcinoma between 2005 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Age, gender, neck dissection status (yes/no), clinical and pathological T stage of the tumor, grade, and perineural invasion were recorded and 3-year and 5-year overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were estimated.Results: Thirty patients were included: 20 patients had pT1 and 10 patients had pT2 tumors. Neck dissection was performed in 13 patients. The 5-year OS rate was 90.9% and 87.8% with and without dissection, respectively. Neck dissection did not appear to affect OS (P = 0.534) in these patients. The 5-year DFS rate was 96.4% in the overall group, while it was 91.7% and 100% in patients who did or did not undergo neck dissection, respectively (P = 0.756).Discussion: Patients with or without neck dissection did not differ significantly in terms of OS and DFS. Watchful waiting with regular ultrasound imaging of the neck in patients with T1 and T2 lip tumors may be an appropriate therapeutic option.

TI  - Evaluation of yield attributes and bioactive phytochemicals of twenty amaranth genotypes of Bengal floodplain
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty vegetable amaranth (VA) genotypes were evaluated to assess the variability, associations, path coefficient, and principal component analysis (PCA) of morpho-chemical traits. The genotypes exhibited adequate antioxidant colorants, phytochemicals, and antiradical capacity with significant variations across genotypes. Genetic parameters revealed selection criteria for the majority of the traits for improving amaranth foliage yield (FY). Based on correlation coefficient, stem weight, stem base diameter, root weight, plant height, and shoot weight for significant development of FY of VA. Observing significant genotypic correlation with high positive direct effects on FY, the path coefficient (PC) of root weight, stem base diameter, stem weight, and shoot weight could contribute to the noteworthy development of FY of VA. The genotypes AA5, AA6, AA8, AA10, AA11, AA19, and AA20 might be selected for high FY, antioxidant colorants, and antiradical phytochemicals to utilize as colorants and antiradical rich superior high yielding cultivars. The first PC accounted for 37.8% of the variances, which implies a larger proportion of variable information explained by PC1. The features that contributed more to PC1 were FY, SW, STW, RW, and PH, whereas Chl b, total Chl, and Chl a contributed to the second PC. This suggests that there are significant genetic differences between amaranths in terms of biochemical and agro-morphological characteristics. The findings of the current work support plant breeders to investigate the genetic potential of the amaranth germplasm, notably in biochemical parameters. High colorants enrich genotypes that can be selected for extracting natural colorants to use in food processing industries.

TI  - Hematological Evaluation of Three Common Teleosts in Relation to The Environmental Changes from Trang Province, Thailand.
T2  - Tropical life sciences research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Hematological evaluation of fish is essential to the assessment of their physiological status. This study describes the morphometric analysis and comparison of blood cell characteristics in Zanarchopterus sp., Gerres filamentosus Cuvier, 1829 and Leiognathus decorus (De Vis, 1884). The species were collected at two locations off the coast of Trang Province, Thailand. A comparative hematological evaluation was made to assess the effects of environmental conditions on the blood of the fish. Ten individuals of each species were collected from a seagrass bed at Libong Island, where human activities are increasing, and from a secluded sandy beach. Their blood samples were analysed using the blood smear technique. Erythrocytes of all the studied fishes were either elliptical or oval. The morphometric data from both locations showed that erythrocytes were of similar size, except for those of Zanarchopterus sp. Fish from both stations showed several types of leukocytes, including neutrophils and lymphocytes.The highest proportion of leukocytes was made up of lymphocytes, followed by neutrophils. However, monocytes were only observed in fish from Libong Island and the erythrocytic nuclei of fish collected from Libong Island were both reniform and lobate. Our results show the potential of hematological evaluation as an early warning signal of environmental impacts on aquatic animals. The determination of baseline parameters could provide a tool for the monitoring of environmental quality.

TI  - Exploring the Potential Use of Sentinel-1 and 2 Satellite Imagery for Monitoring Winter Wheat Growth under Agricultural Drought Conditions in North-Western Poland
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents analyses of the potential use of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) imagery to generate models of winter wheat growth under agricultural drought vs. normal conditions identified based on potential yield losses calculated in the Agricultural Drought Monitoring System (ADMS). The analyses carried out showed the sensitivity of satellite images to agricultural drought conditions determined in ADMS. The study was conducted in a large region, the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (NUTS PL42), and the analysis covered about 22,935 polygons with winter wheat production that constituted a total area of about 108,000 ha in the period from the 1st of April to the 1st of July 2021. For S-1 data, VH and VV backscatter and the VH/VV ratio were calculated, and for S-2 data, NDVI and NDWI indices were calculated, which were used to build models of winter wheat growth under water stress and in normal conditions. The obtained results presented in this work include: (i) Development of a test version of a model describing the winter wheat crop's growth, with a preliminary assessment showing the potential for recognizing water shortage effects; and (ii) identification of promising indicators of water scarcity for crops, calculated based on S-1 and S-2 images, that could be recommended for application in remote sensing (RS) of drought effects as complementary multispectral and radar observations. The results obtained in this work also gave many clues regarding the direction and method of including satellite remote sensing in national monitoring programmes, which involves operations on many types of big data sets.

TI  - Super-Resolution Rural Road Extraction from Sentinel-2 Imagery Using a Spatial Relationship-Informed Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of agricultural and rural modernization, the informatization of rural roads has been an inevitable requirement for promoting rural revitalization. To date, however, the vast majority of road extraction methods mainly focus on urban areas and rely on very high-resolution satellite or aerial images, whose costs are not yet affordable for large-scale rural areas. Therefore, a deep learning (DL)-based super-resolution mapping (SRM) method has been considered to relieve this dilemma by using freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. However, few DL-based SRM methods are suitable due to these methods only relying on the spectral features derived from remote sensing images, which is insufficient for the complex rural road extraction task. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a spatial relationship-informed super-resolution mapping network (SRSNet) for extracting roads in rural areas which aims to generate 2.5 m fine-scale rural road maps from 10 m Sentinel-2 images. Based on the common sense that rural roads often lead to rural settlements, the method adopts a feature enhancement module to enhance the capture of road features by incorporating the relative position relation between roads and rural settlements into the model. Experimental results show that the SRSNet can effectively extract road information, with significantly better results for elongated rural roads. The intersection over union (IoU) of the mapping results is 68.9%, which is 4.7% higher than that of the method without fusing settlement features. The extracted roads show more details in the areas with strong spatial relationships between the settlements and roads.

TI  - Consistency Analysis and Accuracy Evaluation of Multi-Source Land Cover Data Products in the Eastern European Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover changes in the Eastern European Plain have important implications for regional and global ecological environments, food security, and socio-economic development. Here, three 30 m resolution global land cover data products (FROM_GLC, GlobeLand30, and GLC_FCS30) from the Eastern European Plain were analyzed and evaluated for component similarity, type confusion degree, spatial consistency, and accuracy verification. The research found that the three products provided consistent descriptions of land-cover types in the East European Plain. There was a strong correlation in the type area between the different products, with a correlation coefficient >0.85. Medium-to-high-consistency areas represented 92.31% of the total plains area. The low-consistency areas were mainly concentrated on Yuzhny Island, Kola Peninsula, and Pechora River Basin. The comparison revealed high consistency among the three products in identifying forest, cropland, water, and permanent ice/snow types. However, the consistency was poor for shrubs, wetlands, and bare land. Using the GLCVSS_V1 validation dataset, the highest overall accuracy among the assessed land cover data products was observed in the FROM_GLC (73.96%), followed by GlobeLand30 (69.80%) and GLC_FCS30 (67.29%). The FROM_GLC dataset is suitable for studying forests, tundra, water, and providing an overall representation of the region's land cover. The GLC_FCS30 dataset is more suitable for agricultural research. The differences between products arise from the differences in classification systems, algorithms, and data correction. In the future, it will be necessary to utilize the advantages of different products for data fusion, focusing on areas with high heterogeneity and easily confused types, and improving the reliability of land-cover data products.

TI  - Influence of different soil reflectance schemes on the retrieval of vegetation LAI and FVC from PROSAIL in agriculture region
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The PROSAIL model is widely used to retrieve vegetation parameters from remote sensing data in agriculture regions. Soil reflectance is a key input to the PROSAIL model, but its influence on vegetation parameters retrieval accuracy of crops is rarely discussed. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of different soil reflectance schemes on leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) retrieval accuracy based on the PROSAIL model in an agriculture region. Firstly, three sources of soil reflectance including ICRAF-ISRIC soil spectral library (SR_SSL), general spectral vectors model (SR_GSV), and ASD spectroradiometer measurement (SR_ASD) and two reflectance extraction schemes were used to generate input soil reflectance for the PROSAIL model to simulate canopy reflectance. Then, the LAI and FVC retrieval models were developed using the random forest algorithm and validated using field survey data. Determination coefficient (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE (NRMSE) were used to evaluate the accuracy of LAI and FVC retrieval. Under the direct extraction scheme, the LAI retrieval based on SR_ASD (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.613, NRMSE = 0.269) achieved better performance than SR_GSV (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.671, NRMSE = 0.294) and SR_SSL (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.762, NRMSE = 0.334), whereas the performances of FVC retrieval were comparable for SR_ASD (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.084, NRMSE = 0.136), SR_GSV (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.086, NRMSE = 0.139) and SR_SSL (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.091, NRMSE = 0.147). The influence of soil reflectance on LAI retrieval is larger than that of FVC in this study. Furthermore, soil reflectance was more important for canopies characterized by low LAI and FVC. In addition, the combination of SR_SSL and multiplication coefficients scheme could be conveniently used for large areas vegetation parameters retrieval. While SR_GSV and SR_ASD with direct extraction scheme was suitable for small areas with field survey data and more homogeneous region.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval for Sentinel-2 Based on Convolutional Neural Network Method
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol significantly affects the climate environment and public health, and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a fundamental optical characteristic parameter of aerosols, so it is important to develop methods for obtaining AOD. In this work, a novel AOD retrieval algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method that could provide continuous and detailed aerosol distribution is proposed. The algorithm utilizes data from Sentinel-2 and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) spanning from 2016 to 2022. The CNN AOD data are consistent with the AERONET measurements, with an R2 of 0.95 and RMSE of 0.049 on the test dataset. CNN demonstrates superior performance in retrieving AOD compared with other algorithms. CNN retrieves AOD well on high reflectance surfaces, such as urban and bare soil, with RMSEs of 0.051 and 0.042, respectively. CNN efficiently retrieves AOD in different seasons, but it performs better in summer and winter than in spring and autumn. In addition, to study the relationship between image size and model retrieval performance, image datasets of 32 x 32, 64 x 64 and 128 x 128 pixels were created to train and test the CNN model. The results show that the 128-size CNN performs better because large images contain rich aerosol information.

TI  - Identification and Spatial Analysis of Land Salinity in China's Yellow River Delta Using a Land Salinity Monitoring Index from Harmonized UAV-Landsat Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise identification and spatial analysis of land salinity in China's Yellow River Delta are essential for the rational utilization and sustainable development of land resources. However, the accurate retrieval model construction for monitoring land salinity remains challenging. This study constructed a land salinity retrieval framework using a harmonized UAV and Landsat-9 multi-spectral dataset. The Kenli district of the Yellow River Delta was selected as the case study area, and a land salinity monitoring index (LSMI) was proposed based on field survey data and UAV multi-spectral image and applied to the reflectance-corrected Landsat-9 OLI image. The land salinity distribution patterns were then mapped and spatially analyzed using Moran's I and Getis-Ord GI* analysis. The results demonstrated the following: (1) The LSMI-based method can accurately retrieve land salinity content with a validation determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 0.75, 1.89, and 2.11, respectively. (2) Land salinization affected 93.12% of the cultivated land in the study area, and the severely saline soil grade (with a salinity content of 6-8 g/kg) covered 38.41% of the total cultivated land area and was widely distributed throughout the study area. (3) Saline land exhibited a positive spatial autocorrelation with a value of 0.311 at the p = 0.000 level; high-high cluster types occurred mainly in the Kendong and Huanghekou towns (80%), while low-low cluster types were mainly located in the Dongji, Haojia, Kenli, and Shengtuo towns (88.46%). The spatial characteristics of various salinity grades exhibit significant variations, and conducting separate spatial analyses is recommended for future studies.

TI  - Super-Resolution Reconstruction of Remote Sensing Images of the China-Myanmar Pipeline Based on Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The safety monitoring and early warning of overseas oil and gas pipelines are essential for China, as these pipelines serve as significant energy channels. The route of the China-Myanmar pipeline in Myanmar is mountainous and covered with vegetation, changeable climate, and abundant rain, and is prone to disasters. Therefore, artificial route inspection is dangerous and inefficient. Satellite remote sensing technology has an advantage over a traditional ground survey due to its large range and long-distance capabilities, thus can aid in monitoring the safety of oil and gas transportation. To improve the resolution of remote sensing data, in this paper, we propose a Nonlocal dense receptive field generative adversarial network, using remote sensing images of the Muse section of the China-Myanmar pipeline as data. Based on super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), we use a dense residual structure to improve the network depth and introduce the Softsign activation function to optimize the problem of easy saturation and gradient disappearance. To extract deep features of the image, we proposed a residual-in-residual nonlocal (RRNL) dense block, followed by the addition of the receptive field block (RFB) mechanism at the end to extract global features. Four loss functions are combined to improve the stability of model training and the quality of reconstructed image. The experimental results show that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of the reconstructed remote sensing image of Muse section reach 30.20 dB and 0.84. Compared to conventional methods and generic deep neural networks, the proposed approach achieved an improvement of 8.33 dB and 1.41 dB in terms of PSNR and an improvement of 21.7% and 5.9% in terms of SSIM. The reconstructed images exhibit improved texture clarity and are more visible to the human eye. This method successfully achieves super-resolution reconstruction of remote sensing images for the Muse section of the China-Myanmar pipeline, enhances the details of the image, and significantly improves the efficiency of satellite remote sensing monitoring.

TI  - MCSPF-Net: A Precipitation Forecasting Method Using Multi-Channel Cloud Observations of FY-4A Satellite by 3D Convolution Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate precipitation forecasting plays an important role in disaster prevention and mitigation. Currently, precipitation forecasting mainly depends on numerical weather prediction and radar observation. However, ground-based radar observation has limited coverage and is easily influenced by the environment, resulting in the limited coverage of precipitation forecasts. The infrared observations of geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites have been widely used in precipitation estimation due to their extensive coverage, continuous monitoring, and independence from environmental influences. In this study, we propose a multi-channel satellite precipitation forecasting network (MCSPF-Net) based on 3D convolutional neural networks. The network uses real-time multi-channel satellite observations as input to forecast precipitation for the future 4 h (30-min intervals), utilizing the observation characteristics of GEO satellites for wide coverage precipitation forecasting. The experimental results showed that the precipitation forecasting results of MCSPF-Net have a high correlation with the Global Precipitation Measurement product. When evaluated using rain gauges, the forecasting results of MCSPF-Net exhibited higher critical success index (0.25 vs. 0.21) and correlation coefficients (0.33 vs. 0.23) and a lower mean square error (0.36 vs. 0.93) compared to the numerical weather prediction model. Therefore, the multi-channel satellite observation-driven MCSPF-Net proves to be an effective approach for predicting near future precipitation.

TI  - Thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events following second dose with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1: self-controlled case series analysis of the English national sentinel cohort
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Thrombosis associated with thrombocytopenia was a matter of concern post first and second doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, it is important to investigate the risk of thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events following a second dose of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines. Methods We conducted a large-scale self-controlled case series analysis, using routine primary care data linked to hospital data, among 12.3 million individuals (16 years old and above) in England. We used the nationally representative Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sentinel network database with baseline and risk periods between 8th December 2020 and 11th June 2022. We included individuals who received two vaccine (primary) doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) and two vaccine doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (OxfordAstraZeneca) vaccines in our analyses. We carried out a self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis for each outcome using a conditional Poisson regression model with an offset for the length of risk period. We reported the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic (including arterial and venous events) and haemorrhagic events, in the period of 0-27 days after receiving a second dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines compared to the baseline period (14 or more days prior to first dose, 28 or more days after the second dose and the time between 28 or more days after the first and 14 or more days prior to the second dose). We adjusted for a range of potential confounders, including age, sex, comorbidities and deprivation. Findings Between December 8, 2020 and February 11, 2022, 6,306,306 individuals were vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 and 6,046,785 individuals were vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1. Compared to the baseline, our analysis show no increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) for both BNT162b2 (IRR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.770) and ChAdOx1 (IRR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98); and similarly there was no increased risk for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) for both BNT162b2 (IRR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.41-1.85) and ChAdOx1 (IRR 1.73, 95% CI: 0.82-3.68). We additionally report no difference in IRR for pulmonary embolus, and deep vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and haemorrhagic events post second dose for both BNT162b2. Interpretation Reassuringly, we found no associations between increased risk of thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events post vaccination with second dose for either of these vaccines.

Here, using data from Microwave Humidity Sounder II (MWHS-II) onboard the Chinese Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) satellite in the Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES) Four-Dimensional Variational (4D-Var) system of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), we explore the assimilation application of the water-vapor absorption line at 183.31 +/- 1 GHz, 183.31 +/- 3 GHz and 183.31 +/- 7 GHz, as well as 183.31 +/- 1.8 GHz and 183.31 +/- 4.5 GHz, two added channels, to assess the impact of adding the 183.31 +/- 1.8 GHz and 183.31 +/- 4.5 GHz sampling channels on data assimilation and numerical weather prediction. Our findings reveal a significant increase in the specific-humidity increment, which in the middle-upper troposphere is numerically much larger than in the lower troposphere. Specifically, the assimilation of 183.31 +/- 1.8 GHz observations, positioned near the center of the water-vapor absorption line, results in a pronounced adjustment compared with the 183.31 +/- 4.5 GHz observations. And under the strong constraint of the numerical model, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the wind field diminishes more significantly (by an average of 2-4%) after assimilating the water-vapor observations at greater heights.

TI  - Are There Any Land Use Dynamics in the Upper Bistrit, a Basin, Eastern Carpathians, Romania, in the Period 1990-2021?
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to assess land use and land use change (LULC). For this purpose, supervised mapping on satellite imagery, using the European Space Agency (ESA) SNAP programme from LANDSAT databases, publicly accessible through the European Copernicus portal, was used. At the same time, an analysis of the degree of landscape fragmentation in the study area was carried out, which revealed that, because of the particular fragmentation of small polygons, the best results were obtained via analysis/supervised mapping on satellite images. This method, once validated in the field, reflects the most accurate land use pattern in the analysed area, with wide applications in studies of agriculture, biodiversity, geography, etc. Between 2000 and 2010, significant changes were registered. Artificial surfaces decreased by approximately 400 ha, showing a negative trend in the last period of the interval. Coniferous forests reached their maximum threshold in 2000 (with 114,400 ha) in conjunction with the "Grassland" class, which exceeded 16,700 ha. In 2010, a drastic decrease in "Grassland" was recorded, reaching half of the values of 1990 and 2000, now having only 15,684 ha. Land cover changes were significant when comparing the period before 1989 with 2021. This fact was due to socio-economic changes in society, in large part caused by changes in professions and the way of life of the population.

TI  - Progress and Prospect of Satellite Remote Sensing Research Applied to Methane Emissions from the Coal Industry
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance Methane is a significant and powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential over 80 times than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time scale. At the same time, methane decomposes much faster than carbon dioxide, with an average lifespan (namely, the duration an emitted molecule of methane stays in the atmosphere) of about 12 years, compared with hundreds of years for carbon dioxide. This means that compared with a reduction of carbon dioxide, a reduction of methane emissions can offer more control over the greenhouse effect, including controls on global average temperature rise in the short term. In addition, methane is also a precursor of both tropospheric ozone and carbon monoxide. Therefore, a reduction in its emissions will help reduce air pollution and improve air quality.During coal mining activities, the methane contained in the coal seam is released in a variety of ways, including escape from the coal seam in open pit mines, discharge through ventilation and drainage in underground coal mines, and release from pockets trapped in the coal matrix during mining. Escape continues during post-operation activities and coal processing. Methane in abandoned mine shafts also continues to escape from coal remaining after operations. According to data from the International Energy Agency, in 2022, global coal mine methane emissions were about 40. 5 million tons, accounting for more than 10% of total anthropogenic methane emissions. China is the largest coal producer in the world. According to the 2014 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory of the Second Biennial Update Report on Climate Change in China, methane emissions from the country's energy industry accounted for about 46% of the total emissions, mainly attributed to coal emissions from mining. Studies have shown that the increase in global anthropogenic methane emissions from 2000 to 2012 and the increase in China's methane emissions from 2010 to 2015 are both significantly impacted by China's coal mining industry. Accelerating the establishment of a dynamically updateable high-spatial-resolution methane emission inventory for the coal industry is an important starting point for promoting methane emission reductions in the coal industry.Using the short-wave infrared absorption spectrum of methane at 1. 65 mu m and 2. 3 mu m, satellite remote sensing technology has been successfully used in the detection and quantification of methane emissions in the coal industry. Satellite remote sensing detection of methane emissions in the coal industry requires close cooperation between sensors, algorithms, and detection targets. We analyze the research progress from the aspects of remote sensing satellites that can be used for the study of methane emissions in the coal industry, the corresponding methane column concentration, and emission rate inversion technology, and propose a satellite remote sensing method for building a high-spatial-resolution methane emission inventory of China's coal industry research focus.Progress The spatial scale of the methane emission capacity of the coal industry detected by remote sensing satellites has been previously divided into regional and point source types (Table 1). Regional remote sensing satellites mainly include SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI, GOSAT, etc. In order to realize the accurate observation of methane concentration, its spectral resolution is higher (within 0. 3 nm), and the band is more concentrated in the methane absorption window, so it is mainly aimed at the study of spatially large-scale and temporally long-term methane emission sources. GHGSat-D is the representative remote sensing satellite for point source methane emission targeting the coal industry. It observes an area of about 12 km(2) at a time, with a spatial resolution of 25 m. Substantial progress has been made in the detection of emissions from many coal mines around the world. In addition, the scientists found that the high spatial resolution (3. 7-60 m) imager originally used for Earth observation also can detect methane plumes in its broad absorption (2. 3 mu m) band.The methane column concentration inversion of regional satellite sensors such as SCIAMACHY, TROPOMI, and GOSAT estimates the atmospheric methane column concentration Omega(CH4) by fitting the observed spectrum to its simulated spectrum. In order to eliminate the influence of surface pressure changes, the column mass is first normalized by the dry air column concentration Omega(air), yielding the dry air column average mixing ratio X-CH4. According to the band difference of the specific configuration of the instrument, two types of algorithms, namely the full physical inversion and the CO2 proxy method, can be used. Remote sensing satellites for coal mine point source emissions can be divided into hyperspectral type and multispectral type. The former includes GHGSat-D with a spectral resolution of 0. 3 nm and AHSI, PRISMA, and EnMAP with a spectral resolution of 10 nm; the latter includes Sentinel-2 A/2B. Landsat-8/9, WorldView-3, etc.According to the spatial scale of methane emissions identified by satellite observation data, there are two main methods for estimating the methane emission rate of the coal industry: regional remote sensing satellites usually use atmospheric chemical models to invert and optimize the two-dimensional distribution of methane emissions on a regional scale, while point source remote sensing satellites estimate the emission rate of a single point source through mass conservation of methane emissions within a plume-model assumption, where a point source is generally a single facility that emits more than 10 kg/h in an area less than 3x30 m(2).Conclusions and Prospects This work recommends speeding up the construction of a "top-down" emission inventory of China's coal industry from two different scales: coal mine agglomerations and single coal mines. This work further points out three weaknesses that need to be focused on and improved in the future: 1) simplified mass balance methods using TROPOMI observations to constrain and retrieve the methane emissions over 14 large coal bases across the country; 2) detection and quantification of the methane emissions of thousands of coal mines across the country based on hyperspectral remote sensing satellites with 10 nm resolution; 3) more closely examining the internal links between remote sensing satellite observations at different scales and other observations collaboratively and analytically.

TI  - DSRSS-Net: Improved-Resolution Snow Cover Mapping from FY-4A Satellite Images Using the Dual-Branch Super-Resolution Semantic Segmentation Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is one of the regions with the highest snow accumulation in China. Although the Fengyun-4A (FY4A) satellite is capable of monitoring snow-covered areas in real time and on a wide scale at high temporal resolution, its spatial resolution is low. In this study, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has a harsh climate with few meteorological stations, was selected as the study area. We propose a deep learning model called the Dual-Branch Super-Resolution Semantic Segmentation Network (DSRSS-Net), in which one branch focuses with super resolution to obtain high-resolution snow distributions and the other branch carries out semantic segmentation to achieve accurate snow recognition. An edge enhancement module and coordinated attention mechanism were introduced into the network to improve the classification performance and edge segmentation effect for cloud versus snow. Multi-task loss is also used for optimization, including feature affinity loss and edge loss, to obtain fine structural information and improve edge segmentation. The 1 km resolution image obtained by coupling bands 1, 2, and 3; the 2 km resolution image obtained by coupling bands 4, 5, and 6; and the 500 m resolution image for a single channel, band 2, were inputted into the model for training. The accuracy of this model was verified using ground-based meteorological station data. Snow classification accuracy, false detection rate, and total classification accuracy were compared with the MOD10A1 snow product. The results show that, compared with MOD10A1, the snow classification accuracy and the average total accuracy of DSRSS-Net improved by 4.45% and 5.1%, respectively. The proposed method effectively reduces the misidentification of clouds and snow, has higher classification accuracy, and effectively improves the spatial resolution of FY-4A satellite snow cover products.

TI  - A novel approach to examining the optimal use of the cooling effect of water bodies in urban planning
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the main source of cooling in a city, water bodies play an important role in regulating the natural environment. However, there is a lack of analysis regarding the most effective methods for enhancing the cooling effect of different types of water bodies, as well as classifying the cooling effects based on parameters that affect the cooling effect. This hinders targeted optimization in urban construction. To address this gap, this study used remote-sensing data to develop a novel approach for classifying water bodies according to their actual cooling effect, and establishing a cooling effect prediction model for water bodies based on parameters that affect the cooling effect using machine learning methods. First, the cooling effect of 35 water samples from downtown Nanjing were classified by utilizing the data-mining method. Then the traditional method of classifying water bodies directly from parameters that affect the cooling effect and the classification prediction model established in this study were used to classify water bodies, respectively. It was found that the proposed classification prediction model constructed by combining unsupervised and supervised learning accurately and effectively determined the cooling effect classification of water bodies. Compared with the traditional classification method, the accuracy of the cooling effect classification by the novel approach can be improved by 1.46 times. Additionally, the study examined the correlation factors affecting the cooling effect of each class of water body and identified the most effective measures for improving the cooling effect of each class. It is noteworthy that for different classes, the most effective measures to exert the cooling effect are different. Starting from the parameters that affect the cooling effect of water bodies, this study offers targeted measures for respective water bodies to optimize their cooling density, range, and efficiency. This research provides a basis for using the cooling effect of water bodies more effectively and guiding urban planning and the construction of waterfronts.

AB  - Lakes and reservoirs, comprising surface water bodies that vary significantly seasonally, play an essential role in the global water cycle due to their ability to hold, store, and clean water. They are crucial to our planet's ecology and climate systems. This study analyzed Harmonized Sentinel-2 images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to examine the short-term changes in the surface water bodies of civril Lake from March 2018 to March 2023 with meteorological data and lake surface water temperature (LSWT). This study used the Sentinel-2 Level-2A archive, a cloud filter, the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDWI (normalized difference water index), MNDWI (modified NDWI), and SWI (Sentinel water index) methods on lake surfaces utilizing the GEE platform and the random forests (RFs) method to calculate the water surface areas. The information on the water surfaces collected between March 2018 and March 2023 was used to track the trend of changes in the lake's area. The seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) yearly and monthly changes in water areas were identified. Precipitation, evaporation, and temperature are gathered meteorological parameters that impact the observed variation in surface water bodies for the same area. The correlations between the lake area reduction and the chosen meteorological parameters revealed a strong positive or negative significant association. Meteorological parameters and human activities selected during different seasons, months, and years have directly affected the shrinkage of the lake area.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation from Sentinel-1 interferometric observations over arid regions
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an experimental methodology based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis that can provide surface (top 5 cm) soil moisture (SSM) estimations over sandy arid soils. A co-registered Single Look Complex (SLC) SAR stack as well as meteorological information are required as input of the proposed methodological workflow. The proposed methodology consists of five steps. In the first step, meteorological data are exploited to identify the snow/ice free SAR acquisition related to lowest SSM level. In the second step, interferometric (coherence and phase closure) observables over a spatial grid are calculated. In the third step, for each grid cell the ordering of SAR acquisitions according to the SSM is performed. The sorting is performed by starting from the SAR acquisition related to lowest SSM level and by exploiting coherence and backscattering information. In the fourth step, for each grid cell the coherence values due to SSM variations are calculated by exploiting the ordering of SAR acquisitions according to the SSM. In the fifth step, SSM is estimated by inverting an analytical interferometric model using coherence values due to SSM variations and phase closure information. The proposed method estimates SSM over arid regions by ordering SAR acquisitions based on SSM, by calculating coherence values due to SSM variations and by inverting an interferometric model. A case study over an arid region in California/Arizona is presented. The proposed workflow was applied in Sentinel-1 (C-band) VV-polarized InSAR observations. The estimated SSM results were assessed with independent SSM observations from a station of the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) (RMSE: 0.029 m(3)/m(3) R: 0.78) and with ERA5-Land reanalysis model data (RMSE: 0.049 m(3)/m(3) R: 0.62). In summary, the proposed methodology was able to provide accurate SSM estimations at high spatial resolution (similar to 250 m). A discussion of the benefits and the limitations of the proposed methodology highlighted the potential of interferometric observables for SSM estimation over arid regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing public awareness of the serious consequences of unresolved environmental problems is causing people to more likely experience symptoms of anxiety. Eco-anxiety is the psychological distress occurring because of people's influence on the environment, it manifests itself in a feeling of powerlessness, provokes reactive actions, and has negative social consequences. There is no common idea in literature about the content, nature, and manifestations of eco-anxiety. There is no sufficient data on personal factors of eco-anxiety, and differences in behavior of people with eco-anxiety. The purpose of this study is to describe the fundamental beliefs and strategies of behavior of people with eco-anxiety, to analyze the relationship of biographical experience, worldview, and behavioral strategies in the ecological context. The qualitative study includes analysis of semi-structured interviews about the experiences, thoughts, attitudes, and actions of participants in the most memorable environmental situations. The interviews were analyzed with the descriptive phenomenological analysis by A. Giorgi. The sample consisted of 10 people: 4 men, 6 women, 20-50 years old, with higher or incomplete higher education, average income, and access to the Internet, living in Moscow and the Moscow region. We identified two strategies of behavior: 1) spontaneous actions prompted by eco-anxiety; 2) conscious activity based inner dialogue, recognition of one's own feelings and taking the position. The worldview of the respondents: "a man is the destroyer of nature"; "a man is a part and protector of nature"; "nature must be untouched"; "resources are finite, they must be preserved" are developed on the biographical events and values. Experiences in connection with environmental problems are associated with biographical experience, worldview, and basic beliefs. Dealing constructively with one's environmental experiences is associated with the ability to find a personal position, accepting reality and one's own feelings.

AB  - One of the biggest trends in ecology over the past decade has been the creation of standardized databases. Recently, this has included live data, formal linkages between disparate databases, and automated analytics, a synergy that we recognize as the Internet of Animals (IoA). Early IoA systems relate animal locations to remote-sensing data to predict species distributions and detect disease outbreaks, and use live data to inform management of endangered species. However, meeting the future potential of the IoA concept will require solving challenges of taxonomy, data security, and data sharing. By linking data sets, integrating live data, and automating workflows, the IoA has the potential to enable discoveries and predictions relevant to human societies and the conservation of animals.

TI  - Coastal Dynamics at Kharasavey Key Site, Kara Sea, Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, acceleration of coastal erosion has been observed at many key sites of the Arctic region. Coastal dynamics of both erosional and accretional stretches at Kharasavey, Kara Sea, was studied using multi-temporal remote sensing data covering the period from 1964 to 2022. Cross-proxy analyses of the interplay between coastal dynamics and regional (wave and thermal action) and local (geomorphic and lithological features; technogenic impact) drivers were supported by cluster analysis and wind-wave modelling via the Popov-Sovershaev method and WaveWatch III. Ice-rich permafrost bluffs and accretional sandy beaches exhibited a tendency towards persistent erosion (-1.03 m/yr and -0.42 m/yr, respectively). Shoreline progradation occurred locally near Cape Burunniy (6% of the accretional stretch) and may be due to sediment flux reversals responding to sea-ice decline. Although the mean rates of erosion were decreasing at a decadal scale, cluster analysis captured a slight increase in the retreat for 71% of the erosional stretch, which is apparently related to the forcing of wind-wave and thermal energy. Erosional hotspots (up to -7.9 m/yr) occurred mainly in the alignment of Cape Kharasavey and were predominantly caused by direct human impact. The presented study highlights the non-linear interaction of the Arctic coastal change and environmental drivers that require further upscaling of the applied models and remote sensing data.

TI  - Characteristics and Evolution of the Response of the Lower Atmosphere to the Tonga Volcanic Eruption
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Research concerning the response characteristics of lower atmosphere to volcanic eruption is a key and hot topic in the field of volcanic environment research. Against the background of a submarine volcano in the South Pacific island country of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) on 15 January 2022, this paper explores the response characteristics of this volcanic eruption on environmental factors in the lower atmosphere region using a priori data such as ERA5 reanalysis data, water vapor data from GNSS inversion and surface temperature data from Landsat inversion for the Tonga Islands region. Among them, (1) The amount of precipitable water (PWV) in Tonga was abnormally high on 15 January. (2) The water vapor flux was mainly in the lower space below 850 hPa. (3) The average surface temperature in December 2021 was higher. In February 2022, the average surface temperature was lower. (4) There was a low-pressure center near 30 & DEG; S on the south side of Tonga volcano on 14 January, and a new low-pressure center was formed on the east side of Tonga volcano after the eruption of Tonga volcano on 15 January. Furthermore, the precipitation area of Tonga increased in January and decreased in February 2022. The PWV values, water vapor fluxes, temperature and circulation response characteristics, and precipitation characteristics show that the volcanic eruption affected part of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and water vapor was transported to the low-pressure center along the direction of atmospheric circulation. With the continuous water vapor transport, precipitation formed in Tonga, and the intensity and area of precipitation in Tonga increased significantly in January. Thus, the volcanic eruption could have significantly triggered the response between the low-pressure center, PWV, precipitation and surface temperature in the lower atmosphere, which influenced the environmental characteristics of this eruption.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forest fire is considered as a natural disaster and major potential threat in many parts of the world. Due to the lack of a comprehensive study in terms of the synoptic conditions of the fire incident in the studied area, the present study was conducted in order to identify the predominant synoptic patterns of fire occurrence in the western Alborz Mountains. To this end, first, the days of fire were obtained from the Department of Natural Resources of Gilan Province and the product (MCD14) Modis sensor (2007-2020). In order to determine atmospheric synoptic patterns, atmospheric maps were obtained from the NCEP site on all fire days. Totally, 240 fires occurred. Among the months of the year, July, August, and December had the highest incidence of fires. Based on the fires that occurred, three predominant synoptic patterns had the highest frequency of fires, including (1) Saudi-African high pressure dominant in the hot and cold seasons of the year, with three forms of omega blocking (16.5%), ridge (24.8%), and intrusion (22.2%), in total with a frequency of 63.5%; (2) European Migrant high-pressure system intrusion dominant in the hot period of the year, with a frequency of 21.7%; and (3) subpolar low pressure, which is generally dominant during the cold period of the year and responsible for about 14.8% of the fires in the region. Therefore, the most common occurrence of natural fires in the region is due to the high-pressure influence of Arabia and Africa in the hot and cold periods of the year.

TI  - Dolphin-shaped island: Exploring the natural resources and radiological hazards of Wadi El Gemal Island
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the natural resources and radiological risks of Wadi El Gemal Island by examining its topography, mineralogy, geochemistry, and radioactive distributions. This island, which is situated at the outlet of Wadi El Gemal in Egypt's southeastern Desert, has a unique shape resembling a dolphin based on Landsat imagery. It's a part of the Wadi El Gemal-Hamata Protectorate and is notable for its diverse environmental, geological, economic, and archeological features, including recent reefs, sandy deposits, Quaternary carbonate sediments, and mangroves. The main natural resources on the island are fauna, mangrove forests, and flora. Samples collected from the island were analyzed using a NaI detector to measure the concentrations of radionuclides such as 238U, 232Th, 226Ra, and 40K, which were found to be within acceptable levels according to UNSCAR guidelines. The radionuclide 238U, 232Th, 226Ra, and 40K activity concentrations of the collected samples were 32.55 & PLUSMN; 9, 12.63 & PLUSMN; 4, 12.49 & PLUSMN; 4, and 325 & PLUSMN; 34 Bq/kg, respectively. Regarding radiological hazard indices, the values of absorbed gamma dose rate (36.06 & PLUSMN; 5.42 nGy/h), radium equivalent activity (73.88 & PLUSMN; 14.4 Bq/kg), annual effective dose indoor (0.18 & PLUSMN; 0.03 mSv/y) and outdoor (0.04 & PLUSMN; 0.01 mSv/y), internal (0.29 & PLUSMN; 0.05) and external (0.2 & PLUSMN; 0.03) indices, and excess lifetime cancer index (0.15 & PLUSMN; 0.05 x 10-3).This is suggest that there is no significant risk associated with these sediments.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Agriculture Drought Indices for Assessing the Impact on Cereal Yield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyze the potential of different drought indices for identifying drought periods and predicting cereal yield in two semi-arid regions, Lleida in Catalonia and Kairouan in Tunisia, which have similar Mediterranean climates but different agricultural practices. Four drought indices, namely the Soil Moisture Anomaly Index (SMAI), the Vegetation Anomaly Index (VAI), the Evapotranspiration Anomaly Index (EAI), and the Inverse Temperature Anomaly Index (ITAI), were calculated from remote sensing data. Drought periods were identified from 2010/2011 to 2021/2022 based on the aforementioned indices. A correlation study between drought indices and wheat and barley yields was performed in order to select the most informative index and month for yield prediction. In the rainfed cereal area of Lleida, the strongest correlation was found between the EAI and VAI with barley yield (0.91 and 0.83, respectively) at the time of cereal maturity in June. For wheat, the strongest correlation was found between the EAI and VAI (0.75 and 0.72, respectively) at the time of cereal maturity in July. However, the VAI, EAI, and SMAI showed the best performance as an earlier indicator in March with a correlation with barley yield of 0.72, 0.67, and 0.64, respectively; the lowest standard deviation was for the SMAI. For wheat yield, the best earlier indicator was the SMAI in March, showing the highest correlation (0.6) and the lowest standard deviation. For the irrigated cereal zone of Kairouan, the strongest correlation (0.9) and the lowest standard deviation are found between the EAI and cereal yield in April. In terms of advanced prediction, the VAI shows a high correlation in March (0.79) while the SMAI shows a slightly lower correlation in February (0.67) and a lower standard deviation. The results highlight the importance of the EAI and SMAI as key indicators for the estimation and early estimation (respectively) of cereal yield.

TI  - Trend of Changes in Phenological Components of Iran's Vegetation Using Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating vegetation changes, especially plant phenology, can yield valuable information about global warming and climate change. Time series satellite observations and remote sensing methods offer a great source of information on distinctions and changing aspects of vegetation. The current study aimed to determine the trend and rate of changes in some phenological components of Iran's vegetation. In this regard, the current study employed the daily NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) product of the AVHRR sensor with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees, named AVH13C1. Then, using the HANTS algorithm, images of amplitude zero, annual amplitude, and annual phase were prepared annually from 1982 to 2019. Using TIMESAT software, the starting, end, and length of time of growing season were calculated for each pixel time series to prepare annual maps. The Mann-Kendall statistical test was used to investigate the significance of changes during the study period. On average in the entire area of Iran, the annual phase was declining with a trend of -0.6 degrees per year, and the time for the start and end of the season was declining by -0.3 and -0.65 days per year, respectively. Major changes were noticed in the northeast, west, and northwest regions of Iran, where the annual phase declined with a trend of -0.9 degrees per year. Since the annual growth cycle of the plant (equivalent to 356 days) was in the form of a sinusoidal signal, and the angular changes in the sine wave were between zero and 360 degrees, each degree of change was equivalent to 1.01 days per year. Therefore, the reduction in the annual phase by -0.9 degrees almost means a change in the time (due to the earlier negative start phase) of the start of the annual growth signal by -0.9 days per year. The time of the start and end of the growing season declined by -0.6 and -1.33 days per year, respectively. The reduction in annual phase and differences in time of the starting season from 1982 to 2019 indicate the acceleration and earlier initiation of various phenological processes in the area.

TI  - A Case of Axillary Web Syndrome Caused by Venous Blood Sampling
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary web syndrome (AWS) occurs after breast cancer surgery, sentinel lymph node dissection, or sentinel lymph node biopsy. Here, cord-like structures from the axilla to the forearm limit the range of motion of the shoulder joint and cause pain. Although the etiology is unknown, AWS has been attributed to the blockage of normal lymphatic flow. Here, we report a novel case of AWS after venous blood sampling in a patient. A healthy, 31-year-old male patient experienced pain with a limited range of motion of the shoulder joint the day after venous blood was collected from the left upper extremity for a medical checkup, and he presented to an orthopedic outpatient clinic on the day. Palpation of the axillary region disclosed a cord-like structure in the axillary region of the shoulder joint during abduction, and the patient was diagnosed with AWS. The cord-like structure was noted to be a hypoechogenic luminal structure on ultrasound (US) examination of the axilla, extending from the axilla to below the ulnar cutaneous vein from which the blood was drawn. In patients with pain and a limited range of motion of the shoulder joint, only the shoulder joint is examined during an orthopedic examination. It is important to obtain appropriate physical findings for possible AWS.

TI  - Local site conditions reduce interspecific differences in climate sensitivity between native and non-native pines
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two European pine species, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra, are experiencing dieback as a result of the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events. Recent species distribution models predicted shrinkage of ecological niches in the near future and shifted their habitat range towards the northeast. Consequently, P. sylvestris may contract its range and P. nigra may expand in Central Europe. To test whether native pine species have an advantage over introduced pine species in acclimation to a novel climate in Central Europe, we investigated the climate sensitivity and vitality of P. sylvestris, P. nigra and P. rigida. We sampled mature stands of each pine species at three sites in Central Europe, for which we determined climate-growth relationships: temporal stability of temperature and precipitation correlations with tree-ring width and resilience indices. Based on remote sensing data, we assessed differences in surface reflectance and photosynthetic activity obtained from the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our analyses revealed that the climate sensitivity and surface reflectance of pines are not due to their nativeness in Central Europe but better explained by local site conditions. The specificity and variability of drought events may determine both the homogeneous and diverse susceptibility of species to a negative water balance. Therefore, the character of future climatic extremes seems to be the key to understanding the acclimation of native and non-native pine species in Central Europe. Because our study do not provide evidence of the superiority of non-native pine species over P. sylvestris, and the potential impacts of introduced species on local habitats seem poorly understood in the face of climate change, we urge particular caution in introducing species with unrecognized invasive potential.

TI  - Contribution of Photogrammetry for Geometric Quality Assessment of Satellite Data for Global Climate Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This article reviews the role that photogrammetry plays in evaluating the geometric quality of satellite products in connection to the long-term monitoring of essential climate variables (ECVs). The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) is responsible for defining the observations required for climate monitoring. Only satellite products are capable of providing high-quality observations of a particular subset of ECVs on a global scale. Geometric calibration and validation of these products are crucial for ensuring the coherence of data obtained across platforms and sensors and reliable monitoring in the long term. Here, we analyzed the GCOS implementation plan and the data quality requirements and explored various geometric quality aspects, such as internal and external accuracy and band-to-band registration assessment, for a number of satellite sensors commonly used for climate monitoring. Both geostationary (GEO) and low-earth orbit (LEO) sensors with resolutions between 250 m and 3 km were evaluated for this purpose. The article highlights that the geometric quality issues vary with the sensor, and regular monitoring of data quality and tuning of calibration parameters are essential for identifying and reducing the uncertainty in the derived climate observations.

TI  - Exploring the environmental drivers of vegetation seasonality changes in the northern extratropical latitudes: a quantitative analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation seasonality in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has changed dramatically, but our understanding of how it responds to climate change (e.g. temperature, soil moisture, shortwave radiation) and human activities (e.g. elevated CO2 concentration) remains insufficient. In this study, we used two remote-sensing-based leaf area index and factorial simulations from the TRENDY models to attribute the changes in the integrated vegetation seasonality index (S), which captures both the concentration and magnitude of vegetation growth throughout the year, to climate, CO2, and land use and land cover change (LULCC). We found that from 2003 to 2020, the enhanced average S in the NEL (MODIS: 0.0022 yr(-1), p < 0.05; GLOBMAP: 0.0018 yr(-1), p < 0.05; TRENDY S3 [i.e. the scenario considering both time-varying climate, CO2, and LULCC]: 0.0011 +/- 7.5174 x 10(-4) yr(-1), p < 0.05) was primarily determined by the elevated CO2 concentration (5.3 x 10(-4) +/- 3.8 x 10(-4) yr(-1), p < 0.05) and secondly controlled by the combined climate change (4.6 x 10(-4) +/- 6.6 x 10(-4) yr(-1), p > 0.1). Geographically, negative trends in the vegetation growth concentration were dominated by climate change (31.4%), while both climate change (47.9%) and CO2 (31.9%) contributed to the enhanced magnitude of vegetation growth. Furthermore, around 60% of the study areas showed that simulated major climatic drivers of S variability exhibited the same dominant factor as observed in either the MODIS or GLOBMAP data. Our research emphasizes the crucial connection between environmental factors and vegetation seasonality, providing valuable insights for policymakers and land managers in developing sustainable ecosystem management strategies amidst a changing climate.

TI  - Urban land policy and urban land use efficiency: An analysis based on remote sensing and institutional credibility thesis
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethiopia has an urban land lease policy in place to facilitate the transfer of land for residential, commercial and industrial purposes. Because of the lease policy, many cities have experienced significant expansion through massive conversion of agricultural land. Although the lease policy has been in place for nearly three decades, little is known about its effectiveness in promoting sustainable urban land use. This paper examines the effects of the lease policies on urban land use efficiency (ULUE). Building on the institutional credibility thesis, this paper investigated the performance of land institutions using the urban land use efficiency approach. Remote sensing data was used to investigate urban land use efficiency through spatiotemporal analysis of land use change. Analysis of satellite imagery was performed using ArcGIS. Moreover, quantitative and qualitative data from secondary sources were studied. The study findings show that in almost all study areas, urban land use efficiency is low, which is mainly reflected in the forms of land hoarding, land banking, illegal land grabbing, informal settlement, land use fragmentation and urban sprawl. A significant portion of the land transferred for various urban uses has remained vacant or underutilised for years, in direct violation of the provisions of the lease policy. This means that the lease policy has hardly been enforced to ensure efficient urban land utilization. This demonstrates the ineffectiveness (dysfunctionality) of the existing land institutions. It is concluded that some elements of the lease policy have evolved into an empty institution, i.e., a symbolic institutional arrangement that is largely ignored by socioeconomic and political actors.

TI  - Using Landsat-5 for Accurate Historical LULC Classification: A Comparison of Machine Learning Models
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the application of various machine learning models for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in the Kerch Peninsula. The study utilizes archival field data, cadastral data, and published scientific literature for model training and testing, using Landsat-5 imagery from 1990 as input data. Four machine learning models (deep neural network, Random Forest, support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost) are employed, and their hyperparameters are tuned using random search and grid search. Model performance is evaluated through cross-validation and confusion matrices. The deep neural network achieves the highest accuracy (96.2%) and performs well in classifying water, urban lands, open soils, and high vegetation. However, it faces challenges in classifying grasslands, bare lands, and agricultural areas. The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of 90.5% but struggles with differentiating high vegetation from agricultural lands. The SVM model achieves an accuracy of 86.1%, while the AdaBoost model performs the lowest with an accuracy of 58.4%. The novel contributions of this study include the comparison and evaluation of multiple machine learning models for land use classification in the Kerch Peninsula. The deep neural network and Random Forest models outperform SVM and AdaBoost in terms of accuracy. However, the use of limited data sources such as cadastral data and scientific articles may introduce limitations and potential errors. Future research should consider incorporating field studies and additional data sources for improved accuracy. This study provides valuable insights for land use classification, facilitating the assessment and management of natural resources in the Kerch Peninsula. The findings contribute to informed decision-making processes and lay the groundwork for further research in the field.

TI  - An Overview of Endometrial Cancer with Novel Therapeutic Strategies
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) stands as the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy. In the past, it was classified based on its hormone sensitivity. However, The Cancer Genome Atlas has categorized EC into four groups, which offers a more objective and reproducible classification and has been shown to have prognostic and therapeutic implications. Hormonally driven EC arises from a precursor lesion known as endometrial hyperplasia, resulting from unopposed estrogen. EC is usually diagnosed through biopsy, followed by surgical staging unless advanced disease is expected. The typical staging consists of a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsies, with a preference placed on a minimally invasive approach. The stage of the disease is the most significant prognostic marker. However, factors such as age, histology, grade, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, tumor size, peritoneal cytology, hormone receptor status, ploidy and markers, body mass index, and the therapy received all contribute to the prognosis. Treatment is tailored based on the stage and the risk of recurrence. Radiotherapy is primarily used in the early stages, and chemotherapy can be added if high-grade histology or advanced-stage disease is present. The risk of EC recurrence increases with advances in stage. Among the recurrences, vaginal cases exhibit the most favorable response to treatment, typically for radiotherapy. Conversely, the treatment of widespread recurrence is currently palliative and is best managed with chemotherapy or hormonal agents. Most recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment for advanced and recurrent EC.

TI  - Quantifying surface fuels for fire modelling in temperate forests using airborne lidar and Sentinel-2: potential and limitations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface fuel information is an essential input for models of fire behaviour and fire effects. However, spatially explicit, continuous information on surface fuel loads and fuelbed depth is scarce because the collection of field data is laborious, while suitable methods for deriving estimates from remote sensing data are still at an early stage of development. Fine-scale surface fuel mapping using both passive and active remote sensing has not yet been carried out in Central European forest types, and it remains unexplored how prediction uncertainties of different fuel components affect modelled fire behaviour. This study combines very detailed airborne lidar and multispectral satellite data to extract metrics describing forest structure and composition in two forested areas in southwestern Germany. These metrics were used to predict field-sampled surface fuel components using random forest regression. Accuracies of continuous fuel load predictions were compared to accuracies that could be achieved if only forest type-specific average fuels were assigned. Results revealed that models based on remotely sensed metrics explain part of the variance in litter and fine dead woody fuels (R2=0.27-0.41), but not in coarser dead woody fuels. Estimates for herb and shrub fuels were fairly accurate (R2=0.55-0.64) but limited for the more fire-relevant fine fraction of shrub fuels (R2=0.39). Fuelbed depth was moderately well predicted based on remote sensing data (R2=0.44). Lidar-derived metrics were particularly useful for predicting understory fuels and fuelbed depth. Litter and fine woody fuel predictions were linked to canopy characteristics captured with both lidar and multispectral data and similarly accurate estimates could be obtained using average values based on forest type. We used the fine-scale surface fuel maps derived from remote sensing to predict potential surface fire behaviour in the study area and analysed the sensitivity of modelled fire behaviour to errors in the predicted loads of different surface fuel components: fire behaviour was most sensitive to errors in litter and especially shrub fuel loads, hence estimates of these components need to be improved. Overall, this study showed that statistical relationships between remotely sensed metrics describing forest composition and structure and surface fuels have some potential for estimating fuel loads in Central European forest types and should be further developed to provide starting points for realistic fire behaviour models.

TI  - A multi-scale algorithm for the NISAR mission high-resolution soil moisture product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a multi-scale soil moisture algorithm for the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission to estimate high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture (the water content of the soil). The algorithm takes advantage of the high-resolution (-10 [m]) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter and coarse resolution modeled/ reanalysis soil moisture products (-9 [km]) to create a high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture product at a global extent. The end goal of the algorithm is to remove dependencies on any complex modeling, tedious retrieval steps, or multiple ancillary data needs, and subsequently decrease the degrees of freedom to achieve optimal accuracy in soil moisture retrievals. The use of modeled/reanalysis soil moisture products with high temporal resolution gives an added advantage in reducing the temporal mismatch between the two different inputs used in the algorithm. In this study, the proposed algorithm is tested using L-band UAVSAR backscatter (& sigma;degrees) data and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) SAR & sigma;degrees as a substitute for the NISAR L-band SAR observations. The algorithm uses the L-band SAR & sigma;degrees to disaggregate coarse resolution (-9 [km]) reanalysis soil moisture of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) to a high-resolution of-200 [m] soil moisture product. The potential of the algorithm is demonstrated over three sites in different hydro climatic regions of the world, such as India, the USA, and Canada. The high-resolution soil moisture estimates were compared with the in-situ soil moisture measurements available for three sites (North India, Southern California, and Carman, Manitoba, Canada). In North India, in-situ measurements are from paddy crops with high vegetation water content, the unbiased root-mean-square-error (ubRMSE) for the high-resolution soil moisture retrievals was found to be 0.036 [m3/m3] with a bias of-0.051 [m3/m3]. For the southern California site, the validation statistics shows low ubRMSE of 0.027 [m3/m3] and a low bias of 0.016 [m3/m3]. At the Carman, Manitoba test site of Canada, where in-situ soil measurements were available for multiple crop types, the comparison shows that the ubRMSE for all the crop types lies below 0.05 [m3/m3] with an average bias of <0.07 [m3/m3]. The result confirms that the proposed algorithm meets the NISAR mission's accuracy goals, i.e., 0.06 [m3/m3] ubRMSE over areas with vegetation water content (VWC) below 5 [kg/m2]. Rigorous validation work will still need to be carried out in the future based on the availability of L-band SAR datasets and after the launch of the NISAR satellite.

TI  - Urban effects on precipitation: Do the diversity of research strategies and urban characteristics preclude general conclusions?
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban effect on precipitation is a potential increase or decrease of precipitation upon and around urban areas induced by urban processes such as the urban heat island, aerosol emissions, or increased surface roughness. In the last 50 years, many studies have tried to characterize the influence of urban areas on precipitation, as understanding and predicting the effect would enable its mitigation. To summarize previous investigations on the urban effect on precipitation, we review and classify the urban characteristics of studied cities and research strategies used in articles. We then analyze with machine learning the influence of these research strategies and urban characteristics on the results found by articles. Investigating over 174 experiments from 48 articles, we find that the results are mostly sensitive to the dataset type. Modeling studies and those using rain gauges and satellite data agree on an increase in precipitation caused by urban areas while studies based on radar data do not reach a consensus since many of them do not identify an effect. Also, increases in precipitation are more consensual in temperate climates than in continental climates. Future research should focus on multi-city analysis with transferable methodologies to understand the urban effect variations between cities.

TI  - Shifting Patterns of Influenza Circulation during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Senegal
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically low levels of seasonal influenza circulation were reported during the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic and were mainly attributed to implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions. In tropical regions, influenza's seasonality differs largely, and data on this topic are scarce. We analyzed data from Senegal's sen-tinel syndromic surveillance network before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess changes in in-fluenza circulation. We found that influenza shows year-round circulation in Senegal and has 2 distinct epidemic peaks: during January-March and during the rainy sea-son in August-October. During 2021-2022, the expected January-March influenza peak completely disappeared, corresponding to periods of active SARS-CoV-2 circula-tion. We noted an unexpected influenza epidemic peak during May-July 2022. The observed reciprocal circula-tion of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza suggests that factors such as viral interference might be at play and should be further investigated in tropical settings.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen in the Changshan Islands Archipelago Based on a Multiple Weighted Regression Model Considering Spatial Characteristics
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) are important nutrients for maintaining the ecological balance of seawater archipelagos. Obtaining the concentrations of the three nitrogenous compounds simultaneously can allow us to comprehensively analyze nitrogen cycling in archipelago waters, which is beneficial to the ecological protection of both agriculture and fisheries. The existing studies have usually considered a single nitrogen compound or dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), which can only identify the water quality but cannot comprehensively judge the water purification situation or the toxicity of the nitrogen compounds in the water. In the process of constructing an inversion model, only the specific bands of remote sensing imageries used in training/learning are directly related to the actual measured values, ignoring the fact that the specific bands contain information on water quality parameters is different that would affect the fitting accuracy. Furthermore, the existing empirical models and machine learning models have not yet been applied to high-resolution inversion in archipelago waters with active fishing activities. In view of this, we constructed a multiple weighted regression model considering spatial characteristics (S-WSVR) to simultaneously retrieve the distribution of NH4-N, NO2-N, and NO3-N in archipelagic waters. By using the S-WSVR model and considering the complexity of the spatial distribution of the three nitrogen compounds in the mesoscale archipelagic waters, longitude and latitude were added to the experimental dataset as spatial features to fit the nonlinear spatial relationships. Meanwhile, a multivariate weighting module based on the Mahalanobis distance was integrated to calculate the contribution of the characteristic bands and improve the inversion accuracy. The S-WSVR model was applied in the water of Changshan Islands, China, with a retrieval resolution of 30 m, and the r-values of the three nitrogen compounds achieved 0.9063, 0.8900, and 0.9755, respectively. Notably, the sum of the three nitrogen compounds has an r-value of 0.9028 when compared with the measured DIN. In addition, we obtained the Landsat 8 characteristic bands for the three nitrogen compounds and plotted the spatial distributions of the nitrogen compounds in spring and autumn from 2013 to 2022. By analyzing the spatio-temporal variations, it was apparent that the three nitrogen compounds are controlled by human activities and river inputs, and the anoxic discharge of the Yalu River has a strong influence on NO2-N content. Therefore, the accurate estimation in this study can provide scientific support for the protection of sensitive archipelago ecosystems.

TI  - SPOT: Scanning plant IoT facility for high-throughput plant phenotyping
T2  - HARDWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - Many plant phenotyping platforms have been kept out of the reach of smaller labs and institutions due to high cost and proprietary software. The Scanning Plant IoT (SPOT) Facility, located at the University of Florida, is a mobile, laboratory-based platform that facilitates open-source collection of high-quality, interoperable plant phenotypic data. It consists of three main sensors: a hyperspectral sensor, a thermal camera, and a LiDAR camera. Real-time data from the sensors can be collected in its 10 ft. x 10 ft. scanning region. The mobility of the device allows its use in large growth chambers, environmentally controlled rooms, or greenhouses. Sensors are oriented nadir and positioned via computer numerical control of stepper motors. In a preliminary experiment, data gathered from SPOT was used to autonomously and nondestructively differentiate between cultivars.

TI  - Nonparametric System for Automatic Classification of Large-Scale Statistical Data
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure of a nonparametric system for automatic classification of large-scale statistical data is proposed and substantiated. The structure of the system under consideration is made up of a technique for compressing the initial information, algorithms for automatic classification of the transformed data, and a procedure for aggregating the results obtained. To implement the functions of the system under study, new methods are used for testing hypotheses about the distributions of random variables and discretizing the range of their values. The effectiveness of the system is illustrated by the results of its application in assessing the state of forests damaged by the four-eyed fir bark beetle, according to remote sensing data.

TI  - Feasibility of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients with Axillary Conversion after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy-A Single-Tertiary Centre Experience and Review of the Literature
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - (1) Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is widely used in breast cancer patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), replacing axillary lymph node dissection. While commonly accepted for cN0 patients, its role in cN1/2 patients remains controversial. Our study aims to investigate the role of SLNB in BC patients who underwent prior NAC and compare our results to those of other studies presented in the literature. (2) Materials and methods: Our retrospective study included 102 breast cancer patients who received NAC before 99mTc-albumin Nanocolloid SLN mapping and SLNB was performed, completed or not with axillary dissection. A review based on the PRISMA statement was also carried out, encompassing 20 studies. (3) Results: The lymphoscintigraphy performed after the administration of NAC presented an identification rate (IR) of 93.13%. IR for SLNB was 94.11%, with a false-negative rate (FNR) of 7.4%. After a median follow-up of 31.3 months, we obtained a distant disease-free survival rate of 98%. The results obtained by other groups were similar to those of our study, presenting IR in the range 80.8-96.8%, with FNR varying from 0 to 22%. (4) Conclusions: on conclusion, SLNB can accurately determine the lymph node status, with an acceptable FNR and maintain its expected prognostic role with low recurrence rates, and our results are comparable to those obtained by other studies.

TI  - Mapping the National Seagrass Extent in Seychelles Using PlanetScope NICFI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses provide ecosystem services worth USD 2.28 trillion annually. However, their direct threats and our incomplete knowledge hamper our capabilities to protect and manage them. This study aims to evaluate if the NICFI Satellite Data Program basemaps could map Seychelles' extensive seagrass meadows, directly supporting the country's ambitions to protect this ecosystem. The Seychelles archipelago was divided into three geographical regions. Half-yearly basemaps from 2015 to 2020 were combined using an interval mean of the 10th percentile and median before land and deep water masking. Additional features were produced using the Depth Invariant Index, Normalised Differences, and segmentation. With 80% of the reference data, an initial Random Forest followed by a variable importance analysis was performed. Only the top ten contributing features were retained for a second classification, which was validated with the remaining 20%. The best overall accuracies across the three regions ranged between 69.7% and 75.7%. The biggest challenges for the NICFI basemaps are its four-band spectral resolution and uncertainties owing to sampling bias. As part of a nationwide seagrass extent and blue carbon mapping project, the estimates herein will be combined with ancillary satellite data and contribute to a full national estimate in a near-future report. However, the numbers reported showcase the broader potential for using NICFI basemaps for seagrass mapping at scale.

TI  - Landsat 8 and Alos DEM geological mapping reveals the architecture of the giant Mesoproterozoic Kunene Complex anorthosite suite (Angola/Namibia)
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The quasi-monomineralic composition and huge spatial extent of massif-type anorthosites make detect-ing lithological regions and boundaries challenging. We use processed Landsat 8 OLI multispectral images and ALOS digital elevation models integrated with field and petrographic observations to characterize the architecture of the >= 17,000 km2 Mesoproterozoic Kunene Complex (KC) anorthosite suite in Angola and Namibia. Images of false colour composite bands 6, 4 and 1 and band ratios 4/2 (ferric minerals), 6/5 (fer-rous minerals) and 6/7 (OH-bearing minerals), as well as assessment of the PCA and MNF matrices of eigenvectors and eigenvalues from Landsat 8 data using available spectral libraries, have substantially improved the interpretation of the Kunene Complex rock types and structures. The dataset shows that the reflectance signature of KC anorthositic rocks is primarily a function of the degree of metasomatism, which is most significant in olivine-poor rock types. The weathering intensity of the olivine-bearing anorthosite substrate is another control on the remote sensing signal.Our remote sensing and field-based approach has enabled us to divide the KC anorthosite suite into six distinct spectral and architecture domains and at least four distinct magmatic plutons when considering available high-precision geochronological data. The northernmost pluton (ca. 1380 Ma) of massive, olivine-bearing anorthosite shows distinct remote sensing signatures in the band ratio and MNF images marked by the dominance of OH-bearing and subordinate ferric minerals. The central pluton (1412- 1400 Ma) is composed of NNE-to N-striking steeply dipping interlayered olivine-bearing and olivine -poor anorthosite, which correspond to ridges of dark-coloured, low albedo rocks with subordinate slightly oxidised ferrous mineral spectral signatures, and valleys of low albedo and OH-bearing mineral spectral signatures. A NNE-striking tectonic zone along a linear belt of KC granite gneiss separates the northern and central plutons. To the south is a NNW-to NNE-striking layered pluton (ca. 1390 Ma), marked by olivine-bearing anorthosite that forms ridges and metasomatized olivine-poor and pyroxene-bearing anorthosite that forms valleys. This domain is separated from the similarly layered and E-W-striking Zebra Lobe-Oryeheke anorthosite by a top-to-the north thrust zone. A small domain of ca. 1438 Ma olivine-bearing anorthosite sensu lato is situated to the SE of the main Kunene Complex.This work highlights the variability in layered and massive textures, the extent of metasomatism, and the importance of internal tectonic boundaries in the architecture of the Kunene Complex anorthosite suite. Our approach can be applied in other anorthositic terrains and large igneous bodies elsewhere on Earth, especially those where outcrop is poor, or access is inhibited.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Higher Education Press Limited Company This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creative-commons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

TI  - Estimation of Electrical Energy Consumption in Irrigated Rice Crops in Southern Brazil
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - On average, 70% of the world's freshwater is used in agriculture, with farmers transitioning to electrical irrigation systems to increase productivity, reduce climate uncertainties, and decrease water consumption. In Brazil, where agriculture is a significant part of the economy, this transition has reached record levels over the last decade, further increasing the impact of energy consumption. This paper presents a methodology that utilizes the U-Net model to detect flooded rice fields using Sentinel-2 satellite images and estimates the electrical energy consumption required to pump water for this irrigation. The proposed approach involves grouping the detected flooded areas using k-means clustering with the electricity customers' geographical coordinates, provided by the Power Distribution Company. The methodology was evaluated in a dataset of satellite images from southern Brazil, and the results demonstrate the potential of using U-Net models to identify rice fields. Furthermore, comparing the estimated electrical energy consumption required for irrigation in each cluster with the billed energy values provides valuable insights into the sustainable management of rice production systems and the electricity grid, helping to identify non-technical losses and improve irrigation efficiency.

TI  - Multi-Temporal PSI Analysis and Burn Severity Combination to Determine Ground-Burned Hazard Zones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a seasonal phenomenon in Greece, reoccurring annually and causing adverse impacts on both human-made and natural environments. Our case study focuses on the devastating fire that took place in July 2018 in the second-housing area of Mati, East Attica. In this research, we propose a simple and effective approach that combines the deformation trend obtained from the Permanent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) analysis with the burn severity assessment aiming to identify and classify potential ground-burn hazard zones. To maximize the number of measuring points, we employ a weighted full-graph PSI approach. Additionally, we calculate the burn severity by comparing Sentinel-2 satellite images captured before and after the event. The resulting datasets are reclassified on a scale from 1 to 5, and the proposed equation yields the final product. Numerous high and very high hazard zones have been identified using this methodology. The research findings reveal the proximity between these hazard zones and the stream network. Overall, the proposed method offers valuable insights for the post-fire monitoring and management of urban and peri-urban landscapes in the affected areas.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of Woda landslide (China) using InSAR and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the slow motions of highly elevated landslides in remote mountain areas has always been a problem. This paper takes the Woda landslide along the Jinsha River as an example to monitor landslide movement. Although some parts of the landslide body have been found to have moved in recent years, the timing and magnitude of motion have not been systematically monitored or interpreted. Here, we apply the SBAS time series strategy using 65-scene Sentinel-1A/B satellite InSAR images and study the spatial distribution and temporal behaviour of landslide movements between July 4, 2018, and August 29, 2020. Our research results show that the cumulative deformation on the left side of the landslide body with concentrated deformation was approximately 200 mm during the 2-year observation period. By calculating the relationship between the InSAR time series and the precipitation around the landslide, it is found that the landslide deformation is closely related to precipitation. GNSS technology is also deployed on the landslide mass and effectively complements InSAR technology. Simultaneously, based on the results of field surveys and hydrological data analysing the landslide's spatial deformation characteristics and deformation factors, the landslide deformation can also be inferred to be related to precipitation. & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Divergent urbanization-induced impacts on global surface urban heat island trends since 1980s
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization experiences different speeds and forms under diverse development stages across the globe. However, urbanization-induced impacts on long-term surface urban heat island intensity (I-s) trends across global cities and the regulators of such impacts remain understudied Here we estimate interannual trends in daytime I-s (i.e., urban-rural differences in surface temperatures) across 511 major cities for 1985-2020 using annual averages calculated using reconstructed land surface temperature data derived from >250,000 Landsat thermal images. Our study reveals that the global mean I-s growth rate is 0.156 degrees C/decade. We further examine I-s change associated with per 1% impervious land growth (denoted as beta) in each city throughout the research period and during different periods. The global mean beta is 0.018 +/- 0.025 degrees C/% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) for the whole period, with greater values in humid than in arid climates; and the beta may change during different periods, e.g., it has more than tripled when urban impervious land exceeds 30%, indicating the spatiotemporally divergent impacts of urbanization on I-s trends across global cities. The spatial variations in beta across global cities are well correlated with rural vegetation abundance and precipitation but not with urban population. Among these three factors, rural vegetation abundance possesses the greatest standardized regression coefficient of partial least-squares model, signifying the critical role of biome background in regulating beta. The finding implies that future urbanization over densely vegetated regions should be more carefully and strategically planned due to the greater urbanization-induced surface warming effect.

TI  - Mapping and Analyses of Land Subsidence in Hengshui, China, Based on InSAR Observations
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) annual and time-series analysis of RADARSAT-2 SAR data, spanning from September 2011 to October 2022, to study the temporal-spatial characteristics of land subsidence in Hengshui, North China Plain. The data reveal two large-scale subsidence areas in Hengshui, individually located to the north of Hengshui city around the Hutuo River and to the east or south along the Fuyang, Suolu and Qingliang Rivers. The fastest subsidence arises after 2017, with the maximum rate exceeding 11 cm/year. We correlate the observed subsidence with the central table variation of groundwater depression, groundwater table variation of three confined aquifers, hydraulic head declines of three confined aquifers and the time-dependent total hydraulic head variation. We find a spatial consistency between land subsidence and groundwater depression or hydraulic head declines of three confined aquifers, and subsidence displacement and total hydraulic heads both manifest clear seasonal variability. This suggests that the subsidence is primarily caused by groundwater extraction for agricultural use. We also observe that the subsidence rates in Hengshui did not decrease but rather increased when the groundwater table significantly rose after September 2019. It is very likely that as a result of the occurrence of thick and widespread continuity of clay layers with high compressibility in the Quaternary deposit of Hengshui, a new preconsolidation head could be generated due to groundwater table drop, leading to the effective hydraulic head still existing in the aquitards even if the groundwater table rises in the aquifer systems.

TI  - Near-Field Signal Correction and Retrieval Technique for Mie Scattering Vertical Scanning Lidar
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Mie scattering lidar is a remote sensing instrument with a high spatial and temporal resolution, and it has received extensive attention in research since it has successfully been applied in the fields such as atmospheric aerosol observation, cloud and fog characteristic analysis, and pollution emission monitoring. However, most of these ground-based lidars belong to the monostatic structure with the same transmitting and receiving sites. While they are been utilized to detect tropospheric or boundary layer, the transmitting and receiving coaxial systems (limited by the reflective telescope structure) or the transmitting and receiving systems with different axes (also known as off-axis) are almost affected by the near-field blind area and overlap factor, which results in the loss of near-field signals of the lidar or the reduction of accuracy. Therefore, the data of near-field point-type probing instruments (such as horizontal visibility meter, PM2. 5 meter, and particle spectrometer) are usually required for data correction, compensation, or verification in these applications of lidar. However, the near-field atmospheric characteristics are usually essential data in meteorological, environmental, and other fields, which greatly limits the engineering and application process of the lidar. Therefore, overlap factor correction of lidar near-field signals and blind area have always restricted the practical process of lidar.Methods Based on the assumption of horizontal atmosphere uniformity, a multi-angle scanning near-field signal adaptive correction method for lidar is proposed using the vertical scanning function of the developed two-dimensional scanning lidar system. Firstly, according to the overlap factor model of an off-axis lidar system, the influence of laser beam divergence angle, telescope field angle, optical axis distance, and optical axis angle on the overlap factor is analyzed. Secondly, using the Fernald aerosol retrieval algorithm and taking the advantage of lidar vertical scanning, a multi-elevation angle correction scheme dependent on signal-to-noise (SNR) threshold is proposed to achieve adaptive scanning control of different atmospheric states. Combined with the ground extinction coefficient retrieved by the Collis method and the multiangle scanning remote sensing data, the aerosol extinction coefficient without a blind area profile is retrieved, and the effectiveness of the correction scheme under different weather conditions is compared.Results and Discussions Based on the stratification assumption of a uniform atmosphere, the multi-elevation angle scanning control and correction steps (Figs. 5 and 6) are designed to realize the adaptive scanning control for different atmospheric states. Using multi-angle scanning remote sensing data and taking the result of Collis retrieval by horizontal detection as the ground extinction coefficient, the blind area profile of the atmospheric aerosol extinction coefficient is obtained [Fig. 7 (c) and Fig. 8 (c)]. When the horizontal visibility is better than 18 km and the SNR threshold is 20, the average relative deviation of the overlap factor correction curve and the correction curve of the horizontal detection method is about 20% [Fig. 7 (d) and Fig. 8 (d)], and the average relative error of the overlap factor curve is 4. 2% (Fig. 9). Finally, a group of data with 24-h observation is shown to verify the scanning correction method (Fig. 10), and the retrieval without blind area of atmospheric aerosol can be realized.Conclusions In order to correct the near-field aerosol extinction profile of ground-based Mie scattering lidar, a vertical scanning correction method and multi-angle retrieval algorithm are proposed for near-field signals of Mie scattering lidar, and then the adaptive control of the atmospheric state is probed based on the assumption of horizontal atmosphere uniformity. Owing to the scattering lidar equation, a model of the overlap factor and blind area in the near field of the lidar is constructed, and the characteristics of the overlap factor and the blind area are analyzed and simulated based on the developed two-dimensional scanning lidar. In combination with the Fernald retrieval algorithm, a multi-elevation scanning control and correction scheme dependent on SNR is presented to realize adaptive scanning control for different atmospheric conditions. The profile of atmospheric aerosol extinction coefficient without blind area under different weather conditions is obtained by merging multi-angle scanning remote sensing data and the ground extinction coefficient obtained by the Collis method of horizontal detection, and the effectiveness of this scheme is verified. The data analysis results show that the adaptive correction of the lidar overlap factor can be achieved through seven elevations of about 15-min observation with the SNR ratio of 20 as the threshold when the horizontal visibility is better than 18 km. The mean relative deviation of the obtained calibration curve from horizontal correction is about 20%, and the mean relative error of the correction results of the overlap factor curves is 4. 2%, which can realize the retrieval of atmospheric aerosol without blind area.

TI  - Prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer patients with ultrasonic videos based deep learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To develop a deep learning (DL) model for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis using dynamic ultrasound (US) videos in breast cancer patients.Methods: A total of 271 US videos from 271 early breast cancer patients collected from Xiang ' an Hospital of Xiamen University andShantou Central Hospitabetween September 2019 and June 2021 were used as the training, validation, and internal testing set (testing set A). Additionally, an independent dataset of 49 US videos from 49 patients with breast cancer, collected from Shanghai 10th Hospital of Tongji University from July 2021 to May 2022, was used as an external testing set (testing set B). All ALN metastases were confirmed using pathological examination. Three different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with R2 + 1D, TIN, and ResNet-3D architectures were used to build the models. The performance of the US video DL models was compared with that of US static image DL models and axillary US examination performed by ultrasonographers. The performances of the DL models and ultra-sonographers were evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, gradient class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technology was also used to enhance the interpretability of the models.Results: Among the three US video DL models, TIN showed the best performance, achieving an AUC of 0.914 (95% CI: 0.843-0.985) in predicting ALN metastasis in testing set A. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.25% (52/ 61), with a sensitivity of 76.19% (16/21) and a specificity of 90.00% (36/40). The AUC of the US video DL model was superior to that of the US static image DL model ( 0.856, 95% CI: 0.753-0.959, P < 0.05). The Grad- CAM technology confirmed the heatmap of the model, which highlighted important subregions of the keyframe for ultra-sonographers ' review.Conclusion: A feasible and improved DL model to predict ALN metastasis from breast cancer US video images was developed. The DL model in this study with reliable interpretability would provide an early diagnostic strategy for the appropriate management of axillary in the early breast cancer patients.

TI  - What Confucian Eco-Ethics Can Teach Us about Solving the Dilemma of Interpreting the Concept of Sustainability
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability is at the heart of the concept of the common home. By prioritizing sustainability, we can create a better common home and ensure the well-being of present and future generations. However, there is a dilemma in the interpretation of sustainability, which is mainly characterized by the irreconcilability between "weak sustainability" and "strong sustainability". The dilemma is partly rooted in some Western philosophical traditions such as the Western separatist mindset, anthropocentrism, and technological solutionism, which have contributed to human subjugation. This paper proposes Confucian eco-ethics to resolve this dilemma. First, Confucian eco-ethics embraces the holistic worldview of "anthropocosmic" that establishes an ontological understanding of the interconnectedness and interdependence between humans and nature, which transcends the Western dichotomy of subject and object and resolves the dualism between human beings and nature. Second, Confucian eco-ethics advocates "pushing oneself to all things" and considers human beings and nature as an ethical community, which emphasizes the ethical responsibility of human beings to protect nature, thus remedying the dilemma that anthropocentrism and ecocentrism have too little or too much responsibility for nature. Third, Confucianism endorses benevolence as a core value for managing technology to achieve sustainable development, and it favors a comprehensive approach that combines technological innovation, values reform, and institutional reform to solve ecological problems. To do this, we analyze the Dujiangyan Water Hydro-Project Hydraulic Project as a case study to illustrate the practical feasibility of Confucian eco-ethics in achieving sustainable development. The conclusion suggests that Confucian eco-ethics can enrich and expand sustainability theory, offering an alternative pathway for a better common home.

TI  - Detecting Geothermal Anomalies Using Multi-Temporal Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Data in the Damxung-Yangbajain Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal energy is an eco-friendly, renewable source of underground thermal energy that exists in the interior of the earth. By tapping into these formations, fluids can be channeled to heat the rock formations above, resulting in a significantly higher land surface temperature (LST). However, LST readings are influenced by various factors such as sun radiation, cyclical variations, and precipitation, which can mask the temperature anomalies caused by geothermal heat. To address these issues and highlight the LST anomalies caused by geothermal heat, this paper proposes a methodology to efficiently and quickly calculate the multi-temporal LST leveraging of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the Damxung-Yangbajain basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This method incorporates terrain correction, altitude correction, and multi-temporal series comparison to extract thermal anomaly signals. The existing geothermal manifestations are used as a benchmark to further refine the methodology. The results indicate that the annual mean winter LST is a sensitive indicator of geothermal anomaly signals. The annual mean winter LST between 2015 and 2020 varied from -14.7 degrees C to 26.7 degrees C, with an average of 8.6 degrees C in the study area. After altitude correction and water body removal, the annual mean winter LST varied from -22.1 degrees C to 23.3 degrees C, with an average of 6.2 degrees C. When combining the distribution of faults with the results of the annual mean winter LST, this study delineated the geothermal potential areas that are located predominantly around the fault zone at the southern foot of the Nyainqentanglha Mountains. Geothermal potential areas exhibited a higher LST, ranging from 12.6 degrees C to 23.3 degrees C. These potential areas extend to the northeast, and the thermal anomaly range reaches as high as 19.6%. The geothermal potential area makes up 8.2% of the entire study area. The results demonstrate that the approach successfully identified parts of known geothermal fields and indicates sweet spots for future research. This study highlights that utilizing the multi-temporal winter LST is an efficient and cost-effective method for prospecting geothermal resources in plateau environments.

TI  - Comparing land surface temperature and mean radiant temperature for urban heat mapping in Philadelphia
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many cities are experiencing more frequent extreme heat during hot summers. With the rise of global temperature, the thermal comfort in urban areas become even worse. Quantitative information of the spatial distributions of urban heat has become increasingly important for resilience and adaptation to climate change in cities. This study compares satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) and urban microclimate modeling-based mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) for mapping the urban heat distributions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.The LST was estimated based on Landsat 8 thermal imagery with a spatial resolution of around 100 m, while the Tmrt was simulated based on high resolution LiDAR and national aerial imagery program multispectral aerial imageries with a spatial resolution of 1 m. Result shows that both LST and Tmrt show a similar general pattern of the urban heat across the study area, while the Tmrt presents much more details of the heat variations street by street and neighborhood by neighborhood. The LST tends to have a stronger relationship with the Tmrt on building roofs, which are usually not the place for human activities. This studyprovides evidence for choosing more appropriate metrics in urban heat-related studies.

TI  - Exploring the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions through a Combination of Nighttime Light and MODIS NDVI Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change caused by CO2 emissions is posing a huge challenge to human survival, and it is crucial to precisely understand the spatial and temporal patterns and driving forces of CO2 emissions in real time. However, the available CO2 emission data are usually converted from fossil fuel combustion, which cannot capture spatial differences. Nighttime light (NTL) data can reveal human activities in detail and constitute the shortage of statistical data. Although NTL can be used as an indirect representation of CO2 emissions, NTL data have limited utility. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a model that can capture spatiotemporal variations in CO2 emissions at a fine scale. In this paper, we used the nighttime light and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and proposed a normalized urban index based on combination variables (NUI-CV) to improve estimated CO2 emissions. Based on this index, we used the Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall trend analysis, standard deviational ellipse, and a spatial economics model to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics and influencing factors of CO2 emissions over the period of 2000-2020. The experimental results indicate the following: (1) NUI-CV is more suitable than NTL for estimating the CO2 emissions with a 6% increase in average R-2. (2) The center of China's CO2 emissions lies in the eastern regions and is gradually moving west. (3) Changes in industrial structure can strongly influence changes in CO2 emissions, the tertiary sector playing an important role in carbon reduction.

TI  - Multi-Source Precipitation Data Merging for High-Resolution Daily Rainfall in Complex Terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a satellite, reanalysis, and gauge data merging model for daily-scale analysis using a random forest algorithm in Sichuan province, characterized by complex terrain. A high-precision daily precipitation merging dataset (MSMP) with a spatial resolution of 0.1 & DEG; was successfully generated. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the MSMP dataset using various indices across different periods and regions, the following findings were obtained: (1) GPM-IMERG satellite observation data exhibited the highest performance in the region and proved suitable for inclusion as the initial background field in the merging experiment; (2) the merging experiment significantly enhanced dataset accuracy, resulting in a spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation that better aligned with gauge data; (3) topographic factors exerted certain influences on the merging test, with greater accuracy improvements observed in the plain region, while the merging test demonstrated unstable effects in higher elevated areas. The results of this study present a practical approach for merging multi-source precipitation data and provide a novel research perspective to address the challenge of constructing high-precision daily precipitation datasets in regions characterized by complex terrain and limited observational coverage.

TI  - Variations in Phenology Identification Strategies across the Mongolian Plateau Using Multiple Data Sources and Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data and algorithms directly affect the accuracy of phenological estimation; therefore, it is necessary to compare and verify existing phenological models to identify the optimal combination of data and algorithms across the Mongolian Plateau (MP). This study used five phenology fitting algorithms-double logistic (DL) and polynomial fitting (Poly) combined with the dynamic threshold method at thresholds of 35% and 50% (DL-G35, DL-G50, Poly-G35, and Poly-G50) and DL combined with the cumulative curvature extreme value method (DL-CUM)-and two data types-the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)-to identify the start (SOS), peak (POS), and end (EOS) of the growing season in alpine meadow (ALM), desert steppe (DRS), forest vegetation (FV), meadow grassland (MEG), and typical grassland (TYG) of the MP. The optimal methods for identifying the SOS, POS, and EOS of typical grassland areas were Poly-G50 (NSE = 0.12, Pbias = 0.22%), DL-G35/50 (NSE = -0.01, Pbias = -0.06%), and Poly-G35 (NSE = 0.02, Pbias = 0.08%), respectively, based on SIF data. The best methods for identifying the SOS, POS, and EOS of desert steppe areas were Poly-G35 (NSE = -0.27, Pbias = -1.49%), Poly-G35/50 (NSE = -0.58, Pbias = -1.39%), and Poly-G35 (NSE = 0.29, Pbias = -0.61%), respectively, based on EVI data. The data source explained most of the differences in phenological estimates. The accuracy of polynomial fitting was significantly greater than that of the DL method, while all methods were better at identifying SOS and POS than they were at identifying EOS. Our findings can help to facilitate the establishment of a phenological estimation system suitable for the Mongolian Plateau and improve the observation methods of vegetation phenology.

TI  - Super-Resolution Reconstruction of Remote Sensing Data Based on Multiple Satellite Sources for Forest Fire Smoke Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the most devastating natural disasters, and technologies based on remote sensing satellite data for fire prevention and control have developed rapidly in recent years. Early forest fire smoke in remote sensing images, on the other hand, is thin and tiny in area, making it difficult to detect. Satellites with high spatial resolution sensors can collect high-resolution photographs of smoke, however the impact of the satellite's repeat access time to the same area means that forest fire smoke cannot be detected in time. Because of their low spatial resolution, photos taken by satellites with shorter return durations cannot capture small regions of smoke. This paper presents an early smoke detection method for forest fires that combines a super-resolution reconstruction network and a smoke segmentation network to address these issues. First, a high-resolution remote sensing multispectral picture dataset of forest fire smoke was created, which included diverse years, seasons, areas, and land coverings. The rebuilt high-resolution images were then obtained using a super-resolution reconstruction network. To eliminate data redundancy and enhance recognition accuracy, it was determined experimentally that the M11 band (2225-2275 nm) is more sensitive to perform smoke segmentation in VIIRS images. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated experimentally that improving the accuracy of reconstructed images is more effective than improving perceptual quality for smoke recognition. The final results of the super-resolution image segmentation experiment conducted in this paper show that the smoke segmentation results have a similarity coefficient of 0.742 to the segmentation results obtained using high-resolution satellite images, indicating that our method can effectively segment smoke pixels in low-resolution remote sensing images and provide early warning of forest fires.

TI  - Documenting surface deformation at the first geothermal power plant in South America (Cerro Pabellon, Chile) by satellite InSAR time-series
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, Cerro Pabellon in northern Chile became the first high-enthalpy geothermal power facility to go into service in South America. We evaluated Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data containing 201 SAR scenes from the Sentinel-1A/B satellite mission between 2014 and 2021 to quantify the time-dependent surface deformation in the vicinity of the Cerro Pabellon geothermal plant. Using ascending and descending satellite orbits and the InSAR small baseline subset (SBAS) approach, we detected subsidence rates up to 6.3 mm/ yr along the line of sight near the geothermal area, which began in 2017 and persisted through 2020 at which time the deformation rate decreased. We believe that geothermal activity may be responsible for the observed deformation based on the timing of the deformation - there was no detectable deformation in the area until the start of operations of the power plant. We invert the source of ground deformation using multiple analytic elastic half-space models (one or more spheroi ds or a sill-like source). The depth of the inferred sources is between 370 and 660 meters and is similar to the depth of the reservoir as determined by surface geophysics and well data. InSAR time series have not yet detected any tectonic deformation on the faults that encircle the graben where the geothermal plant is located, nor at the graben's periphery. While the seismic records from a regional network near the geothermal field, analyzed between March 2017 and August 2020, show microseismicity in the graben near the power plant, accurate positions cannot be computed due to sparse and inadequate seismic data. Therefore, any possible correlation between the observed seismicity and the geothermal operations remains uncertain. This study emphasizes the need for an improved seismic network to obtain a better understanding of the geothermal-tectonic interplay.

TI  - Spatial and Interannual Variability of Antarctic Sea Ice Bottom Algal Habitat, 2004-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Antarctic, sea ice algae use the highly dynamic sea ice as a platform for growth. Antarctic sea ice extent has recently been highly variable, first showing a slight increase and then a record decrease starting in 2016. We investigated the response of Antarctic ice algal habitat to variations in sea ice and other environmental forcings during 2004-2019. Combining an ice growth model, remote sensing and reanalysis data, and a radiative transfer model, we assessed whether light penetration to the bottom ice was sufficient for ice algal growth. Trends in the inputs over the 16 years were relatively small: there were no changes in ice thickness or bottom ice melt date, a 6.4% decrease in snow depth, a 1.2% decrease in incident light, and a 0.8 & DEG;C decrease in air temperatures. Eighty-one percent of the sea ice cover was habitable by ice algae for & GE;14 days each year. The Antarctic has a larger extent and duration of potential ice algal habitat than the Arctic. Over time, the spatially averaged seasonal duration of habitat increased because a higher proportion of each pixel became habitable on average, compensating for the 2016-2019 reduction in sea ice extent. The spatial variability in potential habitat was strikingly high, even within geographic sectors. Bottom ice melt date (bloom termination) far surpassed other environmental factors in explaining variation (45%) in ice algal habitat on the 25 km scale. Because melt date depends on the ice-atmosphere heat balance, Antarctic ice algal habitat may be highly sensitive to future climate changes.Sea ice algae are single-celled photosynthetic organisms that grow within or at the bottom of sea ice. They tend to bloom early in the spring each year before other carbon fixers and are therefore an important food source for small marine animals. We examined how ice algae responded to spatial and temporal changes in the Antarctic environment during 2004-2019, a period that featured large swings in the amount of area covered by sea ice. We paired satellite data, which can measure where sea ice is and the depth of the snow on top of the ice, with other atmospheric data (e.g., incoming sunlight and air temperature) from models and observations to estimate where and when sea ice was potential algal habitat. There were some increases in habitable sea ice, but more importantly, we found that the spatial distribution of habitat was very patchy. This spatial unevenness suggests that whether or not sea ice is habitable is highly affected by relatively small changes in the environment and that ice algae may be quite sensitive to future climate changes.About 81% of Antarctic sea ice cover transmitted sufficient light to the bottom ice to support & GE;2 weeks of net ice algal growth each yearAn increase in the proportion of habitable area prevented a decline in potential habitat during the 2016-2019 reduction in sea ice areaPotential habitat was highly spatially variable and best explained by bottom ice melt date. It is likely sensitive to future climate change

TI  - Urban Vegetation Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery on SD-UNet and Vegetation Spectral Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation plays a crucial role in the urban ecological system. Efficient and accurate extraction of urban vegetation information has been a pressing task. Although the development of deep learning brings great advantages for vegetation extraction, there are still problems, such as ultra-fine vegetation omissions, heavy computational burden, and unstable model performance. Therefore, a Separable Dense U-Net (SD-UNet) was proposed by introducing dense connections, separable convolutions, batch normalization layers, and Tanh activation function into U-Net. Furthermore, the Fake sample set (NIR-RG), NDVI sample set (NDVI-RG), and True sample set (RGB) were established to train SD-UNet. The obtained models were validated and applied to four scenes (high-density buildings area, cloud and misty conditions area, park, and suburb) and two administrative divisions. The experimental results show that the Fake sample set can effectively improve the model's vegetation extraction accuracy. The SD-UNet achieves the highest accuracy compared to other methods (U-Net, SegNet, NDVI, RF) on the Fake sample set, whose ACC, IOU, and Recall reached 0.9581, 0.8977, and 0.9577, respectively. It can be concluded that the SD-UNet trained on the Fake sample set not only is beneficial for vegetation extraction but also has better generalization ability and transferability.

TI  - Eucalyptus Plantation Area Extraction Based on SLPSO-RFE Feature Selection and Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1/2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and efficient estimation of eucalyptus plantation areas is of paramount significance for forestry resource management and ecological environment monitoring. Currently, combining multidimensional optical and SAR images with machine learning has become an important method for eucalyptus plantation classification, but there are still some challenges in feature selection. This study proposes a feature selection method that combines multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data with SLPSO (social learning particle swarm optimization) and RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination), which reduces the impact of information redundancy and improves classification accuracy. Specifically, this paper first fuses multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, and then carries out feature selection by combining SLPSO and RFE to mitigate the effects of information redundancy. Next, based on features such as the spectrum, red-edge indices, texture characteristics, vegetation indices, and backscatter coefficients, the study employs the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) object-oriented method and three different types of machine-learning models: Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the extraction of eucalyptus plantation areas. Each model uses a supervised-learning method, with labeled training data guiding the classification of eucalyptus plantation regions. Lastly, to validate the efficacy of selecting multi-temporal data and the performance of the SLPSO-RFE model in classification, a comparative analysis is undertaken against the classification results derived from single-temporal data and the ReliefF-RFE feature selection scheme. The findings reveal that employing SLPSO-RFE for feature selection significantly elevates the classification precision of eucalyptus plantations across all three classifiers. The overall accuracy rates were noted at 95.48% for SVM, 96% for CART, and 97.97% for RF. When contrasted with classification outcomes from multi-temporal data and ReliefF-RFE, the overall accuracy for the trio of models saw an increase of 10%, 8%, and 8.54%, respectively. The accuracy enhancement was even more pronounced when juxtaposed with results from single-temporal data and ReliefF-RFE, at increments of 15.25%, 13.58%, and 14.54% respectively. The insights from this research carry profound theoretical implications and practical applications, particularly in identifying and extracting eucalyptus plantations leveraging multi-temporal data and feature selection.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between thermal environmental factors and land surface temperature of a "furnace city" based on local climate zones
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have explored multiple factors that affect the urban thermal environment. Most current studies focus on establishing the holistic quantitative relationships between the characteristics of urban thermal environmental factors and land surface temperature (LST), but less attention has been given to exploring urban subdivisions in detail. The local climate zone (LCZ) system has been proven effective in establishing the quantitative relationships between urban climate and spatial factors, thereby revealing the characteristics of LST spatial variations. This study utilized the random forest regression model to analyze the relative importance and marginal effects of the urban thermal environmental factors on seasonal LSTs based on the whole study area and the LCZ-derived built type area of Fuzhou city, known as a "furnace city" in southeastern China. The results show that: (1) Building morphology and spatial distribution exert a significant impact on LST, with the LST levels of different building forms ranked as open < compact and high-rise < mid-rise < low-rise. (2) Landscape composition exhibits the greatest influence on seasonal LSTs in the whole study city. (3) Building morphology emerges as the most influential category for LST in the LCZ built type area, with the standard deviation of building height having the highest relative importance at approximately 34%. (4) Concentrated compact low-rise self-built houses experience higher temperatures and should be a focus for future urban renewal efforts. We believe that these findings provide quantitative insights for urban heat island analysis and have substantial implications for climate-friendly urban planning.

TI  - The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy Onboard the SATech-01 Satellite
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope of the Einstein Probe mission, was successfully launched onboard the SATech-01 satellite of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on 2022 July 27. In this paper, we introduce the design and on-ground test results of the LEIA instrument. Using state-of-the-art Micro-Pore Optics (MPO), a wide field of view of 346 square degrees (18.& DEG;6 x 18.& DEG;6) of the X-ray imager is realized. An optical assembly composed of 36 MPO chips is used to focus incident X-ray photons, and four large-format complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, each of size 6 cm x 6 cm, are used as the focal plane detectors. The instrument has an angular resolution of 4 & PRIME;-8 & PRIME; (in terms of FWHM) for the central focal spot of the point-spread function, and an effective area of 2-3 cm(2) at 1 keV in essentially all the directions within the field of view. The detection passband is 0.5-4 keV in soft X-rays and the sensitivity is 2-3 x 10(-11) erg s(-1) cm(-2) (about 1 milliCrab) with a 1000 s observation. The total weight of LEIA is 56 kg and the power is 85 W. The satellite, with a design lifetime of 2 yr, operates in a Sun-synchronous orbit of 500 km with an orbital period of 95 minutes. LEIA is paving the way for future missions by verifying in flight the technologies of both novel focusing imaging optics and CMOS sensors for X-ray observation, and by optimizing the working setups of the instrumental parameters. In addition, LEIA is able to carry out scientific observations to find new transients and to monitor known sources in the soft X-ray band, albeit with limited useful observing time available.

TI  - Temperature variability and long-run economic development
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the effects of temperature variability on long-run economic development. To identify causal effects, a novel econometric strategy is employed, based on spatial first differences. Economic activity is proxied by satellite data on nightlights. Drawing on climate science, the study distinguishes between temperature variability on three time scales: day-today, seasonal, and interannual variability. The results indicate that day-to-day temperature variability has a statistically significant, negative effect on economic activity, while seasonal variability has a smaller but also negative effect. The effect of interannual variability is positive at low temperatures, but negative at high temperatures. Furthermore, the results suggest that daily temperature levels have a non-linear effect on economic activity with an optimal temperature around 15 degrees Celsius. However, most of the estimated effects of variability cannot be explained with this non-linearity and instead seem to be due to larger uncertainty about future temperature realisations. The empirical effects can be found in both urban and rural areas, and they cannot be explained by the distribution of agriculture. The results indicate that projected changes of temperature variability might add to the costs of anthropogenic climate change especially in relatively warm and currently relatively poor regions.

TI  - Effects of Thermokarst Lake Drainage on Localized Vegetation Greening in the Yamal-Gydan Tundra Ecoregion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the climate warms, the Arctic permafrost region has undergone widespread vegetation changes, exhibiting overall greening trends but with spatial heterogeneity. This study investigates an underexamined mechanism driving heterogeneous greening patterns, thermokarst lake drainage, which creates drained lake basins (DLBs) that represent localized greening hotspots. Focusing on the Yamal-Gydan region in Siberia, we detect 2712 lakes that have drained during the period of 2000-2020, using Landsat time-series imagery and an automated change detection algorithm. Vegetation changes in the DLBs and the entire study area were quantified through NDVI trend analysis. Additionally, a machine learning model was employed to correlate NDVI trajectories in the DLBs with environmental drivers. We find that DLBs provide ideal conditions for plant colonization, with greenness levels reaching or exceeding those of the surrounding vegetation within about five years. The greening trend in DLBs is 8.4 times the regional average, thus contributing disproportionately despite their small area share. Number of years since lake drainage, annual soil temperature, latitude, air temperature trends, and summer precipitation emerged as key factors influencing DLB greening. Our study highlights lake drainage and subsequent vegetation growth as an important fine-scale process augmenting regional greening signals. Quantifying these dynamics is critical for assessing climate impacts on regional vegetation change.

TI  - A Comparison of Six Forest Mapping Products in Southeast Asia, Aided by Field Validation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, many globally accessible forest mapping products can be utilized to monitor and assess the status of and changes in forests. However, substantial disparities exist among these products due to variations in forest definitions, classification methods, and remote sensing data sources. This becomes particularly conspicuous in regions characterized by significant deforestation, like Southeast Asia, where forest mapping uncertainty is more pronounced, presenting users with challenges in selecting appropriate datasets across diverse regions. Moreover, this situation impedes the further enhancement of accuracy for forest mapping products. The aim of this research is to assess the consistency and accuracy of six recently produced forest mapping products in Southeast Asia. These products include three 10 m land cover products (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring Global LC (FROM-GLC10), ESA WorldCover 10 m 2020 (ESA2020), and ESRI 2020 Land Cover (ESRI2020)) and three forest thematic mapping products (Global PALSAR-2 Forest/Non-Forest map (JAXA FNF2020), global 30 m spatial distribution of forest cover in 2020 (GFC30_2020), and Generated_Hansen2020, which was synthesized based on Hansen TreeCover2010 (Hansen2010) and Hansen Global Forest Change (Hansen GFC) for the year 2020). Firstly, the research compared the area and spatial consistency. Next, accuracy was assessed using field validation points and manual densification points. Finally, the research analyzed the geographical environmental and biophysical factors influencing consistency. The results show that ESRI2020 had the highest overall accuracy for forest, followed by ESA2020, FROM-GLC10, and Generated_Hansen2020. Regions with elevations ranging from 200 to 3000 m and slopes below 15 degrees or above 25 degrees showed high spatial consistency, whereas other regions showed low consistency. Inconsistent regions showed complex landscapes heavily influenced by human activities; these regions are prone to being confused with shrubs and cropland and are also impacted by rubber and oil palm plantations, significantly affecting the accuracy of forest mapping. Based on the research findings, ESRI2020 is recommended for mountainous areas and abundant forest regions. However, in areas significantly affected by human activities, such as forest and non-forest edges and mixed areas of plantations and natural forests, caution should be taken with product selection. The research has identified areas of forest inconsistency that require attention in future forest mapping. To enhance our understanding of forest mapping and generate high-precision forest cover maps, it is recommended to incorporate multi-source data, subdivide forest types, and increase the number of sample points.

TI  - Mapping Algal Blooms in Aquatic Ecosystems Using Long-Term Landsat Data: A Case Study of Yuqiao Reservoir from 1984-2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water eutrophication poses a dual threat to ecological and human well-being. Gaining insight into the intricate dynamics of phytoplankton bloom phenology holds paramount importance in comprehending the complexities of aquatic ecosystems. Remote sensing technologies have gained attention for mapping algal blooms (ABs) effectively, but distinguishing them from aquatic vegetation (AV) remains challenging due to their similar spectral characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a meticulous three-step methodology for AB mapping employing long-term Landsat imagery. Initially, a multi-index decision tree model (DTM) is deployed to identify the vegetation signal (VS) encompassing both AV and ABs. Subsequently, the annual maximum growth range of AV is precisely delineated using vegetation presence frequency (VPF) in conjunction with normal and low water level imagery. Lastly, ABs are accurately extracted by inversely intersecting VS and AV. The performance of our approach is thoroughly validated using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) based on a Gaofen-2 Panchromatic Multi-spectral (GF-2 PMS) image, demonstrating strong consistency with notable values of 0.822 longitudinally, 0.771 latitudinally, and 0.797 overall. The method is applied to Landsat images from 1984 to 2022 to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal variations of ABs in Yuqiao Reservoir-a significant national water body spanning a vast area of 135 km2 in China. Our findings reveal a pervasive and uneven dispersion of ABs, predominantly concentrated in the northern sector. Notably, the intensity of ABs experienced an initial surge from 1984 to 2008, followed by a subsequent decline from 2014 to 2022. Importantly, anthropogenic activities, such as fish cage culture, alongside pollution stemming from nearby industrial and agricultural sources, exert a profound influence on the dynamics of water eutrophication. Fortunately, governmental initiatives focused on water purification exhibit commendable efficacy in mitigating the ecological burden on reservoirs and upholding water quality. The methodological framework presented in this study boasts remarkable precision in AB extraction and exhibits considerable potential in addressing the needs of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Increased snow cover enhances gross primary productivity in cold and dry regions of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important control element in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) ecosystem; however, the impact of snow cover changes on gross primary productivity (GPP) is largely unknown, particularly under complex geographical conditions. In this study, we investigated the impacts of snow cover changes on different seasonal GPP and their mechanisms in different geographical zones using multisource remote sensing data from 1982 to 2018. Snow cover significantly affected GPP by nearly 15% of the TP region, and snow cover days (SCDs) were the dominant snow cover indicators affecting GPP variations compared with snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow cover end date (SCED). In general, an increase in snow cover leads to a significant increase in GPP in regions with low precipitation and temperature, but limits the accumulation of GPP in humid and warm regions. Furthermore, from the humid to the arid zone, the "moisture effect" of snow cover (by altering soil moisture) plays an increasingly important role in regulating GPP variations with increasing drought levels. This study elucidates the importance of snow cover in regulating different seasonal GPP variations and significantly improves our insight into the response of vegetation carbon uptake to snow cover changes in the TP.

TI  - Soil and Rockfill Dams Safety Assessment for Henan Province: Monitoring, Analysis and Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to explore the spatial and temporal evolution of soil and rockfill dam deformation, ensuring the safety of people's lives and healthy economic development. The spatial and temporal evolution patterns of deformation of 17 large soil and rockfill dams in Henan Province were analyzed by using the PS-InSAR technique and 55 Sentinel-1A images from March 2017 to September 2021. Based on factors such as reservoir water level and rainfall, a series of analyses were conducted on the Xiaolangdi soil and rockfill dam, which has the highest dam height and the most prominent deformation problem. The monitoring results show that all the soil and rockfill dams in Henan Province have different degrees of deformation, and there is a close relationship between dam height and deformation. In addition, the deformation rate of the Xiaolangdi soil and rockfill dam in the past five years presents a "Stepped Shape" deformation trend from the top to the bottom of the dam. The deformation of the upper, middle, and lower parts of the dam body reaches 80 mm, 40 mm, and 20 mm, respectively, among which the middle part of the dam crest has the largest deformation. Furthermore, the time series prediction model for sparrow search algorithm Long Short-Term Memory considering the moving average filter (MAF-SSA-LSTM) is proposed to predict and accurately analyze the future deformation of Xiaolangdi soil and rockfill dam with RMSE of 1.526 mm, MAE of 1.447 mm, and MAPE of 2.22%, which proved that the model has high prediction accuracy. It can truly reflect the overall deformation trend of the dam body. The results provide a theoretical basis and decision basis for the census of reservoir safety conditions and deformation history retrieval in Henan Province.

TI  - Landscape Evolution and Its Driving Forces in the Rapidly Urbanized Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a Case Study in Zhuhai City, South China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past four decades, urban expansions driven by rapid economic development and climate change have exerted profound impacts on land-use dynamics in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. However, our understanding of the interplay of different urban landscape patterns in this rapid urbanization zone remains limited. This study examines remote sensing data from 1999, 2009, and 2019 to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the urbanization impact on landscape patterns, as well as driving forces, in Zhuhai City, in the western part of the Great Bay. The findings reveal that land-use changes in Zhuhai City are primarily characterized by the conversion of cultivated land and water areas into construction land and forest land, particularly in the western part of the city. These changes may result from rapid urbanization, leading to increased fragmentation and spatial aggregation of landscape patterns. Landscape pattern changes in Zhuhai City were related to both socio-economic development and natural environment change. The urbanization has promoted the agricultural transformation with a loss of cultivated land and water areas. Additionally, this study suggests that the coordination of land use along with the protection and construction of the ecological environment is urgently needed to achieve sustainable development in the region.

AB  - Air pollution is considered one of the greatest threats to human health. This study combines a land use regression (LUR) model with satellite measurements and a distributed-lagged non-linear model (DLNM). It aims to predict high-resolution ground-level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and reveal the mechanisms of influence between NO2 and PM2.5 and precursors and meteorological factors. Results showed that the annual average NO2 and PM2.5 in the YRD urban agglomeration 2019 were 39.5 & mu;g/m(3) and 37.5 & mu;g/m(3), respectively. The seasonal variation of NO2 and PM2.5 showed winter > spring > autumn > summer. There is a compelling and complex relationship between NO2 and PM2.5. Predictors indicate that latitude (Y), surface pressure (P), ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), aerosol optical depth (AOD), residential, and rangeland have positive impacts on NO2 and PM2.5. In contrast, temperature (T), precipitation (PRE), and industrial trees hurt NO2 and PM2.5. DLNM model results show that NO2 and PM2.5 had significant associations with the included precursors and meteorological elements, with lagged and non-linear effects observed. Satellite data could help significantly increase the accuracy of LUR models; the R-2 of tenfold cross-validation was enhanced by 0.18-0.22. In 2019, PM2.5 will be the dominant pollutant in the YRD, and NO2 showed a high value in the central and eastern parts of the YRD. High concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 are present in 86% of the YRD, meaning that residents will have difficulty avoiding exposure to these two high pollution levels.

TI  - Mid-Long-Term Prediction of Surface Seawater Organic Carbon in the Southern South China Sea Based on Multi-Applicability CNN-LSTM Prediction Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The organic carbon pool is a crucial component of the ocean carbon cycle. The study of organic carbon distribution and interannual variability in the land-sea interface can contribute to understanding the global ocean carbon cycle and ecological effects in the context of the Anthropocene and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At present, there has been a certain amount of research on the source and flux of carbon in the ocean carbon cycle, but the prediction of marine carbon is still in its infancy. In this paper, a CNN-LSTM deep learning model that takes into account spatio-temporal features was used to make a 5-year mid-long-term rolling prediction of particulate organic carbon (POC) and yellow matter (CDOM) using MODIS Level 2 semimonthly synthetic data from the official website of NASA from January 2002 to June 2020. The model uses chlorophyll-a data to adjust the parameters. The results showed that the model could also be applied to the mid-long-term rolling prediction of POC and CDOM. The model was capable of accurately predicting POC and CDOM over periods of three and two years, respectively (R > 0.5). Meanwhile, the 5-year trends of the predicted and actual values were verified using the least squares method and the Mann-Kendall trend test. The results showed that the predicted and actual values of sea surface POC and CDOM in 2015-2020 showed an overall upward trend. The surface-level POC and CDOM in the ocean are considered to be related to primary production. The mid-long-term prediction of surface seawater organic carbon in the southern South China Sea helps humans explore the regional characteristics of organic carbon in the coral reef waters of the South China Sea and study the changing trend of surface seawater organic carbon.

TI  - Multi-source satellite reveals the heterogeneity in water storage change over northwestern China in recent decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwestern China (NWC) generally suffers from severe water shortages. To improve the management and utilization of the limited water storage in NWC, it is crucial to explore the distribution and variation of water storage. Here, we obtained the variations of terrestrial water storage (TWS), surface water area (SWA), and groundwater storage (GWS) in NWC (which refers to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the study) from 2002 to 2018 based on multi-source satellite data, and analyzed the factors influencing water storage changes. The results indicated that (1) SWA exhibited an increasing trend with 40.90 km2/year from 2002 to 2018 based on main lakes/reservoirs and rivers water area in NWC, due to the increase of precipitation and glacier melting. TWS and GWS showed a decreasing trend with a mean rate of -1.25 mm/year and -1.08 mm/year from 2002 to 2018 in NWC, respectively, due to the increase of arable land area and water consumption. (2) SWA in northern and southern NWC showed a decrease (-0.72 km2/year) and an increase (51.14 km2/year) from 2002 to 2018, respectively. The different rates are due to regional precipitation and temperature variations. TWS in northern and southern NWC showed a declining of -0.14 mm/year and -1.94 mm/year, respectively. GWS in northern and southern NWC showed a declining of -0.55 mm/year and -1.72 mm/year, respectively. The differences are related to the greater evapotranspiration and irrigation water consumption in southern than northern NWC. This study enriches the information on water storage in NWC and provides useful guidance for local water resource management and protection.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Algorithms in Farming Land of Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter for the circulation of water and energy exchange between surface and the atmosphere, playing an important role in hydrology, agriculture, and meteorology. Traditional methods for monitoring soil moisture suffer from spatial discontinuity, time-consuming processes, and high costs. Remote sensing technology enables the non-destructive and efficient retrieval of land information, allowing rapid soil moisture monitoring to schedule crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Satellite data with different resolutions provide different observation scales. Evaluating the accuracy of estimating soil moisture based on open and free satellite data, as well as exploring the comprehensiveness and adaptability of different satellites for soil moisture temporal and spatial observations, are important research contents of current soil moisture monitoring. The study utilized three types of satellite data, namely GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4, with respective temporal and spatial resolutions of 16 m (every 4 days), 30 m (every 16 days), and 50 m (daily). The gray relational analysis (GRA) was employed to identify vegetation indices that selected sensitivity to soil moisture at varying depths (3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm). Then, this study employed random forest (RF), Extra Tree (ETr), and linear regression (LR) algorithms to estimate soil moisture at different depths with optical satellite data sources. The results showed that the accuracy of soil moisture estimation was different at different growth stages. The model accuracy exhibited an upward trend during the middle and late growth stages, coinciding with higher vegetation coverage; however, it demonstrated a decline in accuracy during the early and late growth stages due to either the absence or limited presence of vegetation. Among the three satellite images, the vegetation indices derived from GF-1 exhibited were more sensitive to vegetation characteristics and demonstrated superior soil moisture estimation accuracy (with R2 ranging 0.129-0.928, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.078), followed by Landsat-8 (with R2 ranging 0.117-0.862, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.088). The soil moisture estimation accuracy of GF-4 was the worst (with R2 ranging 0.070-0.921, RMSE ranging 0.020-0.140). Thus, GF-1 is suitable for vegetated areas. In addition, the ETr model outperformed the other models in both accuracy and stability (ETr model: R2 ranging from 0.117 to 0.928, RMSE ranging from 0.021 to 0.091; RF model: R2 ranging from 0.225 to 0.926, RMSE ranging from 0.019 to 0.085; LR model: R2 ranging from 0.048 to 0.733, RMSE ranging from 0.030 to 0.144). Utilizing GF-1 is recommended to construct the ETr model for assessing soil moisture variations in the farming land of northern China. Therefore, in cases where there are limited ground sample data, it is advisable to utilize high-spatiotemporal-resolution remote sensing data, along with machine learning algorithms such as ETr and RF, which are suitable for small samples, for soil moisture estimation.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Target Detection and Recognition Based on YOLOv5
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main task of remote sensing image target detection is to locate and classify the targets of interest in remote sensing images, which plays an important role in intelligence investigation, disaster relief, industrial application, and other fields. However, the targets in the remote sensing image scene have special problems such as special perspective, scale diversity, multi-direction, small targets, and high background complexity. In this paper, the YOLOv5 target detection algorithm is improved according to the above characteristics. Aiming at the problem of large target size span in remote sensing images, this paper uses K-Means++ clustering algorithm to eliminate the problem in which the original clustering algorithm is sensitive to initial position, noise, and outliers, and optimizes the instability caused by K-Means clustering to obtain preset anchor frames. Aiming at the redundancy of background information around the location of remote sensing image targets, the large number of small targets, and the denseness of targets, a double IoU-aware decoupling head (DDH) is introduced at the output end to replace the coupled yolo head, which eliminates the interference caused by different task sharing parameters. At the same time, the correlation between positioning accuracy and classification accuracy is improved by the IoU-aware method. The attention mechanism is introduced into the backbone network to optimize the detection and small target detection in complex backgrounds. The mAP of the improved YOLOv5 algorithm is improved by 9%, and the detection effect of small targets and dense targets is significantly improved. At the same time, the paper has achieved good results through the verification of the DIOR remote sensing data set and has also achieved good performance advantages in comparison with other models.

TI  - Pre-operative localisation of axillary lymph nodes using radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags: a feasibility assessment in 75 cases
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of using radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags for the localisation of axillary nodes prior to targeted excision in a National Health Service (NHS) breast unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective data collection was carried out to analyse the first 75 cases of RFID-targeted axillary nodes inserted between 12 June 2019 and 27 October 2022, during which an overall total of 1,296 breast and axillary tags were deployed in 1,120 patients.RESULTS: Of the 75 axillary tags, 70 (93%) had a primary breast cancer and five (7%) had no known breast cancer but had an abnormal node targeted for diagnostic excision. Of the 70 with breast cancer, 20 (29%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) including one neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy. Localisations were performed an average of 11 days before surgery (median 6, range 1-95; n1/475). Patients undergoing NAC had their tags inserted after completing treatment due to the artefact caused by the tags on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tag deployment had a 100% success rate, with 62 tags (83%) lying within the node and 13 tags (17%) lying directly adjacent to the node, either in direct contact (nine of 13), or a maximum of 8 mm from the target (four of 13). All tags and their respective nodes were excised successfully at surgery with no significant complications. There were four cases of tag dislodgement during excision, but overall, this did not compromise retrieval of the tag or the node.CONCLUSIONS: The use of RFID tags for the preoperative localisation of axillary nodes is safe and feasible.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal College of Radiologists.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation and Quantitative Attribution of Carbon Storage Based on Multiple Satellite Data and a Coupled Model for Jinan City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly predicting and revealing the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of land-use changes in carbon storage within megacities under different scenarios is crucial to achieving sustainable development. In this study, Jinan City (JNC) is taken as the study area, and the Markov-FLUS-InVEST model is utilized to predict and analyze the spatiotemporal variation in carbon storage in 2030 under three scenarios, namely, the natural development scenario (S1), the ecological conservation scenario (S2), and the economic development scenario (S3). The drivers of carbon storage changes were identified using an optimal parameter-based geographic detection (OPGD) model. The findings indicate that (1) land use from 2010 to 2018 shows a trend of continuous expansion of construction land and reduction in arable land. (2) The main types of carbon pools were cropland, forest, and grassland, accounting for more than 96% of the total amount. Carbon storage showed a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2018, and the main type of carbon pool that decreased was cropland. The center of gravity of carbon storage increases and decreases was located in the southern Lixia District, and the center of gravity of increase and decrease moved to the southwest by 3057.48 m and 1478.57 m, respectively. (3) From 2018 to 2030, the reductions in carbon stocks were 3.20 x 106 t (S1), 2.60 x 106 t (S2), and 4.26 x 106 t (S3), and the carbon release was about 9 times (S1), 4 times (S2), and 10 times (S3) that of the carbon sink. (4) The contribution of slope (A2) boolean AND nighttime light index (B6) and elevation (A1) boolean AND nighttime light index (B6) to the regional heterogeneity of carbon stocks was the largest among the interaction drivers. To sum up, this study deepens the simulation of spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon storage under land-use changes in megacities and the related driving mechanism, which can provide the basis for scientific decision-making for cities to conduct territorial spatial planning and ecological protection and restoration.

TI  - Enhancing Spatial Resolution of GNSS-R Soil Moisture Retrieval through XGBoost Algorithm-Based Downscaling Approach: A Case Study in the Southern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of soil moisture (SM) using the Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique has become a prominent topic in recent years. Although prior research has reached a spatial resolution of up to 9 km through the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), it is insufficient to meet the requirements of higher spatial resolutions for hydrological or agricultural applications. In this paper, we present an SM downscaling method that fuses CYGNSS and SMAP SM. This method aims to construct a dataset of CYGNSS observables, auxiliary variables, and SMAP SM (36 km) products. It then establishes their nonlinear relationship at the same scale and finally builds a downscale retrieval model of SM using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Focusing on the southern United States, the results indicate that the SM downscaling method exhibits robust performance during both the training and testing processes, enabling the generation of a CYGNSS SM product with a 1 day/3 km resolution. Compared to existing methods, the spatial resolution is increased threefold. Furthermore, in situ sites are utilized to validate the downscaled SM, and spatial correlation analysis is conducted using MODIS EVI and MODIS ET products. The CYGNSS SM obtained by the downscaling model exhibits favorable correlations. The high temporal and spatial resolution characteristics of GNSS-R are fully leveraged through the downscaled method proposed. Furthermore, this work provides a new perspective for enhancing the spatial resolution of SM retrieval using the GNSS-R technique.

TI  - Supraglacial Lake Evolution over Northeast Greenland Using Deep Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes in Greenland are highly dynamic hydrological features in which glacial meltwater cumulates, allowing for the loss and transport of freshwater from a glacial surface to the ocean or a nearby waterbody. Standard supraglacial lake monitoring techniques, specifically image segmentation, rely heavily on a series of region-dependent thresholds, limiting the adaptability of the algorithm to different illumination and surface variations, while being susceptible to the inclusion of false positives such as shadows. In this study, a supraglacial lake segmentation algorithm is developed for Sentinel-2 images based on a deep learning architecture (U-Net) to evaluate the suitability of artificial intelligence techniques in this domain. Additionally, a deep learning-based cloud segmentation tool developed specifically for polar regions is implemented in the processing chain to remove cloudy imagery from the analysis. Using this technique, a time series of supraglacial lake development is created for the 2016 to 2022 melt seasons over Nioghalvfjerdsbrae (79(circle) N Glacier) and Zachariae Isstrom in Northeast Greenland, an area that covers 26,302 km(2) and represents roughly 10% of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. The total lake area was found to have a strong interannual variability, with the largest peak lake area of 380 km(2) in 2019 and the smallest peak lake area of 67 km(2) in 2018. These results were then compared against an algorithm based on a thresholding technique to evaluate the agreement of the methodologies. The deep learning-based time series shows a similar trend to that produced by a previously published thresholding technique, while being smoother and more encompassing of meltwater in higher-melt periods. Additionally, while not completely eliminating them, the deep learning model significantly reduces the inclusion of shadows as false positives. Overall, the use of deep learning on multispectral images for the purpose of supraglacial lake segmentation proves to be advantageous.

TI  - Calibration of the SNPP and NOAA 20 VIIRS sensors for continuity of the MODIS climate data records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate long-term sensor calibration and periodic re-processing to ensure consistency and continuity of atmospheric, land and ocean geophysical retrievals from space within the mission period and across different missions is a major requirement of climate data records. In this work, we applied the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC)-based vicarious calibration technique over Libya-4 desert site to perform calibration analysis of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. For both VIIRS sensors we characterized residual linear calibration trends and cross-calibrated both sensors to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua regarded as a calibration standard. The relative spectral response (RSR) differences were accounted for using the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) hyperspectral surface reflectance data. Our results agree with independent vicarious calibration results of both the MODIS/VIIRS Characterization Support Team as well as the CERES Imager and Geostationary Calibration Group within estimated uncertainty of 1-2%. Analysis of MAIAC geophysical products with the new calibration shows a high level of agreement of MAIAC aerosol, surface reflectance and NDVI records between MODIS and VIIRS. Excluding high aerosol optical depth (AOD), all three sensors agree in AOD with mean difference (MD) less than 0.01 and residual mean squared difference rmsd - 0.04. Spectral geometrically normalized surface reflectance agrees within rmsd of 0.003-0.005 in the visible and 0.01-0.012 at longer wavelengths. The residual surface reflectance differences are fully explained by differences in spectral filter functions. Finally, difference in NDVI is characterized by rmsd 0.02 and MD less than 0.003 for NDVI based on VIIRS imagery bands I1/I2 and less than 0.01 for NDVI based on VIIRS radiometric bands M5/M7. In practical sense, these numbers indicate consistency and continuity in MAIAC records ensuring the smooth transition from MODIS to VIIRS.

TI  - UCTNet with Dual-Flow Architecture: Snow Coverage Mapping with Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing (RS) has been drawing considerable research interest in land-cover classification due to its low price, short revisit time, and large coverage. However, clouds pose a significant challenge, occluding the objects on satellite RS images. In addition, snow coverage mapping plays a vital role in studying hydrology and climatology and investigating crop disease overwintering for smart agriculture. Distinguishing snow from clouds is challenging since they share similar color and reflection characteristics. Conventional approaches with manual thresholding and machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM and Random Forest) could not fully extract useful information, while current deep-learning methods, e.g., CNNs or Transformer models, still have limitations in fully exploiting abundant spatial/spectral information of RS images. Therefore, this work aims to develop an efficient snow and cloud classification algorithm using satellite multispectral RS images. In particular, we propose an innovative algorithm entitled UCTNet by adopting a dual-flow structure to integrate information extracted via Transformer and CNN branches. Particularly, CNN and Transformer integration Module (CTIM) is designed to maximally integrate the information extracted via two branches. Meanwhile, Final Information Fusion Module and Auxiliary Information Fusion Head are designed for better performance. The four-band satellite multispectral RS dataset for snow coverage mapping is adopted for performance evaluation. Compared with previous methods (e.g., U-Net, Swin, and CSDNet), the experimental results show that the proposed UCTNet achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy (95.72%) and mean IoU score (91.21%) while with the smallest model size (3.93 M). The confirmed efficiency of UCTNet shows great potential for dual-flow architecture on snow and cloud classification.

AB  - Oceanic eddies and fronts are plentiful in the global oceans. There are abundant frontal processes at the edges of eddies, meanwhile, eddies can be formed due to instability along the fronts. Moreover, they can both induce submesoscale processes and strong vertical motions. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the correlation between eddies and fronts, along with their spatiotemporal distribution characteristics, for the transport of ocean energy and material and marine ecosystems. Generally, using remote sensing to detect eddies and fronts is based on geometrics, physical parameters, and handcrafted features. Existing approaches are inaccurate due to the highly dynamic nature of eddies and fronts as well as the lack of physical mechanisms between them. This paper proposes an adversarial approach for mining eddy-front coupling, dubbed the eddy-front generative adversarial network (EFGAN). In EFGAN, the generator follows the encoder-decoder structure and consists of a data encoder, a feature decoder, and a multi-task generation module. The rich contextual and semantic information on eddy features and frontal structure, which are the physical constraints for EFGAN, can be extracted from the fusion of satellite sea level anomaly (SLA) and sea surface temperature (SST) data, generating styled eddy-front coupling images with the accompaniment of the mask of eddy-front categories and styled fronts. To tackle the issue of inconsistency in the category of a single eddy, an instance consistency loss is designed to make the category of each individual eddy as consistent as possible, thus ensuring that the correlation of eddy-front belongs to a single category. Furthermore, multiple loss functions are combined to jointly guide network training to improve stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFGAN outperforms state-of-the-art generative adversarial network-based models. The spatial distribution indicates that frontal eddies are more prevalent at the confluence where warm and cold currents meet. In the Kuroshio Extension region, there are concentrated distribution areas of frontal eddies that are strong in the boreal spring and summer, while eddy-induced fronts are highly active in the boreal winter and spring but weak in autumn.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Nighttime PM<sub>2.5</sub> Datasets in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region from 2015 to 2021 Using VIIRS/DNB and Deep Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) can be estimated using satellite data collected during the daytime. However, there are currently no long-term evening PM2.5 datasets, and the application of low-light satellite data to analyze nighttime PM(2.5 )concentrations is limited. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS/DNB), meteorology, Digital Elevation Model, moon phase angle, and Normalized Digital Vegetation Index were used in this study to develop a Deep Neural Network model (DNN) for estimating the nighttime concentrations of PM2.5 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from 2015 to 2021. To evaluate the model's performance from 2015 to 2021, a ten-fold cross-validation coefficient of determination was utilized (CV - R-2 = 0.51 - 0.68). Using a high spatial resolution of 500 m, we successfully generated a PM2.5 concentration map for the BTH region. This finer resolution enabled a detailed representation of the PM2.5 distribution over the area. Interannual and seasonal trends in nighttime PM2.5 concentrations were analyzed. Winter had the highest seasonal spatial PM2.5, followed by spring and autumn, whereas summer had the lowest. The annual concentration of PM2.5 at night steadily decreased. Finally, the estimation of nighttime PM2.5 was applied in scenarios such as continuous day-night changes, rapid short-term changes, and single-point monitoring. A deeper understanding of PM2.5, enabled by nightly PM2.5, will serve as an invaluable resource for future research.

TI  - Modeling the Agia Zoni II tanker oil spill in Saronic Gulf, Greece
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - We employed GNOME to simulate the oil spill due to the sinking of the tanker "Agia Zoni CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN ICYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN I" in September 2017 in Saronic Gulf. We performed simulations using various combinations of wind and current input, and values of the GNOME parameters, and compared the simulated oil spill trajectories with coastal pollution and satellite data. The best scenario, i.e., the combination that showed the most satisfactory agreement with field data, uses wind data from one of the closest meteorological stations, calculated currents by a hydrodynamic model and default values of the parameters, except for the windage and the refloat half-life whose proposed values are 3-4 % and 6 h, respectively. Neglecting the effect of the wind in the best scenario worsened the agreement. Mass balance results depicted that approximately 47 % of the total 500 tons of the oil spill ended up on the coastline of Attica peninsula and Salamina Island.

TI  - Engaging diverse experts in the global science-policy interface: Learning experiences from the process of the IPBES Values Assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This longitudinal study explores evidence of learning and reflexivity among experts involved in the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Values Assessment from 2018 to 2022. As part of an online survey administered at yearly intervals, experts self-reported their views on: i) the aims they attributed to the Values Assessment, ii) their epistemic worldviews, iii) the definition of the multiple values of nature, and iv) their personal learning experiences in the assessment process. The represented epistemic worldviews corresponded to Constructivist, Transformative, Pragmatist, and Post-positivist. Across the three surveys, 59% of the respondents shifted their epistemic worldviews. However, these same experts did not change their core perspectives regarding the motivation behind the Values Assessment. At the same time, experts holding a Post-positivist worldview came to express more engagement-inclined themes and openness to dialogue with diverse knowledge systems. While enhanced reflexivity stimulated overall learning, cutting across all learning dimensions, it was itself a multilayered learning outcome. This study illustrates how diverse experts critically reflected and changed their own underlying assumptions during the inter- and transdisciplinary process of the Values Assessment. It further reveals that learning experiences in the Values Assessment were embedded in epistemic worldviews and connected to cognitive, relational, and transformative dimensions of learning. Our findings have broader implications for the design of inclusive and reflexive learning processes in future work of organisations aiming to facilitate inter- and transdisciplinary practices at the science-policy interface.

TI  - Estimating the parcel-level impacts of agricultural conservation easements on farmland loss using satellite data in New England
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid loss of farmland to development has long been a concern of policymakers and conservation non-profits globally. In the United States, agricultural conservation easements are a widespread policy tool used to protect farmland from conversion to development in perpetuity. However, the extent to which these easements reduce farmland loss to development within their boundaries is rarely studied at the spatial scale at which easement adoption decisions are made: the individual parcel. Our case study from six New England states uses a rich dataset of 1.97 million parcels, novel estimates of annual parcel-level land cover change from 1988 to 2016, and a quasi-experimental research design to estimate the extent to which 3959 farmland easements avoided conversion of cropland to development. We examine and discuss the suitability of remote sensing data and quasi experimental matching methods for impact assessments in this geographic and political context. Our empirical results suggest that agricultural conservation easements have reduced farmland loss to development. The magnitude of avoided farmland loss is small (0.0067% & PLUSMN; 0.0019% of parcel area per annum), largely because of a low background rate of farmland loss across New England (0.0027% of total area per annum). Our findings suggest that the spatial allocation of farmland easements has historically not prioritized the highest-threat locations where impacts would be most noticeable, as allocation is driven by a diverse range of goals in addition to avoiding farmland loss.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Hg-Contaminated Sediments Washing through Sentinel Species: A Mesocosm Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combines a traditional chemical characterization with a simultaneous biological evaluation through histological, immunohistochemical, and enzymatic observations to assess the efficiency and sustainability of soil washing on Hg-contaminated sediment in terms of the bioavailability of the contaminant before and after the treatment, as well as the potential drawbacks of the treatment that are not revealed by a simple chemical characterization of treated sediments on its own. Different extracting agents, that is, ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS), sodium thiosulfate, potassium iodide (KI), and iodine (I2), have been compared in this work to evaluate their efficiency in the removal of Hg from contaminated sediments. Speciation analysis was applied to assess the mobility of Hg from different fractions of aged sediments. Biological evaluation was carried out through the use of large mesocosms and Mytilus galloprovincialis as biological sentinels. Results from bench scale tests have shown Hg removal of up to 93% by means of the multi-step KI/I2 washing process of the sediment. Results from histological, immunohistochemical, and enzymatic analysis have shown significant differences in the degree of alteration of biological tissues and their functional integrity between organisms in contact with contaminated and restored sediments. The reduction in 5-HT3R immunopositivity in the mesocosm with treated sediments suggests a tendency for mussels to recover a healthy condition. This result was also confirmed by the measurement of the enzymatic activity of AChE in mussel gills, which was significantly reduced in organisms from the mesocosm with polluted sediments compared with those from the one with restored sediments. The proposed approach could help stakeholders all over the world select, at an early stage, the most efficient cleaning action from a more holistic perspective, including not only pollutant concentration and economic reduction but also a direct assessment of the ultimate impact of the selected process on the biological system.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Maize Yield Response to Urban Sprawl in a Changing Climate: Case of Harare Metropolitan City
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture in free spaces within urban areas sustains residents as they grow crops to ensure food availability while at the same time selling other produce to fund other needs. Due to the value of urban agricultural production, the main focus of this study was to investigate the implications of urban growth on maize yield in Harare metropolitan city. In order to achieve this, Landsat multispectral and multi-temporal data were used to establish the responses of the estimated maize yield to city growth from 1984 to 2018. Initially, Land Use and Land Cover map for each period were produced using multispectral images and field observation in Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based supervised image classification. The maps were reclassified using a binary scheme of croplands and non-croplands, which was used to quantify cropland area in each period and hence change over time. The maize yield for each period was estimated from data obtained from a study of maize yields obtained at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (UZ) farm for maize grown under variable agricultural practices. Results showed that cropland area was reduced from 11,120 ha in 1984 down to 2631 ha in 2018. The estimated average maize yield decreased from 52,264 tons in 1984 to 12,366 tons in 2018. In addition to showing the value of urban agriculture, the findings of this study are important in informing the government, municipalities, and other stakeholders about how urban growth has the potential to compromise food security and livelihoods, especially for the urban poor.

TI  - The Classification of Riparian Habitats and Assessment of Fish-Spawning Habitat Suitability: A Case Study of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - After the completion of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), there was a significant and drastic transformation of the original river habitat. These changes led to the loss of the original fish habitat and the emergence of a new habitat. To effectively classify and assess fish-spawning habitats in the TGR, a novel coastal complexity index (CCI) was developed. The CCI was formulated utilizing satellite remote sensing data and considering the river coastal line and river centerline on the river-reach scale. By integrating the CCI with river morphology, five river habitats were identified: the backwater bay, point bar, straight river channel, convex-bank point bar, and concave-bank deep pool. In order to evaluate the suitability of these habitats for sticky-egg-spawning fish, a single-factor habitat suitability curve was constructed using three key habitat factors: the CCI, slope, and vegetation coverage. This process involved the employment of two distinct methods: the habitat utilization method and the habitat preference method. The former only considered the survey data of spawning grounds, while the latter integrated the overall distribution of habitats in the TGR. Subsequently, a habitat suitability index (HSI) was established to assess the overall suitability of the identified habitats for sticky-egg-spawning fish. The results demonstrated a high classification accuracy, with the backwater bay representing the most prevalent habitat type, accounting for 43.31% of the total habitat types. When considering slope and vegetation coverage, the optimal ranges obtained through the two habitat suitability analysis methods were similar. However, for the CCI, there were variations in the optimal ranges obtained using the two methods. The habitat utilization method indicated an optimal interval of 2-4, while the habitat preference method provided an optimal interval of 4-8. Nonetheless, the assessment results for the spawning habitats' suitability using both methods yielded essentially identical outcomes. Specifically, the backwater bay, convex-bank point bar, and concave-bank deep pool habitats exhibited higher suitability for spawning than point bar and straight river channel habitats. Further analysis revealed that approximately 75% of the 230 identified backwater bays were categorized as high-quality or higher-quality spawning habitats. In the time since this research was conducted, its findings have served as a theoretical foundation for the protection of aquatic biological resources and habitats.

TI  - Understanding the spatio-temporal behaviour of the sunflower crop for subfield areas delineation using Sentinel-2 NDVI time-series images in an organic farming system
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the suitability of time series Sentinel-2 NDVI-derived maps for the subfield detection of a sunflower crop cultivated in an organic farming system. The aim was to understand the spatio-temporal behaviour of subfield areas identified by the K-means algorithm from NDVI maps obtained from satellite images and the ground yield data variability to increase the efficiency of delimiting management zones in an organic farming system. Experiments were conducted on a surface of 29 ha. NDVI time series derived from Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithm for rapidly delineating the sunflower subfield areas were used. The crop achene yields in the whole field ranged from 1.3 to 3.77 t ha-1 with a significant within-field spatial variability. The cluster analysis of hand-sampled data showed three subfields with achene yield mean values of 3.54 t ha-1 (cluster 1), 2.98 t ha-1 (cluster 2), and 2.07 t ha-1 (Cluster 3). In the cluster analysis of NDVI data, the k-means algorithm has early delineated the subfield crop spatial and temporal yield variability. The best period for identifying subfield areas starts from the inflorescences development stage to the development of the fruit stage. Analyzing the NDVI subfield areas and yield data, it was found that cluster 1 covers an area of 42.4% of the total surface and 50% of the total achene yield; cluster 2 covers 35% of both surface and yield. Instead, the surface of cluster 3 covers 22.2% of the total surface with 15% of achene yield. K-means algorithm derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI images delineates the sunflower subfield areas. Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithms can improve an efficient assessment of subfield areas in sunflower crops. Identifying subfield areas can lead to site-specific long-term agronomic actions for improving the sustainable intensification of agriculture in the organic farming system.

TI  - Assessment and Analysis of Crop Irrigation by the Combination of Modelling and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop irrigation should be properly monitored to plan the use of land water resources and their repartition among competing activities. Appropriate statistical approaches can be applied to infer the irrigation water (IW) supplied over a cropped area relying on ground observations and the outputs of calibrated crop development models. The collection of such reference samples over relatively large areas and multiyear periods, however, is often hampered by practical problems that limit the possibility of obtaining precise estimates of the IW actually supplied. One of the possible ways to overcome these issues and increase the precision of the IW observations is through a regression correction versus wall-to-wall IW covariates obtained from remotely sensed images. Specifically, the correction of the reference IW observations can be performed using mapped IW estimates yielded by the combination of meteorological data and Sentinel-2 NDVI images. This strategy was tested in a 10 x 10 km2 agricultural area in Southern Tuscany (Central Italy) during 2018-2022. The high correlations found between the reference and remotely sensed IW values allowed us to obtain satisfactory results for all years. The regression corrections applied had very high relative efficiencies (> 30) and notably enhanced the IW precisions obtained from the reference samples. The dynamics of the corrected IW observations were finally analysed versus the possible drivers, yielding useful indications for the management of local water resources.

TI  - Exploring Prescribed Fire Severity Effects on Ground Beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) Taxonomic and Functional Community Composition
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed fire is a management tool that is frequently used to foster biodiversity. Simultaneously, insects that provide essential ecosystem services are globally declining. Within the pyroentomology literature, there are mixed reports of positive and negative effects that prescribed fires have on insect communities. This is likely due to not accounting for fire heterogeneity created by fire severity. To better understand prescribed fire severity effects on insect communities, we used multispectral reflectance data collected by Sentinel-2 to methodically quantify prescribed fire severity and compared ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) taxonomic and functional community composition responses between an unburned site and two burned sites with contrasting fire impacts. We found 23 ground beetle species and used 30 morphological, physiological, phenological, and ecological functional traits for each species. We found that our moderate fire severity site had different taxonomic and functional community compositions from both our unburned and high-severity sites. Surprisingly, we did not find a strong difference in taxonomic or functional ground beetle composition between our unburned and high-severity sites. Our results encourage future pyroentomology studies to account for fire severity, which will help guide conservation managers to make more accurate decisions and predictions about prescribed fire effects on insect biodiversity.

TI  - Mapping Buildings across Heterogeneous Landscapes: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applied to Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the production of maps of buildings on Hawai'i Island, based on complementary information contained in two different types of remote sensing data. The maps cover 3200 km2 over a highly varied set of landscape types and building densities. A convolutional neural network was first trained to identify building candidates in LiDAR data. To better differentiate between true buildings and false positives, the CNN-based building probability map was then used, together with 400-2400 nm imaging spectroscopy, as input to a gradient boosting model. Simple vector operations were then employed to further refine the final maps. This stepwise approach resulted in detection of 84%, 100%, and 97% of manually labeled buildings, at the 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 percentiles of true building size, respectively, with very few false positives. The median absolute error in modeled building areas was 15%. This novel integration of deep learning, machine learning, and multi-modal remote sensing data was thus effective in detecting buildings over large scales and diverse landscapes, with potential applications in urban planning, resource management, and disaster response. The adaptable method presented here expands the range of techniques available for object detection in multi-modal remote sensing data and can be tailored to various kinds of input data, landscape types, and mapping goals.

TI  - Assessing the Chlorophyll-a Retrieval Capabilities of Sentinel 3A OLCI Images for the Monitoring of Coastal Waters in Algoa and Francis Bays, South Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eleven level-2 Sentinel 3A OLCI images that were acquired between 29 March 2017 and 11 December 2017 were used to assess their ability to retrieve oceanic Chl-a concentrations in South Africa's Algoa and St Francis Bays. This was done by applying a 7-colour gradient pallet in the SNAP software to produce oceanic Chl-a concentration maps on a scale ranging from 0.1-30 mg/m3. The validation of Sentinel's Chl-a's retrieval potentials was based on temporally corresponding in-situ data from eight stations. Comparative analysis of the image-based and in-situ Chl-a concentrations revealed statistically significant correlations (r 0.609-r 0.899, ᾶ 0.05) at five stations out of the eight that were used as sources of reference data. This finding is helpful as an objectively premised source of insights on how to sustainably utilise the oceanic resources at our disposal. It is also useful because it verifiably demonstrates that Sentinel images can be reliably used to retrieve usable information on Chl-a concentrations in lieu of the costly sea-surface-based in-situ measurements at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Demonstration of a Modular Prototype End-to-End Simulator for Aquatic Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces a prototype end-to-end Simulator software tool for simulating two-dimensional satellite multispectral imagery for a variety of satellite instrument models in aquatic environments. Using case studies, the impact of variable sensor configurations on the performance of value-added products for challenging applications, such as coral reefs and cyanobacterial algal blooms, is assessed. This demonstrates how decisions regarding satellite sensor design, driven by cost constraints, directly influence the quality of value-added remote sensing products. Furthermore, the Simulator is used to identify situations where retrieval algorithms require further parameterization before application to unsimulated satellite data, where error sources cannot always be identified or isolated. The application of the Simulator can verify whether a given instrument design meets the performance requirements of end-users before build and launch, critically allowing for the justification of the cost and specifications for planned and future sensors. It is hoped that the Simulator will enable engineers and scientists to understand important design trade-offs in phase 0/A studies easily, quickly, reliably, and accurately in future Earth observation satellites and systems.

TI  - Identifying Pipeline Leak Positions Potentially Connected to Soil Deformations through SAR Data Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transmission mains (TMs) and water distribution systems (WDS) are, among the others, fundamental networks on which society relies on. Age, pipeline materials, and internal and external stresses are just few of the numerous factors that undermine the efficiency of these infrastructures and potentially reduce performance and functionality, leading to leakages or causing dangerous conditions in the surrounding environment, such as flooding or disruption. Accurate condition assessment, with suitable monitoring techniques, allows for proper management and maintenance throughout the infrastructures' lifetime. Starting from the hypothesis that leakages could be related to soil deformation, this study evaluated the opportunities offered by the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) method in identifying soil deformations in nonurban areas potentially related to leak positions along TMs. Satellite images were analyzed to derive millimetric evolution of slow deformation processes over large surfaces and a long time frame. To test the capability of the proposed method and its operability as a monitoring tool, data acquired between 2014 and 2019 by Sentinel-1 satellites, were processed to investigate two transmission pipelines located in two areas of Italy (Veneto and Toscana regions). An analysis of historical damages in the hydraulic network and soil deformations obtained by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data examination along the pipeline path suggests how and in which conditions potential relationships between leakages along pipeline and deformations of the ground surface can be defined.

TI  - Male breast cancer: Report of two cases with bloody nipple discharge.
T2  - Radiology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - We report 2 rare cases of male breast cancer with bloody nipple discharge. Patient 1, a 32-year-old male, presented with a bloody nipple discharge from the left breast. Diagnostic workup revealed papillary ductal carcinoma in situ. Patient 1 underwent bilateral mastectomy with left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and has been doing well ever since. Patient 2, a 70-year-old male with concomitant metastatic prostate cancer, presented with a palpable right breast mass and with initially serous, then bloody nipple discharge. Diagnostic workup revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ of the right breast. Patient 2 received aromatase inhibitor therapy prior to right total mastectomy with SLN biopsy followed by adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Patient 2 recovered without complication for 2 years until metastatic disease recurrence was detected. This case report's purpose is to increase awareness and enhance understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of rare malignant pathologies.

TI  - Downscaling Daily Satellite-Based Precipitation Estimates Using MODIS Cloud Optical and Microphysical Properties in Machine-Learning Models
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a method for downscaling the spatial resolution of daily satellite-based precipitation estimates (SPEs) from 10 km to 1 km. The method deliberates a set of variables that have close relationships with daily precipitation events in a Random Forest (RF) regression model. The considered variables include cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER) an cloud water path (CWP), derived from MODIS, along with maximum and minimum temperature (Tx, Tn), derived from CHIRTS. Additionally, topographic features derived from ALOS-DEM are also investigated to improve the downscaling procedure. The approach consists of two main steps: firstly, the RF model training at the native 10 km spatial resolution of the studied SPEs (i.e., IMERG) using rain gauge observations as targets; secondly, the application of the trained RF model at a 1 km spatial resolution to downscale IMERG from 10 km to 1 km over a one-year period. To assess the reliability of the method, the RF model outcomes were compared with the rain gauge records not considered in the RF model training. Before the downscaling process, the CC, MAE and RMSE metrics were 0.32, 1.16 mm and 6.60 mm, respectively, and improved to 0.48, 0.99 mm and 4.68 mm after the downscaling process. This corresponds to improvements of 50%, 15% and 29%, respectively. Therefore, the method not only improves the spatial resolution of IMERG, but also its accuracy.

TI  - A Novel Physics-Statistical Coupled Paradigm for Retrieving Integrated Water Vapor Content Based on Artificial Intelligence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of integrated water vapor content (WVC) from remote sensing data is often ill-posed because of insufficient observational information. There are many factors that cause WVC changes, which yield instability in the accuracy of many traditional algorithms. To overcome this problem, we developed a novel fully-coupled paradigm for the robust retrieval of WVC from thermal infrared remote sensing data. Through the derivation of the physical radiative transfer equation, we determined two conditions that need to be satisfied for the deep learning retrieval paradigm of WVC. The first condition is that the input parameters and output parameters of the deep learning need to be able to build a complete set of solvable equations in theory. The second condition is that, if there is a strong relationship between input parameters and output parameters, it can be directly retrieved. If it is a weak relationship, we need to use prior knowledge to improve the portability and accuracy of the algorithm. The training and test data of deep learning is composed of representative solutions of physical methods and solutions of statistical methods. The representative solutions of the physical methods were obtained from the physical forward model, and the statistical solutions were obtained from multi-source data which can compensate for the defect that the physical model cannot simulate mixed pixels. MODIS L1B data was used for case analysis of paradigm retrieval, and the analysis indicated that four thermal infrared bands were usually needed as the input parameters of deep learning and the integrated water vapor content as the output parameter. When land surface temperature and emissivity were taken as prior knowledge, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved WVC was 0.07 g/cm2. The optimal accuracy RMSE was 0.27 g/cm2. When there was a strong correlation between input parameters and output parameters, i.e., if there were two bands that were very sensitive to WVC in the band combination, high-precision retrieval could also be achieved without prior knowledge. All the analyses show that the paradigm of deep learning coupling physics and statistics can accurately retrieve WVC, which is a significant improvement on the traditional method and solves the problem of lack of physical interpretation of deep learning.

TI  - An Integrated Framework for Remote Sensing Assessment of the Trophic State of Large Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic state is an important factor reflecting the health state of lake ecosystems. To accurately assess the trophic state of large lakes, an integrated framework was developed by combining remote sensing data, field monitoring data, machine learning algorithms, and optimization algorithms. First, key meteorological and environmental factors from in situ monitoring were combined with remotely sensed reflectance data and statistical analysis was used to determine the main factors influencing the trophic state. Second, a trophic state index (TSI) inversion model was constructed using a machine learning algorithm, and this was then optimized using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) based on a backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) to establish an SSA-BP-NN model. Third, a typical lake in China (Hongze Lake) was chosen as the case study. The application results show that, when the key environmental factors (pH, temperature, average wind speed, and sediment content) and the band combination data from Sentinel-2/MSI were used as input variables, the performance of the model was improved (R2 = 0.936, RMSE = 1.133, MAPE = 1.660%, MAD = 0.604). Compared with the performance prior to optimization (R2 = 0.834, RMSE = 1.790, MAPE = 2.679%, MAD = 1.030), the accuracy of the model was improved by 12.2%. It is worth noting that this framework could accurately identify water bodies in different trophic states. Finally, based on this framework, we mapped the spatial distribution of TSI in Hongze Lake in different seasons from 2019 to 2020 and analyzed its variation characteristics. The framework can combine regional special feature factors influenced by a complex environment with S-2/MSI data to achieve an assessment accuracy of over 90% for TSI in sensitive waters and has strong applicability and robustness.

T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Developments in the transportation field are emerging because of the growing worldwide demand and upgrading requirements. This study measured the transportation development, shortage distance, and decadal land transformation of Kuala Lumpur and Madrid using various remote sensing and GIS approaches. The kernel density estimation (KDE) tool was applied for road and railway density analysis, and hotspot information increased the knowledge about assessable areas. Landsat datasets were used (1991-2021) for land transformation and related analyses. The built-up land increased by 1327.27 and 404.09km2 in Kuala Lumpur and Madrid, respectively. In the last thirty years, the temperature increased 6.45°C in Kuala Lumpur and 4.15°C in Madrid owing to urban expansion and road construction. Chamberi, Retiro, Moratalaz, Salama, Wangsa Maju, Titiwangsa, Bukit Bintang, and Seputeh have very high road densities. KDE measurements showed that the road densities in Kuala Lumpur (4498.34) and Madrid (9099.15) were high in the central parts of the city, and the railway densities were 348.872 and 2197.87, respectively. The observed P values were 0.99 and 0.96 for traffic signals and 0.98 and 0.99 for bus stops, respectively. The information provided by this study can support local planners, administrators, scientists, and researchers in understanding the global transportation issues that require implementation strategies for ensuring sustainable livelihoods.

TI  - Comparing Forest Understory Fuel Classification in Portugal Using Discrete Airborne Laser Scanning Data and Satellite Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires burn millions of hectares of forest worldwide every year, and this trend is expected to continue growing under current and future climate scenarios. As a result, accurate knowledge of fuel conditions and fuel type mapping are important for assessing fire hazards and predicting fire behavior. In this study, 499 plots in six different areas in Portugal were surveyed by ALS and multisource RS, and the data thus obtained were used to evaluate a nationwide fuel classification. Random Forest (RF) and CART models were used to evaluate fuel models based on ALS (5 and 10 pulse/m2), Sentinel Imagery (Multispectral Sentinel 2 (S2) and SAR (Synthetic Aperture RaDaR) data (C-band (Sentinel 1 (S1)) and Phased Array L-band data (PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 Satellite) metrics. The specific goals of the study were as follows: (1) to develop simple CART and RF models to classify the four main fuel types in Portugal in terms of horizontal and vertical structure based on field-acquired ALS data; (2) to analyze the effect of canopy cover on fuel type classification; (3) to investigate the use of different ALS pulse densities to classify the fuel types; (4) to map a more complex classification of fuel using a multi-sensor approach and the RF method. The results indicate that use of ALS metrics (only) was a powerful way of accurately classifying the main four fuel types, with OA = 0.68. In terms of canopy cover, the best results were estimated in sparse forest, with an OA = 0.84. The effect of ALS pulse density on fuel classification indicates that 10 points m-2 data yielded better results than 5 points m-2 data, with OA = 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. Finally, the multi-sensor approach with RF successfully classified 13 fuel models in Portugal, with moderate OA = 0.44. Fuel mapping studies could be improved by generating more homogenous fuel models (in terms of structure and composition), increasing the number of sample plots and also by increasing the representativeness of each fuel model.

AB  - The continuous evolution of cancer biology has led to the discovery of mammaglobin, a potential novel biomarker for breast carcinoma. This review aims to unravel the enigmatic aspects of mammaglobin and elucidate its potential role in redefining the paradigm of breast carcinoma biomarkers. We will thoroughly examine its expression in tumoral and peritumoral tissues and its circulating levels in the blood, thereby providing insights into its possible function in cancer progression and metastasis. Furthermore, the potential application of mammaglobin as a non-invasive diagnostic tool and a target for personalized treatment strategies will be discussed. Given the increasing incidence of breast carcinoma worldwide, the exploration of novel biomarkers such as mammaglobin is crucial in advancing our diagnostic capabilities and treatment modalities, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Investigating Earthquake-Induced Changes in the Persian Gulf Marginal Strip, Using Sentinel-1A Images and Radar Interferometry
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Geohazards, such as earthquakes, pose significant threats to human life and infrastructure in various regions across the globe. Iran, in particular, is highly vulnerable to earthquakes due to its unique structural and tectonic characteristics. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor geohazards in order to mitigate their impacts. Several techniques, including the global positioning system, geodesy, tacheometry, and mapping cameras, have been developed for this purpose. Among these methods, radar interferometry has emerged as a particularly accurate and cost-effective approach. It is capable of operating under all weather conditions, 24 h a day, and can cover large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this research, we employed Sentinel 1A images and radar interferometry to investigate the changes in the Earth's surface following earthquakes in the marginal strip of the Persian Gulf. Specifically, our focus was on earthquakes in Bandar Khamir, and we analyzed the Earth's surface changes three days and fifteen days after the events. The findings of our study revealed that the most significant uplift occurred around Bandar Khamir, with an uplift rate of 14 cm. Conversely, the highest subsidence was observed near Bandar Charak, with a subsidence of 12 cm. Furthermore, we observed a rise of 32 cm around the eastern and northern regions of Bandar Khamir 11 days after the initial period, accompanied by a subsidence of 31 cm around Bandar Lange and Bandar Charak. These results underscore the importance of continuous monitoring of earthquakes and their impact on the Earth's surface, particularly in coastal areas where the effects on the water table and coastal infrastructure can be severe. In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of employing radar interferometry as a powerful tool for monitoring and assessing the impacts of earthquakes.

TI  - Do Organochlorine Contaminants Modulate the Parasitic Infection Degree in Mediterranean Trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>)?
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: Living organisms may be simultaneously exposed to several stressors. Trout are a clear example of this scenario, being usually exposed to chemical contaminants and parasites. Moreover, it is also an intensely farmed fish, often caught for human consumption. Thus, trout may be considered a sentinel species, and the related evidence is a matter of importance. We looked at a sample of wild brown trout from a protected area of Southern Italy. Different numbers of gastro-intestinal helminths and concentrations of organochlorine pollutants were detected among sample units. In particular, a negative correlation between the presence of parasites and the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls was assessed, suggesting that these organochlorine pollutants can affect parasite survival. Our results provide a contribution to the advancement of the knowledge of the interplay among environment, parasites, and host. We investigated the occurrence of organochlorine pollutants (OCs) in the muscle of brown trout and evaluated their potential modulation of parasite infection. The toxicological risk for consumer health was assessed, too. Trout were collected from the Sila National Park (Calabria region, South of Italy). The highest concentrations emerged for the sum of the 6 non-dioxin-like (ndl) indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma 6ndl-PCBs), followed by the 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)-ethane (DDT), dioxin-like PCBs, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and dieldrin. Measured on lipid weight (LW), the mean value of sigma 6ndl-PCBs amounted to 201.9 ng g(-1), that of Sigma DDTs (the sum of DDT-related compounds) to 100.2 ng g(-1), with the major contribution of the DDT-metabolite p,p'-DDE which was detected in all sample units (97.6 ng g(-1) on average). Among dioxin-like congeners, PCB 118 showed the highest mean concentration (21.96 ng g(-1) LW) and was detected in all sample units. Regression analysis of intestinal parasites on OC concentration was performed, controlling for two potential confounding factors, namely sex and sexual stage. The results evidenced the existence of interactions between the dual stressors in the host-parasite system in the wild. A negative and statistically significant correlation was estimated, suggesting that OCs may decrease parasite infection degree. Regarding the toxicological risk evaluation, OC concentrations were consistently below the current European Maximum Residue Limits.

T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the absorption coefficients of phytoplankton community (a(Ph)(lambda)), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) [alpha CDOM(lambda)], and Non-Algal Particles (NAP) [alpha Nap(lambda)] were analyzed in the northern Persian Gulf, a Mediterranean-type semi-enclosed marginal sea, through seven cruise expeditions conducted from May 2018 to February 2022. The highest and lowest aPh(443) values were observed in the shallow area (depth <= 20 m) during the wet season (November-April) (0.043 +/- 0.004 m(-1)) and within the deep area (depth >20 m) through the dry season (July-September) (0.024 +/- 0.003 m(-1)), respectively. The chlorophyll-specific absorption (a*Ph(lambda)) values increased from the deep to shallow areas as well as the wet to dry seasons. A significant difference was further detected in a*Ph(lambda) magnitude at the blue (443 nm) and red (675 nm) wavelengths, with the mean values of 0.0124/0.0223 m2 mg 1 and 0.0069/0.0135 m2 mg 1 in the wet/dry seasons, respectively. The mean values of aCDOM(443) in the shallow area during the wet season (0.10 +/- 0.001 m(-1)) were significantly larger than those in the deep area during the dry season (0.06 +/- 0.002 m(-1)). Similarly, aNAP(443) decreased from the shallow (0.056 +/- 0.021 m(-1)) to deep areas (0.019 +/- 0.011 m(-1)), and from the wet (0.035 +/- 0.020 m(-1)) to dry (0.029 +/- 0.015 m(1)) seasons. The statistical analysis revealed that the differences in aCDOM(lambda) and aNAP(lambda) spectral distribution were not statistically significant for the duration of the wet and dry seasons, whereas significant differences were observed in the shallow and deep samples. During both wet and dry seasons, the magnitude of the blue-green absorption spectra was dominated by CDOM, but the red bands were associated with phytoplankton dominated samples. The ratio of aCDOM(lambda)/a*Ph(lambda) was utilized as an index for uncertainty assessment to estimate Chla concentrations by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) standard Chl-a algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS; OC3M) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) (OLCI; OC4v6). The results additionally demonstrated that the satellite-derived Chl-a was overestimated due to higher aCDOM(lambda) and underestimated owing to lower a*Ph(lambda) at the low (<0.5 mg m 3) and high (>3 mg m 3) concentrations of Chl-a, respectively. The study findings established that the red bands should be considered for tuning or developing new Chl-a algorithms in the Persian Gulf.

TI  - Finding Misclassified Natura 2000 Habitats by Applying Outlier Detection to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of Natura 2000 habitats (Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC) is a key activity ensuring the sufficient protection of European biodiversity. Reporting on the status of Natura 2000 habitats is required every 6 years. Although field mapping is still an indispensable source of data on the status of Natura 2000 habitats, and very good field-based data exist in some countries, keeping the field-based habitat maps up to date can be an issue. Remote sensing techniques represent an excellent alternative. Here, we present a new method for detecting habitats that were likely misclassified during the field mapping or that have changed since then. The method identifies the possible habitat mapping errors as the so-called "attribute outliers", i.e., outlying observations in the feature space of all relevant (spectral and other) characteristics of an individual habitat patch. We used the Czech Natura 2000 Habitat Layer as field-based habitat data. To prepare the feature space of habitat characteristics, we used a fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data along with a Digital Elevation Model. We compared outlier ratings using the robust Mahalanobis distance and Local Outlier Factor using three different thresholds (Tukey rule, histogram-based Scott's rule, and 95% quantiles in & chi;2 distribution). The Mahalanobis distance thresholded by the 95% & chi;2 quantile achieved the best results, and, because of its high specificity, appeared as a promising tool for identifying erroneously mapped or changed habitats. The presented method can, therefore, be used as a guide to target field updates of Natura 2000 habitat maps or for other habitat/land cover mapping activities where the detection of misclassifications or changes is needed.

TI  - Residential greenspace and anxiety symptoms among Australian women living in major cities: A longitudinal analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite an increasing number of studies demonstrating the potential mental health benefits of greenspace, few longitudinal studies have been reported. We aimed to assess associations between two metrics of residential greenspace exposure and anxiety symptoms in a cohort of Australian women living in major cities.Our study comprised 3,938 women, born between 1973 and 78. Anxiety symptoms in the previous month were assessed at follow-up every three years during 2003-2018, using the anxiety subscale of the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale. The three-month seasonal average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was estimated from 30 m Landsat satellite images in a 500 m buffer (NDVI500m) around participants' address at each survey (higher NDVI indicates more green vegetation). The annual fractional cover of nonphotosynthesising vegetation was estimated (fNPV500m, with higher values indicating greater levels of dead leaf litter or dry grass). A generalised estimating equation assessed associations between greenspace measures and anxiety symptoms (as odds ratios [ORs]), adjusting for repeated outcomes and individual-level covariates. Additional analyses focused on women experiencing substantial changes in between-survey exposure due to moving, and adjusting for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, among others.A standard deviation (SD) (0.12 units) increase in NDVI500m was significantly associated with lower odds of anxiety symptoms (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99) in the adjusted model. An SD (5.2%) increase in annual fNPV500m was consistent with the direction expected for that exposure, but not significant in the adjusted model (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99-1.07). NDVI500m was modestly attenuated when air pollutants were adjusted for, while fNPV500m only became significant when PM2.5 was adjusted for. Between-survey contrasts had no clear effect for NDVI500m. Moving to a higher fNPV500m area, compared with a similar fNPV500m area, was consistently associated with anxiety symptoms (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.31). NDVI500m was generally associated with lower odds of anxiety symptoms, while fNPV500m was generally associated with higher odds of anxiety, depending on the covariates considered.

TI  - Soil Salinity Estimation for South Kazakhstan Based on SAR Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8,9 OLI Data with Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, uneven distribution of water resources and anthropogenic impact have led to salinization and land degradation in the southern regions of Kazakhstan. Identification of saline lands and their mapping is a laborious process associated with a complex of ground measurements. Data from remote sensing are widely used to solve this problem. In this paper, the problem of assessing the salinity of the lands of the South Kazakhstan region using remote sensing data is considered. The aim of the study is to analyze the applicability of machine learning methods to assess the salinity of agricultural lands in southern Kazakhstan based on remote sensing. The authors present a salinity dataset obtained from field studies and containing more than 200 laboratory measurements of soil salinity. Moreover, the authors describe the results of applying several regression reconstruction algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest, Support vector machines, Elastic net, etc.), where synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 satellite and optical data in the form of spectral salinity indices are used as input data. The obtained results show that, in general, these input data can be used to estimate salinity of the wetted arable land. XGBoost regressor (R2 = 0.282) showed the best results. Supplementing the radar data with the values of salinity spectral index improves the result significantly (R2 = 0.356). For the local datasets, the best result shown by the model is R2 = 0.473 (SAR) and R2 = 0.654 (SAR with spectral indexes), respectively. The study also revealed a number of problems that justify the need for a broader range of ground surveys and consideration of multi-year factors affecting soil salinity. Key results of the article: (i) a set of salinity data for different geographical zones of southern Kazakhstan is presented for the first time; (ii) a method is proposed for determining soil salinity on the basis of synthetic aperture radar supplemented with optical data, and this resulted in the improved prediction of the results for the region under consideration; (iii) a comparison of several types of machine learning models was made and it was found that boosted models give, on average, the best prediction result; (iv) a method for optimizing the number of model input parameters using explainable machine learning is proposed; (v) it is shown that the results obtained in this work are in better agreement with ground-based measurements of electrical conductivity than the results of the previously proposed global model.

TI  - Estimation of the vegetal cover fraction in corn from information obtained with remote sensing
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is a biophysical variable related to biomass, leaf area index and crop coefficient, among others. Currently, with the wide availability of satellite images, it is possible to estimate FVC extensively using vegetation indices (VI). However, it is important to examine the relationship between VCF measured in the field and that estimated with satellite imagery to determine its reliability. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of estimating FVC using different VIs (NDVI, SR, SAVI and MSAVI), calculated using radiometric information and Landsat 8 imagery, and to determine the differences that exist when estimating FCV with both sources of information. The radiometric information was collected in six corn plots located in the municipality of Texcoco, State of Mexico. The results showed a good fit of the VI calculated with field information when the FVC was less than 60 %. The correlation between the FVC measured in the field and the indices estimated with satellite imagery had R-2 values greater than 0.78, being slightly higher in the case of the NDVIL (R-2 = 0.89), a value that suggests an acceptable degree of adjustment. It is concluded that it is feasible to estimate the FCV in a maize crop using spectral images from Landsat 8. The best fit between the field VI and the VI calculated with Landsat 8 data, for the conditions of this study, corresponded to the NDVI.

TI  - Measuring the extent and impact of urban expansion in an agricultural-urbanized landscape in Central Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The unplanned urban expansion is a major environmental challenge in Iran resulting in vast degradation of agricultural lands. Focusing on an agricultural-urbanized landscape in Central Iran, the spatial pattern of built-up expansion was assessed from Landsat data processed in 1992 (TM), 2002 (ETM+), 2012 (TM), and 2022 (OLI). Multi-year crop NDVI was also used as a proxy for cropland suitability to assess the intensity of the urban growth impact. Results showed that (1) the area of built-up surfaces increased almost up to double than that of 1992 and passed 36% (413.42 km(2)) by 2022, (2) the region experienced a coalescence-diffusion transition phase with decreasing spatial connectivity of newly developed patches with old ones, (3) the most suitable croplands were lost in the middle period (2002-2012) when urban patches started to diffuse, and (4) a significantly positive spatial (Spearman's) relationship (r (22100) = 0.181, p = 0.000) was found between the area and quality of croplands which further highlights the high importance of cropland protection in the region.

TI  - Microglial dynamics, blood-brain barrier morphogenesis, and developmental toxicity: A<i> brief</i> review and model
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Morphogenesis of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a complex process linked to neovascularization of the embryonic neural tube. This selective transport interface forms between vascular-neural compartments during organogenesis and dysregulation has been linked to neuroinflammation and neurodevelopmental defects. One emerging concept is that microglial cells play a central role in this neurovascular patterning, yet despite an extensive literature base, many gaps still exist in understanding how this resident immunological sentinel cell type interacts with chemical exposure at critical stages of neurodevelopment. The goals of this short review were to: (i) synopsize current understanding of microglial function during BBB morphogenesis; (ii) review potential disruption of microglial function linked to drug/chemical exposure during pregnancy; and (iii) present a working computational model for predictive toxicology of BBB dysmorphogenesis.

TI  - Performance Assessment of Irrigation Projects in Nepal by Integrating Landsat Images and Local Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With growing global concern for food and water insecurity, an efficient method to monitor irrigation projects is essential, especially in the developing world where irrigation performance is often suboptimal. In Nepal, the irrigated area has not been objectively recorded, although their assessment has substantial implications for national policy, project's annual budgets, and donor funding. Here, we present the application of Landsat images to measure irrigated areas in Nepal for the past 17 years to contribute to the assessment of the irrigation performance. Landsat 5 TM (2006-2011) and Landsat 8 OLI (2013-2022) images were used to develop a machine learning model, which classifies irrigated and non-irrigated areas in the study areas. The random forest classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82.2% and kappa statistics of 0.72. For the class of irrigation areas, the producer's accuracy and consumer's accuracy were 79% and 96%, respectively. Our regionally trained machine learning model outperforms the existing global cropland map, highlighting the need for such models for local irrigation project evaluations. We assess irrigation project performance and its drivers by combining long-term changes in satellite-derived irrigated areas with local data related to irrigation performance, such as annual budget, irrigation service fee, crop yield, precipitation, and main canal discharge.

TI  - Rural Residency Status in South Dakotans is Not Associated With More Advanced Stage Melanoma at Time of Diagnosis.
T2  - South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have established that geographic location strongly influences health literacy, access to care, and health outcomes across all disease types. There are many well-understood risk factors for the development of melanoma, and likewise various markers of disease severity. However, few studies have been conducted to determine what role locality and access to dermatological care play in both the incidence and severity of melanoma, particularly in South Dakotans. Here, it is hypothesized that living in rural regions with less access to care increases the risk for more advanced stage melanoma at time of diagnosis.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of the electronic medical records of patients with a diagnosis of melanoma from a Midwest dermatology practice in South Dakota was performed. The authors examined patients' rural vs. urban status, disease predictors, and markers of disease severity. Multivariate and descriptive statistical analysis were utilized.RESULTS: There were 148 unique cases identified. The average age was 62.32 (SD=16.69, min=25, max=98); 53.4% were male (n=79); 99.3% were Caucasian. Among them, 35 (23.6%) had a personal history of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), 9 (6.1%) had a personal history of melanoma, and 20 (13.5%) had a family history of melanoma. Most cases (75.7%) had at least one documented visit to a primary care physician (PCP) within a year of melanoma diagnosis. When comparing geographic distance to the Breslow depth at time of biopsy, a significant negative relationship (p=0.009) resulted. However, when eliminating 3 outliers (Breslow depths of 22.2mm, 19.0 mm, and 15.0mm), this relationship was no longer significant (p=0.141). No significant findings resulted when comparing geographic distance to provider site for wide lesion excision (WLE) to post-WLE Breslow depth (p=0.778), pathological stage (p=0.079), +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy (p=0.299), or +/- chemotherapy/radiation (p=0.191). When comparing disease predictors to severity markers of disease, the only significant finding was between personal history of melanoma and post-WLE Breslow depth (p=0.026). Those without a personal history of melanoma had greater (3.08 vs 1.68) post-WLE Breslow depth.CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies indicate increased distance to a dermatologist and decreased density of dermatologists represent significant associations with Breslow depth and mortality. In contrast, the present data did not appear to indicate a significant difference in melanoma detection or outcomes based on geographic parameters. However, it does support that the density of dermatologists is a more appropriate proxy for melanoma outcomes than is PCP density. The lack of impact based on rural vs. urban status may suggest the current literature is not applicable to all states or populations or that some disparities in access to dermatologists and melanoma treatment may be overcome by factors not investigated presently (e.g. AI, tele-dermatology). Other limitations include analyzing patients within a single health system and a sample population consisting primarily of persons located in the Sioux Falls metropolitan area. With rural South Dakotans representing a significant portion of the population, this state presents an opportunity to identify disparities in access and treatment based on population and community resources.

TI  - Estimating the Impacts of Ungauged Reservoirs Using Publicly Available Streamflow Simulations and Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the Korean Peninsula, the Imjin River is a transboundary river that flows from North Korea into South Korea. Therefore, human intervention activities in the upstream region can have a substantial impact on the downstream region of South Korea. In addition to climate impacts, there are increasing concerns regarding upstream man-made activities, particularly the operation of the Hwanggang dam located in the territory of North Korea. This study explored the feasibility of using the publicly available global hydrological model and satellite remote sensing imagery for monitoring reservoir dynamics and assessing their impacts on downstream hydrology. "Naturalized" streamflow simulation was obtained from the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) Global Water Sustainability (GEOGloWS) European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Streamflow Services (GESS) model. To correct the biases of the GESS-based streamflow simulations, we employed quantile mapping using the observed streamflow from a nearby location. This method significantly reduced volume and variability biases by up to 5 times on both daily and monthly scales. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in improving temporal correlation on a daily scale in small catchments remained constrained. For the reservoir storage changes in the Hwanggang dam, we combined multiple remote sensing imagery, particularly cloud-free optical images of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and snow-free Sentinel-1, with the area-elevation-volume (AEV) curves derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In assessing its hydrological impacts, the study found that overall impacts within the downstream catchment in Pilseung bridge of South Korea were generally less significant compared to the upstream Hwanggang catchment. However, there was a higher probability of experiencing water shortages during wet months due to the upstream dam's operations. The study highlights the potential benefits of utilizing the publicly available hydrological model and satellite remote sensing imagery to supplement decision makers with important information for the effective management of the transboundary river basin in ungauged regions.

TI  - Assessments for the Effect of Mineral Dust on the Spring Heat Waves in the Sahel
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical mechanisms associated with heat waves (HWs) are well known in the midlatitudes but still under-documented in the Sahel. Specifically, the role of anthropogenic and natural changes in tropospheric aerosols regarding HWs remains an issue to address. Our study focuses on the characterisation of the dusty HWs in the Sahel, which generally occur from March to June. The goal is to reinforce or invalidate the assumption proposed in previous studies recently carried out in southern Europe and according to which mineral dust may locally change irradiance at the surface, thus atmospheric temperatures at 2 m, intensifying the HW. The work is carried out in three steps: (i) detect and describe the HW over the 2003-2014 period based on maximum daily 2-m temperatures (Tmax) from ERA-Interim reanalyses; (ii) characterise the dust optical properties during the HW using the Deep Blue aerosols products from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometre): the Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD550), the Angstrom Exponent (AE440-870) and the Single Scattering Albedo at 412 nm (SSA412) as a proxy of quantity over atmospheric column, size and absorption of aerosols, respectively; (iii) relate HW intensity to the aerosol conditions during the HW. Over the 12-year study period, 14 HWs are detected when Tmax exceeds the 90th percentile (P90). The HWs are dusty with AOD550 ranging between 0.46 and 1.17 and all the dust types are absorbent with a SSA412 value of 0.93 (round to hundredths). The HW classification according to aerosol conditions gave three HWs: Type 1 corresponds to Pure Dust Situation (PDS with AE440-870 = 0.1), Type 2 and Type 3 are associated with Mixed Situation (MS) with dominance of Coarse Particles (CP with AE440-870 = 0.35) and Fine Particles (FP with AE440-870 = 0.65), respectively. The main result obtained is that the intensity of the dusty HW, computed as the difference between daily Tmax and its P90 (Tmax-P90)), is higher for Type 1 HW (+1.1 & DEG;C) in the case of the most absorbent aerosol situation (SSA412 = 0.931). A non-significant difference between Type 2 and Type 3 especially for temperature (+0.5 & DEG;C and +0.4 & DEG;C, respectively) and SSA (0.938 and 0.935, respectively) is observed and, during these mixing situations, the HWs are less intense than those during the PDS. Finally, the analysis of two huge Type 1 HWs in 2007 and 2010 shows that dust mass concentrations at the surface were particularly high, up to 214 & mu;g/m3 on average. These findings enable us to assess that highly absorbent and concentrated pure dust situations observed in spring in the Sahel may have a potential warming effect at the surface.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Variations of GPP and Its Climatic Driving Factors in the Yangtze River Basin during 2000-2018
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) is the major carbon input to the terrestrial ecosystem. The Yangtze River Basin (YRB) holds a key role in shaping China's economic and social progress, as well as in ecological and environmental protection. However, how the GPP in the YRB responds to the climate factors remain unclear. In this research, we applied the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) GPP data to explore the spatial and temporal variations of GPP in the YRB during 2000-2018. Based on the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was employed to identify the GPP responses to changes in precipitation, temperature, and shortwave radiation between 2000 and 2018. The findings showed that the long-term average of GPP in the YRB was 1153.5 & PLUSMN; 472.4 g C m-2 yr-1 between 2000 and 2018. The GPP of the Han River Basin, the Yibin-Yichang section of the Yangtze River mainstream, and the Poyang Lake Basin were relatively high, while the GPP of the Jinsha River Basin above Shigu and the Taihu Lake Basin were relatively low. A significant upward trend in GPP was observed over the 19-year period, with an annual increase rate of 8.86 g C m-2 yr-1 per year. The GPP of the Poyang Lake Basin and Jialing River Basin grew much faster than other water resource regions. Savannas and forests also had relatively higher GPP rate of increase compared to other vegetation types. The relative contributions of precipitation, temperature, and shortwave radiation to GPP variations in the YRB were 13.85 & PLUSMN; 13.86%, 58.87 & PLUSMN; 9.79%, and 27.07 & PLUSMN; 15.92%, respectively. Our results indicated that temperature was the main climatic driver on the changes of GPP in the YRB. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the variations and climate-impacting factors of vegetation productivity in the YRB.

TI  - Spatial Patterns of the Primorye Current in the Northwestern East/Japan Sea on Satellite Images and Standard Sections
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns of the Primorye Current, as a band of cold water along the coast of Primorye (northwestern East/Japan Sea), are considered on the data of satellite images and standard sections obtained in 2000-2020. The data of AVHRR and MODIS scanners mounted on the satellites NOAA, Terra and Aqua are used with spatial resolution of 1.0-1.1 km. Temperature and salinity profiles in the upper 500 m layer were measured at the standard sections directed southward and east-southeastward from Vladivostok. The new data contradict a false supposition about the current origin from the Okhotsk Sea that is preserved in the name of "Liman Current", still used sometimes. The cold-water area prolongs from the southern Tatar Strait to Peter the Great Bay but is definitely separated from the Amur Liman. Its core with the lowest SST is usually located on the external shelf of Primorye, outside of the Tatar Strait. Shape of the cold-water area is complicated and highly variable; it looks seldom as an alongshore flow, but more frequently as chains of eddies or filaments. In winter, the Primorye Current is presented usually as a wide uninterrupted alongshore belt with many intrusions to the warmer waters. This belt is distorted in spring by mesoscale eddies. In summer, the cold-water zone is narrowed and sometimes interrupted between 43 and 45 & DEG;N; the cold waters interact with large anticyclonic eddies which transport the warm subtropic water close to the shore. The cold-water zone begins to extend again in fall season: large eddies and cold intrusions spread offshore, and upwellings appear at the coast. In November-December, summer stratification is destroyed and the warm water advection is weakened, so the solid band of cold water mixed by convection occupies a vast area of the northwestern East/Japan Sea off the coast of Primorye. Observed structural patterns show that the cold water at the sea surface along the coast of Primorye is produced on the shelf by upwellings or tidal mixing. Possible mechanisms of the cold spot inducing are discussed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in Driving Factors of Vegetation Dynamics in the Yellow River Delta Estuarine Wetlands from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies of vegetation dynamics in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) predominantly relied on sparse time series or coarse-resolution images, which not only overlooked the rapid and spatially heterogeneous changes, but also limited our understanding of driving mechanisms. Here, employing spatiotemporal data fusion methods, we constructed a novel fused enhanced vegetation index (EVI) dataset with a high spatiotemporal resolution (30-meter and 8-day resolution) for the YRD from 2000 to 2020, and we analyzed the vegetation variations and their driving factors within and outside the YRD Nation Natural Reserve (YRDNRR). The fused EVI effectively captured spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics. Notably, within the YRDNRR core area, the fused EVI showed no significant trend before 2010, while a significant increase emerged post-2010, with an annual growth of 7%, the invasion of Spartina alterniflora explained 78% of this EVI increment. In the YRDNRR experimental area, the fused EVI exhibited a distinct interannual trend, which was characterized by an initial increase (2000-2006, p < 0.01), followed by a subsequent decrease (2006-2011, p < 0.01) and, ultimately, a renewed increase (2011-2020, p > 0.05); the dynamics of the fused EVI were mainly affected by the spring runoff (R-2 = 0.71), while in years with lower runoff, it was also affected by the spring precipitation (R-2 = 0.70). Outside of the protected area, the fused EVI demonstrated a substantial increase from 2000 to 2010 due to agricultural land expansion and human management practices, followed by stabilization post-2010. These findings enhance our comprehension of intricate vegetation dynamics in the YRD, holding significant relevance in terms of wetland preservation and management.

TI  - Nuclear medicine contribution to precision surgery in breast cancer
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Nuclear medicine has significantly contributed to precision surgery in breast cancer in the past decades. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has enabled sentinel node (SN) biopsy in assessing regional nodal involve-ment modifying the management of patients with early breast cancer. For the axilla the SN procedure has resulted in fewer complications and better quality of life when compared with axillary lymph node dissection. Originally, SN biopsy principally concerned cT1-2 tumors without evidence of axillary lymph node metastases. However, in last years SN biopsy is also being offered to patients with large or multifocal tumors, ductal carcinoma in situ, ipsilateral breast cancer relapse, and to patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) for breast sparing surgery. Parallel to this evolution various scientific asso-ciations are trying to homogenise issues such as radiotracer choice, breast injection site, preoperative imaging standardisation and SN biopsy timing in relation to NST as well as management of non-axillary SN metastasis (e.g. internal mammary chain). Additionally, RGS is currently used to accomplish primary breast tumour excision either by intralesional radiocolloid injection or by radioactive iodine seed implan-tation which is also employed to target metastatic axillary lymph nodes. This latter procedure contributes to manage the node-positive axilla in combination with 18F-FDG PET/CT in an effort to tailor systemic and loco regional treatment.& COPY; 2023 Sociedad Espanjola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

TI  - Origin of El-Maghara Anticlines, North Sinai Peninsula, Egypt: Insights from Gravity Data Interpretation Using Edge Detection Filters
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The gravity data of Gebel El-Maghara area and its surrounding region in northern Sinai Peninsula, Egypt have been subjected to high precision edge detection filters in order to evaluate the structural and tectonic settings of the study area. Various traditional and modern edge detection filters were tested on synthetic gravity data and then the most successful filters in detection the boundaries of the causative bodies have been used to accomplish the study's objectives. By examining the power spectrum of the gravity data, three gravity maps were generated using low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filters, respectively, representing deep, intermediate and shallow gravity anomalies. The STDR filter and its total horizontal derivative were applied to these gravity maps to image the causative structural features (faults and contacts) and construct structural maps at these different depths. The findings demonstrate that the major trend of faults and contacts at deep depths predominantly aligns along the WNW-ESE direction, while at shallow depths, the main orientation is observed along the NE-SW direction. It is worth noting that the trend of structures at shallow depths demonstrates a good agreement with the structural trends derived from both surface structural map and Landsat images. This trend disparity supports the hypothesis that the formation of the anticlines in the study area is linked to thin-skinned tectonic processes associated with the Syrian Arc system.

TI  - Coupling UAV Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data for Mangrove Classification Using XGBoost in China's Pinglu Canal Estuary
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine classification of mangroves plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of their structural and functional aspects which has significant implications for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality enhancement, and sustainable development. Accurate classification aids in effective mangrove management, protection, and preservation of coastal ecosystems. Previous studies predominantly relied on passive optical remote sensing images as data sources for mangrove classification, often overlooking the intricate vertical structural complexities of mangrove species. In this study, we address this limitation by incorporating unmanned aerial vehicle-LiDAR (UAV-LiDAR) point cloud 3D data with UAV hyperspectral imagery to perform multivariate classification of mangrove species. Five distinct variable scenarios were employed: band characteristics (S1), vegetation index (S2), texture measures (S3), fused hyperspectral characteristics (S4), and a canopy height model (CHM) combined with UAV hyperspectral characteristics and LiDAR point cloud data (S5). To execute this classification task, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm was employed. Our investigation focused on the estuary of the Pinglu Canal, situated within the Maowei Sea of the Beibu Gulf in China. By comparing the classification outcomes of the five variable scenarios, we assessed the unique contributions of each variable to the accurate classification of mangrove species. The findings underscore several key points: (1) The fusion of multiple features in the image scenario led to a higher overall accuracy (OA) compared to models that employed individual features. Specifically, scenario S4 achieved an OA of 88.48% and scenario S5 exhibited an even more impressive OA of 96.78%. These figures surpassed those of the individual feature models where the results were S1 (83.35%), S2 (83.55%), and S3 (71.28%). (2) Combining UAV hyperspectral and LiDAR-derived CHM data yielded improved accuracy in mangrove species classification. This fusion ultimately resulted in an OA of 96.78% and kappa coefficient of 95.96%. (3) Notably, the incorporation of data from individual bands and vegetation indices into texture measures can enhance the accuracy of mangrove species classification. The approach employed in this study-a combination of the XGBoost algorithm and the integration of UAV hyperspectral and CHM features from LiDAR point cloud data-proved to be highly effective and exhibited strong performance in classifying mangrove species. These findings lay a robust foundation for future research efforts focused on mangrove ecosystem services and ecological restoration of mangrove forests.

TI  - A CNN-LSTM Machine-Learning Method for Estimating Particulate Organic Carbon from Remote Sensing in Lakes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As particulate organic carbon (POC) from lakes plays an important role in lake ecosystem sustainability and carbon cycle, the estimation of its concentration using satellite remote sensing is of great interest. However, the high complexity and variability of lake water composition pose major challenges to the estimation algorithm of POC concentration in Class II water. This study aimed to formulate a machine-learning algorithm to predict POC concentration and compare their modeling performance. A Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm based on spectral and time sequences was proposed to construct an estimation model using the Sentinel 2 satellite images and water surface sample data of Chaohu Lake in China. As a comparison, the performances of the Backpropagation Neural Network (BP), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were evaluated for remote sensing inversion of POC concentration. The results show that the CNN-LSTM model obtained higher prediction precision than the BP, GRNN, and CNN models, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.66, and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 3.03, which are 6.02%, 22.13%, and 28.4% better than the CNN model, respectively. This indicates that CNN-LSTM effectively combines spatial and temporal information, quickly captures time-series features, strengthens the learning ability of multi-scale features, is conducive to improving estimation precision of remote sensing models, and offers good support for carbon source monitoring and assessment in lakes.

TI  - E2EVAP: End-to-end vectorization of smallholder agricultural parcel boundaries from high-resolution remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate agricultural parcel mapping from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is fundamental to precision agriculture for smallholder farming systems. However, due to the narrow and small-size parcels, and the significant spatio-spectral variability, the existing two-stage segmentation methods cannot extract individual parcels automatically. In this article, the end-to-end vectorization of smallholder agricultural parcel boundaries (E2EVAP) framework is proposed for extracting the vertices of each parcel boundary individually in smallholder farming regions, where the semantic-contour interaction and topological loss through hierarchical instance representation (called "channel to instance") are designed for aggregating the foreground features and jointly establishing the topological relationship between instances to alleviate the topological overlap between parcel objects. Vertex shift correction based on the deep attention corner snake module guided by the parcel boundaries is also proposed to adaptively correct the boundary vertex location shift of large-scale irregular parcels. The comprehensive experimental results obtained on the iFLYTEK public agricultural parcel dataset confirm that E2EVAP shows a superior performance (with a mask mAP of 0.335 and a boundary mAP of 0.201), compared with the pixel-based (such as Mask R-CNN, HTC, and SOLOv2) and contour-based (such as DeepSnake and E2EC) benchmark methods. We believe that E2EVAP has the potential to be widely used for accurate vectorization mapping of agricultural parcels in smallholder farming areas such as South Africa and southern China. The code of E2EVAP is at https://github.com/YangPanHZAU/E2EVAP.

TI  - Research on On-Orbit Radiometric Calibration Method for Remote Sensors with Large Fields of View Based on Snow and Ice Scenes
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Radiation calibration is a necessary prerequisite for the quantification of remote sensing data from laboratory calibration before launch to on-orbit calibration after launch throughout the entire life cycle of remote sensors. Site calibration is a common method for on-orbit alternative calibration of remote sensors with large fields of view. When a remote sensor is operating normally, it is calibrated with a large area of uniform ground objects as the calibration source, which has the advantages of a high calibration frequency and no need for synchronous measurement. The Greenland ice sheet (- 75 degrees S, 123 degrees E) and the Antarctic ice sheet (73. 375 degrees N, -40 degrees W) are commonly used as targets for snow and ice scenes, whose surfaces are covered with evenly distributed snow. Due to their high altitudes (usually greater than 2 km), they are less affected by the atmosphere and help obtain calibration samples with better data quality. Furthermore, ice and snow have a relatively flat spectrum in the visible range, which makes band transfer easier with other calibration methods. Thus, using the Greenland ice sheet and the Antarctic ice sheet as the calibration source of snow and ice scenes has many advantages for the calibration and verification of remote sensors.Methods The research method in this paper is based on the previous study of polar scene calibration methods. First, we choose Greenland as the calibration target of snow and ice scenes and select the calibration sample in the directional polarimetric camera (DPC) level 1 data. The area interfered with by cloud pixels is then eliminated after spectral channel traversal and angle traversal through the calibration sample's rows and columns. After substituting the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and atmospheric parameters ( aerosol, water vapor, ozone, and other profiles) of the snow and ice scene into the radiative transfer model to obtain the zenith reflectivity and radiance, we test the on-orbit radiation response changes of the payload of the DPC on Gaofen-5 satellite. In addition, the obtained conclusions are in good agreement with the calibration results of the desert and ocean scenes, and the dispersion of the calibration results is smaller.Results and Discussions We compare the measured results of the DPC with the calibration results and obtain the following findings.1) When the view zenith angle is less than 50 degrees, the measured reflectance values of each band of the DPC have good consistency with the calibrated reflectance values. The standard deviations of their ratios are within 3%, and the root-mean-square errors were both lower than 2% (Fig. 4 and Table 3).2) When the view zenith angle is less than 30 degrees, the measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance values in each band of the DPC are compared with the calibrated TOA radiance values. The results show that the DPC data in the visible light band are relatively stable and have low uncertainty (Fig. 5 and Table 4).3) The influence of the atmosphere (aerosol, water vapor, and ozone) and the surface BRDF on TOA reflectivity is analyzed. The uncertainty of the BRDF model of the snow and ice scene is 2%. Finally, we synthesize the uncertainty of each factor, and the synthetic uncertainty of each band is 2% ( Table 5).4) The research on the size of ice and snow shows that the average relative error of fine snow in each band is within 4%, and the relative error standard deviation of bands from 443 nm to 765 nm is within 2%, so the data of fine snow in each band is relatively stable (Fig. 9 and Table 6).5) The results obtained in this paper are compared with the calibration results of the desert scene and the ocean scene. The comparison results show that the calibration coefficient of the Greenland snow and ice scene deviates from the average value of the calibration coefficients of the ocean scene and the desert scene within 5%, and the standard deviation of the Greenland polar scene is within 2% (Table 7 and Table 8).Conclusions Inspired by the idea of on-orbit alternative calibration, we propose an on-orbit radiometric calibration method based on the glacier scenes in the North and South Poles. We choose Greenland for research and analysis and conduct radiometric calibration of the remote sensor DPC with a large field of view. The measurement results of the DPC are compared with the calibration results. The comparison results show that the measured value and the calibrated value in each band of DPC are in good agreement. The standard deviation of the ratio of the measured value to the calibrated value is within 3%, and the root-mean-square error is lower than 2%, which proves that DPC has a good performance in snow and ice scenes. Moreover, through the error analysis of the atmosphere and the surface, it is shown that the BRDF on the surface has the greatest influence, and the final synthetic uncertainty in the visible light band is 2%. Finally, the comparison of the calibration results of this paper with the calibration results of the desert scene and the ocean scene also proves the stability of the calibration results of the Greenland snow and ice scene and the validity and reliability of the calibration method. The method described in this paper can provide long-term monitoring and calibration of the detection data while the payload is on orbit and contribute to the quality improvement of products for operational application.

TI  - Climatology and interannual variability of the migrating quarterdiurnal tide (QW4) seen in the SABER/TIMED temperatures (2002-2022)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a climatological global view on the spatial structure and interannual variability of the high-frequency migrating quarterdiurnal tide (QW4) built on a large statistics of the 21 years (2002-2022) SABER/ TIMED temperature measurements. The obtained consistent picture for the vertical structure and phase coher-ence provide strong support that the observed oscillation is a tide which is a permanent feature of middle at-mospheric dynamics while the repeating seasonal variability during all 21 years reaffirms the validity and effectiveness of the satellite data analysis method previously proposed by the same authors and used for analyzing the satellite data. The climatological tidal amplitudes rapidly growth with the height, as the 21-yearly mean amplitude changes from-1.6 K at 84 km to-7.9 K at 110 km; the latter is the largest climatologically mean tidal amplitude observed at latitude of 20 degrees S. The tide is stronger in the SH than that in the NH particularly in the lower thermosphere and it is stronger at low latitudes than that at middle latitudes at all considered heights in the & PLUSMN;50 degrees latitude range. The latitude tidal structure changes quite rapidly with height. While it is definitely asymmetric about the equator in the lower thermosphere with main enhancements at 110 km height situated around the equator, at-20 degrees S and around & PLUSMN;(40-50 degrees), the tidal structures at lower height levels become more symmetric as that at 84 km height with enhancements at the equator, & PLUSMN;35 degrees and around & PLUSMN;50 degrees. The seasonal variability based on the latitude and altitude climatological tidal structures indicated that at least four seasonal components have to be included in correctly describing the tidal seasonal behavior. The 21-year QW4 clima-tology reports for the first time the presence of the vertically upward propagating QW4 tide around the latitudes of -(0 degrees -20 degrees N) with a wavelength of-30 km, hence for correct description of the QW4 tide it is necessary besides the trapped and propagating Hough modes with very large wavelengths some propagating modes with shorter wavelengths to be included as well. This study also presents the QW4 responses to the 11-year solar cycle and the quasi-biennial oscillation at 30 hPa which define the tidal interannual variability.

TI  - A satellite-observation based study on responses of clouds to aerosols over South Asia during IOD events of south-west monsoon season
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigated the possible effects of aerosols on cloud properties during positive and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) months over South Asia using 20 years (2002-2021) of long-term satellite-based observations and reanalyses datasets. Positive aerosol optical depth (AOD) differences between the two IOD phases are found mainly over the land areas and some parts of the Indian Ocean, with the maximum value observed over Indonesia, Malaysia, Northern China, Western India, and the Northern Arabian Sea. The negative AOD differences are seen over the equatorial Indian Ocean, some regions of Indian land mass, the North Indian Ocean, and some parts of the South China Sea, with the highest dip over the central Indo-Gangetic Plain region. The highest increase (decrease) in rainfall is observed over the western (eastern) pole. The reduced rainfall is responsible for the increased AOD over Indonesia, Malaysia, and neighboring regions. The strong negative relationships of cloud fraction (CF) with cloud top pressure and cloud optical depth (COD) suggest persisting optically thick middle and high-level clouds during the IOD months. Twomey effect is noticed over the study region during both the IOD phases irrespective of the meteorological conditions. CF and COD both showed an upsurge with increased AOD in the presence of high relative humidity and stronger updrafts, suggesting the role of prevailing meteorology in forming thicker clouds. However, the height of the cloud tops is getting lowered in polluted conditions. The aerosol-cloud relationships observed during IOD scenarios could be attributed to the prevailing meteorology.

This system can be applied to remotely obtain the radioactivity distribution and identify the radionuclides in radioactive waste by utilizing a scanning method. Variation in scintillation light was measured in two-dimensional regions of interest and then converted into radioactivity distribution images. Outliers present in the images were removed by using a digital filter to make the hot spot location more accurate and cubic interpolation was applied to make the images smoother and clearer. Next, gamma-ray spectroscopy was performed to identify the radionuclides, and three-dimensional volume scanning was also performed to effectively find the hot spot using the proposed array sensor.& COPY; 2023 Korean Nuclear Society, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comparative analysis of the coastal performances of Sentinel-6 and Jason-3 altimeters during their tandem phase, considering their different processing modes. We examine the measurements available in the standard geophysical data records (GDR) and also perform dedicated reprocessing using coastal retracking algorithms applied to the original waveforms. The performances are evaluated, taking into account the quality of retrievals (outlier analysis), their precision (along-track noise analysis), potential systematic biases, and accuracy (comparison against tide gauges). The official SAR altimetry product of Sentinel-6 demonstrates improved coastal monitoring capabilities compared to Jason-3, except for the remaining issues related to significant wave height, which have already been identified. These findings highlight the significance of dedicated coastal retracking algorithms for enhancing the capabilities of both traditional, pulse-limited altimeters and more recent developments utilizing SAR altimetry.

TI  - Lymph node metastasis and tumor-educated immune tolerance: Potential therapeutic targets against distant metastasis
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node metastasis has been shown to positively associated with the prognosis of many cancers. However, in clinical treatment, lymphadenectomy is not always successful, suggesting that immune cells in the tumor and sentinel lymph nodes still play a pivotal role in tumor immunosuppression. Recent studies had shown that tumors can tolerate immune cells through multiple strategies, including tumor-induced macrophage reprogramming, T cells inactivation, production of B cells pathogenic antibodies and activation of regulatory T cells to promote tumor colonization, growth, and metastasis in lymph nodes. We reviewed the bidirectional effect of immune cells on anti-tumor or promotion of cancer cell metastasis during lymph node metastasis, and the mechanisms by which malignant cancer cells modify immune cells to create a more favorable environment for the growth and survival of cancer cells. Research and treatment strategies focusing on the immune system in lymph nodes and potential immune targets in lymph node metastasis were also be discussed.

TI  - Exploring microplastic contamination in Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis): Insights into plastic pollution in the southwestern tropical Atlantic.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Marine mammals are considered sentinel species and may act as indicators of ocean health. Plastic residues are widely distributed in the oceans and are recognised as hazardous contaminants, and once ingested can cause several adverse effects on wildlife. This study aimed to identify and characterise plastic ingestion in the Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from the Southwestern Tropical Atlantic by evaluating the stomach contents of stranded individuals through KOH digestion and identification of subsample of particles by LDIR Chemical Imaging System. Most of the individuals were contaminated, and the most common polymers identified were PU, PET and EVA. Microplastics were more prevalent than larger plastic particles (meso- and macroplastics). Smaller particles were detected during the rainy seasons. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the stomach content mass and the number of microplastics, suggesting contamination through trophic transfer.

TI  - Future Directions in the Assessment of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives: Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and accurate assessment of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) is crucial for patient management and outcomes. We aim to summarize the current state of ALN assessment techniques in BC and provide insights into future directions. Materials and Methods: This review discusses various imaging techniques used for ALN evaluation, including ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. It highlights advancements in these techniques and their potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. The review also examines landmark clinical trials that have influenced axillary management, such as the Z0011 trial and the IBCSG 23-01 trial. The role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning algorithms, in improving ALN assessment is examined. Results: The review outlines the key findings of these trials, which demonstrated the feasibility of avoiding axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in certain patient populations with low sentinel lymph node (SLN) burden. It also discusses ongoing trials, including the SOUND trial, which investigates the use of axillary ultrasound to identify patients who can safely avoid sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Furthermore, the potential of emerging techniques and the integration of AI in enhancing ALN assessment accuracy are presented. Conclusions: The review concludes that advancements in ALN assessment techniques have the potential to improve patient outcomes by reducing surgical complications while maintaining accurate disease staging. However, challenges such as standardization of imaging protocols and interpretation criteria need to be addressed. Future research should focus on large-scale clinical trials to validate emerging techniques and establish their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Over-all, this review provides valuable insights into the current status and future directions of ALN assessment in BC, highlighting opportunities for improving patient care.

TI  - Towards Improved Quality Control of In Situ Sea Surface Temperatures from Drifting and Moored Buoys in the NOAA <i>i</i>Quam System
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The NOAA in situ Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Quality Monitor (iQuam) online system collects in situ SSTs from various sources, performs quality control (QC), and provides QC'ed data to users. Like many other in situ QCs, the iQuam QC employs comparisons with Level 4 SST analysis. However, the current daily L4 analyses do not capture the diurnal cycle, nor do they resolve the fine structure of SST in dynamic areas. As a result, high-quality in situ SSTs significantly deviating from the L4 SST may be rejected. This paper discusses the new Diurnal Reference Check (DRC), which addresses overscreening for buoys whose sampling frequency is sufficient for resolving the diurnal cycle. The DRC separates records from individual buoys into 24-h segments and characterizes each segment with the median nighttime (MNT) SST and the amplitude of the diurnal signal (ADS). The segment is rejected if the ADS is unrealistically large or if the difference between the MNT and L4 SST exceeds a geographically dependent threshold. The outliers are further screened out by comparison of individual in situ SSTs with the MNT. All thresholds are determined from the analysis of matchups with reprocessed NOAA SSTs from multiple low-orbiting satellites. The satellite matchups are also used to validate the QC results. The DRC minimizes the overscreening, increases the number of high-quality in situ data by similar to 5%, and reduces the QC reliance on the L4 analysis. In addition, a new retrospective satellite-based quality check is introduced to identify matchups, which are most useful for training SST algorithms and validation of reprocessed satellite data.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Characteristics from Multispectral Sentinel-3 Imagery and DEM Derivatives Using Machine Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, different machine learning methodologies have been evaluated for the estimation of the multiple soil characteristics of a continental-wide area corresponding to the European region, using multispectral Sentinel-3 satellite imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives. The results confirm the importance of multispectral imagery in the estimation of soil properties and specifically show that the use of DEM derivatives improves the quality of the estimates, in terms of R2, by about 19% on average. In particular, the estimation of soil texture increases by about 43%, and that of cation exchange capacity (CEC) by about 65%. The importance of each input source (multispectral and DEM) in predicting the soil properties using machine learning has been traced back. It has been found that, overall, the use of multispectral features is more important than the use of DEM derivatives with a ration, on average, of 60% versus 40%.

TI  - Surface Energy Dynamics and Canopy Structural Properties in Intact and Disturbed Forests in the Southern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon has been a focus of land development with large swaths of forests converted to agriculture. Forest degradation by selective logging and fires has accompanied the agricultural frontier and has resulted in significant impacts on Amazonian ecosystems. Changes in forest structure resulting from forest disturbances have large impacts on the surface energy balance, including on land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET). This study's objective is to assess the effects of forest disturbances on water fluxes and forest structure in a transitional forest site in the Southern Amazon. We used ET and LST products from MODIS and Landsat 8 and GEDI-derived forest structure data to address our research questions. We found that disturbances induced seasonal water stress, more pronounced in croplands/pastures than in forests (differences up to 20% in the dry season), and more pronounced in second-growth and recently burned areas than in logged and intact forests (differences up to 12% in the dry season). Moreover, ET and LST were negatively related, with more consistent relationships across disturbance classes in the dry season (R-2: 0.41-0.87) than in the wet season (R-2: 0.18-0.49). Forest and cropland or pasture classes showed contrasting relationships in the dry season. Finally, we found that forest structure exhibited stronger relationships with ET and LST in the most disturbed forests (R-2: 0.01-0.43) than in the least disturbed forests (R-2 < 0.05). Our findings help to elucidate degraded forests functioning under a changing climate and to improve estimates of water and energy fluxes in Amazonian degraded forests.

TI  - Modern Approach to Melanoma Adjuvant Treatment with Anti-PD1 Immune Check Point Inhibitors or <i>BRAF/MEK</i> Targeted Therapy: Multicenter Real-World Report
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: Performing this real-world analysis, we intended to see if postoperative (adjuvant) systemic treatment outcomes in a Polish melanoma patient population are comparable to the results from international trials based on which the treatment was registered worldwide. We intended to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of postoperative melanoma treatment from everyday practice. We have shown that the type of surgical procedure on the lymph nodes prior to adjuvant treatment does not influence the outcome of that treatment. Our results support a de-escalation of surgery approach in melanoma patients. We support the value of adjuvant treatment for melanoma patients selected according to new guidelines implemented in parallel to the registration process. Analyzing the recorded side effects of adjuvant systemic treatment in our group of patients, we have noticed that severe complications worsen survival, giving us an indication not to treat by all means despite toxicity, particularly since it is a complementary to surgery treatment.Background: The landscape of melanoma management changed as randomized trials have launched adjuvant treatment. Materials and Methods: An analysis of data on 248 consecutive melanoma stage III and IV patients given adjuvant therapy in eight centers (February 2019 to January 2021) was conducted. Results: The analyzed cohort comprised 147 melanoma patients given anti-PD1 (33% nivolumab, 26% pembrolizumab), and 101 (41%) were given dabrafenib plus trametinib (DT). The 2-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and distant-metastases-free survival (DMFS) rates were 86.7%, 61.4%, and 70.2%, respectively. The disease stage affected only the RFS rate; for stage IV, it was 52.2% (95% CI: 33.4-81.5%) vs. 62.5% (95% CI: 52.3-74.8%) for IIIA-D, p = 0.0033. The type of lymph node surgery before adjuvant therapy did not influence the outcomes. Completion of lymph node dissection cessation after positive SLNB did not affect the results in terms of RFS or OS. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were associated with longer 24-month RFS, with a rate of 68.7% (55.5-84.9%) for TRAE vs. 56.6% (45.8-70%) without TRAE, p = 0.0031. For TRAE of grade >= 3, a significant decline in OS to 60.6% (26.9-100%; p = 0.004) was observed. Conclusions: Melanoma adjuvant therapy with anti-PD1 or DT outside clinical trials appears to be effective and comparable with the results of registration studies. Our data support a de-escalating surgery approach in melanoma treatment.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Atmospheric Correction of KMSS-2 Meteor-M #2.2 Data over Northern Eurasia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing data is a prerequisite for a large variety of applications, including time series analysis and quantitative assessment of the Earth's vegetation cover. It was earlier reported that an atmospherically corrected KMSS-M (Meteor-M #2) dataset was produced for Russia and neighboring countries. The methodology adopted for atmospheric correction was based on localized histogram matching of target KMSS-M and MODIS reference gap-free and date-matching imagery. In this paper, we further advanced the methodology and quantitatively assessed Level-2 surface reflectance analysis-ready datasets, operatively produced for KMSS-2 instruments over continental scales. Quantitative assessment was based on accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (APU) metrics produced for red and near-infrared bands of the KMSS-2 instrument based on a reference derived from a MODIS MOD09 reconstructed surface reflectance. We compared error distributions at 5%, 20%, and 50% levels of cloudiness and indicated that the cloudiness factor has little impact on the robustness of the atmospheric correction regardless of the band. Finally, the spatial and temporal gradients of accuracy metrics were investigated over northern Eurasia and across different seasons. It was found that for the vast majority of observations, accuracy falls within the -0.010-0.035 range, while precision and uncertainty were below 0.06 for any band. With the successful launch of the most recent Meteor-M #2.3 with a new KMSS-2 instrument onboard, the efficiency and interoperability of the constellation are expected to increase.

TI  - Learning to care for Dangaba
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In a Kimberley place-based cultural story, Dangaba is a woman whose Country holds poison gas. Her story shows the importance of cultural ways of understanding and caring for Country, especially hazardous places. The authors contrast this with a corporate story of fossil fuel, illustrating the divergent discourses and approaches to place. Indigenous and local peoples and their knowledge, cultures, laws, philosophies and practices are vitally important to Indigenous lifeways and livelihoods, and critically significant to the long-term health and well-being of people and place in our locality, region and world. We call for storying and narratives from the pluriverse of sociocultural voices to be a meaningful part of environmental education and to be implemented in multiple places of learning. To know how to hear, understand and apply the learnings from place-based story is to know how to move beyond a normalised worldview of separation, alienation, individualism, infinite growth, consumption, extraction, commodification and craving. To know how to see, feel, describe and reflect upon experience, concepts and practice is to find ways to move towards radical generosity, mutuality of becoming, embodied kinship, wisdom, humility and respect.

TI  - Flood Extent and Volume Estimation Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are natural events that can have a significant impacts on the economy and society of affected regions. To mitigate their effects, it is crucial to conduct a rapid and accurate assessment of the damage and take measures to restore critical infrastructure as quickly as possible. Remote sensing monitoring using artificial intelligence is a promising tool for estimating the extent of flooded areas. However, monitoring flood events still presents some challenges due to varying weather conditions and cloud cover that can limit the use of visible satellite data. Additionally, satellite observations may not always correspond to the flood peak, and it is essential to estimate both the extent and volume of the flood. To address these challenges, we propose a methodology that combines multispectral and radar data and utilizes a deep neural network pipeline to analyze the available remote sensing observations for different dates. This approach allows us to estimate the depth of the flood and calculate its volume. Our study uses Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 data, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) measurements to provide accurate and reliable flood monitoring results. To validate the developed approach, we consider a flood event occurred in 2021 in Ushmun. As a result, we succeeded to evaluate the volume of that flood event at 0.0087 km3. Overall, our proposed methodology offers a simple yet effective approach to monitoring flood events using satellite data and deep neural networks. It has the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of flood damage assessments, which can aid in the timely response and recovery efforts in affected regions.

TI  - Assessment of Land Surface Temperature from the Indian Cities of Ranchi and Dhanbad during COVID-19 Lockdown: Implications on the Urban Climatology
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An apparent increase in average global temperature is evident globally, and India is no exception. With the recent decade (2011-2020) arguably being the warmest, significant challenges due to rapid climate change have gained attention. However, notable spatial-temporal changes, especially with regard to land surface temperature (LST), were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, when a comparatively cooler climate was experienced in many urban centers. Assessment of LST, crucial in many heat-balance, land use, and climate change models research studies, depicts the near-surface hotness of the Earth's temperature at a given location. Thus, this study utilizes satellite remote-sensing data to investigate the spatial-temporal variations of LST pre and post-lockdown imposed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Unlike many existing research studies on the metropolitans of India, the study considers developing Indian cities, Ranchi and Dhanbad, as its study area. Accurate LST computation was performed using existing LANDSAT-8 OLI/TIRS images and judged using other parameters (NDVI, LSE) obtained directly from the thermal infrared bands. The LST assessment successfully estimated temperature variations in Ranchi and Dhanbad, depicting a significant drop in temperature coinciding with the lockdown period and subsequent increase in urban temperature post-pandemic, indicating a meaningful relationship between human activities and urban surface temperature.

TI  - Mapping tea plantations using multitemporal spectral features by harmonised Sentinel-2 and Landsat images in Yingde, China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea is a highly demanded and valuable commodity in both domestic and international markets, with China being the world's largest producer and exporter, resulting in the expansion of tea tree cultivation in China over the past few decades. Accurate mapping of tea plantations is vital for tea markets, food security, poverty alleviation, and ecosystem value assessment. However, research on vegetation plantation monitoring has focused primarily on food crops, and the spatial information for the perennial tea tree is often neglected. Moreover, monitoring tea plantations poses significant challenges in terms of the diverse cultivation management measures, the heterogeneity of tea garden landscapes, and the limited availability of clear imagery due to cloud cover. In this study, we constructed a novel tea plantation mapping algorithm based on multitemporal spectral features. In addition, a Tea Plantation Phenological Feature Index (TPI) is proposed to enable easy and reliable monitoring of tea plantations. The algorithm harmonized the Landsat7/8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, utilizing a semi-automatic decision tree model to identify tea gardens in Yingde City, Guangdong Province. Our results show that the tea plantation phenological feature index (TPI), green band in October (Green(Oct)) and cumulative band in April (CBApr) are the most effective multitemporal spectral features for identifying tea gardens. The F1-score, OA, and kappa coefficients (Kappa) of the 2020 tea plantation map generated by the tea plantation mapping algorithm based on multitemporal spectral features are 90.75%, 92.71%, and 0.844, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithm is time-reusable, as evidenced by the F1-score, OA, and kappa coefficients of the generated 2021 tea plantation map, which are 85.99%, 88.86%, and 0.7675, respectively. Our results underscore the exceptional ability of the multitemporal spectral features to separate tea gardens from evergreen forests. The tea plantation mapping algorithm based on multitemporal spectral features is a robust, user-friendly, and effective tool suitable for regional or national annual tea plantation mapping, enabling sustainable production and implementing.

TI  - Model-free daily inversion of NOx emissions using TROPOMI (MCMFE-NOx) and its uncertainty: Declining regulated emissions and growth of new sources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current approaches to estimate NOx emissions fail to account for new and small sources, biomass burning, and sources which change rapidly in time, generally don't account for measurement error, and are either based on models, or do not consider wind, chemistry, and dynamical effects. This work introduces a new, model-free analytical environment that assimilates daily TROPOMI NO2 measurements in a mass-conserving manner, to invert daily NOx emissions. This is applied over a rapidly developing and energy-consuming region of Northwest China, specifically chosen due to substantial economic and population changes, new environmental policies, large use of coal, and access to independent emissions measurements for validation, making this region representative of many rapidly developing regions found across the Global South. This technique computes a net NOx emissions gain of 118% distributed in a see-saw manner: a more than doubling of emissions in cleaner regions, chemical plants, and regions thought to be emissions-free, combined with a more than halving of emissions in city centers and at well-regulated steel and powerplants. The results allow attribution of sources, with major contributing factors computed to be increased combustion temperature, atmospheric transport, and in-situ chemical processing. Furthermore, sensitivity runs that represent the range of uncertainties in the TROPOMI NO2 retrievals themselves are performed, and it is determined that the differences between the errors in TROPOMI NO2 lead to smaller errors in the emissions estimates, due to non-linear buffering built in from the physical bounds on the underlying physical and chemical driving factors. It is also observed that errors in the priori dataset contribute more than the uncertainties in the TROPOMI retrievals, opening a new door to recursive iteration between this approach and new emissions dataset development. It is hoped that these findings will drive a new look at emissions estimation and how it is related to remotely sensed measurements and associated uncertainties, especially applied to rapidly developing regions. This is especially important for understanding the loadings and impacts of short-lived climate forcers, and provides a bridge between remotely sensed data, measurement error, and models, while allowing for further improvement of identification of new, small, and rapidly changing sources.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 using a first-order radiative transfer model-A case-study over the Po-Valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable controlling many land surface processes and is used to quantify precipitation, drought, flooding, irrigation and other factors that influence decision making and risk-assessment. This paper presents the retrieval of high resolution (-1 km) soil moisture data from Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter measurements using a new bistatic radiative transfer modeling framework (RT1) previously only tested for scatterometer data. The model is applied over a diverse set of landcover types across the entire Po-Valley in Italy over a 4-year time-period from 2016 to 2019. The performance of the soil moisture retrievals is analyzed with respect to the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset. The model parameterisation and retrieval method are chosen such as to constitute a trade-off between a physically plausible and a computationally feasible modeling approach. The results demonstrate the potential of RT1 for the retrieval of high-resolution soil moisture data from SAR time series.

T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental conservation management planning has an important role in creating conditions for social learning, adaptive governance, and improvements for co-management arrangements with Indigenous peoples. Incorporating Indigenous cosmologies, worldviews, and epistemologies within management planning processes can enable factors that support appropriate management practices for protected areas considered to be sacred natural sites by Indigenous peoples. Here, we review processes and outcomes of management planning led by Native Hawaiians with various positionalities that resulted in the Mai Ka Po Mai Native Hawaiian Guidance Document for the Management of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. As we look back to look forward, we highlight the factors that supported knowledge co-production and expanded opportunities to develop management planning and evaluation processes informed by Hawaiian place-based knowledge and human-nature relations of care and reciprocity. These include collaborative approaches, long-term commitment to community and institution capacity-building; an enabling policy environment; and diverse and consistent involvement of Native Hawaiians.

TI  - S2MetNet: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for methane point source quantification using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane, as a crucial greenhouse gas, plays a significant role in global warming, contributing to approximately one-quarter of the observed climate change since pre-industrial times. Consequently, the detection and quantification of major methane emitters are vital in addressing this issue effectively. Satellite sensors with shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands provide valuable information for monitoring methane emissions. For example, Sentinel-2 multispectral data have the capability to detect methane plumes of large point sources. As such, a wide range of quantification approaches have been developed to quantify methane source rates based on this dataset. Most of the existing methods, however, require auxiliary data, such as wind speed, and have large uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a novel approach based on deep learning models to enhance the precision of methane quantification using Sentinel-2 data without the reliance on external data sources. To train the proposed deep learning model, a comprehensive benchmark dataset has been generated, using Sentinel-2 data. This dataset is created by integrating simulated plumes and background noise extracted from real Sentinel-2 images. This approach ensures the integration of realistic environmental conditions within the simulated data, enhancing the robustness and reliability of our proposed model. The generated benchmark dataset is utilized in different deep learning architectures, namely VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, DenseNet-121, Swin-T, and EfficientNet-V2L, to estimate methane source rate. The performance of deep models has been evaluated in three learning strategies, namely from scratch, transfer-learning, and fine-tuning. The fine-tuned EfficientNet-V2L achieves the highest accuracy with root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Pearson R of 2101 kg h-1, 10.05%, and 95.70%, respectively. More importantly, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional physical-based quantification methods (e.g., integrated mass enhancement) and recently developed deep learning model techniques (e.g., MethaNet). In particular, the proposed model exhibits an improvement of approximately 1287 kg h-1 in terms of RMSE, a 3.92% reduction in MAPE, and a 5.01% enhancement in R compared to the IME method. These results highlight the advancements achieved by the proposed approach in accurately quantifying methane emissions using Sentinel-2 imagery. The generated benchmark dataset and the developed deep learning model presented in this study serve as a fundamental resource and constructive framework for future research, promoting extensive implementation across various methane monitoring scenarios on different satellites and in distinct geographic regions, which delivering greater effectiveness to global methane emission monitoring initiatives.

TI  - Application of Satellite-Derived Summer Bloom Indicators for Estonian Coastal Waters of the Baltic Sea
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to test and develop the indicators for the remote sensing assessment of cyanobacterial blooms as an input to the estimation of eutrophication and the environmental status (ES) under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in the optically varying Estonian coastal regions (the Baltic Sea). Here, the assessment of cyanobacteria blooms considered the chlorophyll-a (chl-a), turbidity, and biomass of N2-fixing cyanobacteria. The Sentinel-3 A/B Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data and Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor were used for chl-a and turbidity detection. The ES was assessed using four methods: the Phytoplankton Intensity Index (PII), the Cyanobacterial Surface Accumulations Index (CSA), and two variants of the Cyanobacterial Bloom Indicator (CyaBI) either with in situ-measured cyanobacterial biomass or with satellite-estimated cyanobacterial biomass. The threshold values for each coastal area ES assessment are presented. During 2022, the NW Gulf of Riga reached good ES, but most of the 16 coastal areas failed to achieve good ES according to one or multiple indices. Overall, the CyaBI gives the most comprehensive assessment of cyanobacteria blooms, with the CyaBI (in situ) being the best suited for naturally turbid areas. The CyaBI (satellite) could be more useful than in situ in large open areas, where the coverage of in situ sampling is insufficient.

TI  - Discursive Norms and Incentives for Equipping Students with Religion and Worldview Literacy in Swedish Preschool Teacher Education Policy
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing societal diversity of religions and worldviews (R&W) in Swedish preschools affects what competencies today's preschool teachers need and what needs to be taught in Swedish Preschool Teacher Education (PTE). The study aims to investigate the content and discursive norms regarding religion and worldviews in Swedish PTEs on a national policy level and contribute to knowledge in the research field of Religious Studies and Higher Education. The PTE curricula of all the twenty Higher Education institutions offering PTE in Sweden in 2022 are investigated using text-centred discourse analysis, together with a theoretical and analytical tool for analyzing different dimensions of the PTEs and the potential for them to function as socially sustainable communities of care. The results show that even though there might be implicit incentives for teaching about R&W, all but one of the educational curricula of the twenty PTEs in Sweden lack explicit mention of 'religion'. Based on the results, we can see that at a national policy level, the content of the educational curricula reproduces liberal secular and humanist worldviews as norms for the PTEs. There is also a lack of explicit policy-related incentives for the PTEs to promote social sustainability regarding equipping students with proper knowledge and skills for developing care-centered and norm-critical R&W literacy.

TI  - Ecohydrological Footprint and Climate Trends in Lotic Ecosystems of Central Western Ghats
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecohydrological assessment of lotic ecosystems would provide insights into understanding the symbiotic interactions of hydrological and ecological processes for sustainable catchment management to ensure water security and achieve sustainable development goals (SDG). Global monitoring reveals changing climate patterns due to the unabated anthropogenic activities altering the ecohydrological behavior of waterscapes and thus affecting the sustenance of natural resources. The current research investigates the ecohydrological footprint using a modified water balance method by accounting for climatic and land-use trends across three river catchments in the northern portion of the Central Western Ghats. Assessment of landscape dynamics using temporal remote sensing data indicates the reduction in forest cover in Mahadayi, Ghataprabha, and Malaprabha river basins with increased anthropogenic activities. Evaluation of climate trends shows rising temperatures over 0.4 & DEG;C in the last century with increasing rainfall. The consequence of enhanced rainfall is increased overland flows to the extent of 35-80% in all river basins. Water availability in streams during all seasons is evident in the catchment dominated by native forest cover, while streams are intermittent and seasonal at the transition zone and plains. Analyses of temperature and rainfall in the last century indicate higher spatial variations directly influencing surface and subsurface hydrology. The reduced native forest cover has directly affected the variations in the local temperatures and precipitation patterns. This highlights the need for maintaining the ecological integrity of watersheds with native vegetation cover for sustaining the natural resources (water, etc.) that support the livelihood of farmers with socio-economic benefits.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Intensification in Ecuador through Spectral Analysis of MODIS NDVI Time Series
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple cropping systems constitute an essential agricultural practice that will ensure food security within the increasing demand of basic cereals as a consequence of global population growth and climate change effects. In this regard, there is a need to develop new methodologies to adequately monitor cropland intensification. The main objective of this research was to assess cropland intensification by means of spectral analysis of MODIS NDVI time series in a high cloudiness tropical area such as Ecuador. A surface of 89,225 ha of the main staple crops in this country, which are rice and maize crops, was monitored to assess the evolution of the number of crop cycles. The 20-year period of NDVI time series was used to calculate the periodograms across four subperiods (2001-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, 2016-2020). The maximum ordinate value of each periodogram was used as an indicator of the number of growing crop cycles per year identifying single-, double-, and triple-cropping systems in each subperiod. Cropland intensification was assessed by comparing the cropping system between the subperiods. Results reveal that more than half of the studied croplands experienced changes in the cropping systems, and 40% showed positive trends in terms of the number of growing crop cycles, being principally located near the main rivers where irrigation facilitates crop development during the dry season. Therefore, the area under single cropping decreased from over 60,000 ha in the first subperiod to less than 50,000 ha in the last two subperiods. The cropland surface subjected to multi-cropping practices increased during the second decade of the study period, with a double-cropping system being more widely used than growing three crops per year, reaching surfaces of 24,400 ha and 10,450 ha in the last subperiod, respectively. The robust results obtained in this research show the great potential of the periodogram approach for the discrimination of cropping systems and for mapping intensification areas in tropical regions where dealing with noisy remote sensing time series as a consequence of high cloudiness is a great challenge.

TI  - Cerebral Embolic Protection Devices During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
T2  - Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Stroke is a feared complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which embolic protection devices (EPDs) may mitigate. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of EPDs in TAVR.Methods: All RCTs comparing EPDs with control during TAVR were systematically identified. Prespecified primary end points were all stroke, disabling stroke, nondisabling stroke, and all-cause mortality. Safety and neuroimaging parameters were assessed. Sensitivity analyses were stratified by EPD type. Study registration was a priori (CRD42022377939).Results: Eight trials randomizing 4043 patients were included. There was no significant difference between EPDs and control for all stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65-1.18; P = .39; I2 = 0%), disabling stroke (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.31-1.46; P = .32; I2 = 8.6%), nondisabling stroke (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71-1.40; P = .97; I2 = 0%), or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.43-1.78; P = .71; I2 = 2.3%). There were no differences in safety end points of bleeding, vascular complications, or acute kidney injury. EPDs did not result in differences in total lesion volume or the number of new lesions. The Sentinel EPD significantly reduced the risk of disabling stroke (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.88; P = .022; I2 = 0%) but did not affect all stroke, nondisabling stroke, or all-cause mortality.Conclusions: The totality of randomized data for EPDs during TAVR demonstrated no safety concerns or significant differences in clinical or neuroimaging end points. Analyses restricted to the Sentinel EPD demonstrated large, clinically meaningful reductions in disabling stroke. Ongoing RCTs may help validate these results.

TI  - New Functionalities and Regional/National Use Cases of the Anomaly Hotspots of Agricultural Production (ASAP) Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Anomaly hotSpots of Agricultural Production (ASAP) Decision Support System was launched operationally in 2017 for providing timely early warning information on agricultural production based on Earth Observation and agro-climatic data in an open and easy to use online platform. Over the last three years, the system has seen several methodological improvements related to the input indicators and to system functionalities. These include: an improved dataset of rainfall estimates for Africa; a new satellite indicator of biomass optimised for near-real-time monitoring; an indicator of crop and rangeland water stress derived from a water balance accounting scheme; the inclusion of seasonal precipitation forecasts; national and sub-national crop calendars adapted to ASAP phenology; and a new interface for the visualisation and analysis of high spatial resolution Sentinel and Landsat data. In parallel to these technical improvements, stakeholders and users uptake was consolidated through the set up of regionally adapted versions of the ASAP system for Eastern Africa in partnership with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC), for North Africa with the Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel (OSS), and through the collaboration with the Angolan National Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics (INAMET), that used the ASAP system to inform about agricultural drought. Finally, ASAP indicators have been used as inputs for quantitative crop yield forecasting with machine learning at the province level for Algeria's 2021 and 2022 winter crop seasons that were affected by drought.

TI  - Estimation of Soybean Yield by Combining Maturity Group Information and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Multi-Sensor Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid estimation of the crop yield is essential to precision agriculture. Critical to crop improvement, yield is a primary index for selecting excellent genotypes in crop breeding. Recently developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and advanced algorithms can provide powerful tools for plant breeders. Genotype category information such as the maturity group information (M) can significantly influence soybean yield estimation using remote sensing data. The objective of this study was to improve soybean yield prediction by combining M with UAV-based multi-sensor data using machine learning methods. We investigated three types of maturity groups (Early, Median and Late) of soybean, and collected the UAV-based hyperspectral and red-green-blue (RGB) images at three key growth stages. Vegetation indices (VI) and texture features (Te) were extracted and combined with M to predict yield using partial least square regression (PLSR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest regression (RFR) and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The results showed that (1) the method of combining M with remote sensing data could significantly improve the estimation performances of soybean yield. (2) The combinations of three variables (VI, Te and M) gave the best estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, the flowering stage was the optimal single time point for yield estimation (R2 = 0.689, RMSE = 408.099 kg/hm2), while using multiple growth stages produced the best estimation performance (R2 = 0.700, RMSE = 400.946 kg/hm2). (3) By comparing the models constructed by different algorithms for different growth stages, it showed that the models built by GPR showed the best performances. Overall, the results of this study provide insights into soybean yield estimation based on UAV remote sensing data and maturity information.

TI  - Enhancing Flood Simulation in Data-Limited Glacial River Basins through Hybrid Modeling and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the scarcity of observational data and the intricate precipitation-runoff relationship, individually applying physically based hydrological models and machine learning (ML) techniques presents challenges in accurately predicting floods within data-scarce glacial river basins. To address this challenge, this study introduces an innovative hybrid model that synergistically harnesses the strengths of multi-source remote sensing data, a physically based hydrological model (i.e., Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY)), and ML techniques. This novel approach employs MODIS snow cover data and remote sensing-derived glacier mass balance data to calibrate the SPHY model. The SPHY model primarily generates baseflow, rain runoff, snowmelt runoff, and glacier melt runoff. These outputs are then utilized as extra inputs for the ML models, which consist of Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GDBT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Transformer (TF). These ML models reconstruct the intricate relationship between inputs and streamflow. The performance of these six hybrid models and SPHY model is comprehensively explored in the Manas River basin in Central Asia. The findings underscore that the SPHY-RF model performs better in simulating and predicting daily streamflow and flood events than the SPHY model and the other five hybrid models. Compared to the SPHY model, SPHY-RF significantly reduces RMSE (55.6%) and PBIAS (62.5%) for streamflow, as well as reduces RMSE (65.8%) and PBIAS (73.51%) for floods. By utilizing bootstrap sampling, the 95% uncertainty interval for SPHY-RF is established, effectively covering 87.65% of flood events. Significantly, the SPHY-RF model substantially improves the simulation of streamflow and flood events that the SPHY model struggles to capture, indicating its potential to enhance the accuracy of flood prediction within data-scarce glacial river basins. This study offers a framework for robust flood simulation and forecasting within glacial river basins, offering opportunities to explore extreme hydrological events in a warming climate.

TI  - Towards the Early Detection of <i>Gymnodinium catenatum</i> Algal Blooms in the Northern Gulf of California
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum in the northern Gulf of California (NGC) during winter and spring has negative ecological, economic, and social impacts on the local coastal population. G. catenatum produces paralytic shellfish toxins, and a robust monitoring program of the species is necessary to sustain mitigation actions against their detrimental effects. Here, we applied the maximum-likelihood classification (MLC) method to classify satellite images from MODIS and Sentinel-3 to evaluate their effectiveness to detect G. catenatum. Different classes associated with the presence of the species were developed from data of two HABs that occurred in 2015 and 2017. Two classes derived from Sentinel-3 data from the 2017 HAB allowed the detection of this species. These Sentinel-3 classes adequately represented the temporal and geographical distribution of G. catenatum in the region and the no-bloom condition during the summer. The concordance between the detection of the Sentinel-3 classes on the west coast of the NGC and the recorded presence of G. catenatum (75% of concordance) in the area indicates that the MLC method could be applied for early detection of the species in the NGC, using Sentinel-3 full resolution images.

TI  - Estimation of Water Quality Parameters through a Combination of Deep Learning and Remote Sensing Techniques in a Lake in Southern Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we combined machine learning and remote sensing techniques to estimate the value of chlorophyll-a concentration in a freshwater ecosystem in the South American continent (lake in Southern Chile). In a previous study, nine artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms were tested to predict water quality data from measurements during monitoring campaigns. In this study, in addition to field data (Case A), meteorological variables (Case B) and satellite data (Case C) were used to predict chlorophyll-a in Lake Llanquihue. The models used were SARIMAX, LSTM, and RNN, all of which showed generally good statistics for the prediction of the chlorophyll-a variable. Model validation metrics showed that all three models effectively predicted chlorophyll as an indicator of the presence of algae in water bodies. Coefficient of determination values ranging from 0.64 to 0.93 were obtained, with the LSTM model showing the best statistics in any of the cases tested. The LSTM model generally performed well across most stations, with lower values for MSE (< 0.260 (mu g/L)2), RMSE (< 0.510 ug/L), MaxError (< 0.730 mu g/L), and MAE (< 0.442 mu g/L). This model, which combines machine learning and remote sensing techniques, is applicable to other Chilean and world lakes that have similar characteristics. In addition, it is a starting point for decision-makers in the protection and conservation of water resource quality.

AB  - Observed by satellites for more than a decade, surface soil moisture (SSM) is an essential component of the Earth system. Today, with the Sentinel missions, SSM can be derived at a sub-kilometer spatial resolution. In this work, aggregated 1 km x 1 km SSM observations combining Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data are assimilated for the first time into the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model using the global Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS-Monde) tool of Meteo-France. The ISBA simulations are driven by atmospheric variables from the Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME) numerical weather prediction model for the period 2017-2019 for two regions in Southern France, Toulouse and Montpellier, and for the Salamanca region in Spain. The S1 SSM shows a good agreement with in situ SSM observations. The S1 SSM is assimilated either alone or together with leaf area index (LAI) observations from the PROBA-V satellite. The assimilation of S1 SSM alone has a small impact on the simulated root zone soil moisture. On the other hand, a marked impact of the assimilation is observed over agricultural areas when LAI is assimilated, and the impact is larger when S1 SSM and LAI are assimilated together.

TI  - Updating of the Archival Large-Scale Soil Map Based on the Multitemporal Spectral Characteristics of the Bare Soil Surface Landsat Scenes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For most of the arable land in Russia (132-137 million ha), the dominant and accurate soil information is stored in the form of map archives on paper without coordinate reference. The last traditional soil map(s) (TSM, TSMs) were created over 30 years ago. Traditional and/or archival soil map(s) (ASM, ASMs) are outdated in terms of storage formats, dates, and methods of production. The technology of constructing a multitemporal soil line (MSL) makes it possible to update ASMs and TSMs based on the processing of big remote-sensing data (RSD). To construct an MSL, the spectral characteristics of the bare soil surface (BSS) are used. The BSS on RSD is distinguished within the framework of the conceptual apparatus of the spectral neighborhood of the soil line. The filtering of big RSD is based on deep machine learning. In the course of the work, a vector georeferenced version of the ASM and an updated soil map were created based on the coefficient "C" of the MSL. The maps were verified based on field surveys (76 soil pits). The updated map is called the map of soil interpretation of the coefficient "C" (SIC "C"). The SIC "C" map has a more detailed legend compared to the ASM (7 sections/chapters instead of 5), greater accuracy (smaller errors of the first and second kind), and potential suitability for calculating soil organic matter/carbon (SOM/SOC) reserves (soil types/areals in the SIC "C" map are statistically significant are divided according to the thickness of the organomineral horizon and the content of SOM in the plowed layer). When updating, a systematic underestimation of the numbers of contours and areas of soils with manifestations of negative/degradation soil processes (slitization and erosion) on the TSM was established. In the process of updating, all three shortcomings of the ASMs/TSMs (archaic storage, dates, and methods of creation) were eliminated. The SIC "C" map is digital (thematic raster), modern, and created based on big data processing methods. For the first time, the actualization of the soil map was carried out based on the MSL characteristics (coefficient "C").

TI  - Impact of a Hyperspectral Satellite Cross-Calibration Radiometer's Spatial and Noise Characteristics on Cross-Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite cross-calibration radiometer (SCR) is a conceptual on-orbit hyperspectral imaging radiometer that transfers the radiometric calibration from a "gold-standard" reference instrument such as the Landsat 8/9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) to other civil, international, or commercial "client" multispectral satellite systems via near-simultaneous cross-calibration acquisitions. The spectral resolution, spectral range, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) all significantly impact the complexity and cost of hyperspectral SCRs, so it is important to understand their effect on cross-calibration quality. This paper discusses the results of a trade study to quantify the effects of varying ground sample distance (GSD), number of independent samples, and instrument/scene noise on cross-calibration gain uncertainties. The trade study used a simulated SCR cross-calibration with near-simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) of the Landsat 8 OLI acting as the reference instrument and the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) acting as a surrogate SCR hyperspectral instrument. Results demonstrate that cross-calibration uncertainty is only minimally affected by spatial resolution and SNR, which may allow SCR instruments to be developed at a lower cost.

TI  - Assessing the shoreline dynamics of Moheskhali Island in Bangladesh by integrating GIS techniques and sea-level data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Moheskhali is the maiden coastal hilly island of Bangladesh, has increased with a rate of 280.74 m/yr and the area of this Island increased with a rate of 105.6 ha/yr in three decades (27 years). A positive correlation revealed by analyzing the shoreline changes, erosion and accretion of Moheskhali Island in last 27 years. The result showed that shoreline has increased about 272.75 mm with an annual rate of 11.85 mm/yr despite the mean rise of sea-level in this stipulated period. In this study, shoreline change rate was calculated by Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), and erosion and accretion were calculated by an overlay operation in ArcGIS. A linear regression model was drawn along with sea-level, shoreline, and erosion and accretion data to understand the impact of sea-level. Active storm surge, the abundance of sediment and water discharge, coastal afforestation, etc. played a significant role to increase area of this Island. Based on the positive relationship between rising sea-level and shoreline change, this study finally suggests that satellite imagery, sea-level data and statistical techniques are more reliable to understand the changing nature of shorelines along with sea-level rise.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Integrative assessment of urban dust polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using ground and satellite data in Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, for quick urbanization and industrialization, pollutants, especially urban dust, have posed many threats to the human environment. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are regarded as the main dangerous pollutants that are widespread, persistent, and carcinogenic. The present work aimed to investigate the contamination and sources of PAHs, as well as to assess the risk of cancer for 16 priority PAHs, in urban dust samples in Ahvaz, Isfahan, and Shiraz cities in Iran. We measured PAH concentrations by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The average concentrations of the 16 PAHs in Ahvaz, Isfahan, and Shiraz were 6215.11, 7611.03, and 7810.37 & mu;g kg(-1), respectively. The domination of low-molecular-weight (LMW) PAHs was observed in Ahvaz, while maximum contribution was observed for high-molecular-weight (HMW) PAHs in Esfahan and Shiraz. For PAHs' source identification, diagnostic ratio, correlation analysis, clustering, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) model were used. PAHs had a combustion (coal and wood, oil, fossil fuels) and gasoline/diesel engine emissions in all cities. Comparative studies suggest that the PAH compounds' level is higher in the research area than in other countries, except for China and India. Also, the pollution of urban dust PAHs has increased over time compared to previous studies in the same cities. The cancer risk from exposure to dust contaminated with PAHs was assessed using the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) model. According to the findings, a high risk of exposure to cancer was observed in Ahvaz, Isfahan, and Shiraz. However, compared to adults, children are at higher risk of cancer in their daily lives via dermal contact and unconscious ingestion. Based on the ILCR values, the risk of cancer is in the order of Shiraz > Isfahan > Ahvaz. To assess air pollutants and their effects on urban dust, TROPOMI onboard the Sentinel-5P data were used in the studied cities during 2018-2021. The results show that Ahvaz has different high levels of CO compared to the other 2 cities. Also, Isfahan has different high levels of NO2 compared to the other 2 cities, but Shiraz has different low levels of O-3. According to satellite time series data, the trend of the Aerosol Absorbing Index (AAI) has been increasing, while there was a decreasing trend in AAI from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until 12 months later. Therefore, the natural and anthropogenic sources of urban dust PAHs have been increasing in all studied cities. Our findings show that PAH compounds in urban dust pose a significant threat to human health. Therefore, strategic management and planning are vital in reducing urban dust pollution.

TI  - Assessing and Enhancing Predictive Efficacy of Machine Learning Models in Urban Land Dynamics: A Comparative Study Using Multi-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and accurate land-use/land cover maps are vital for monitoring and mitigating urbanization impacts. This necessitates evaluating machine learning simulations and incorporating valuable insights. We used four primary models, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine, random decision forests, and artificial neural network (ANN), to simulate land cover maps for Tsukuba City, Japan. We incorporated an auxiliary input that used multinomial logistic regression to enhance the ANN and obtained a fifth model (ANN was run twice, with and without the new input). Additionally, we developed a sixth simulation by integrating the predictions of ANN and LR using a fuzzy overlay, wherein ANN had an additional new input alongside driving forces. This study employed six models, using classified maps with three different resolutions: the first involved 15 m (ASTER) covering a study area of 114.8 km2, for the second and third, 5 and 0.5 m (derived from WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1) covering a study area of 14.8 km2, and the models were then evaluated. Due to a synergistic effect, the sixth simulation demonstrated the highest kappa in all data, 86.39%, 72.65%, and 70.65%, respectively. The results indicate that stand-alone machine learning-based simulations achieved satisfactory accuracy, and minimalistic approaches can be employed to improve their performance.

TI  - Evaluation of multifrequency SAR data for estimating tropical above-ground biomass by employing radiative transfer modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of the biophysical parameters and subsequent estimation of the above-ground biomass (AGB) of vegetation stands are made possible by the simulation of the extinction and scattering components from the canopy layer using vector radiative transfer (VRT) theory-based scattering models. With the use of such a model, this study aims to evaluate and compare the potential of dual-pol, multi-frequency SAR data for estimating above-ground biomass. The data selected for this work are L-band dual polarized (HH/HV) ALOS-2 data, S-band dual polarized (HH/HV) NovaSAR data, and C-band dual polarized (VV/VH) Sentinel-1 data. The two key biophysical parameters, tree height, and trunk radius are retrieved using the proposed methodology, applying the frequencies independently. A general allometric equation with vegetation-specific coefficients is used to estimate the AGB from the retrieved biophysical parameters. The retrieval results are validated using ground truth measurements collected from the study area. The L-band, with the coefficient of determination ( R-2) of 0.73 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.90 t/ha, has the best correlation between the modeled and field AGBs, followed by the S-band with an R-2 of 0.37 and an RMSE of 63.37 t/ ha, and the C-band with an R-2 of 0.25 and an RMSE of 72.32 t/ha. The L-band has yielded improved estimates of AGB in regression analysis as well, with an R2 of 0.48 and an RMSE of 50.02 t/ha, compared to the S- and C-bands, which have the R-2 of 0.12 and 0.03 and the RMSE of 70.98 t/ha and 80.84 t/ha, respectively.

TI  - Detection of Winter Heat Wave Impact on Surface Runoff in a Periglacial Environment (Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of extreme warm events in the Arctic has been increasing in recent years in terms of their frequency and intensity. The assessment of the impact of these episodes on the snow season requires further observation capabilities, where spatial and temporal resolutions are key constraints. This study targeted the snow season of 2022 when a winter rain-on-snow event occurred at Ny-angstrom lesund in mid-March. The selected methodology was based on a multi-scale and multi-platform approach, combining ground-based observations with satellite remote sensing. The ground-based observation portfolio included meteorological measurements, nivological information, and the optical description of the surface in terms of spectral reflectance and snow-cover extent. The satellite data were obtained by the Sentinel-2 platforms, which provided ten multi-spectral acquisitions from March to July. The proposed strategy supported the impact assessment of heat waves in a periglacial environment, describing the relation and the timing between rain-on-snow events and the surface water drainage system. The integration between a wide range of spectral, time, and spatial resolutions enhanced the capacity to monitor the evolution of the surface water drainage system, detecting two water discharge pulsations, different in terms of duration and effects. This preliminary study aims to improve the description of the snow dynamics during those extreme events and to assess the impact of the produced break during the snow accumulation period.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to analyze the adverse events associated with botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injections in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The literature search was completed using the Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases from the earliest date possible up to December 2021. Search terms included 'botulinum toxin', 'cerebral palsy', 'spasticity', 'adverse effects', 'side effects', 'undesirable effects', 'complications', 'lower limb', 'upper limb', and 'children' including combinations of index and free-text terms. Fifty-five studies were included in the study. Data on 6333 pediatric patients and more than 14 080 BoNT-A injections were collected. Respiratory symptoms and respiratory tract infections were the most frequently registered adverse events (AEs). Other common AEs included procedural/focal AEs, flu-like symptoms, and asthenia. Sentinel events including four cases of death were reported. AEs were more frequent and severe in high-dose patients; however, the capacity of BoNT-A to spread systemically remains unclear. Since severe adverse events are not common, further research is needed to collect more definitive clinical and homogeneous data to support the findings of the present research and clarify the safety profile of BoNT-A, especially regarding the incidence of respiratory issues and complications in GMFCS IV or V patients.

TI  - Using Deep Learning to Detect the Need for Forest Thinning: Application to the Lungau Region, Austria
T2  - ALGORITHMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information about the need to thin forests is vital in forest management to maintain a healthy forest while maximizing income. Currently, very-high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data can provide crucial assistance to experts when evaluating the maturity of thinnings. Nevertheless, this task is still predominantly carried out in the field and demands extensive resources. This paper presents a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect the necessity and urgency of carrying out thinnings using only remote sensing data. The approach uses very-high-spatial-resolution RGB and near-infrared orthophotos; a canopy height model (CHM); a digital terrain model (DTM); the slope; and reference data, which, in this case, originate from spruce-dominated forests in the Austrian Alps. After tuning, the model achieves an F1 score of 82.23% on our test data, which indicates that the model is usable in a practical setting. We conclude that DCNNs are capable of detecting the need to carry out thinnings in forests. In contrast, attempts to assess the urgency of the need for thinnings with DCNNs proved to be unsuccessful. However, additional data, such as age or yield class, have the potential to improve the results. Our investigation into the influence of each individual input feature shows that orthophotos appear to contain the most relevant information for detecting the need for thinning. Moreover, we observe a gain in performance when adding the CHM and slope, whereas adding the DTM harms the model's performance.

TI  - Tackling a global epidemic threat: Nipah surveillance in Bangladesh, 2006-2021
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human Nipah virus (NiV) infection is an epidemic-prone disease and since the first recognized outbreak in Bangladesh in 2001, human infections have been detected almost every year. Due to its high case fatality rate and public health importance, a hospital-based Nipah sentinel surveillance was established in Bangladesh to promptly detect Nipah cases and respond to outbreaks at the earliest. The surveillance has been ongoing till present. The hospital-based sentinel surveillance was conducted at ten strategically chosen tertiary care hospitals distributed throughout Bangladesh. The surveillance staff ensured that routine screening, enrollment, data, and specimen collection from suspected Nipah cases were conducted daily. The specimens were then processed and transported to the reference laboratory of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and icddr,b for confirmation of diagnosis through serology and molecular detection. From 2006 to 2021, through this hospital-based surveillance platform, 7,150 individuals were enrolled and tested for Nipah virus. Since 2001, 322 Nipah infections were identified in Bangladesh, 75% of whom were laboratory confirmed cases. Half of the reported cases were primary cases (162/322) having an established history of consuming raw date palm sap (DPS) or tari (fermented date palm sap) and 29% were infected through person-to-person transmission. Since the initiation of surveillance, 68% (218/322) of Nipah cases from Bangladesh have been identified from various parts of the country. Fever, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and increased salivation were the most common symptoms among enrolled Nipah patients. Till 2021, the overall case fatality rate of NiV infection in Bangladesh was 71%. This article emphasizes that the overall epidemiology of Nipah virus infection in Bangladesh has remained consistent throughout the years. This is the only systematic surveillance to detect human NiV infection globally. The findings from this surveillance have contributed to early detection of NiV cases in hospital settings, understanding of Nipah disease epidemiology, and have enabled timely public health interventions for prevention and containment of NiV infection. Although we still have much to learn regarding the transmission dynamics and risk factors of human NiV infection, surveillance has played a significant role in advancing our knowledge in this regard.NiV is one of the most fatal emerging bat-borne zoonotic viruses, posing a threat to global health security. Since the first recognized outbreak in Bangladesh in 2001, human infections have been detected almost every year. In 2006, a hospital-based Nipah sentinel surveillance was established in Bangladesh for the early detection of cases and rapid response to outbreaks. Currently, this surveillance is running at ten strategically chosen public hospitals throughout Bangladesh. Till December 2021, a total of 322 Nipah cases have been reported in Bangladesh, 71% of whom has died during the course of infection. Throughout the years, fever, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and increased salivation have remained the most commonly observed symptoms. Half of the reported cases were primary cases (162/322) having an established history of consuming raw date palm sap (DPS) or tari, and 29% were infected through person-to-person transmission. Since the inception of surveillance, there has been a decrease in large outbreaks and a concurrent increase in sporadic Nipah case detection throughout the country. The overall epidemiology of Nipah virus infection in Bangladesh has remained consistent throughout the years. National Nipah surveillance of Bangladesh is the only global, systematic surveillance to detect human NiV infection. The findings from this surveillance have contributed to the early detection of Nipah cases, understanding of disease epidemiology, and implementation of timely public health interventions for the prevention and containment of human NiV infection.

TI  - An Integrated Approach between Multispectral Satellite Images and Geophysical and Morpho-Topographic Surveys for the Detection of Water Stress Associated with Coastal Dune Erosion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion occurs due to different processes involving physical and ecological systems. One of these factors is the degree of water stress experienced by dune vegetation. While healthy dune vegetation can help to stabilize the dune systems, water-stressed vegetation can instead enhance dune erosion. In this study, remote sensing techniques were used to monitor the water stress affecting the dune vegetation in dune systems along the alluvial plain of the Chiatona coast (Apulia, Southern Italy) located on the Ionian Arc. Multispectral satellite data from Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel-2 were used to assess the water stress at different spatial scales over a 4-year monitoring period from 2019 to 2023. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were used to identify dune surfaces that were experiencing water stress. Furthermore, a terrestrial laser scanner and LiDAR data were acquired at different temporal ranges in areas affected by water stress to highlight coastal changes in areas associated with unhealthy dune vegetation. A large drop in NDVI values was observed in May 2020 due to the occurrence of coastal fires in some parts of the Chiatona coast. Geoelectrical surveys were conducted to investigate if coastal fires were capable of saline groundwater contamination, potentially enhancing dune erosion in these areas. The joint analysis of remote sensing, topographical, and geoelectric data showed that water stress reduced the amount of healthy dune vegetation, triggering dune deflation processes that resulted in increased coastal erosion rates, while also leading to the saline contamination of groundwater.

AB  - Individual tree detection using airborne laser scanning (ALS) can provide relevant data to complement forest inventory data. Local Maxima-based (LM) methods for individual tree detection are suitable for applications over large extents, but their performance depends on the type of pre-processing of the input data, as well as forest structure and composition. We developed a model that improves LM through statistical modeling using prior knowledge about forest structure. The model selects the optimal canopy height model (CHM) pre-processing filters based on forest structure variables like the dominant canopy height and degree of cover derived from ALS data, the dominant leaf type derived from Sentinel data, and terrain metrics. The model performance was evaluated by assessing tree detection errors for the canopy stem count in National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots in Switzerland (n=5254). For plots with point densities of more than 15 points per square meter and, at most, 6 years between ALS acquisition and inventory (n=2676), the results showed a mean absolute error of 61 stems per ha compared to 174 stems per ha when detecting trees using an unprocessed CHM. The model showed a stable performance for different dominant leaf types (broadleaved-dominated, mixed, coniferous-dominated) and for different degrees of cover. We consider the developed model to be suitable for applications that require data on forest structure or individual tree positions and heights over large areas.

TI  - INternational Soft Tissue saRcoma ConsorTium (INSTRuCT) consensus statement: Imaging recommendations for the management of rhabdomyosarcoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue neoplasm in the pediatric population. The survival of children with rhabdomyosarcoma has only marginally improved over the past 25 years and remains poor for those with metastatic disease. A significant challenge to advances in treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma is the relative rarity of this disease, necessitating years to complete clinical trials. Progress can be accelerated by in-ternational cooperation and sharing national experiences. This necessitates agreement on a common language to describe patient cohorts and consensus standards to guide diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment. These goals formed the premise for creating the INternational Soft Tissue saRcoma ConsorTium (INSTRuCT) in 2017. Multidisciplinary members of this consortium have since developed international consensus statements on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas. Herein, members of the INSTRuCT Diagnostic Imaging Working Group present international consensus recommendations for imaging of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma at diagnosis, at staging, and during and after completion of therapy. The intent is to promote a standardized imaging approach to pediatric patients with this malignancy to create more-reliable comparisons of results of clinical trials internationally, thereby accelerating progress in managing rhabdomyo-sarcoma and improving survival.

TI  - Classifying a Highly Polymorphic Tree Species across Landscapes Using Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation classifications on large geographic scales are necessary to inform conservation decisions and monitor keystone, invasive, and endangered species. These classifications are often effectively achieved by applying models to imaging spectroscopy, a type of remote sensing data, but such undertakings are often limited in spatial extent. Here we provide accurate, high-resolution spatial data on the keystone species Metrosideros polymorpha, a highly polymorphic tree species distributed across bioclimatic zones and environmental gradients on Hawai'i Island using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR. We compare two tree species classification techniques, the support vector machine (SVM) and spectral mixture analysis (SMA), to assess their ability to map M. polymorpha over 28,000 square kilometers where differences in topography, background vegetation, sun angle relative to the aircraft, and day of data collection, among others, challenge accurate classification. To capture spatial variability in model performance, we applied Gaussian process classification (GPC) to estimate the spatial probability density of M. polymorpha occurrence using only training sample locations. We found that while SVM and SMA models exhibit similar raw score accuracy over the test set (96.0% and 93.4%, respectively), SVM better reproduces the spatial distribution of M. polymorpha than SMA. We developed a final 2 m x 2 m M. polymorpha presence dataset and a 30 m x 30 m M. polymorpha density dataset using SVM classifications that have been made publicly available for use in conservation applications. Accurate, large-scale species classifications are achievable, but metrics for model performance assessments must account for spatial variation of model accuracy.

TI  - Release of liposomally formulated near-infrared fluorescent probes included in giant cluster vesicles by ultrasound irradiation
T2  - ULTRASONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of tumors and regional lymph nodes during surgery has been proposed in the diagnosis of lymphatic metastasis and the surgical treatment of malignant diseases. Giant cluster vesicles (GCVs), including liposomally formulated indocyanine green (LP-ICG) derivatives, are a possible candidate for agents to realize the two contradictory properties, i.e., retention in tissue for lesion-marking and trace for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identification. We attempted to release the LP-ICG derivatives from GCVs using ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) under ultrasound irradiation. An absorption spectrophotometer quantitatively evaluated the amounts of released LP-ICG derivatives. As a result, we demonstrated that it depended on conditions for sound pressure, burst length, and number density of UCAs, and had a sound pressure threshold independent of burst length and number density of UCAs. The results will aid to determine appropriate conditions to maximize the released amount of LP-ICG derivatives while keeping safety.

TI  - Mapping Post-Earthquake Landslide Susceptibility Using U-Net, VGG-16, VGG-19, and Metaheuristic Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are among the most frequent secondary disasters caused by earthquakes in areas prone to seismic activity. Given the necessity of assessing the current seismic conditions for ensuring the safety of life and infrastructure, there is a rising demand worldwide to recognize the extent of landslides and map their susceptibility. This study involved two stages: First, the regions prone to earthquake-induced landslides were detected, and the data were used to train deep learning (DL) models and generate landslide susceptibility maps. The application of DL models was expected to improve the outcomes in both stages. Landslide inventory was extracted from Sentinel-2 data by using U-Net, VGG-16, and VGG-19 algorithms. Because VGG-16 produced the most accurate inventory locations, the corresponding results were used in the landslide susceptibility detection stage. In the second stage, landslide susceptibility maps were generated. From the total measured landslide locations (63,360 cells), 70% of the locations were used for training the DL models (i.e., convolutional neural network [CNN], CNN-imperialist competitive algorithm, and CNN-gray wolf optimizer [GWO]), and the remaining 30% were used for validation. The earthquake-induced landslide conditioning factors included the elevation, slope, plan curvature, valley depth, topographic wetness index, land cover, rainfall, distance to rivers, and distance to roads. The reliability of the generated susceptibility maps was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The CNN-GWO model (AUROC = 0.84 and RMSE = 0.284) outperformed the other methods and can thus be used in similar applications. The results demonstrated the efficiency of applying DL in the natural hazard domain. The CNN-GWO predicted that approximately 38% of the total area consisted of high and very high susceptibility regions, mainly concentrated in areas with steep slopes and high levels of rainfall and soil wetness. These outcomes contribute to an enhanced understanding of DL application in the natural hazard domain. Moreover, using the knowledge of areas highly susceptible to landslides, officials can actively adopt steps to reduce the potential impact of landslides and ensure the sustainable management of natural resources.

TI  - Heterogeneity Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Vegetation Cover in Two-Tider Administrative Regions of China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover is a crucial component of regional ecological environments that plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem balance. This investigation utilized Google Earth Engine and MODIS NDVI products to examine the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of regional vegetation coverage based on the multi-year average NDVI in China. Using the multi-year average NDVI, multi-year change trend slope, coefficient of variation, and Hurst exponent, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of provincial and prefectural administrative regions were quantified. The results indicated an upward trend in vegetation coverage from 2000 to 2021 at both provincial and prefectural levels, with growth rates of 0.032/10a and 0.03/10a, respectively. Moreover, the multi-year average NDVI significantly correlated with regional precipitation. Notably, vegetation growth was fastest in the Loess Plateau, while degradation was observed in southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang. Additionally, the degree of vegetation cover change in Ningxia and Macau was particularly prominent. These findings support the effectiveness of the Loess Plateau greening project and highlight the potential cost of economic and population growth on the ecosystem in eastern and southeastern coastal areas, where local vegetation degradation occurs. This study can serve as a valuable reference for ecosystem restoration and developmental planning at the administrative regional level, with the goal of enhancing vegetation management and conservation efforts in China.

TI  - The Spatial Pattern Evolution of Rural Settlements and Multi-Scenario Simulations since the Initiation of the Reform and Opening up Policy in China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the inception of China's reform and opening-up policy, the rapidly advancing process of urbanization and the primacy accorded to urban development policies have imparted increasingly profound ramifications on rural domains. Nonetheless, antecedent research has predominantly fixated on urban sprawl, overlooking the spatial metamorphosis of rural settlements and the prospective developmental trajectories within the policy paradigm. Consequently, this inquiry endeavors to scrutinize the evolution of the spatial configuration of rural settlements in She County from the advent of reform and opening-up (1980-2020) utilizing remote sensing data. In tandem, through scenario delineation and the utilization of the CLUE-S model, it aspires to prognosticate the evolving trends in the spatial arrangements of rural settlements in She County by 2035. The empirical findings divulge that (1) The temporal progression of rural settlement spatial configurations in She County over the preceding four decades can be delineated into two discernible phases. From 1980 to 2000, alterations in the number, extent, and spatial morphological attributes of rural settlements remained circumscribed. While the count of rural settlements registered a diminution (by 3), the aggregate extent experienced a marginal augmentation (by 8.45%), concomitant with a gradual gravitation towards regular boundaries, manifesting a stochastic distribution throughout the investigation expanse. Conversely, from 2000 to 2020, the quantity and extent of rural settlements in She County underwent a precipitous augmentation (92 and 36.37%, respectively), characterized by irregular peripheries. (2) The CLUE-S model achieved an overall precision of 0.929, underscoring its applicability in emulating fluctuations in rural settlements. (3) Within the new-type urbanization scenario, the cumulative expanse of rural settlements witnessed a decline of 35.36% compared to the natural development scenario, marked by substantial conversions into grassland and urban land usage. Furthermore, orchestrated planning and directive measures have propelled the consolidation of rural settlements in She County, engendering a more equitable and standardized layout. Under the aegis of the ecological conservation scenario, the total rural settlement area recorded a 0.38% reduction vis-a-vis the natural development scenario, primarily entailing competitive coexistence with arable land, grassland, and urban land usage in spatial terms.

TI  - First estimation of high-resolution solar photovoltaic resource maps over China with Fengyun-4A satellite and machine learning
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), which is the latest-generation Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite, measures solar reflection and thermal emission with high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions. It is expected to be highly beneficial for solar resource assessment and forecasting in China. This study is the first to estimate, using FY-4A and a random forest model, the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a 4-km-15-min spatio-temporal resolution over China, as a means to arrive at a solar photovoltaic (PV) resource map. In terms of GHI esti-mates, the root mean square error and mean bias error between hourly measured and retrieved values are 147.02 (35.2%),-5.64 W/m2 (-1.4%), respectively, whereas the values of daily estimates are 29.20 (18.0%),-2.97 W/ m2 (-1.3%). The retrieval accuracy is found much better for instances with solar zenith angles smaller than 60 degrees. Relatively larger errors are found at locations in the Sichuan Basin and northeastern China, which can be attributed to bright surfaces and/or strong cloud transients. With the retrieved irradiance, PV resource is derived through a physical model chain. The annual mean PV resource map suggests that, over most of the west areas, the annual mean effective irradiance exceeds 1700 kWh/m2, with the highest value found in Tibet (around 2000 kWh/m2 per annum). Eastern China has an annual effective irradiance of only 1300-1500 kWh/m2. The region with poorest solar resource is the Sichuan Basin (less than 1100 kWh/m2 per annum).

TI  - Ecological Environment Quality Assessment of Arid Areas Based on Improved Remote Sensing Ecological Index-A Case Study of the Loess Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems in arid and semi-arid areas are delicate and prone to different erosive effects. Monitoring and evaluating the environmental ecological condition in such areas contribute to the governance and restoration of the ecosystem. Remote sensing ecological indices (RSEIs) are widely used as a method for environmental monitoring and have been extensively applied in various regions. This study selects the arid and semi-arid Loess Plateau as the research area, in response to existing research on ecological monitoring that predominantly uses vegetation indices as monitoring indicators for greenness factors. A fluorescence remote sensing ecological index (SRSEI) is constructed by using monthly synthesized sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data during the vegetation growth period as a new component for greenness and combining it with MODIS product data. The study generates the RSEI and SRSEI for the research area spanning from 2001 to 2021. The study compares and analyzes the differences between the two indices and explores the evolution patterns of the ecosystem quality in the Loess Plateau over a 21-year period. The results indicate consistent and positively correlated linear fitting trend changes in the RSEI and SRSEI for the research area between 2001 and 2021. The newly constructed ecological index exhibits a higher correlation with rainfall data, and it shows a more significant decrease in magnitude during drought occurrences, indicating a faster and stronger response of the new index to drought in the research area. The largest proportions are found in the research area's regions with both substantial and minor improvements, pointing to an upward tendency in the Loess Plateau's ecosystem development. The newly constructed environmental index can effectively evaluate the quality of the ecosystem in the research area.

TI  - Subsidence of a Coal Ash Landfill in a Power Plant Observed by Applying PSInSAR to Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed ground subsidence at the coal ash disposal sites of Stanton Energy Center, a power plant located in Orlando, Florida, USA, by applying 157 Sentinel-1 SAR images obtained between May 2017 and December 2022 in ascending orbit to the PSInSAR technique. A LiDAR DEM with 1 m posting was used for the DInSAR and StaMPS processing for PSInSAR. The results showed significant ground subsidence on the area where solar panels were installed on top of the coal ash landfill. The coal ash landfill was divided into three sites (A, B, and C) according to the landfill sequence. The spatially averaged PSInSAR showed subsidence rates of 7.3 mm/year, 6.2 mm/year, and 8.8 mm/year in sites A, B, and C, respectively. In particular, relatively newly deposited sites A and B showed a decreasing trend in subsidence rate with higher quadratic components in regression function, indicating a stabilization of the subsidence. On the other hand, the oldest site C exhibited the highest (and a relatively constant) subsidence rate, suggesting that the settlement occurred earlier and is now at a constant rate. It is also suspected that new dumping activity near C might have caused a higher subsidence rate than in sites A and B. No subsidence occurred at other solar panel installations on the ground outside the landfill, suggesting that the subsidence was caused by the gravitational compaction of the landfill materials rather than by the instability of the solar facilities. Comparison of PSInSAR results with lower resolution DEMs, such as SRTM and Copernicus DEM, showed range errors of the PS positions proportional to the height deviation from LiDAR DEM, highlighting the importance of accurate DEMs for the time-series analysis of SAR data.

AB  - Introduction:Limited research on cultural competence in nursing, midwifery, and education exists within low- and middle-income countries such as South Africa (SA). This study aimed to describe midwives' self-reported levels of cultural competence toward women receiving maternal care.Methodology:A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design and an all-inclusive sample of (N = 104; n = 82) midwives yielded a 79% response rate. Data were collected using the Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool (TSET) questionnaire. Participants included midwives recruited from maternity units of five hospitals in South Africa: different hospitals that included one large district, two regional, and two tertiary hospitals in the North-West Province of SA. An all-inclusive sample of (N = 104; n = 82) midwives participated, representing a 79% response rate.Results:Midwives reported an overall moderate level of competence regarding their knowledge and understanding of cultural factors; it was concerning that their confidence in interviewing patients from different cultural backgrounds on factors such as acculturation and worldview were the lowest.Discussion:To the best of the authors' knowledge, this was the first study to assess the cultural competence of midwives in SA using TSET. The study highlighted the need for midwives' training to improve their cultural competence.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary observations provide measurements of the cloud liquid water path (LWP), permitting con-tinuous observation of cloud evolution throughout the daylit portion of the diurnal cycle. Relative to LWP derived from microwave imagery, these observations have biases related to scattering geometry, which systematically varies throughout the day. Therefore, we have developed a set of bias corrections using microwave LWP for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 and-17 (GOES-16 and GOES-17) observations of LWP derived from retrieved cloud-optical properties. The bias corrections are defined based on scattering geometry (solar zenith, sensor zenith, and relative azimuth) and low cloud fraction. We demonstrate that over the low-cloud regions of the northeast and southeast Pacific, these bias corrections drastically improve the characteristics of the retrieved LWP, including its regional distribution, diurnal varia-tion, and evolution along short-time-scale Lagrangian trajectories.

TI  - Alongshore Winds Force Warm Atlantic Water Toward Helheim Glacier in Southeast Greenland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhanced transport of warm subsurface Atlantic Water (AW) into Greenland fjords has driven glacier mass loss, but the mechanisms transporting AW to the fjords remain poorly characterized. Here, we provide the first direct satellite-based observations of rapid (& SIM;0.2 m/s) AW intrusion toward Sermilik Fjord abutting Helheim Glacier, one of Greenland's largest glaciers. The intrusions arise when coastal upwelling-through interactions with Sermilik's bathymetric trough on the continental shelf-triggers enhanced AW upwelling and inflow that can travel tens of kilometers along the trough within hours. A weakening or reversal of northeasterly alongshore winds stimulates the intrusions and is often associated with the passing of cyclones and subsequent sea surface lowering. Mooring data show that these intrusions produce subsurface ocean warming both at Sermilik Fjord mouth and within the fjord and that the warming signal in the fjord does not diminish during subsequent coastal downwelling events. Satellite imagery captures near-synchronous AW intrusions at multiple troughs rimming southeast Greenland suggesting that these wind-driven processes may play a substantial role in ocean heat transport toward the Greenland Ice Sheet.Greater transport of the warm subtropical Atlantic Waters into Greenland fjords has driven glacier mass loss, but the mechanisms transporting the subtropical waters to glacier fronts remain poorly characterized. Here, we provide the first satellite-based observations of rapid flow of subtropical water toward Sermilik Fjord abutting Helheim Glacier, one of Greenland's largest glaciers. Often associated with the passing of cyclones, strong alongshore wind events stimulate ocean circulation that brings subtropical waters from offshore onto the continental shelf along an underwater trough that leads to Helheim. Our measurements show that when these events produce ocean warming nearshore, they tend to transport more heat toward Helheim Glacier's front where it may increase ice melting. A higher number of such wind events in a season has the potential to impact glacier calving, thinning, and retreat. Satellite imagery shows that these events can occur simultaneously along other bathymetric troughs leading toward other Greenland glaciers in the southeast and potentially elsewhere. Therefore, these ocean events may be important for predicting future Greenland Ice Sheet ice loss.Alongshore wind-driven coastal upwelling drives Atlantic Water intrusions onto the continental shelf along Sermilik TroughThis work represents the first remote-sensing evidence of intrusion events along a bathymetric depressionRapid intrusions often transport warm subsurface water to the inner shelf and fjord in less than 1 day

M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis has been a neglected, widespread and reemerging zoonotic disease of global importance. The One Health holistic approach combining human, animal and environmental health has been important for control and prevention of zoonotic disease. An urban municipality in Southern Brazil with a high prevalence of leptospirosis was selected by convenience, with asymptomatic human and canine individuals serologically tested using MAT against 30 Leptospira spp. serovars. Epidemiological questionnaires were assessed along with the historical national database, with associated risk factors to dog and human seropositivity analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The spatial distribution of retrospective human leptospirosis cases was analyzed using a Kernel map and overlapped dog seropositivity and historical flooding areas, demonstrating that domestic and asymptomatic dogs may be important environmental sentinels for leptospirosis in such urban areas, even in the absence of human seropositivity and low canine seropositivity. Associated risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs and humans according to multiple regression included healthy dogs (p = 0.02, odds ratio-OR = 0.17, confidence interval of 95%CI 0.03-0.71) with indoor access (p = 0.059, OR = 5.12, 95%CI 1.10-37.7) and human males (p = 0.042, OR = 2.44, 95%CI 1.08-6.11) with presenting calf pain (p = 0.005, OR = 3.14, 95%CI 1.46-7. 14), jaundice (p < 0.001, OR = 4.61, 95%CI 2.11-10.10) and renal failure (p = 0.008, OR = 4.49, 95%CI 1.49-13.76). The greater the rain precipitation (above 3 mm of average annual precipitation), the higher the number of leptospirosis cases in humans. In conclusion, dog active serosurvey and rain precipitation should be systematically reported and plotted altogether as a basis for the early detection and monitoring of human risk areas. Such findings may serve as a basis for public health policies in Brazil and other endemic countries worldwide.

TI  - Improvement of Ice Surface Temperature Retrieval by Integrating Landsat 8/TIRS and Operation IceBridge Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate retrieval of ice surface temperature (IST) over the Arctic ice-water mixture zone (IWMZ) is significantly essential for monitoring the change of the polar sea ice environment. Previous researchers have focused on evaluating the accuracy of IST retrieval in pack ice regions, possibly on account of the availability of in situ measurement data. Few of them have assessed the accuracy of IST retrieval on IWMZ. This study utilized Landsat 8/TIRS and Operation IceBridge observations (OIB) to evaluate the accuracy of the current IST retrieval method in IWMZ and proposed an adjustment method for improving the overall accuracy. An initial comparison shows that Landsat 8 IST and OIB IST have minor differences in the pack ice region with RMSE of 0.475 K, MAE of 0.370 K and cold bias of -0.256 K. In the thin ice region, however, the differences are more significant, with RMSE of 0.952 K, MAE of 0.776 K and warm bias of 0.703 K. We suggest that this phenomenon is because the current ice-water classification method misclassified thin ice as water. To address this issue, an adjusted method is proposed to refine the classification of features within the IWMZ and thus improve the accuracy of IST retrieval using Landsat 8 imagery. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the retrieved IST in the two cases was improved in the thin ice region, with RMSE decreasing by about 0.146 K, Bias decreasing by about 0.311 K, and MAE decreasing by about 0.129 K. After the adjustment, high accuracy was achieved for both pack ice and thin ice in IWMZ.

TI  - Hierarchical extraction of cropland boundaries using Sentinel-2 time-series data in fragmented agricultural landscapes
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately extracting cropland field parcels from satellite data in fragmented agricultural landscapes presents huge challenges due to small field sizes and irregular field shapes. Here, we developed a hierarchical framework for agricultural field boundary extraction from Sentinel-2 satellites based on the concept of the degree in field fragmentation. Our framework focused on three tasks, including a core task for agricultural field extraction and two auxiliary tasks to address special situations in two different fragmented regions, namely the Plains-Basin scenes with relatively regular shapes and diverse crop types, and the Plateau-Hilly scenes, with irregular shapes and small field sizes. First, the field boundaries were delineated using a modified Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network based on U-Net (R2U-Net), and post-processed using morphological filtering and the Douglas-Peucker algorithm (DPA). A rule-based decision fusion strategy assisted with a classification method was developed to address the under-segmentation problem in the Plains-Basin scenes, and an adaptive generalized buffer algorithm (AGBA) was used to address the incomplete-segmentation problem in the Plateau-Hilly scenes. We tested the proposed methods in Yangming County, Heilongjiang Province of China, using time series Sentinel-2 imageries with 10-m spatial resolution. Compared with the results from using R2U-Net or a single temporal image alone, the fragmented field boundaries show an outstanding performance, with an overall accuracy of 86.42% and 84.15% and F1 score of 0.85 and 0.83 in Plains-Basin scenes and Plateau-Hilly scenes, respectively. Our proposed methods provide a feasible solution to finely extract field boundaries in highly fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Tree-Structured Parzan Estimator-Machine Learning-Ordinary Kriging: An Integration Method for Soil Ammonia Spatial Prediction in the Typical Cropland of Chinese Yellow River Delta with Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Image and Air Quality Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial prediction of soil ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in monitoring climate warming and soil ecological health. However, traditional machine learning (ML) models do not consider optimal parameter selection and spatial autocorrelation. Here, we present an integration method (tree-structured Parzen estimator-machine learning-ordinary kriging (TPE-ML-OK)) to predict spatial variability of soil NH3 from Sentinel-2 remote sensing image and air quality data. In TPE-ML-OK, we designed the TPE search algorithm, which encourages gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) models to pay more attention to the optimal hyperparameters' high-possibility range, and then the residual ordinary kriging model is used to further improve the prediction accuracy of soil NH3 flux. We found a weak linear correlation between soil NH3 flux and environmental variables using scatter matrix correlation analysis. The optimal hyperparameters from the TPE search algorithm existed in the densest iteration region, and the TPE-XGB-OK method exhibited the highest predicted accuracy (R2 = 85.97%) for soil NH3 flux in comparison with other models. The spatial mapping results based on TPE-ML-OK methods showed that the high fluxes of soil NH3 were concentrated in the central and northeast areas, which may be influenced by rivers or soil water. The analysis result of the SHapley additive explanation (SHAP) algorithm found that the variables with the highest contribution to soil NH3 were O3, SO2, PM10, CO, and NDWI. The above results demonstrate the powerful linear-nonlinear interpretation ability between soil NH3 and environmental variables using the integration method, which can reduce the impact on agricultural nitrogen deposition and regional air quality.

TI  - Carbon Biomass Estimation Using Vegetation Indices in Agriculture-Pasture Mosaics in the Brazilian Caatinga Dry Tropical Forest
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is valuable for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) stocks. However, its application in agricultural and pasture areas is limited compared with forest areas. This study quantifies AGB in agriculture-pasture mosaics within Brazil's Campo Maior Complex (CMC). The methodology employs remote sensing cloud processing and utilizes an estimator to incorporate vegetation indices. The results reveal significant changes in biomass values among land use and land cover classes over the past ten years, with notable variations observed in forest plantation, pasture, sugar cane, and soybean areas. The estimated AGB values range from 0 to 20 Mg.ha-1 (minimum), 53 to 419 Mg.ha-1 (maximum), and 19 to 57 Mg.ha-1 (mean). In Forest formation areas, AGB values range from approximately 0 to 278 Mg.ha-1, with an average annual value of 56.44 Mg.ha-1. This study provides valuable insights for rural landowners and government officials in managing the semiarid territory and environment. It aids in decision making regarding agricultural management, irrigation and fertilization practices, agricultural productivity, land use and land cover changes, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, conservation strategies, the identification of priority areas for environmental restoration, and the optimization of resource utilization.

TI  - Comparison of Five Spectral Indices and Six Imagery Classification Techniques for Assessment of Crop Residue Cover Using Four Years of Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining residue cover on agricultural land is an important task. Residue cover helps reduce soil erosion and helps sequester carbon. Many studies have used either spectral indices or classification techniques to map residue cover using satellite imagery. Unfortunately, most of these studies use only a few spectral indices or classification techniques and generally only study an area for a single year with a certain level of success. This manuscript presents an investigation of five spectral indices and six classification techniques over four years to determine if a single spectral index or classification technique performs consistently better than the others. A second objective is to determine whether using the coefficient of determination (R2) from the relationship between residue cover and a spectral index is a reasonable substitute for calculating accuracy. Field visits were conducted for each of the years studied and used to create the correlations with the spectral indices and as ground truth for the classification techniques. It was found that no spectral index/classification technique is consistently better than all the others. Classification techniques tended to be more accurate in 2011 and 2013, while spectral indices tended to be more accurate in 2015 and 2018. The combination of spectral indices/classification techniques outperformed the individual approach. For the second objective, it was found that R2 is not a great indicator of accuracy. Root mean square error (RMSE) is a better indicator of accuracy than R2. However, simply calculating the accuracy would be the best of all.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Classification of Winter Irrigation Fields Using the Random Forest Algorithm and GF-1 Data: A Case Study of Jinzhong Basin, North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is one of the key agricultural management practices of crop cultivation in the world. Irrigation practice is traceable on satellite images. Most irrigated area mapping methods were developed based on time series of NDVI or backscatter coefficient within the growing season. However, it has been found that winter irrigation out of growing season is also dominating in north China. This kind of irrigation aims to increase the soil moisture for coping with spring drought and reduce the wind erosion in spring. This study developed a remote sensing-based classification approach to identify irrigated fields out of growing season with Radom Forest algorithm. Four spectral bands and all Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) like indices computed from any two of these four bands for each of the seven scenes of GF-1 satellite data were used as the input features in the building of separated RF models and in applying the built models for the classification. The results showed that the mean of the highest out-of-bag accuracies for seven RF models was 94.9% and the mean of the averaged out-of-bag accuracies in the plateau for seven RF models was 94.1%; the overall accuracy for all seven classified outputs was in the range of 86.8-92.5%, Kappa in the range of 84.0-91.0% and F1-Score in the range of 82.1-90.1%. These results showed that the classification was neither overperformed nor underperformed as the accuracies of all classified images were lower than the model ones. This study also found that irrigation started to be applied as early as in November and irrigated fields were increased and suspended in December and January due to freezing conditions. The newly irrigated fields were found again in March and April when the temperature rose above zero degrees. The area of irrigated fields in the study area were increasing over time with sizes of 98.6, 166.9, 208.0, 292.8, 538.0, 623.1, 653.8 km2 from December to April, accounting for 6.1%, 10.4%, 12.9%, 18.2%, 33.4%, 38.7%, and 40.6% of the total irrigatable land in the study area, respectively. The results showed that the method developed in this study performed well. This study found on the satellite images that 40.6% of irrigatable fields were already irrigated before the sowing season and the irrigation authorities were supposed to improve their water supply capacity in the whole year with this information. This study may complement the traditional consideration of retrieving irrigation maps only in growing season with remote sensing images for a large area.

TI  - Quantification of Spatiotemporal Variability of Evapotranspiration (ET) and the Contribution of Influencing Factors for Different Land Cover Types in the Yunnan Province
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of terrestrial ecosystems and is sensitive to climate and land-use change due to its obvious link to ecohydrological processes. Therefore, understanding the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration and its drivers under different land cover types plays an important role in estimating the impact of environmental change on the regional water cycle. In this study, we first estimated the spatiotemporal variations of ET for different land cover types in the Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2020 using the MODIS-Terra ET product (MOD16A2.06) and meteorological datasets, and quantified the contribution of six factors: namely, temperature (TEMP), precipitation (PRCP), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WDSP), soil moisture (SLME), NDVI, elevation, and slope, to the ET under different land cover types by using a ridge regression model. We then discussed the main reasons for the differences in ET in the Yunnan Province under different land cover types. The conclusions are as follows: during the study period, the annual mean ET ranged from 27 to 1183 mm, and there was a large spatial heterogeneity in its spatial distribution, with the smallest increasing trend of 2.1 mm/year in agricultural land and the largest increasing trend of 4.7 mm/year in grassland. Except for cropland, the sum of the relative contributions of the three influence factors, precipitation (PRCP), NDVI, and elevation, to all land cover types exceeded 40%, making them the most dominant factors influencing ET changes in the Yunnan Province. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate, vegetation, topography, and soils on ET, and contributes to the development of appropriate water resource management policies for different subsurface types in the context of climate warming and revegetation programs.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning Algorithms for Digital Mapping of Soil Salinity Levels and Assessing Their Spatial Transferability in Arid Regions
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of soil salinity distribution in arid regions is essential for making informed decisions regarding agricultural suitability, water resource management, and land use planning. A methodology was developed to identify soil salinity in Sudan by utilizing optical and radar-based satellite data as well as variables obtained from digital elevation models that are known to indicate variations in soil salinity. The methodology includes the transfer of models to areas where similar conditions prevail. A geographically coordinated database was established, incorporating a variety of environmental variables based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Electrical Conductivity (EC) measurements from the saturation extract of soil samples collected at three different depths (0-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm). Thereafter, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNLR) and Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBM), were utilized to spatially classify the salinity levels in the region. To determine the applicability of the model trained at the reference site to the target area, a Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) analysis was conducted. The producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and Tau index parameters were used to evaluate the model's accuracy, and spatial confusion indices were computed to assess uncertainty. At different soil depths, Tau index values for the reference area ranged from 0.38 to 0.77, whereas values for target area samples ranged from 0.66 to 0.88, decreasing as the depth increased. Clay normalized ratio (CLNR), Salinity Index 1, and SAR data were important variables in the modeling. It was found that the subsoils in the middle and northwest regions of both the reference and target areas had a higher salinity level compared to the topsoil. This study highlighted the effectiveness of model transfer as a means of identifying and evaluating the management of regions facing significant salinity-related challenges. This approach can be instrumental in identifying alternative areas suitable for agricultural activities at a regional level.

TI  - Melanoma-derived mediators can foster the premetastatic niche: crossroad to lymphatic metastasis
T2  - TRENDS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The natural history of advanced malignant melanoma demonstrates that, in most cases, widespread tumor dissemination is preceded by regional metastases involving tumor-draining lymph nodes [sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs)]. Under physiological conditions, LNs play a central role in immunosurveillance to non self-antigens to which they are exposed via afferent lymph. The dysfunctional immunity in SLNs is mediated by tumor secretory factors that allow the survival of metastatic melanoma cells within the LN by creating a premetastatic niche (PMN). Recent studies outline the altered microenvironment of LNs shaped by melanoma mediators. Here, we discuss tumor secretory factors involved in subverting tumor immunity and remodeling LNs and highlight emerging therapeutic strategies to reinvigorate antitumoral immunity in SLNs.

TI  - Placebo response of sham acupuncture in patients with primary dysmenorrhea: A meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE-JIM
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The placebo response of sham acupuncture in patients with primary dysmenorrhea is a substantial factor associated with analgesia. However, the magnitude of the placebo response is unclear. Objective: This meta-analysis assessed the effects of sham acupuncture in patients with primary dysmenorrhea and the factors contributing to these effects.Search strategy: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched from inception up to August 20, 2022.Inclusion criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using sham acupuncture as a control for female patients of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhea were included.Data extraction and analysis: Pain intensity, retrospective symptom scale, and health-related quality of life were outcome measures used in these trials. Placebo response was defined as the change in the outcome of interest from baseline to endpoint. We used standardized mean difference (SMD) to estimate the effect size of the placebo response.Results: Thirteen RCTs were included. The pooled placebo response size for pain intensity was the largest (SMD = -0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.31 to -0.68), followed by the retrospective symptom scale (Total frequency rating score: SMD = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.39. Average severity score: SMD = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.20) and physical component of SF-36 (SMD = 0.27; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.72). Studies using blunt-tip needles, single-center trials, studies with a low risk of bias, studies in which patients had a longer disease course, studies in which clinicians had < 5 years of experience, and trials conducted outside Asia were more likely to have a lower placebo response.Conclusion: Strong placebo response and some relative factors were found in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.

TI  - Supervised and self-supervised learning-based cascade spatiotemporal fusion framework and its application
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is considered an effective way to address the mutual constraints of the spatiotem-poral resolutions of the remote sensing images from a single satellite sensor. Although the deep learning (DL) -based STF methods have shown great potential so far, there are still some deficiencies. Supervised DL-based methods usually train the network on the original scale data with richer spatial information, but they utilize only the data at auxiliary dates to generate the fusion data at prediction dates, which may perform poorly when significant spatiotemporal changes occur between the auxiliary and prediction dates. For self-supervised DL -based methods, the training can focus more on the data at prediction dates, but the network is generally trained on the down-sampled data with less spatial information, causing insufficient spatial structures of the fusion results. Based on the above, we innovatively combine supervised and self-supervised learning and propose a dual-stage cascade STF framework. In the first stage, a model based on supervised learning is trained on the data at auxiliary dates to extract abundant spatial features and obtain the initial fusion results. In the second stage, we utilize a self-supervised strategy to excavate the spatiotemporal features of prediction dates based on the initial fusion results and the observed data at prediction dates. In addition, to alleviate the insufficient consideration of the temporal correlation in existing STF methods, we design a temporal consistency loss function to fully utilize the temporal correlation information between multiple prediction dates to generate more accurate fusion results. The proposed framework can not only realize the STF of remote sensing images but also be well applied to the STF of remote sensing products such as land surface temperature (LST). Based on the quantitative results of three datasets, the proposed method improves the quantitative indices of root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity (SSIM), erreur relative global adimensionnelle de synthese (ERGAS), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and spectral angle mapper (SAM) by up to 0.2014, 0.0279, 0.6797, 0.7629, and 0.2006 at most compared with the best comparison method, which fully shows the superiority of our method.

TI  - Strong inhibiting effect of daytime warming but weak promoting effect of nighttime warming on carbon use efficiency in Northern Hemisphere
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Asymmetric daytime and nighttime warming broadly affects terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling in the Northern Hemisphere. Photosynthesis mostly occurs in the daytime and respiration occurs during the whole day. Then AWD-N will certainly affect the ratio between net primary productivity (NPP) against gross primary productivity (GPP), i.e. vegetation carbon use efficiency (CUE). However, how night and daytime warming differentially affects CUE remains unclear on a global scale. Using long-term productivity datasets from MODIS and terrestrial biosphere models, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of CUE response to daytime (Tmax) and nighttime (Tmin) temperature changes across the Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N) spanning 2000-2019. Regions exhibiting a negative correlation between Tmax and CUE were extensive throughout the growing season in most northern ecosystems, with a stronger correlation magnitude in summer than in spring and autumn. Tmin warming tended to cause a positive impact on CUE in spring and autumn, while being correlated negatively with summer CUE, resulting in an overall weak positive relationship between CUE and Tmin. Divergences in the strength and direction of productivity and respiratory responses to AWD-N lead to spatial and seasonal patterns between CUE and Tmax or Tmin, and this pattern is regulated by soil moisture. Our findings provide an in-depth understanding on how the interactions between AWD-N and water limitations regulate the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation gross primary product allocation, which is vital for improving model performance.

TI  - Monitoring Agricultural Land and Land Cover Change from 2001-2021 of the Chi River Basin, Thailand Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, climate change has greatly affected agricultural activity, sustainability and production, making it difficult to conduct crop management and food security assessment. As a consequence, significant changes in agricultural land and land cover (LC) have occurred, mostly due to the introduction of new agricultural practices, techniques and crops. Earth Observation (EO) data, cloud-computing platforms and powerful machine learning methods can certainly support analysis within the agricultural context. Therefore, accurate and updated agricultural land and LC maps can be useful to derive valuable information for land change monitoring, trend planning, decision-making and sustainable land management. In this context, this study aims at monitoring temporal and spatial changes between 2001 and 2021 (with a four 5-year periods) within the Chi River Basin (NE-Thailand). Specifically, all available Landsat archives and the random forest (RF) classifier were jointly involved within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in order to: (i) generate five different crop type maps (focusing on rice, cassava, para rubber and sugarcane classes), and (ii) monitoring the agricultural land transitions over time. For each crop map, a confusion matrix and the correspondent accuracy were computed and tested according to a validation dataset. In particular, an overall accuracy > 88% was found in all of the resulting five crop maps (for the years 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021). Subsequently the agricultural land transitions were analyzed, and a total of 18,957 km2 were found as changed (54.5% of the area) within the 20 years (2001-2021). In particular, an increase in cassava and para rubber areas were found at the disadvantage of rice fields, probably due to two different key drivers taken over time: the agricultural policy and staple price. Finally, it is worth highlighting that such results turn out to be decisive in a challenging agricultural environment such as the Thai one. In particular, the high accuracy of the five derived crop type maps can be useful to provide spatial consistency and reliable information to support local sustainable agriculture land management, decisions of policymakers and many stakeholders.

TI  - Satellite Imagery for Rapid Detection of Liquefaction Surface Manifestations: The Case Study of Tu(sic)rkiye-Syria 2023 Earthquakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 6 February 2023 earthquake doublet (M-w 7.7 and M-w 7.6) that occurred on the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) triggered a significant amount of soil liquefaction phenomena in SE Turkiye and NW Syria. The great areal extent of the affected area and the necessity of rapid response led to the adoption and improvement of a workflow for mapping liquefaction phenomena based on remote sensing data. Using satellite imagery, we identified 1850 sites with liquefaction manifestation and lateral spreading deformation. We acquired a thorough map of earthquake-triggered liquefaction based on visual mapping with optical satellite imagery (high and very high-resolution) and the aid of radar satellite imagery and interferometry. The majority of sites are found along meandering sections of river valleys, coastal plains, drained lakes, swamps, and lacustrine basins along the East Anatolian Fault, highlighting once again the influence of geomorphology/surficial geology on the distribution of liquefaction phenomena. A total of 95% of the liquefaction occurrences were mapped within 25 km from the surface trace of the fault, confirming the distance from fault rupture as a more effective tool for predicting the distribution of liquefaction than epicentral distance. Thus, taking into consideration the rapid documentation of these phenomena without the limitations in terms of time, cost, and accessibility of the field investigation techniques, this desktop-based approach can result in a rapid and comprehensive map of liquefaction from a strong earthquake, and can also be used as a future guide for subsequent field investigations for liquefaction hazard mapping.

TI  - ADU-Net: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery for land cover classification
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic Segmentation is an important problem in many vision related tasks. Land use and land cover classification involves semantic segmentation of satellite imagery and plays a vital role in many applications. In this paper, we propose an extended U-Net architecture with dense decoder connections and attention mechanism for pixel wise classification of satellite imagery named Attention Dense UNet (ADU-Net). We further evaluate the effect of different upsampling strategies in the decoder part of the U-Net architecture. We evaluate our models on the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) for landcover classification consisting of five classes: built-up, forest, farmland, meadow and water. The experiments on the GID dataset show better performance than the previous approaches. Our proposed architecture delivers more than 4% higher mIoU and F1-score than the baseline U-Net. Moreover, our proposed architecture achieves an F1score of 87.21% and mIoU of 77.66% on the GID dataset. Our evaluations shows that data-dependent upsampling layer achieves higher accuracy than the Transposed Convolution, Pixel Shuffle and Bilinear upsampling layers. & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

M3  - Article
AB  - Involuntary celibates ("incels") refers to a group consisting mostly of heterosexual men that exists predominantly in online spaces. These men are united by a belief that they are victimized by a postfeminist society, leading to an inability to engage in sexual intimacy with women. Recent acts of mass violence have been linked to self-identified incels, leading to an increased need for awareness of incel worldviews, argot, and demographics among psychiatrists. Limited research exists to describe this heterogenous group, with existing data suggesting higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation within the demographic. This column reviews the incel worldview, existing literature, how to identify an individual with incel beliefs based on vocabulary and internet usage, and treatment modalities.

TI  - Land use change in rapidly developing economies-a case study on land use intensification and land fallowing in Kochi, Kerala, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use/land cover change is a local driver of environmental change having cascading impacts and implications at the global level, and therefore requires appreciable consideration when perceived from sustainability perspectives. Kerala, the southernmost state of India, has undergone a dramatic transition from a traditional agrarian economy to a modern thriving economy involving the irrational exploitation of natural resources, precisely, land and its components. The present study addresses how land is being changed along an urbanization gradient in the most agglomerative city in the state, Kochi, during the last one and half decades. High-resolution remote sensing data available from the Google Earth Pro pertaining to the four time periods, i.e., 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, representing urban, suburban, and rural areas, were analysed to estimate the changes in land use land cover. A semi-structured interview was conducted at the household level to identify the major drivers of land use change. The results indicated the presence of two major and divergent trends; the first one is the intensification of land use activities at the rate of 1.37% per annum, primarily driven by urbanization and infrastructure developments, and the second one is the fallowing and abandonment of land (at the rate of 0.21% per annum) driven by the increased cost of cultivation. The rates of change are more prominent in the rural areas while the urban grids are nearing saturation occupying nearly two-thirds of the area with urban features at the expense of greenery. Though the progression with respect to urbanization and infrastructure developments is expected, the fallowing and abandonment of land is unanticipated, raising serious questions in the developmental pathways to achieve Sustainable Development Goals in the State of Kerala.

TI  - Santa's Got a Gun: A Case Study of Cultural Stereotypes Embedded in a Map
T2  - CARTOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 20th century, the General Drafting Company was one of the "Big Three" American road map makers. When it came to the Company's Christmas card maps cultural biases overrode their commitment to accuracy and high standards. Starting in 1930, General Drafting produced a series of Christmas card maps that featured Santa Claus. Cultural and regional stereotypes are highlighted in the 1930s maps; the 1950s maps also reveal a prominent American nationalist worldview. Although Santa Claus generally serves as an avatar for the benevolent "Traditional American" who is generous and jolly, the Santa of General Drafting maps portray him differently. Santas are seen harvesting natural resources, hunting animals, and being shown deference by non-Americans while disparaging the Soviet Union. Most disturbingly, Santa is shooting a Native American in the back, and enslaving other Santas in Siberia. The abhorrent behavior is being cloaked by the kindly image of Santa Claus to make his (America's) actions more palatable. These Christmas card maps are compelling and unique examples that illustrate how accurate cartography can be supplanted by deeply engrained cultural stereotypes and ideologies.Au 20e siecle, la General Drafting Company comptait parmi les trois principales editrices de cartes routieres aux etats-Unis. En ce qui concerne les cartes de l'entreprise figurant sur ses cartes de Noel, une etude montre que les prejuges culturels l'emportaient sur son engagement envers l'exactitude et ses exigences elevees. A partir de 1930, la General Drafting a produit une serie de cartes de souhaits mettant en vedette le pere Noel. Les cartes des annees 1930 mettent en evidence des stereotypes culturels et regionaux ; les cartes ulterieures, celles des annees 1950, revelent egalement la dominance d'une vision du monde nationaliste americaine. Bien que le pere Noel soit generalement une representation de l'<< Americain typique >>, bienveillant, genereux et jovial, les cartes de la General Drafting en donnent une image differente. Sur ses cartes, le pere Noel puise dans les ressources naturelles, chasse les animaux et recoit des marques de deference de peuples non americains pour denigrer l'Union sovietique. Plus troublant encore, le pere Noel est montre en train de tirer dans le dos d'un Autochtone et d'asservir d'autres peres Noel en Siberie. Son comportement odieux se dissimule sous son image bienveillante afin de rendre ses actions (celles des etats-Unis) plus acceptables. Ces cartes geographiques apparaissant sur des cartes de Noel montrent de maniere remarquablement convaincante que des ideologies et des stereotypes culturels profondement enracines peuvent supplanter l'exactitude de la cartographie.

TI  - Usefulness of Sentinel-2 satellite data to aid in geoscientific mapping work: a case study of Giyani Greenstone Belt area
T2  - EPISODES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the usefulness of remote sensing data processing and analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery acquired during the winter period of year 2018 to aid the geologi -cal mapping of six 1:50,000 scale map sheets of Giyani Greenstone Belt area of South Africa. Images of different band ratios and band combinations were experimented using ENVI and SNAP to identify suitable band/band ratio combinations to produce false colour composites (FCCs) that enabled the discrimination of surface features (land/ water/vegetation) and the geology of the area through identification of lithological units, structural features and lineaments present. FCCs made in RGB using band ratios and combinations of B12/B11-B11-Slope in degrees, B12/ B11-B11-B2, B12-B8A-B11/B3, B12-B8A-B5, B4/B3-B11-B12, B11-B12-B8A, B12-B11-B4, B7-B4-B2 and shaded relief made from 30m digital elevation model (RGB: 240, 0, 120 degree azimuth) are found to be very useful in dis-criminating lithological units, structural features, linea -ments and protruded outcrops including dykes that are hardly not visible in a true colour image of the same res-olution. FCCs made using RGB: B4/B3-B11/B8-B11/B12 and RGB: B11/B12-B11/B8-B4/B2 could show indications of existence of some alteration and iron oxides. The datasets of selected FCCs produced from Sentinel-2 and exported as GeoTiff format for displaying in a GIS are found to be very useful to mapping geologists for their geological mapping purpose. The quality of the information extract-able from the described analysis depends on the inherent quality and characteristics (band resolutions) of the input datasets.

TI  - Spatial Configuration of Urban Greenspace Affects Summer Air Temperature: Diurnal Variations and Scale Effects
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing the spatial pattern (spatial compositive and spatial configuration) of urban greenspace can effectively alleviate the urban heat island effect. While the relationship between air temperature (AT) and spatial composition of urban greenspace has been widely studied, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between AT and spatial configuration of urban greenspace and its diurnal variations and scale effects. Based on hourly AT data from 36 meteorological stations in Changsha, China, and land cover data interpreted from the Gaofen 2 remote sensing images, this study first quantified spatial composition (i.e., percent of greenspace) and spatial configuration (i.e., average patch area, patch density, edge density, landscape shape index, and mean shape index) of urban greenspace at different scales (30 m to 2000 m buffer surrounding the air station), then Pearson correlations (between AT and each landscape metric) and partial Pearson correlations (between AT and spatial configuration metrics with percent of greenspace controlled) were analyzed. Multiple linear regression was applied to model the variation of AT using the landscape metrics as independent variables. Finally, the variance partitioning analysis was performed to investigate the relative importance of spatial composition and spatial configuration of urban greenspace to explain the variation of AT. The results showed that (1) the temperature range reached 1.73 degrees C during the day and 2.94 degrees C at night. Urban greenspace was fragmented especially at small scales. (2) The Pearson correlation between AT and percent of greenspace fluctuated with the increase of scale and was generally higher during the day than during the night. (3) The spatial pattern of urban greenspace explained as high as 55% of the AT variation, showing diurnal variations and scale effects (i.e., a maximum of 0.54 during the day at 50 m buffer and a maximum of 0.55 during the night at 400 m buffer). (4) A higher percent of greenspace, more aggregated greenspace patches, and simpler greenspace shapes can generate a stronger cooling effect. (5) The relative importance of spatial composition and spatial configuration of greenspace varied among spatial scales and showed diurnal variations. These results emphasize the scale effect as well as diurnal variation of the relationship between urban greenspace spatial pattern and AT. These findings provide theoretical guidance for urban greenspace planning and management to improve the urban thermal environment in rapidly developing subtropical cities such as Changsha, China.

TI  - Factors of Subsidence in Katy, Texas, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal communities are susceptible to the damaging effects of land subsidence caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. The Greater Houston area, situated along the Gulf Coast of Texas, has experienced some of the highest rates of subsidence in the United States. Previous work has extensively analyzed the role of groundwater levels and oil and gas extraction in land subsidence of the Greater Houston area, but has failed to adequately incorporate other significant contributing factors. In this research, we aim to fill that information gap by analyzing the individual effects of subsidence from multiple different processes including groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction rates with the addition of population growth, total annual precipitation, and total developed area in terms of impervious surfaces. We perform a full resolution InSAR analysis of the Katy area using Sentinel-1 data from 2017 to 2022 and compare contributors of subsidence to vertical displacement rates calculated by GNSS stations through a generalized linear regression analysis. The InSAR results show up to 1.4 cm/yr of subsidence in multiple areas of Katy, and the generalized linear regression results suggest that population growth and total developed area are two of the highest contributors to subsidence in the area.

TI  - Long-term oncological and surgical outcomes after Video Endoscopic Inguinal Lymphadenectomy (VEIL) in patients with penile cancer.
T2  - International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes from the largest multicenter series of penile cancer patients undergoing video endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (VEIL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective multicenter analysis. Authors of 21 centers from the Penile Cancer Collaborative Coalition-Latin America (PeC-LA) were included. All centers performed the procedure following the same previously described standardized technique. Inclusion criteria included penile cancer patients with no palpable lymph nodes and intermediate/high-risk disease and those with non-fixed palpable lymph nodes less than 4 cm in diameter. Categorical variables are shown as percentages and frequencies whereas continuous variables as mean and range.RESULTS: From 2006 to 2020, 210 VEIL procedures were performed in 105 patients. Mean age was 58 (45-68) years old. Mean operative time was 90 minutes (60-120). Mean lymph node yield was 10 nodes (6-16). Complication rate was 15.7%, including severe complications in 1.9% of procedures. Lymphatic and skin complications were noted in 8.6 and 4.8% of patients, respectively. Histopathological analysis revealed lymph node involvement in 26.7% of patients with non-palpable nodes. Inguinal recurrence was observed in 2.8% of patients. 10y- overall survival was 74.2% and 10-y cancer specific survival was 84.8%. CSS for pN0, pN1, pN2 and pN3 were 100%, 82.4%, 72.7% and 9.1%, respectively.CONCLUSION: VEIL seems to offer appropriate long term oncological control with minimal morbidity. In the absence of non-invasive stratification measures such as dynamic sentinel node biopsy, VEIL emerged as the alternative for the management of non-bulky lymph nodes in penile cancer.

TI  - Assessing biodiversity using forest structure indicators based on airborne laser scanning data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The role of forests in biodiversity assessment and planning is substantial as these ecosystems support approxi-mately 80% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. Forests provide food, shelter, and nesting environments for numerous species, and deliver multiple ecosystem services. It has been widely recognised that forest vegetation structure and its complexity influence local variations in biodiversity. As forests are facing threats globally caused by human activities, there is a need to map the biodiversity of these ecosystems. The main objective of this review was to summarise the use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in biodiversity-related assessment of forests. We draw attention to topics related to animal ecology, structural diversity, dead wood, fragmentation and forest habitat classification. After conducting a thorough literature search, we categorised scientific articles based on their topics, which served as the basis for the section division in this paper. The majority of the research was found to be conducted in Europe and North America, only a small fraction of the study areas was located elsewhere. Topics that have received the most attention were related to animal ecology (namely richness and diversity of forest fauna), assessment of dead trees and tree species diversity measures. Not all studies used ALS data only, as it were often fused with other remote sensing data - especially with aerial or satellite images. The fusion of spectral information from optical images and the structural information provided by ALS was highly advantageous in studies where tree species were considered. Relevant ALS variables were found to be case -specific, so variables varied widely between forest biodiversity studies. We found that there was a lack of research in geographical areas and forest types other than temperate and boreal forests. Also, topics that considered functional diversity, community composition and the effect of spatial resolution at which ALS data and field information are linked, were covered to much lesser extent.

TI  - Integrating Ecological Knowledge into Regenerative Design: A Rapid Practice Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - While sustainable design practice is working to reduce the ecological impacts of development, many of the earth's already damaged life support systems require repair and regeneration. Regenerative design theory embraces this challenge using an ecological worldview that recognizes all life as intertwined and interdependent to deliver restorative outcomes that heal. Central to regenerative design theory is the mutually beneficial and coevolving 'stewardship' relationship between community and place, the success of which requires local ecological knowledge. However, there is a lack of understanding about how-within the design process-practitioners are integrating 'innate knowledge' of place held by local people. This rapid practice review sought to collate and evaluate current 'regenerative design practice' methods towards ensuring good practice in the integration of place-based ecological knowledge. A comprehensive online search retrieved 345 related articles from the grey literature, academic book chapters, and government reports, from which 83 articles were analyzed. The authors conclude that regenerative design practice is emergent, with the design practice of including community knowledge of ecological systems of place remaining ad hoc, highly variable, and champion-based. The findings have immediate implications for regenerative design practitioners, researchers, and developers, documenting the state of progress in methods that explore innate ecological knowledge and foster co-evolving ecological stewardship.

TI  - Calibration and Validation for the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) Mission Concept: Recommendations for a Multi-Sensor System for Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission is to measure biological, physical, chemical, and mineralogical features of the Earth's surface, realizing a key conceptual component of the envisioned NASA Earth System Observatory (ESO). SBG is planned to launch as a two-platform mission in the late 2020s, the first of the ESO satellites. Targeted science and applications objectives based on observations of the Earth's SBG helped to define the mission architecture and instrument capabilities for the SBG mission concept. These objectives further drove the need for enabling change detection and trending of surface biological and geological features. These needs implied fundamental calibration goals to achieve the necessary science data quality characteristics. To meet those goals, calibration and validation pre-launch and on-orbit methods formed a basis of the calibration and validation concept, including the combined use of on-board references, vicarious techniques, and routine lunar imaging. International collaboration with space agencies in other countries, an important feature of the recommended SBG mission architecture, uncovered and emphasized the need for inter-calibration techniques that underscored the importance of collaborative instrument characterization data sharing and the use of common calibration references that are International System of Units (SI) traceable in pre-launch and post-launch on orbit calibration mission phases. International collaboration through the use of terrestrial and aquatic networks on six continents for vicarious calibration and validation activities will further assure necessary science data quality while in orbit.

TI  - Metaphorical models of time flow in the Altai language: comparison with other Turkic languages
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the time flow models based on a conventional (dead) "space-time" metaphor. In particular, the compatibility of motion verbs with nominations of time periods in Altai, in contrast with other Turkic languages, is analyzed. Directed motion verbs are used depending on the typical phase meaning of the beginning or end of the movement. The choice of these verbs reflects a fragment of the Altai linguistic worldview related to the ideas of these linguocultural communities about time. The Altai and Kazakh world models feature the time of annual and daily cycles moving both horizontally and vertically. The bottom is related to winter and dark periods of the day. In the Altai horizontal model, time belongs to the space where the observer is located. In the modern language, it is particularly true for the dark periods of the day. The Tuvan model has seasonal and daily cycles moving from the top to the bottom. Three dynamic and two static models can be distinguished, primarily including directed motion verbs because of the temporal flow directionality. Some models of time flow found in the Russian language are practically not represented in the Altai language and possibly also in other Turkic languages of Siberia. These models include motion verbs associated with the characterization of fast /slow time flow, as well as synchronous models. The latter may indicate a lower activity of humans within the time flow, excluding one's life progression, in the Altai linguistic worldview compared to the Russian one.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Deep Learning to Understand Noisy OpenStreetMap
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is an open-source, community-based, user-generated street map/data service. It is the most popular project within the state of the art for crowdsourcing. Although geometrical features and tags of annotations in OSM are usually precise (particularly in metropolitan areas), there are instances where volunteer mapping is inaccurate. Despite the appeal of using OSM semantic information with remote sensing images, to train deep learning models, the crowdsourced data quality is inconsistent. High-resolution remote sensing image segmentation is a mature application in many fields, such as urban planning, updated mapping, city sensing, and others. Typically, supervised methods trained with annotated data may learn to anticipate the object location, but misclassification may occur due to noise in training data. This article combines Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing data with computer vision methods to deal with noisy OSM. This work deals with OSM misalignment ambiguity (positional inaccuracy) concerning satellite imagery and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach to detect missing buildings in OSM. We propose a translating method to align the OSM vector data with the satellite data. This strategy increases the correlation between the imagery and the building vector data to reduce the noise in OSM data. A series of experiments demonstrate that our approach plays a significant role in (1) resolving the misalignment issue, (2) instance-semantic segmentation of buildings with missing building information in OSM (never labeled or constructed in between image acquisitions), and (3) change detection mapping. The good results of precision (0.96) and recall (0.96) demonstrate the viability of high-resolution satellite imagery and OSM for building detection/change detection using a deep learning approach.

TI  - Hyperspectral Mixture Models in the CHIME Mission Implementation for Topsoil Texture Retrieval
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is part of the requirements consolidation study for the European Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for Environment (CHIME). It explores the value added by existing hyperspectral data of similar characteristics to CHIME, namely AVIRIS-NG and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), for detecting topsoil texture properties. The spatial variability is retrieved using the linear spectral mixture analysis, an image-based algorithm that breaks down the hyperspectral data set into fractional abundance of spectral classes within each pixel. The fractional abundance of image-based endmembers is broken into categories to find intervals having a spatial relation with texture components in terms of fine (clay and silt) or coarse (sand) abundance. The fraction maps obtained show similar spatial patterns to the USDA soil texture classification, obtained with a geostatistical approach. Specifically, AVIRIS CHIME-like FAM1 > 0.45 presented an agreement of 86% with clay and/or silt higher than 45% which, according to the United Stated Agriculture Department (USDA) intervals, correspond to loam-clay loam classes. Similar results are obtained with PRISMA with FAM2 0.20-0.35, overlapping 63% of the kriging-based USDA clay-loam class. The fractional abundance categories showing the highest overlap percentages are correlated with the short-wave infrared spectral range, showing average coefficients of 0.7 where wavelengths are over 1,500 nm. From 1700 nm, CHIME-like shows values of 0.8. In conclusion, this exploratory research and results leverage the opportunity of extending the processing chain to a larger number of case studies to better understand the physical relation between the spectral reflectance captured by new spaceborne hyperspectral sensors and the spatial patterns of soil texture classes.

TI  - Conceptualization of Farmers' Water Conservation Intention and Behavior through the Lens of Economic Man Worldview: Application of Structural Equation Modeling
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Although different worldviews have been presented to analyze the conservation behaviors of farmers, limited empirical evidence exists for the use of the economic man worldview to analyze farmers' water conservation behaviors (WCBs). Therefore, the conceptualization of farmers' water conservation behavioral intentions through the lens of this worldview was the primary objective of this survey. To this aim, the extended planned behavior theory (PBT), which is the main theory of the economic man worldview, was employed. The study population was 36183 Iranian farmers, 380 of whom were interviewed in-person in the form a cross-sectional survey research design. An estimation of sample size was performed via the Krejcie and Morgan Table. Moreover, the distribution of the sample size was carried out by a multi-stage random sampling method. Validity and reliability, which are undeniable features of questionnaires in social and psychological sciences, were examined using different quantitative and qualitative indices. The obtained results indicated that the effect of intention towards water conservation (IWC) on WCB was positive and significant. Therefore, this research supports the main assumption of the PBT and the economic man worldview. However, according to the results, the power of IWC's effect on WCB is not very significant. In addition, the variance explanation of WCB as the fundamental dependent variable is not very high. It can be mentioned that the economic man worldview has a relative and moderate power to analyze the WCBs of farmers. Hence, it is suggested that some variables, including moral norms, environmental concerns, and environmental values, are used to develop and increase the explanatory power of the PBT in future studies. This study is the first study of the applicability of the economic man approach in analyzing farmers' WCBs. It could be used to open a new research window for future and interested researchers to conduct successful interventions in the field of water conservation.

TI  - Improving the quality of coffee yield forecasting in Dak Lak Province, Vietnam, through the utilization of remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to identify sensitive areas for Robusta coffee trees in Dak Lak province, Vietnam, where frequent droughts caused fluctuations in productivity. To improve yield forecasting, a mask was developed to extract potential predictive variables from satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs). Correlation coefficients between VIs and coffee yield were analyzed to determine sensitive areas, and grid cells with high multiple correlation coefficients and a variable over time were used to build the mask for extracting VIs as predictor variables. The study found that sensitive areas had more challenging farming conditions than long-term crops, and the Vegetation Health Index was the most appropriate index for predicting coffee yield. The forecast quality for 6-8 months in advance was relatively high, with a 'Willmott's index of agreement' ranging from 0.85 to 0.97 and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error ranging from 4.9% to 7.5%. Compared to previous research, the forecast quality has significantly improved. This study provides valuable insights for predicting coffee yield in Dak Lak and highlights the importance of considering sensitive areas and VIs for accurate forecasting.

TI  - Regional Algorithm of Quantitative Assessment of Cyanobacteria Blooms in the Eastern Part of the Gulf of Finland Using Satellite Ocean Color Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer blooms of potentially harmful cyanobacteria are common in the Baltic Sea. Under clear sky conditions, the cyanobacterial blooms are easily detectable from space. We propose a new regional algorithm for cyanobacteria biomass estimation from satellite data in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, developed on the basis of field measurements in July-August 2012-2014. The multi-regression equation defines the cyanobacteria biomass as a function of the particle backscattering coefficient and chlorophyll concentration. The use of this equation provides the best performance in comparison to the linear one, which is reflected in both R2 and RMSE values (0.61 and 272 mg m(-)3 respectively). Unlike other algorithms, which determine only the cyanobacteria bloom area in the Baltic Sea, our algorithm allows the determination of both a bloom area and its intensity. Considering the algorithm errors, the bloom detection threshold has been shifted from the 200 mg m-3 determined by biologists to 300 mg m(-3). Based on data from the MODIS-Aqua satellite ocean color scanner, the spatial and temporal variability of cyanobacterial blooms in this region from 2003 to 2022 was analyzed. Significant interannual variability of cyanobacteria biomass was revealed in the central part of the studied region, with minimum values in 2014 and maximum in 2004. The record bloom during the studied period occurred in July 2004 (the average cyanobacteria biomass was 780 mg m(-3)). The weakest blooms were observed in 2009, 2010, and 2014, when both in July and August, the bloom areas did not exceed 30% of the study region.

TI  - Sox-2 positive cells identified in lymph nodes from endometriosis patients may play a role in the disease pathogenesis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to characterize Sox-2 in sentinel lymph nodes and randomly obtained lymph nodes from endometriosis (EM) patients for the first time. Study Design: This prospective study analyzed tissue samples from surgical specimens collected from May until December 2007 in the Endometriosis Center Charite & PRIME;, Berlin. Lymph node samples from 38 women aged between 22 and 49 years who underwent laparoscopy due to symptomatic EM were analyzed. The material was obtained either randomly or, in the case of deep infiltrating endometriosis, detected using 4 cc Patent Blue & REG;, labeled intraoperatively, which made the sentinel lymph nodes available for histological examination. Together with hematoxylin and eosin staining, the sections were evaluated by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against estrogen and progesterone receptors and Sox-2. Using double-immunofluorescence microscopy, the colocalization of Sox-2 and estrogen receptors were evaluated. Results: Sox-2-positive cells were identified in the lymph nodes' cortical and medullary zones, with a higher expression in the medullary layer. Occasionally, Sox-2 positive stained cell groups, called cell nests, could also be detected. The number of Sox-2 positive cells in the sentinel lymph nodes was almost three times higher than in the random lymph nodes (p = 0.031). A significant five-fold increase (p = 0.0013) in Sox-2 expression was seen in the estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive patient group compared to the progesterone receptor positive group or hormone receptor negative patients. Identical hormone-related Sox-2 expression was also detected separately for the sentinel lymph node group (p = 0.0174). Sox-2 showed pronounced colocalisation with estrogen receptors. Conclusion: The lymphatic involvement in EM is evidence of a systemic disease manifestation and provides evidence of an immune system failure. In recent years, many theories have been studied, but there is no single theory that could explain all aspects of EM. The future concept of EM is likely to incorporate the elements from all the pathogenetic theories already described. Through this study, stem cells and lymphatic metastasis theories were incorporated.

TI  - GEOV2: Improved smoothed and gap filled time series of LAI, FAPAR and FCover 1 km Copernicus Global Land products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Essential vegetation variables including leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) and fraction of green vegetation cover (FCover) are produced and distributed in the Copernicus Global Land Service. We describe here the algorithmic principles, consistency and improvements of GEOV2, Version 2 of LAI, FAPAR and FCover products derived from SPOT/VGT (1999-2013) and PROBA-V data (2014-2020) at 1 km resolution, as compared to the earlier version GEOV1. GEOV2 is based on neural networks first trained with CYCLOPES and MODIS products to estimate LAI, FAPAR and FCover from daily top of canopy reflectance. Temporal techniques are then applied to filter, smooth, fill gaps and get a composited value every 10 days. Results show that GEOV2 products keep a high consistency with GEOV1 (90% of residuals within +/- max (0.5, 20%) LAI, and 80% within +/- max(0.05, 10%) FAPAR / FCover) and improves in terms of product completeness (<1% of missing data), temporal consistency, consistency across variables and accuracy.

TI  - Built-up area mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A timely and accurate spatial mapping of built-up areas (BA) is crucial in making cities and human settlements safe, resilient, and sustainable. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are useful for BA mapping due to strong coherent backscatter from diverse human-made targets, distinct texture patterns, and sensitivity to its geometric characteristics. However, BA mapping using SAR data is still challenging due to various geometrical and physical factors that often lead to misinterpretations. Therefore, this study presents a novel method to map BA using single-date dual polarized Sentinel-1 SAR data to overcome such challenges in complex built-up scenarios. Here, we propose three normalized descriptors derived from the Stokes vector elements. These three descriptors are found to be vital in characterizing different types of BA structures. We then consider the symmetric quadratic mean of the normalized descriptors to propose a novel dual polarimetric radar built-up index (DpRBI). The proposed index provides information about the average normalized polarized power, which is useful for mapping diverse types of BA or their combination in an image. We assess the proposed methodology utilizing the Sentinel-1 image acquired over three major cities: Delhi, Milan, and Barcelona. The BA map accuracy for all three cities was found to be & AP; 85 % with a low BA omission error. We compared the mapping results with available BA/land cover products: World Settlement Footprint 2019 (WSF-19) and World cover 2020 (WC-20). The BA map obtained using the proposed index was better than WSF-19 and WC-20, particularly for BA omission errors. For example, we observed a relatively low BA omission error of 22.34 % using DpRBI compared to 31.86 % and 41.79 % for WC-20 and WSF-19, respectively, over Milan, Italy.

TI  - Current Status of Vector-Borne Diseases in Croatia: Challenges and Future Prospects
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Different vector-borne pathogens are present or have (re-)emerged in Croatia. Flaviviruses tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), West Nile (WNV), and Usutu (USUV) are widely distributed in continental regions, while Toscana virus (TOSV) and sandfly fever viruses are detected at the Croatian littoral. Recently, sporadic clinical cases of Tahyna orthobunyavirus (TAHV) and Bhanja bandavirus infection and seropositive individuals have been reported in continental Croatia. Acute infections and serologic evidence of WNV, TBEV, USUV, and TAHV were also confirmed in sentinel animals and vectors. Autochthonous dengue was reported in 2010 at the Croatian littoral. Lyme borreliosis is the most widely distributed vector-borne bacterial infection. The incidence is very high in northwestern and eastern regions, which correlates with numerous records of Ixodes ricinus ticks. Acute human Anaplasma phagocytophilum infections are reported sporadically, but there are many records of serologic evidence of anaplasmosis in animals. Mediterranean spotted fever (Rickettsia conorii) and murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi) are the main rickettsial infections in Croatia. Human leishmaniasis is notified sporadically, while serologic evidence of leishmaniasis was found in 11.4% of the Croatian population. After the official eradication of malaria in 1964, only imported cases were reported in Croatia. Since vector-borne diseases show a growing trend, continuous monitoring of vectors is required to protect the population from these infections.

TI  - A Long Short-Term Memory-Based Prototype Model for Drought Prediction
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the development of a deep learning model to predict droughts in the coastal region of Ecuador. Historical information from local meteorological stations was used, including data on precipitation, temperature, humidity, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. A multi-layered artificial neural network was used. It was trained and evaluated by cross-validation, comparing it with other machine learning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.5% and a high sensitivity of 97.2% in predicting drought events in the coastal region of Ecuador. This exceptional performance underscores the model's potential for effective decision making to prevent and mitigate droughts. In addition, the study's limitations are discussed, and possible improvements are proposed, such as the incorporation of satellite data and the analysis of other environmental variables. This study highlights the importance of deep learning models in drought prediction and their potential to contribute to sustainable management in areas vulnerable to this climatic phenomenon.

TI  - Positioning Chaplaincy in the Pluralistic and Multidisciplinary Dutch Care Context
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The professional identity of chaplains is under question because of societal trends of disaffiliation from and pluralization of religion, and of deinstitutionalization of care. Chaplaincy in the Netherlands looks to discourse around "meaning" to navigate these challenges. The use of the term "meaning" as the central concept in the professional identity of chaplaincy (and, by extension, spiritual care) is not undisputed, however. There are three related critiques: 1. Meaning and meaning-making have a strong cognitive and intentional connotation, which does not do justice to the lived experience of meaning and might lead to a medicalization of meaning. 2. The term meaning places the professional identity of chaplaincy in the instrumental discourse of other professions, which might lead to "abuse" of spiritual care toward external objectives such as health, (hedonistic) well-being, and/or economic gain, instead of internal objectives such as faith and spirituality. 3. A focus on meaning leads to a marginalization of religion, both societally and within chaplaincy, which might negatively affect chaplaincy's core competence of hermeneutic understanding and worldview counseling. We conclude that finding one language to present the discipline might not be feasible and desirable. Instead, we advocate for the revitalization of the hermeneutic competency of chaplains.

TI  - Thermal regime of the Danube Delta and the adjacent lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Danube Delta is a unique natural object influenced by natural and human factors. According to the available observation and remote sensing data, the features of the water temperature in the Danube Delta, as well as in nearby lakes and the adjacent area of the Black Sea, have been determined. The water temperature in the Danube River was found to be much higher than the air temperature, especially in autumn. Generally, it is also higher than in nearby lakes and the adjacent part of the Black Sea. During 1961-2021 the mean annual water temperature in the Danube Delta increased significantly, especially during the last three decades. It has been determined that water temperature is affected not only by air temperature, but also by water discharge and wind. With a large water discharge the mixing of water is intensified and it causes the decrease of surface water temperature during the main part of the year with the exception of the coldest months. The greatest impact of water discharge on the water temperature is observed in June. The cool breeze in summer months also has some effect on the surface water temperature of the river near the seashore. The results show the potential of remote sensing to track the changes of water temperature along the river and to identify the shallow sections.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Predict Lake Area in an Arid Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML)-based models are popular for complex physical system simulation and prediction. Lake is the important indicator in arid and semi-arid areas, and to achieve the proper management of the water resources in a lake basin, it is crucial to estimate and predict the lake dynamics, based on hydro-meteorological variations and anthropogenic disturbances. This task is particularly challenging in arid and semi-arid regions, where water scarcity poses a significant threat to human life. In this study, a typical arid area of China was selected as the study area, and the performances of eight widely used ML models (i.e., Bayesian Ridge (BR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extra Trees (ET), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AB), Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) were evaluated in predicting lake area. Monthly lake area was determined by meteorological (precipitation, air temperature, Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) and anthropogenic factors (ETc, NDVI, LUCC). Lake area determined by Landsat satellite image classification for 2000-2020 was analysed side-by-side with the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on 9 and 12-month time scales. With the evaluation of six input variables and eight ML algorithms, it was found that the RF models performed best when using the SPEI-9 index, with R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 1.37, LCCC = 0.95, and PRD = 1331.4 for the test samples. Furthermore, the performance of the ML model constructed with the 9-month time scale SPEI (SPEI-9) as an input variable (MLSPEI-9) depended on seasonal variations, with the average relative errors of up to 0.62 in spring and a minimum of 0.12 in summer. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different ML models for predicting lake area by demonstrating that the right inputs can lead to a remarkable increase in performance of up to 13.89%. These findings have important implications for future research on lake area prediction in arid zones and demonstrate the power of ML models in advancing scientific understanding of complex natural systems.

TI  - Enhanced Understanding of Key Soil Properties in Northern Xinjiang Using Water-Heat-Spectral Datasets Based on Bioclimatic Guidelines
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Current digital soil mapping of soil properties (soil organic carbon, SOC; electrical conductivity, EC; and pH) is mainly based on transfer learning, which is inadequate in terms of accuracy for the northern plain area of Xinjiang. To address this issue, establishing a new model is urgently required that can improve our understanding of the soil properties in this region. To this end, based on the global bioclimatic variables and surface dry-wet and wet-dry transitions, The study developed a spectral-water-heat database (SWHD). The study then incorporated this database and background data into machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, and random forest) to establish models applicable to the study area and draw spatial changes in the key soil properties. Our findings revealed that the organic carbon content was the highest in grasslands, whereas shrublands had high soil salinity. The pH value indicated overall alkalinity in the study area. Additionally, the SWHD-based predictions outperformed the mean or maximum value datasets, with LightGBM showing superior performance among all models. Furthermore, the validation accuracy obtained through our optimal algorithm was significantly higher than that obtained by other products, such as Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and SoilGrid250, likely because of the limitations of these datasets, which may represent historical soil properties rather than current variations in the soil properties in the region. The study also observed that the mean SOC and EC values significantly decreased compared to the historical data, while the decrease in pH was smaller but not significant. Structural equation modeling and variable importance analysis revealed that the variables with the greatest influence on modeling SOC, EC, and pH were BIO10, DTW2021_406-426_B3 (Surface reflectance acquired in spring), and land use type. Our improved model developed based on the SWHD dataset offers important scientific evidence and decision support for land use management and provides a solid foundation for future research in this field.

AB  - Sparse tensors play fundamental roles in hypergraph data, sensor node network data and remote sensing data. In this paper, we establish new H-eigenvalue inclusion sets for sparse tensors by their majorization matrix's digraph and representation matrix's digraph. Numerical examples are proposed to verify that our conclusions are more accurate and less computations than existing results.

TI  - Landscape Ecological Risk Assessment for the Tarim River Basin on the Basis of Land-Use Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use variation indicates the spatial differentiation of regional ecological risk. Landscape ecological risk assessment (LERA) has been used for the measurement and prediction of environmental quality. In the present study, the land-use dynamics of the Tarim River Basin from 2000 to 2020 were quantitatively analyzed using ENVI 5.6 software based on Landsat TM and ETM+ images (2000, 2010, and 2020). Moreover, the ecological risk level and its spatiotemporal differentiation features were explored using geostatistical methods based on landscape pattern indices. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the arable land area increased the most (12,130.272 km2), and the woodland, wetland, water bodies, and building-land areas increased by 2416.541 km2, 4103.789 km2, 3331.230 km2, and 2330.860 km2, respectively. However, the bare-land area decreased the most (18,933.943 km2). (2) From 2000 to 2020, a decrease was detected in the landscape ecological risk index (LERI) of the basin, and the very low-, low-, and moderate-risk areas had the largest decrease. In addition, the area of the low- and moderate-risk areas gradually increased, while that of the high-risk areas was reduced. (3) The conversion rate of low-risk areas to very low-risk areas was the largest (5144.0907 km2/a), followed by that of high-risk areas to moderate-risk areas (4994.4765 km2/a). Therefore, the overall landscape ecological risk (LER) of the basin was reduced from 2000 to 2020, but the ecological risk of some areas, especially that of the glaciers and permanent snow-covered areas, still needs close attention.

TI  - Improving Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar Phase Unwrapping Accuracy with Global Navigation Satellite System Monitoring Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a GNSS-assisted InSAR phase unwrapping algorithm for large-deformation DInSAR data processing in coal mining areas. Utilizing the Markov random field (MRF) theory and simulated annealing, the algorithm derived the energy function using MRF theory, Gibbs distribution, and the Hammersley-Clifford theorem. It calculated an image probability ratio and unwrapped the phase through iterative calculations of the initial integer perimeter matrix, interference phase, and weight matrix. Algorithm reliability was confirmed by combining simulated phases with digital elevation model (DEM) data for deconvolution calculations, showing good agreement with real phase-value results (median error: 4.8 x 10-4). Applied to ALOS-2 data in the Jinfeng mining area, the algorithm transformed interferometric phase into deformation, obtaining simulated deformation by fitting GNSS monitoring data. It effectively solved meter-scale deformation variables between single-period images, particularly for unwrapping problems due to decoherence. To improve calculation speed, a coherence-based threshold was set. Points with high coherence avoided iterative optimization, while points below the threshold underwent iterative optimization (coherence threshold: 0.32). The algorithm achieved a median error of 30.29 mm and a relative error of 2.5% compared to GNSS fitting results, meeting accuracy requirements for mining subsidence monitoring in large mining areas.

TI  - Comparison and Analysis of Payloads Performance for Active and Passive Spaceborne Atmospheric Detection
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance Atmospheric environmental parameters directly affect the earth's ecological environment and climate changes, and even human life and health. For example, aerosols, clouds, and greenhouse gases affect the radiation balance between the sun and the earth through sunlight absorption and scattering, which is an important cause of atmospheric environmental pollution and frequent extreme weather. Additionally, the atmosphere is an aerospace operation area, and environmental parameters such as atmospheric temperature, pressure, density, and atmospheric wind field exert a decisive influence on the design and performance indicators of the equipment. Therefore, the detection of global atmospheric environmental parameters has caught much attention from scholars all over the world.Satellite remote sensing is an important technical means to obtain global atmospheric environment parameters, and can be divided into active and passive detections. Active detection of its radiation source is to emit different forms of electromagnetic waves to the target. Meanwhile, it does not depend on sunlight and can work day and night. Passive detection of its non-radiation source needs to rely on the reflection of the target object or the electromagnetic wave of the natural radiation source (such as the sun). Compared with the active spaceborne detection technology, the passive detection payloads have a long history, mature technology, and diversified types of remote sensing instruments and detection targets, but there are some problems such as reliance on sunlight, detection time, and regional limitations. The active spaceborne detection technology represented by lidar makes up for these shortcomings, and the active and passive spaceborne remote sensing atmospheric detection technologies are developed jointly to provide strong technical support for the detection of global atmospheric environmental parameters.Currently, atmospheric environment detection of satellite remote sensing has made great contributions to the detection of clouds, aerosols, atmospheric wind fields, greenhouse gases, temperature, pressure, density, and other parameters, and solved the problems of air pollution, climate changes, and national defense applications. We introduce the development history of spaceborne lidar and focus on the comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of active and passive spaceborne remote sensing payloads for detecting major atmospheric environmental parameters. Finally, the future development trend of atmospheric environmental parameter detection technology in spaceborne lidar and passive remote sensing is summarized.Progress Since the launch of LITE in the United States, domestic extraterrestrial lidars have developed rapidly for nearly 30 years, and the atmospheric parameters that can be detected mainly include clouds, aerosols, greenhouse gases, and atmospheric wind fields. Although LITE has a short working time, it lays a good foundation for spaceborne lidar atmospheric detection with milestone significance. The ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite (ICESat) carries the geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS) and is the world's first earth observation laser altimeter satellite. As a follow-up mission to ICESat, the ICESAT-2 satellite is launched by the national aeronautics and space administration of America (NASA) in September 2018, and is equipped with the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS) (Fig. 1). Developed by NASA in collaboration with the French National Space Research Center (CNES), CALIOP is a major breakthrough in the development of spaceborne lidar technology and has been in orbit for 17 years now, far exceeding the expected design. Scientific data are provided for such scientific issues as aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions, global dust distribution, transport and pollution, and studies on weather and climate changes (Fig. 2). As the only lidar system aboard the space station to date, CATS employs photon counting methods to obtain vertical cloud and aerosol distribution characteristics (Fig. 3). To obtain information about the three-dimensional wind field of the global atmosphere, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the ADM-Aeolus satellite on August 22, 2018, carrying the Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN). It is the first Doppler wind measurement lidar to acquire the global atmospheric wind field. This indicates the high precision and strong real-time wind measurement capability of spaceborne lidar and has made great contributions to improving the weather and climate forecasting accuracy, optimizing atmospheric models, and advancing atmospheric dynamics research (Fig. 4). Domestic spaceborne lidar started late. On April 16, 2022, China launched the aerosol and carbon dioxide detection lidar (ACDL) on the atmospheric environmental monitoring satellite (DQ-1). Based on path integral laser differential absorption (IPDA) and high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) technologies, atmospheric environmental parameters can be obtained, such as global cloud, aerosol vertical profile distribution, and CO2 column line concentration in full time and with high accuracy. It is also the only on-orbit spaceborne lidar actively detecting greenhouse gases globally (Fig. 5). Spaceborne lidars such as ASCENDS, A-SCOPE, and MERLIN are also based on IPDA. The platforms and main technical parameters of these spaceborne lidar are shown in Table 1.There are many kinds of passive spaceborne remote sensing for cloud, aerosol, greenhouse gas, and atmospheric wind field loads, and the inversion algorithms are diverse and mature. In 1960, the United States launched the first meteorological satellite TIROS-1 to open a new era of satellite cloud remote sensing observation. The representative of China is the Fengyun meteorological satellite series. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) in the United States launched on the Terra and Aqua satellites and the Himawari series in Japan show good results in cloud remote sensing. There are many kinds of spaceborne passive remote sensing of aerosols and can be roughly divided into the following categories: multi-spectral remote sensing instruments, polarization remote sensing instruments, and multi-angle remote sensing instruments, such as AVHRR, DPC, MODIS, and MISR. In the passive satellite remote sensing of greenhouse gases, the most representative ones are Japan's GOSAT series, the United States' OCO series, and China's GF-5. The atmospheric wind field of passive spaceborne remote sensing mainly takes cloud, water vapor, and atmospheric composition as detection targets for inversion, including MERSI-II, AGRI, DPC, MODIS, and AHI.Conclusions and Prospects Satellite remote sensing is an effective means to obtain global atmospheric parameters and provide scientific data support for global environmental and climate changes. The development of passive spaceborne remote sensing starts earlier with more mature technology and more abundant atmospheric environment parameters that can be detected. However, passive remote sensing has inevitable disadvantages, such as low accuracy, incomplete coverage of high latitude areas, and lack of night detection data. As a typical active remote sensing equipment, lidar features high precision and high spatio-temporal resolution, which can make up for the shortcomings of passive remote sensing. At present, ground-based and airborne atmospheric lidar detection has been quite mature, and spaceborne lidar remote sensing detection is the future development trend, which has developed for nearly 30 years since the launch of LITE. The atmospheric parameters that can be detected mainly include clouds, aerosols, greenhouse gases, and atmospheric wind fields. Through comparative analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of active and passive spaceborne remote sensing detection technology of atmospheric environmental parameters are revealed. According to different application scenarios and needs, the appropriate detection methods are chosen.

TI  - Land Subsidence Prediction and Analysis along Typical High-Speed Railways in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Plain Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-speed railways in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Plain are gradually becoming more widespread, covering a greater area. The operational safety of high-speed railways is influenced by the continuous development of land subsidence. It is necessary to predict the subsidence along the high-speed railways; thus, this work is of critical importance to the safety of high-speed railway operation. In this study, we processed Sentinel-1A data using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique to acquire the land subsidence in the typical BTH area. Then, we combined the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) methods (EMD-GBDT) to forecast land subsidence along high-speed railways. The results revealed that some parts of the high-speed railways in the BTH plain had passed through or approached the land subsidence area; the maximum cumulative subsidence of the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Baoding and Shijiazhuang-Jinan high-speed railways reached 326 mm, 384 mm and 350 mm, respectively. The forecasting accuracy for land subsidence along high-speed railways was enhanced by the EMD-GBDT model. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were 0.38 mm to 0.56 mm and 0.23 mm to 0.38 mm, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study of vegetation coverage in Jiamusi City provides theoretical support for local urban development, land use, and ecological environmental protection. Based on the land cover data and Landsat remote sensing image data from 2000 to 2020, the vegetation cover and land use data of Jiamusi City were extracted. The study includes the following aspects: (1) an analysis of the spatio-temporal changes in vegetation coverage; (2) analysis of the land use situation in Jiamusi City; and (3) investigation of the impact of natural and human factors on vegetation coverage in Jiamusi City using the Geodetector model. The results show that (1) over the past 20 years, the vegetation coverage of Jiamusi has shown a decreasing trend, declining from 25.22% in 2000 to 17.13% in 2020, representing a decrease of 32%. In terms of spatial distribution, the areas of Fuyuan City and Tongjiang City have experienced more significant decreases in vegetation coverage, decreasing by 73.6% and 54.0%, respectively. (2) The land use pattern of Jiamusi City has undergone significant changes during the study period; except for paddy fields (PF), unused land (UL), and construction land (CL), the areas of all the land categories have decreased. The ranking of the single land use dynamic degree in terms of magnitude is as follows: PF, UL, CL, dry farmland (DF), vegetation coverage land (VCL), and wetland (WET). (3) The changes in vegetation coverage were influenced by both natural and human activities and, according to the Geodetector results, the main influencing factors were CL and DF. The key findings of this study emphasize the need for comprehensive land use planning and ecological environmental protection that focus on sustainable development and conservation practices, and lay the groundwork for future ecosystem management and urban planning efforts in Jiamusi City.

TI  - A Downscaling Method Based on MODIS Product for Hourly ERA5 Reanalysis of Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for the dynamic simulation of land surface processes and for analyzing variations on regional or global scales. Obtaining LST with high spatiotemporal resolution is a subject of intensive and ongoing research. This study proposes a pixel-wise temporal alignment iterative linear regression model for downscaling based on MODIS LST products. This approach allows us to address the problem of high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution of the ERA5 reanalysis LST product while remaining immune to the pixel loss caused by clouds. The hourly ERA5 LST of the study area for 2012-2021 was downscaled to a 1000 m resolution, and its accuracy was verified by comparison with measured data from meteorological stations. The downscaled LST offers intricate details and is faithful to the LST characteristics of distinct land-cover categories. In comparison with other downscaling techniques, the proposed technique is more stable and preserves the spatial distribution of the ERA5 LST with minimal missing pixels. The pixel-wise average R2 and mean absolute error for the MODIS view times are 0.87 and 2.7 K, respectively, for cloud-free conditions on a 1000 m scale. The accuracy verification using data from meteorological stations indicates that the overall error is lower during cloudless periods rather than during overcast periods, during the night rather than during the day, and at MODIS view times rather than at non-view times. The maximum and minimum mean errors are 0.13 K for cloud-free periods and -0.98 K for cloudy periods, indicating a slight underestimation and overestimation, respectively. Conversely, the maximum and minimum mean absolute errors are 2.01 K for the daytime and 0.85 K for the nighttime. Therefore, the model ensures higher accuracy during cloudy periods with only the clear-sky LST used as input data, making it suitable for long-term, all-weather ERA5 LST downscaling.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the application value of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The main objective of this study was to compare the application value of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICGFI) and its combined tracing method with the blue dye method in guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer. Materials and methods: A computerized search of the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify all relevant literature on ICGFI compared to the sole methylene blue (MB) tracing method in guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer. The search was performed up until May 2023. After assessing the quality of the included studies, a meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 12.0 software. Results: A total of 11 relevant studies were included in this research. The analysis results showed that, in terms of the detection rate, the ICGFI group had a higher detection rate to the MB group [odds ratio (OR) = 8.64, 95% CI: 5.46-13.66, P = 0.000], and had a higher quantity compared to the MB group [weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.72, 95% CI 0.31-1.13, P = 0.001], and it also had a lower false-negative rate [OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.43, P = 0.002]. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the positive detection rate, and sensitivity comparison. Conclusion: The indocyanine green fluorescence imaging and tracing method for sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer are simple and effective, and they are well suited for clinical use. A multicenter randomized controlled trial with a large sample size should be conducted in the future for further validation of the method.

TI  - Dam Surface Deformation Monitoring and Analysis Based on PS-InSAR Technology: A Case Study of Xiaolangdi Reservoir Dam in China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xiaolangdi Dam is a key project for the control and development of the Yellow River. It bears the functions of flood control, controlling water and sediment in the lower reaches, ice prevention, industrial and agricultural water supply, power generation, and so on. Its safety is related to people's life and property safety and local economic and social development. It is of great significance to carry out comprehensive and regular deformation monitoring for dams since the deformation is an important evaluation index for dam safety. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has been a rapidly evolving technology in the field of space geodesy in recent years. It offers advantages such as high monitoring precision, extensive coverage, and high monitoring point density, making it a powerful tool for monitoring deformations in hydraulic engineering projects. Based on Sentinel-1 data covering the Xiaolangdi Dam from September 2020 to November 2022, the PS-InSAR technique was used to obtain the surface deformation of the Xiaolangdi Dam, and reservoir water level data on image acquisition dates were obtained for joint analysis. The results show that there is a large deformation in the center of the dam crest of the Xiaolangdi Dam, while both sides of the slope and downstream dam foot are relatively stable. The time series deformation of the dam body is closely related to the reservoir water level change. When the water level increases, the dam body tends to deform downstream; when the water level decreases, the dam body tends to deform upstream. The deformation and water level of the Xiaolangdi Dam exhibit a clear negative correlation. There is no significant cumulative deformation on the dam slopes or at the base of the dam. However, cumulative deformation occurs over time in the central area of the dam's crest. The deformation process at the central area of the dam's crest follows a continuous and non-disruptive pattern, which is consistent with the typical deformation behavior of the Xiaolangdi earth-rock dam structure. Therefore, it is judged that the current deformation of the Xiaolangdi Dam does not impact the safe operation of the dam. InSAR technology enables the rapid acquisition of high-precision, high-density deformation information on the surfaces of reservoir dams. With an increasing number of radar satellites in various frequency bands, such as Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X, there is now an ample supply of available data sources for InSAR applications. Consequently, InSAR technology can be extended to routine monitoring applications for reservoir dam deformations, especially for small and medium-sized reservoirs that may not be equipped with ground measurement tools like GNSS. This holds significant importance and potential for enhancing the safety monitoring of such reservoirs.

TI  - Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using Multi-Modal Transformer Cascaded Fusion Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of surface observation methods and technologies, we can acquire multiple sources of data more effectively in the same geographic area. The quality and availability of these data have also significantly improved. Consequently, how to better utilize multi-source data to represent ground information has become an important research question in the field of geoscience. In this paper, a novel model called multi-modal transformer cascaded fusion net (MMTCFN) is proposed for fusion and classification of multi-modal remote sensing data, Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) and LiDAR data. Feature fusion and feature extraction are the two stages of the model. First, in the feature extraction stage, a three-branch cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework is employed to fully leverage the advantages of convolutional operators in extracting shallow-level local features. Based on this, we generated multi-modal long-range integrated deep features utilizing the transformer-based vectorized pixel group transformer (VPGT) module during the feature fusion stage. In the VPGT block, we designed a vectorized pixel group embedding that preserves the global features extracted from the three branches in a non-overlapping multi-space manner. Moreover, we introduce the DropKey mechanism into the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to alleviate overfitting caused by insufficient training samples. Finally, we employ a probabilistic decision fusion strategy to integrate multiple class estimations, assigning a specific category to each pixel. This model was experimented on three HSI-LiDAR datasets with balanced and unbalanced training samples. The proposed model outperforms the other seven SOTA approaches in terms of OA performance, proving the superiority of MMTCFN for the HSI-LiDAR classification task.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Pattern of Invasive Pedicularis in the Bayinbuluke Land, China, during 2019-2021: An Analysis Based on PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification and monitoring of invasive plants are of great significance to sustainable ecological development. The invasive Pedicularis poses a severe threat to native biodiversity, ecological security, socioeconomic development, and human health in the Bayinbuluke Grassland, China. It is imperative and useful to obtain a precise distribution map of Pedicularis for controlling its spread. This study used the positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) method to extract Pedicularis from the Bayinbuluke Grassland based on multi-period Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope remote sensing images. A change rate model for a single land cover type and a dynamic transfer matrix were constructed under GIS to reflect the spatiotemporal distribution of Pedicularis. The results reveal that (1) the PUL method accurately identifies Pedicularis in satellite images, achieving F1-scores above 0.70 and up to 0.94 across all three datasets: PlanetScope data (seven features), Sentinel-2 data (seven features), and Sentinel-2 data (thirteen features). (2) When comparing the three datasets, the number of features is more important than the spatial resolution in terms of use in the PUL method of Pedicularis extraction. Nevertheless, when compared with PlanetScope data, Sentinel-2 data demonstrated a higher level of accuracy in predicting the distribution of Pedicularis. (3) During the 2019-2021 growing season, the distribution area of Pedicularis decreased, and the distribution was mainly concentrated in the northeast and southeast of Bayinbuluke Swan Lake. The acquired spatiotemporal pattern of invasive Pedicularis could potentially be used to aid in controlling Pedicularis spread or elimination, and the methods proposed in this study could be adopted by the government as a low-cost strategy to identify priority areas in which to concentrate efforts to control and continue monitoring Pedicularis invasion.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Troposphere O<sub>3</sub> and Precursors HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub> in East China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on OMI remote sensing satellite data, the temporal and spatial characteristics of tropospheric ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations in East China from 2005 to 2021 were analyzed, and the backward trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to explore their sources. The results showed that (1) during the 17 years, the tropospheric O-3 concentration steadily increased, reached the maximum value in 2010, and then showed a fluctuating and undulating state. NO2 showed an increasing trend from 2005 to 2012 and slowly decreased from 2012 to 2021. The average HCHO concentration showed an increasing trend from 1.15x10(16)molec center dot cm(-2) in 2005 to 1.8x10(16) molec center dot cm(-2) in 2021. (2) In terms of spatial characteristics, the concentrations of the three pollutants generally showed a pattern of high concentration in the north and low concentration in the south, with a high concentration in the north, uncharacteristic concentration in the middle, and low concentration in the south. (3) The sensitivity of O-3 was as follows: eta<2.3 in spring, which belonged to the VOCs control area; eta<4.2 in summer, showing that most areas were NOx-VOCs coordinated control areas and a few areas were VOCs control areas; eta<4.2 in autumn, which was primarily controlled by VOCs, with a few of them being NOx-VOC synergistic control areas; and eta<2.3 in winter, which was a VOCs-controlled area. VOCs were primarily controlled in Shandong Province. (4) Owing to the high concentration of O-3 in Shandong Province from 2005 to 2021, Jinan, the capital city of Shandong Province in 2021, was selected for ozone source analysis. The O-3 concentration increased in Jinan in 2021 owing to two aspects. First, the long-distance air transportation primarily originated from Lianyungang City in Jiangsu Province and Cangzhou City in Hebei Province. Second, the close air mass transport originated from the pollution of cities near Jinan and the economic zones of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, and the aggregation analysis results corresponded with those of the potential source contribution factor algorithm (PSCF) and the weighted trajectory analysis (CWT).

TI  - Decoupling Effect and Driving Factors of Land-Use Carbon Emissions in the Yellow River Basin Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change is a crucial element influencing the patterns of carbon sinks/sources in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Therefore, studying land-use carbon emissions (LUCE) in the YRB and the decoupling from economic development can help formulate emission reduction strategies. In order to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of LUCE in the YRB, we estimated the LUCE in 69 cities in the YRB using the downscale energy balance table estimation method and land-use remote sensing data for seven phases from 1990 to 2020. The spatial and temporal features of LUCE were researched from three different spatial scales: the whole spatial scale of the YRB, the sub-basin level, and the city level. Furthermore, the Tapio decoupling model was utilized to research the decoupling state between LUCE and economic development using a multi-scale approach. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model was employed to explore the influencing factors of LUCE in the YRB. These results showed the following: (1) The LUCE in the YRB went through two stages: "stable growth" (1990-2000) and "rapid growth" (2000-2020). The LUCE increased from 165 million tons in 1990 to 1.414 billion tons in 2020, and the average annual growth rate was 25.12%. The spatial pattern of LUCE in the YRB exhibited significant variations, with the LUCE showing a geographic differentiation of midstream > downstream > upstream. (2) Except for the expansive coupling state during 2000-2005 (e: 0.952) and the expansive negative decoupling state during 2015-2020 (e: 2.151), the YRB was in the weak decoupling state for the majority of the time periods. (3) Economic development was the major positive driving factor for the rise of LUCE in this basin, while energy consumption intensity was the primary inhibiting factor. Through a discussion of the features and influencing factors of LUCE, these results can be utilized to provide carbon emission reduction recommendations tailored to the characteristics of cities' resources and economic development, which will be helpful for achieving low-carbon and sustainable development in the YRB.

TI  - Estimation of Total Phosphorus Concentration in Lakes in the Yangtze-Huaihe Region Based on Sentinel-3/OLCI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total phosphorus (TP) concentration is a crucial parameter to assess eutrophication in lakes. As one of the most concentrated regions for freshwater lakes, the Yangtze-Huaihe region plays a significant role in monitoring TP concentrations for the sustainable utilisation of China's water resources. In this study, a TP concentration estimation model suitable for large-sized lake groups was developed using a combination of measured and remote sensing data powered by advanced machine learning algorithms. Compared to traditional empirical models, the model developed in this study demonstrates significant accuracy in fitting (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.08 mg/L, MAPE = 34.20%). Moreover, the application of this model to lakes in the Yangtze-Huaihe region from 2017 to 2022 has been conducted. The multi-year average TP concentration was 0.18 mg/L. Spatial distribution analyses showed that total phosphorus concentrations were higher in small lakes. In terms of temporal changes, the interannual decreases in total phosphorus concentrations were 0.02 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, and 0.01 mg/L for small, medium, and large lakes, respectively. We also found that large lakes typically exhibited a "high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter" pattern until 2020, but transitioned to a "high in summer and autumn, low in spring and winter" pattern after 2020 due to the removal of closed fish nets, which were having a significant impact on the lake ecosystem. Other lakes in the area consistently showed a pattern of "high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter" during the six-year period. These findings may provide useful references and suggestions for the environmental protection and management of lakes in China.

TI  - Cross-satellite calibration of high-energy electron fluxes measured by FengYun-4A based on Arase observations
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the High-energy Electron Experiments (HEP) instrument onboard Arase (ERG) to conduct an energy-dependent crosssatellite calibration of electron fluxes measured by the High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD) onboard FengYun-4A (FY-4A) spanning from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. By tracing the two-dimensional magnetic positions (L, magnetic local time [MLT]) of FY-4A at each time, we compare the datasets of the conjugate electron fluxes over the range of 245-894 keV in 6 energy channels for the satellite pair within different sets of L x MLT. The variations in the electron fluxes observed by FY-4A generally agree with the Arase measurements, and the percentages of the ratios of electron flux conjunctions within a factor of 2 are larger than 50%. Compared with Arase, FY-4A systematically overestimates electron fluxes at all 6 energy channels, with the corresponding calibration factors ranging from 0.67 to 0.81. After the cross-satellite calibration, the electron flux conjunctions between FY-4A and Arase show better agreement, with much smaller normalized root mean square errors. Our results provide a valuable reference for the application of FY-4A high-energy electron datasets to in-depth investigations of the Earth's radiation belt electron dynamics.

TI  - High summer land surface temperatures in a temperate city are mitigated by tree canopy cover
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate warms, the impact of existing urban heat islands on the health of residents in towns and cities will worsen. A reduction in impervious in cities may help to reduce temperatures, but the relationship between tree canopy coverage and land surface temperature (LST) is not well characterised. Here, we quantified the summer LST of the temperate city of Leeds, UK using Landsat 8 TIRS remote sensing image and explored the spatial relationships between LST and impervious land cover, greenspace coverage, type of greenspace and canopy cover. We found a strong relationship between LST and canopy coverage across the built-up region of Leeds and use this relationship to project the impact of future canopy cover expansion. We found that of the nine main types of greenspaces in Leeds, private gardens occupied the greatest fraction of the total greenspace area and offered most potential for canopy cover expansion. Results suggest that a doubling of canopy coverage across the city, could reduce the mean LST by around 2.5 degrees C during the warmest summer months. Such a temperature reduction adds further weight to efforts by cities and countries globally to increase tree cover to both mitigate for and adapt to climate change.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Through conversion of land cover to more built-up, impervious surfaces, cities create hotter environments than their surroundings for urban residents, with large differences expected between different parts of the city. Existing measurements of ambient air temperature and heat stress, however, are often insufficient to capture the intra-urban variability in heat exposure. This study provides a replicable method for modeling air temperature, humidity, and moist heat stress over the urban area of Chapel Hill while engaging citizens to collect high-temporal and spatially-resolved air temperature and humidity measurements. We use low-cost, consumer-grade sensors combined with satellite remote sensing data and machine learning to map urban air temperature and relative humidity over various land-cover classes to understand intra-urban spatial variability of ambient heat exposure at a relatively high resolution (10 m). Our findings show that individuals may be exposed to higher levels of air temperature and moist heat stress than weather station data suggest, and that the ambient heat exposure varies according to land cover type, with tree-covered land the coolest and built-up areas the warmest, and time of day, with higher air temperatures observed during the early afternoon. Combining our resulting dataset with sociodemographic data, policymakers and urban planners in Chapel Hill can use data output from this method to identify areas exposed to high temperature and moist heat stress as a first step to design effective mitigation measures.

TI  - Empirical Correlation Weighting (ECW) Spatial Interpolation Method for Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth Products by MODIS AOD over Northern China in 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol products are pivotal in studies of regional air quality and global climate change. Compared with accurate in situ observations, satellite measurements provide valuable large-scale atmospheric information. However, limitations such as clouds and retrieval assumptions result in a significant number of missing values in satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, which severely hampers the representativeness. To address this issue, spatial interpolation of the AOD data is necessary to improve data coverage. In this study, one year of AOD observation data from the MODIS C6.1 version was applied to analyze the spatiotemporal correlated characteristics. The statistical parameters were used as dynamic interpolation weights to develop a novel interpolation method called empirical correlation weighting (ECW) based on MODIS AOD over Northern China in 2016. The ECW interpolation results were obtained at a 0.05 degrees resolution (similar to 5 km). The results showed that the spatial coverage of the Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT) products increased from 43.88% to 70.65% and from 15.04% to 32.62%, respectively. The reconstruction of the ECW method illustrated good agreement with original values in three cases and in two experimental areas. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) in the two experiments were 0.1171 and 0.0809, and 0.1212 and 0.0838, respectively, indicating that the ECW exhibited the better accuracy than ordinary Kriging (OK) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS). The AERONET validation results indicated that the values of RMSE and MAE were slightly higher after interpolation compared with those before interpolation, maintaining relatively low values, 0.241 and 0.257, 0.140 and 0.150, respectively.

TI  - Bathymetry Inversion Using Attention-Based Band Optimization Model for Hyperspectral or Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry enables the non-contact derivation of large-scale shallow water depths. Hyperspectral satellite images provide more information than multispectral satellite images, making them theoretically more effective and accurate for bathymetry inversion. This paper focuses on the use of hyperspectral satellite images (PRISMA) for bathymetry inversion and compares the retrieval capabilities of multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 9) in the southeastern waters of Molokai Island in the Hawaiian Archipelago and Yinyu Island in the Paracel Archipelago. This paper proposes an attention-based band optimization one-dimensional convolutional neural network model (ABO-CNN) to better utilize the increased spectral information from multispectral and hyperspectral images for bathymetry inversion, and this model is compared with a traditional empirical model (Stumpf model) and two deep learning models (feedforward neural network and one-dimensional convolutional neural network). The results indicate that the ABO-CNN model outperforms the above three models, and the root mean square errors of retrieved bathymetry using the PRISMA images are 1.43 m and 0.73 m in the above two study areas, respectively. In summary, this paper demonstrates that PRISMA hyperspectral imagery has superior bathymetry inversion capabilities compared to multispectral images (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 9), and the proposed deep learning model ABO-CNN is a promising candidate model for satellite-derived bathymetry using hyperspectral imagery. With the increasing availability of ICESat-2 bathymetric data, the use of a combination of the proposed ABO-CNN model and the ICEsat-2 data as the training data provides a practical approach for bathymetric retrieval applications.

TI  - Characterizing annual dynamics of urban form at the horizontal and vertical dimensions using long-term Landsat time series data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of built-up height are a crucial aspect of urban form, enabling the characterization of urban growth patterns and the attainment of sustainable development goals. While past studies have focused on urban extent mapping, little has been done to reveal changes in vertical structures in built-up areas. In this study, we reconstructed annual urban form dynamics in Beijing, China, from 1990 to 2020, utilizing Landsat time-series data. First, we identified urban growth and renewal years using a temporal segmentation approach. Then, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights through logical reasoning, using the reference height in 2020 and the identified changing years. We evaluated the derived dataset and analyzed the urban growth patterns (i.e., upward and outward) over the past three decades. The detected change years are reliable, with an overall accuracy of 88% (& PLUSMN;1 year). Meanwhile, the reconstructed built-up height data showed good agreement with surveyed results (R2: 0.92), with a root mean square error of 2.87 m and a mean absolute error of 2.07 m. Most expanded built-up areas during 1990-2020 were located at the fringe of the central city, and about 16% experiencing multiple changes. Overall, outward growth was prominent in Beijing during the first decade, while upward growth became dominant in most districts thereafter. The proposed framework provides a new way to reveal annual urban form dynamics through time series analysis, with great potential to support relevant studies such as urban climate modeling and carbon emissions studies.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Absorbing Aerosol Sensor (AAS) is carried on the Gao-Fen 5B (GF-5B) satellite, and it allows for the measurement of solar backscatter radiation by the atmosphere in the UV-Vis bands. The AAS is an imaging spectrometer that employs CCD for capturing both a continuous spectrum and the cross-track orientation with a 114(circle) wide swath. The broad field of view provides daily global envelopment with a 4 km spatial resolution at the nadir. This paper mainly analyzes the initial working status of the instrument in orbit, including wavelength calibration, radiometric calibration, detector performance, and product availability. Preliminary observations indicate the ability of the AAS to monitor absorbing aerosols like dust, biomass burning, volcano ash, and some pollution aerosols and to identify the aerosol events in China and other regions with high spatial resolution.

TI  - All-Day Cloud Classification via a Random Forest Algorithm Based on Satellite Data from CloudSat and Himawari-8
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - It remains challenging to accurately classify complicated clouds owing to the various types of clouds and their distribution on multiple layers. In this paper, multi-band radiation information from the geostationary satellite Himawari-8 and the cloud classification product of the polar orbit satellite CloudSat from June to September 2018 are investigated. Based on sample sets matched by two types of satellite data, a random forest (RF) algorithm was applied to train a model, and a retrieval method was developed for cloud classification. With the use of this method, the sample sets were inverted and classified as clear sky, low clouds, middle clouds, thin cirrus, thick cirrus, multi-layer clouds and deep convection (cumulonimbus) clouds. The results indicate that the average accuracy for all cloud types during the day is 88.4%, and misclassifications mainly occur between low and middle clouds, thick cirrus clouds and cumulonimbus clouds. The average accuracy is 79.1% at night, with more misclassifications occurring between middle clouds, multi-layer clouds and cumulonimbus clouds. Moreover, Typhoon Muifa from 2022 was selected as a sample case, and the cloud type (CLT) product of an FY-4A satellite was used to examine the classification method. In the cloud system of Typhoon Muifa, a cumulonimbus area classified using the method corresponded well with a mesoscale convective system (MCS). Compared to the FY-4A CLT product, the classifications of ice-type (thick cirrus) and multi-layer clouds are effective, and the location, shape and size of these two varieties of cloud are similar.

TI  - An InSAR Deformation Phase Retrieval Method Combined with Reference Phase in Mining Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of precise deformation data, including the entirety of the subsidence basin resulting from subterranean mining operations, assumes critical significance in the context of surface impairment monitoring during the course of mining activities. In light of the constraints associated with InSAR technology when applied to the surveillance of expansive deformation gradient mining regions, an innovative approach is advanced herein for InSAR deformation phase retrieval. This approach integrates a reference phase, derivable through a variety of means, including pre-existing models or measurements. Initially, the reference deformation phase is subjected to subtraction from the wrapped InSAR deformation phase, culminating in the derivation of the wrapped phase indicative of the residual phase. Notably, it is posited that the fringe density characterizing the wrapped phase of the residual phase is theoretically diminished in comparison to that of the InSAR wrapped phase. This reduction in complexity in phase unwrapping ensues as a direct consequence. Subsequent to this, the phase retrieval process is effectuated through the summation of the reference phase and the unwrapped phase pertaining to the residual phase. The study harnesses Sentinel-1A and ALOS PALSAR-2 data, employing the PIM-predicted outcomes and GNSS-RTK monitoring outcomes as reference phases for the execution of phase retrieval experiments in two designated study areas. The computation of subsidence is subsequently realized through the combination of the displacement vector depression angle model and the retrieved phase, with the accuracy thereof corroborated through the utilization of leveling data. The experimental findings underscore the efficacy of the reference phase retrieval methodology in securing a more precise deformation phase characterization within expansive deformation gradient mining regions, thereby demonstrating the suitability of this methodological approach.

TI  - Intra- and Peritumoral Radiomics of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography Predicts Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Breast Cancer: A Multicenter Study
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: This multicenter study aimed to explore the feasibility of radiomics based on intra- and peritumoral regions on preoperative breast cancer contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) to predict axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis.Materials and Methods: A total of 809 patients with preoperative breast cancer CEM images from two centers were retrospectively recruited. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select radiomics features extracted from CEM images in regions of the tumor and peritumoral area of five and ten mm as well as construct radiomics signature. A nomogram, including the optimal radiomics signature and clinicopathological factors, was then constructed. Nomogram performance was evaluated using AUC and compared with breast radiologists directly.Results: In the internal testing set, AUCs of peritumoral signatures decreased when the peritumoral area increased and signature(tumor) (+) (10mm) demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.712. The nomogram incorporating signaturetumor + 10mm, tumor diameter, progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and CEM-reported lymph node status yielded maximum AUCs of 0.753 and 0.732 in internal and external testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the nomogram outperformed radiologists and improved diagnostic performance of radiologists.Conclusion: The nomogram based on CEM intra- and peritumoral regions may provide a noninvasive auxiliary tool to guide treatment strategy of ALN metastasis in breast cancer.

TI  - Land subsidence simulation based on Extremely Randomized Trees combined with Monte Carlo algorithm
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a threat to the living safety of urban residents. Land subsidence simulation helps make prevention and conservation efforts more effective. This work introduces an innovative model for land subsidence simulation which combines Extremely Randomized Trees (ET) with the Monte Carlo algorithm to conduct quantitative analysis on the importance of different factors in land subsidence. Long-time series land surface deformation results in the eastern part of Beijing Plain were obtained by time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring technology based on 91 scenes of RADARSAT-2 data collected from Sept. 2009 to Jan. 2020. In addition, multi-source data, such as layered compressible layer and layered groundwater level were introduced to analysis the evolutionary mechanism of land subsidence. The results showed that the average annual rates of land subsidence at the following three typical subsidence bowls in the Beijing Plain, Chaoyang-Jinzhan, Dong Balizhuang-Da Jiaoting and Tongzhou-Song Gezhuang were -66.4 mm/a, -64.2 mm/a and -53.2 mm/a from 2010 to 2019, indicating a rather alarming subsidence issue. The most important feature affecting land subsidence is the groundwater level which contributed 67.6% to 81.8% to land surface deformation. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicated that land subsidence occurs at Dong Balizhuang-Da Jiaoting Subsidence Bowl is estimated to be the worst, with a 95% confidence interval differing by 95.7 mm/ a between the upper and lower limits. Such work contributes to better understand the complex relationship between the land subsidence and influencing factors. And the simulation results provide different scientific means to facilitate efficient management and control of three land subsidence bowls.

TI  - Vis-NIR spectroscopy coupled with PLSR and multivariate regression models to predict soil salinity under different types of land use
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is an important environmental challenging factor that threatens human life and food security. Therefore, accurate monitoring of soil salinization needs some low-cost measurement methods. One of the rapid and low costly methods is monitoring by using Vis-NIR spectroscopy methodology. For this aim, 84 points were selected in to take soil samples in different types of land uses such as bare lands, range lands, and farm lands. Soil salinity (ECe) was measured at all sampled soils. Moreover, spectral reflectance at various bands was recorded by using a portable spectrometer. The spectral reflectance at all wavelength ranges (i.e. from 400 to 2400 nm) and a combination of spectral reflectance from different wavelengths were used as input variables for developing PLSR (partial least squares regression) and MLR (multiple regression) models. The results indicated that the derived MLR model by using combinations of spectral reflectance from different wavelengths such as 1448, 1943 and 2400 nm as input variables performed better results to predict soil salinity (RMSE = 7.890 dS m  1, R2 = 0.728, and RPD = 2.024). In addition, the results of developed PLSR and MLR models showed that the MLR model performed better soil salinity predictions at farm lands and range lands, while the accurate prediction of soil salinity for range lands was found by using developed PLSR models. It was concluded that the employing Vis-NIR spectroscopy data under different types of land uses could predict soil salinity in a different level of accuracy.

TI  - Indonesian Foreign Policy under the Jokowi Administration: Variations on Traditional Ideas
T2  - ISSUES & STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since independence in 1945, Indonesia has managed to carry out its foreign policy according to a unique doctrine described as "independent and active" (bebas dan aktif). To be independent means that Indonesia does not side with world powers, while being active means vigorously carrying out peaceful policies and actively participating in the peaceful settlement of international issues. The doctrine is not a neutral policy but does not align and bind the country with the superpowers or any military pact. Instead, being independent and active primarily serves the national interest while allowing the Indonesian government to collaborate with other nations. However, the doctrine's implementation has varied according to the different interpretations of successive presidents. This paper explains Indonesia's independent and active foreign policy during President Joko Widodo's presidency. It contends that while the doctrine has continued to underlie Indonesia's foreign policy, the formulation of President Joko Widodo's foreign policy is unique in its practical approach, prioritizing the national interest and the domestic advantages of foreign relations. In the president's worldview, foreign policy has been instrumental in promoting the nation's development.

TI  - Long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using Landsat images and deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.

TI  - Temporal and spatial analysis of vegetation cover change in the Yellow River Delta based on Landsat and MODIS time series data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the NDVI product of MODIS, this study synthesized two kinds of time-series images. The features were selected according to the characteristics of the time series, and the random forest algorithm was used for classification. Based on the classification results and GIS spatial analysis, the temporal and spatial changes in vegetation cover in the Yellow River Delta from 2000 to 2020 were studied. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, the vegetation first increased and then decreased, and the dynamic degree of land cover change was generally low. The monthly average minimum NDVI values during the vegetation growth period mostly occurred before 2010, and the maximum values occurred after 2010. From the spatial perspective, the average vegetation area of the Yellow River Delta accounted for 31.54% of the total study area; specifically, the spatial pattern of vegetation distribution was relatively fixed, and the fixed vegetation area accounted for 63.90% of the total vegetation area. The spatial distribution had significant differences, and the vegetation was distributed radially from the center of the Yellow River to the periphery, with significant fragmentation found outside the watershed. The Yellow River had a strong interference with vegetation growth, and the stable vegetation distribution areas were concentrated near the Yellow River. The correlation coefficient between vegetation distribution and the location of the Yellow River was - 0.9964.

TI  - Not Secular: Interrogating the Sacred-Secular Binary through Gospel-Pop Performance
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secularisation theory proposed that the modernisation of society would bring about a decline in religiosity across the West, leading to 'entzauberung' (disenchantment). Eventually, society would be devoid of belief in the transcendent. Some theorists have challenged this by suggesting (with some qualifying factors) that enchantment better describes the secular age we occupy. Charles Taylor suggests that we can perceive the enchantment of a secular age through the human relationship with art. In this article, I suggest that, when present in popular music, black gospel music (in particular) complicates notions of the sacred-secular binary. The sacred-secular distinction was not familiar to West Africans arriving in the New World during the transatlantic slave trade. Music had played a central role in the lives of pre-diaspora Africans, with no differentiation between sacred and secular musicking. Despite some of the historical opposition to secular music in many black-majority churches, gospel music owes its heritage to this West African worldview. In this article, I propose a four-quadrant model that troubles the accepted binaries of sacred and secular. I use the Kingdom Choir's 2018 performance of 'Stand by Me' at the Royal Wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as a basis for discussing alternative ways of viewing holy-profane, sacred-secular dichotomies.

TI  - Relativistic effects of LEO satellite and its impact on clock prediction
T2  - MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Low Earth orbit (LEO) augmentation in the global navigation satellite system has become a focus in the current satellite navigation field. To achieve high precision in positioning, navigation and timing services, relativistic effects should be considered, as they are difficult to distinguish from LEO satellite clock estimates and disturb their predictions. The relativistic effects on LEO satellite clocks are discussed in detail based on both theoretical and empirical results. Two LEO satellite clock prediction strategies are proposed, with and without removing the relativistic effect, using real data from typical LEO satellites: SENTINEL-3B and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE FO-1). For GRACE FO-1 and SENTINEL-3B, the relativistic effects are both on the order of nanoseconds and after removing the relativistic effects, the modified Allan deviations of the clocks are shown to be significantly improved. Based on the prediction strategies proposed, for SENTINEL-3B at around 810 km, with the prediction period increased from 30 to 3600 s, the root mean square error (RMSE) increases from 0.025 ns to about 1.4-1.6 ns. For the lower LEO satellite GRACE FO-1 at around 500 km, the RMSE of the predicted clocks increases more rapidly, i.e. from 0.012 ns at 30 s to about 4.5 ns at 3600 s. Results showed that the LEO satellite relativistic effects developed based on the theory could correct the majority, but not all of the once- and twice-per-revolution terms in the LEO satellite clocks. Although the corrections have exhibited effective improvements in the clock stability, they do not behave better than simply applying the mathematical model to the clock predictions. The latter model, however, does not have physical foundations as the former one.

TI  - Forest Cover Change Monitoring Using Sub-Pixel Mapping with Edge-Matching Correction
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 serves as a crucial data source for monitoring forest cover change. In this study, a sub-pixel mapping of forest cover is performed on Sentinel-2 images, downscaling the spatial resolution of the positioned results to 2.5 m, enabling sub-pixel-level forest cover monitoring. A novel sub-pixel mapping with edge-matching correction is proposed on the basis of the Sentinel-2 images, combining edge-matching technology to extract the forest boundary of Jilin-1 images at sub-meter level as spatial constraint information for sub-pixel mapping. This approach enables accurate mapping of forest cover, surpassing traditional pixel-level monitoring in terms of accuracy and robustness. The corrected mapping method allows more spatial detail to be restored at forest boundaries, monitoring forest changes at a smaller scale, which is highly similar to actual forest boundaries on the surface. The overall accuracy of the modified sub-pixel mapping method reaches 93.15%, an improvement of 1.96% over the conventional Sub-pixel-pixel Spatial Attraction Model (SPSAM). Additionally, the kappa coefficient improved by 0.15 to reach 0.892 during the correction. In summary, this study introduces a new method of forest cover monitoring, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of acquiring forest resource information. This approach provides a fresh perspective in the field of forest cover monitoring, especially for monitoring small deforestation and forest degradation activities.

TI  - Assimilation of AMSU-A Surface-Sensitive Channels in CMA_GFS 4D-Var System over Land
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of two surface-sensitive channels of the AMSU-A instruments on board the NOAA-15/ NOAA-18/NOAA-19 and MetOp-A/MetOp-B satellites over land was achieved in the China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA_GFS). The land surface emissivity was calculated by 1) the window channel retrieval for these satellite microwave observations over land were conducted. The predictors and regression coefficients used for oceanic satellite data were retained during the bias correction over land and found to perform well. Three batch experiments were implemented in CMA_GFS with 4D-Var: 1) assimilating only the default data, and adding the above data over land with land surface emissivity obtained from 2) TELSEM2 and 3) the window channel retrieval method. The results indicated that the window channel retrieval method can better reduce the departure between the observed and simulated brightness temperature. Over most land types, the positive impacts of this method exceed those of TELSEM2. Both TELSEM2 and the window channel retrieval method improve the humidity analysis near the ground, as well as the forecast capability globally, particularly in those regions where the land coverage is greater, such as in the Northern Hemisphere. The data utilization of the two surface-sensitive channels increase by 6% and 12%, respectively, and the additional data every 6 h can cover most land, where there was no surface-sensitive data assimilated before. This study marks the beginning of near-surface channel assimilation over land in CMA_GFS and represents a breakthrough in the assimilation of other surface-sensitive channels in other satellite instruments.

TI  - A Novel Approach of Monitoring <i>Ulva pertusa</i> Green Tide on the Basis of UAV and Deep Learning
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ulva pertusa (U. pertusa) is a benthic macroalgae in submerged conditions, and it is relatively difficult to monitor with the remote sensing approaches for floating macroalgae. In this work, a novel remote-sensing approach is proposed for monitoring the U. pertusa green tide, which applies a deep learning method to high-resolution RGB images acquired with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The results of U. pertusa extraction from semi-simultaneous UAV, Landsat-8, and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images demonstrate the superior accuracy of the deep learning method in extracting U. pertusa from UAV images, achieving an accuracy of 96.46%, a precision of 94.84%, a recall of 92.42%, and an F1 score of 0.92, surpassing the algae index-based method. The deep learning method also performs well in extracting U. pertusa from satellite images, achieving an accuracy of 85.11%, a precision of 74.05%, a recall of 96.44%, and an F1 score of 0.83. In the cross-validation between the results of Landsat-8 and UAV, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the portion of macroalgae (POM) model for U. pertusa is 0.15, and the mean relative difference (MRD) is 25.01%. The POM model reduces the MRD in Ulva pertusa area extraction from Landsat-8 imagery from 36.08% to 6%. This approach of combining deep learning and UAV remote sensing tends to enable automated, high-precision extraction of U. pertusa, overcoming the limitations of an algae index-based approach, to calibrate the satellite image-based monitoring results and to improve the monitoring frequency by applying UAV remote sensing when the high-resolution satellite images are not available.

TI  - TCUNet: A Lightweight Dual-Branch Parallel Network for Sea-Land Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques for shoreline extraction are crucial for monitoring changes in erosion rates, surface hydrology, and ecosystem structure. In recent years, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have developed as a cutting-edge deep learning technique that has been extensively used in shoreline extraction from remote sensing images, owing to their exceptional feature extraction capabilities. They are progressively replacing traditional methods in this field. However, most CNN models only focus on the features in local receptive fields, and overlook the consideration of global contextual information, which will hamper the model's ability to perform a precise segmentation of boundaries and small objects, consequently leading to unsatisfactory segmentation results. To solve this problem, we propose a parallel semantic segmentation network (TCU-Net) combining CNN and Transformer, to extract shorelines from multispectral remote sensing images, and improve the extraction accuracy. Firstly, TCU-Net imports the Pyramid Vision Transformer V2 (PVT V2) network and ResNet, which serve as backbones for the Transformer branch and CNN branch, respectively, forming a parallel dual-encoder structure for the extraction of both global and local features. Furthermore, a feature interaction module is designed to achieve information exchange, and complementary advantages of features, between the two branches. Secondly, for the decoder part, we propose a cross-scale multi-source feature fusion module to replace the original UNet decoder block, to aggregate multi-scale semantic features more effectively. In addition, a sea-land segmentation dataset covering the Yellow Sea region (GF Dataset) is constructed through the processing of three scenes from Gaofen-6 remote sensing images. We perform a comprehensive experiment with the GF dataset to compare the proposed method with mainstream semantic segmentation models, and the results demonstrate that TCU-Net outperforms the competing models in all three evaluation indices: the PA (pixel accuracy), F1-score, and MIoU (mean intersection over union), while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources compared to other models. These results indicate that the TCU-Net model proposed in this article can extract the shoreline from remote sensing images more effectively, with a shorter time, and lower computational overhead.

TI  - MP-Net: An efficient and precise multi-layer pyramid crop classification network for remote sensing images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop classification map is of great significance in various fields such as the survey of agricultural resource, the analysis of existing circumstance on land application, the yield estimation of crop and the disaster warning. The methods based on machine learning and deep learning are popularly used in crop classification and recognition of remote sensing images. However, the crop classification task based on neural networks still faces significant challenges due to the spatial and temporal distribution of crops and the inherent characteristics of remote sensing images. Therefore, this study proposes the multi-layer pyramid crop classification network (MPNet) to solve the above problems. To reduce the feature loss during the crop extraction, the proposed model uses the pyramid pooling module to improve the ability of global information acquisition, and the information concatenation module to retain the upper features. Using the GF-6 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, the proposed model was tested in Erhai Lake Basin and Beian City. Compared with other five deep learning models, such as FCN, SegNet, U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLabv3+, the experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves the highest accuracy in both study areas. Meanwhile, the proposed model has the advantages of short training time and high efficiency under the same running conditions. Overall, this study is beneficial to improve the efficiency and accuracy of crop classification task in the unbalanced temporal and spatial distribution. It also brings a feasible scheme for crop classification tasks in complex growing areas. The code has been publicly available at https://github.com/Xu-Chang-Hong/MP-Net.

TI  - Assessing 30-Year Land Use and Land Cover Change and the Driving Forces in Qianjiang, China, Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) related with aquaculture areas is vital for evaluating the impacts of aquaculture ponds on the environment and developing a sustainable aquaculture production system. Most studies analyze changes in aquaculture land in coastal areas, and little research focuses on the inland area, where the conversions between agriculture and aquaculture land is primarily driven by socioeconomic factors. This study assessed LULCC related to aquaculture areas in Qianjiang City, China, from 1990 to 2022, using multitemporal Landsat images and a combination of decision tree classifier and visual interpretation. The LULCC was analyzed by the transition matrix. Results showed that the main LULC type was farmland, which accounted for more than 70% of the study area from 1990 to 2022. The built-up and aquaculture land showed an increasing trend year by year. In contrast, there was a gradual decline in forest/grass land from 1990 to 2016, and then its area increased slightly from 2016 to 2022 due to the policy of returning farmland to forest. Water areas were mainly composed of rivers and ponds, with subtle changes during the study period. The main driving forces of LULCC in Qianjiang City were economic and policy factors, with rapid GDP growth and government policies being the dominant factors.

TI  - Analysis of Ocean-Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling Related to Two Strong Earthquakes Occurring in June-September 2022 on the Sea Coast of Philippines and Papua New Guinea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific progress in the context of seismic precursors reveals a systematic mechanism, namely lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC), to elaborate the underlying physical processes related to earthquake preparation phases. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted for two earthquakes that occurred on the sea coast through tidal force fluctuation to investigate ocean-lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (OLAIC), based on oceanic parameters (i.e., sea potential temperature and seawater salinity), air temperature and electron density profiles. The interrupted enhancement and diffusion process of thermal anomalies indicate that the intensity of seismic anomalies in the atmosphere is affected by the extent of land near the epicenter. By observing the evolution of the ocean interior, we found that the deep water was lifted and formed upwelling, which then diffused along the direction of plate boundaries with an "intensification-peak-weakening" trend under the action of the accelerated subduction of tectonic plates. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the seismic anomalies have two propagation paths: (i) along active faults, with the surface temperature rising as the initial performance, then the air pressure gradient being generated, and finally the ionosphere being disturbed; (ii) along plate boundaries, upwelling, which is the initial manifestation, leading to changes in the parameters of the upper ocean. The results presented in this study can contribute to understanding the intrinsic characteristics of OLAIC.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Match Individual Trees between Aerial Photographs and Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating multimodal remote sensing data can optimize the mapping accuracy of individual trees. Yet, one issue that is not trivial but generally overlooked in previous studies is the spatial mismatch of individual trees between remote sensing datasets, especially in different imaging modalities. These offset errors between the same tree on different data that have been geometrically corrected can lead to substantial inaccuracies in applications. In this study, we propose a novel approach to match individual trees between aerial photographs and airborne LiDAR data. To achieve this, we first leveraged the maximum overlap of the tree crowns in a local area to determine the correct and the optimal offset vector, and then used the offset vector to rectify the mismatch on individual tree positions. Finally, we compared our proposed approach with a commonly used automatic image registration method. We used pairing rate (the percentage of correctly paired trees) and matching accuracy (the degree of overlap between the correctly paired trees) to measure the effectiveness of results. We evaluated the performance of our approach across six typical landscapes, including broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, mixed forest, roadside trees, garden trees, and parkland trees. Compared to the conventional method, the average pairing rate of individual trees for all six landscapes increased from 91.13% to 100.00% (p = 0.045, t-test), and the average matching accuracy increased from 0.692 & PLUSMN; 0.175 (standard deviation) to 0.861 & PLUSMN; 0.152 (p = 0.017, t-test). Our study demonstrates that the proposed tree-oriented matching approach significantly improves the registration accuracy of individual trees between aerial photographs and airborne LiDAR data.

TI  - A Collaborative Inference Algorithm in Low-Earth-Orbit Satellite Network for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite network has achieved considerable development. Moreover, it is necessary to introduce edge computing into LEO networks, which can provide high-quality services, such as worldwide seamless low-delay computation offloading for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or user terminals and nearby remote-sensing data processing for UAVs or satellites. However, because the computation resource of the satellite is relatively scarce compared to the ground server, it is hard for a single satellite to complete massive deep neural network (DNN) inference tasks in a short time. Consequently, in this paper, we focus on the multi-satellite collaborative inference problem and propose a novel COllaborative INference algorithm for LEO edge computing called COIN-LEO. COIN-LEO manages to split the complete DNN model into several submodels consisting of some consecutive layers and deploy these submodels to several satellites for inference. We innovatively leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to efficiently split the model and use a neural network (NN) to predict the time required for inference tasks of a specific submodel on a specific satellite. By implementing COIN-LEO and evaluating its performance in a highly realistic satellite-network-emulation platform, we find that our COIN-LEO outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of inference throughput, time consumed and network traffic overhead.

TI  - For a Better Quality of Beef: The Challenge from Growing Livestock on Limited Grasslands with a Production-Consumption Balance Perspective
T2  - FOODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing population, the transition dietary towards animal-based products, and the preference for the brand of grass-feeding livestock are bringing increasing pressure on natural grasslands, especially for dry-land areas. The Xilingol League of China is famous for its free-range livestock product, however, overgrazing and herders' benefits damage are always serious issues for this semi-arid grassland region. This study focuses on the relationship between the supply of natural grassland and the consumption of free-range livestock in the Xilingol League, and this study employed the grassland carrying capacity as the index to judge the sustainability states and its trends of the local grass-feeding system. Satellite data production of net primary production was used for grassland production, statistical livestock data and the consumption model were used for actual forage consumption, and empirical key informant interview data were used to obtain a more comprehensive understanding. The results show that: (1) the natural grassland carrying capacity of the Xilingol League fluctuated, showing improvement from 2000 to 2021; (2) the grassland management needs to be more diversified in different regions with different natural conditions; and (3) while the demand for free-range, high-quality beef is increasing, attention should be paid to the carrying capacity of natural pastures and more consideration should be taken of the benefits of balancing the livelihood of herders, policy strategies, and the customers' preferences. Potential ways of doing this include employing technologies to improve livestock production, and further exploring and promoting the economic value of the free-range livestock and the geographical indication to get the economic-ecological win-win situation. The research framework and results would be beneficial to reveal the potential threats in pastoral areas and provide support for the optimization of the regional grass-feeding breeding system, especially in middle-income countries.

TI  - Detection of Atmospheric Metal Layer by Ground-Based Lidar
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance The atmospheric detection of the mesosphere (about 80-110 km) is of scientific research and application significance. There are many important spatial features and phenomena in this region, including the coldest altitude of the Earth's atmosphere (similar to 90 km), and special phenomena such as high-altitude noctilucent clouds, temperature inversion layer, and atmospheric metal layers also occur in this region. Gravity wave fragmentation makes the atmospheric disturbances in this region particularly intense, and the wind shear in this region becomes extremely intense. This region is also part of the atmospheric photochemical layer, and the atmospheric compositions have dramatic diurnal variations. With the development of aerospace, the influence of this region needs to be closely focused on. For example, suborbital flights (generally defined as 35 to 300 km to the Earth) involve this region, and these studies will lay a solid foundation for future suborbital commercial flights.This region has long been relatively unknown to humans because of the limitations of traditional detection methods. Fortunately, there are atmospheric metal layers in this region. As the cross section of resonance fluorescence scattering of metal atoms and ions is much larger than those of Rayleigh scattering and Raman scattering, it can be employed to detect low-concentration atmospheric components. In the past half century, by adopting the transition spectra of atoms and ions at specific wavelengths, the metal layer of the atmosphere has been detected by lasers with specific wavelengths and laser remote sensing technology. These metal atoms and ions are excellent tracers of atmospheric fluctuations, and many parameters such as atomic number density, temperature, and wind have been obtained. In recent years, with the discovery of thermospheric metal layers, the height range of atmospheric metal layers has been expanded, and the study of metal layers has been paid great attention to.Progress Based on the research of our team and collaborators, we introduce the development of atmospheric metal layer lidar and the current situation and trend of atmospheric metal layer detection by lidar. First, the dye laser opens the door to the atmospheric metal layer. Second, the sum frequency of the dye laser and YAG laser increases the laser energy further. Third, with pulsed dye amplifier employing dye as the working substance, directly amplifies the single-mode continuous seed laser into a high-power pulse laser. This meets the dual characteristics of high spectral resolution and sound center frequency stability of wind and temperature detection in metal layers. Fourth, narrow-band filtering technology extends lidar detection from night to all time. Fifth, a dye laser needs to change dye frequently with low single pulse energy, and all- solid-state laser solves this problem. Sixth, OPO lasers have many advantages such as high integration degree, good pump light spot, high single pulse energy, and further improved detection ability of atmospheric compositions. Additionally, we list the parameters of sodium atom, calcium atom and ion, iron atom lidar, and potassium atom lidar in four tables respectively.Conclusions and Prospects With the development of Q-switching, harmonic generation, tuning, high-power optical fiber devices, and other technologies, the pulse energy, stability, and operation convenience of lasers are constantly improving. In recent years, the simultaneous detection of multi-component density, temperature, and wind has become the trend. The multi-function lidar with high resolution and detection accuracy has been excavated and applied in China and abroad. In the future, the development and application of automated and intelligent lidar will promote satellite lidar, and in combination with ground-based lidar, more ion component detection will be possible to provide support for temperature and wind detection at higher altitudes. Finally, the cognition of chemical and physical processes in the upper atmosphere, and the coupling research on different regions of the ionosphere will be advanced.

TI  - Comparison of FY-4A/AGRI SST with Himawari-8/AHI and In Situ SST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite is a new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite developed by China. The advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI), one of the key payloads onboard FY-4A, can monitor sea surface temperature (SST). This paper compares FY-4A/AGRI SST with in situ and Himawari-8/advanced Himawari imager (AHI) SST. The study area spans 30 degrees E-180 degrees E, 60 degrees S-60 degrees N, and the study period is from January 2019 to December 2021. The matching time window of the three data is 30 min, and the space window is 0.1 degrees. The quality control criterion is to select all clear sky and well-distributed matchups within the study period, removing the influence of SST fronts. The results of the difference between FY-4A/AGRI and in situ SST show a bias of -0.12 degrees C, median of -0.05 degrees C, standard deviation (STD) of 0.76 degrees C, robust standard deviation (RSD) of 0.68 degrees C, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.77 degrees C for daytime and a bias of 0.00 degrees C, median of 0.05 degrees C, STD of 0.78 degrees C, RSD of 0.72 degrees C, and RMSE of 0.78 degrees C for nighttime. The results of the difference between FY-4A/AGRI SST and Himawari-8/AHI SST show a bias of 0.04 degrees C, median of 0.10 degrees C, STD of 0.78 degrees C, RSD of 0.70 degrees C, and RMSE of 0.78 degrees C for daytime and the bias of 0.30 degrees C, median of 0.34 degrees C, STD of 0.81 degrees C, RSD of 0.76 degrees C, and RMSE of 0.86 degrees C for nighttime. The three-way error analysis also indicates a relatively larger error of AGRI SST. Regarding timescale, the bias and STD of FY-4A/AGRI SST show no seasonal correlation, but FY-4A/AGRI SST has a noticeable bias jump in the study period. Regarding spatial scale, FY-4A/AGRI SST shows negative bias at the edge of the AGRI SST coverage in the Pacific region near 160 degrees E longitude and positive bias in high latitudes of the southern hemisphere. The accuracy of FY-4A/AGRI SST depends on the satellite zenith angle and water vapor. Further research on the FY-4A/AGRI SST retrieval algorithm accounting for the variability of water vapor will be conducted.

TI  - Inversion of soil heavy metals in metal tailings area based on different spectral transformation and modeling methods.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The exploitation of mineral resources has seriously polluted the environment around mines, notably in terms of heavy metal contamination of tailings pond soil. Hyperspectral remote sensing, as opposed to conventional on-site sampling and laboratory analysis, offers a potent tool for effective monitoring the content of soil heavy metals. Therefore, we investigated the inversion models of heavy metal content in metal tailings area based on measured hyperspectral and multispectral data. Hyperspectral and its transformation, as well as the simulated Landsat8-OLI multispectral were used for model inversion respectively. Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Back Propagation Neuron Network (BPNN) were established to study the spectral inversion of eight heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, As, and Hg). The direct inversion models were established on the basis of correlation analysis and the adjust coefficient of determination (Adjust_R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used for model evaluation. Then the best combination of spectral transformation and inversion model were explored. The model inversion results suggested that: (1) Hyperspectral transformation can generally improve the model accuracy, especially the second derivative spectral, based on which the training Adjust_R2 of Hg SMLR and PLSR models are as high as 0.795 and 0.802. (2) The BP neural network inversion based on the denoised hyperspectrum demonstrate that both the training and testing Adjust_R2 of Cd, Ni and Hg models are all greater than 0.5, indicating good applicability in practical extrapolation. (3) Both the training and testing Adjust_R2 of Cu and Hg PLSR models based on simulated R_Landsat8-OLI multispectral are greater than 0.5, and Hg has lower RMSE and lager Adjust_R2 with training and testing Adjust_R2 values of 0.833 and 0.553 respectively. (4) Multispectral remote sensing detection and mapping of Hg contamination were realized by the optimal simulation model of Hg. Hence, it is feasible to simulate the multispectral with hyperspectral data for investigating heavy metal contamination.

TI  - Impacts of Extreme-High-Temperature Events on Vegetation in North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the response of vegetation to temperature extremes is crucial for investigating vegetation growth and guiding ecosystem conservation. North China is a vital hub for China's economy and food supplies, and its vegetation is highly vulnerable to complex heatwaves. In this study, based on remote sensing data, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), spatio-temporal variations in vegetation and extreme high temperatures are investigated by using the methods of trend analysis, linear detrending, Pearson correlation and ridge regression. The impacts of extreme-high-temperature events on different vegetation types in North China from 1982 to 2015 are explored on multiple time scales. The results indicate that the NDVI in North China exhibits an overall increasing trend on both annual and monthly scales, with the highest values for forest vegetation and the fastest growth trend for cropland. Meanwhile, extreme-high-temperature events in North China also display an increasing trend. Before detrending, the correlations between the NDVI and certain extreme-high-temperature indices are not significant, while significant negative correlations are observed after detrending. On an annual scale, the NDVI is negatively correlated with extreme temperature indices, except for the number of warm nights, whereas, on a monthly scale, these negative correlations are only found from June to September. Grassland vegetation shows relatively strong correlations with all extreme temperature indices, while forests show nonsignificant correlations with the indices. This study offers new insight into vegetation dynamic variations and their responses to climate in North China.

TI  - Combined Retrievals of Turbidity from Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8/9 in the Taihu Lake through Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play a crucial role in the earth's ecosystems and human activities. While turbidity is not a direct biochemical indicator of lake water quality, it is relatively easy to measure and indicates trophic status and lake health. Although ocean color satellites have been widely used to monitor water color parameters, their coarse spatial resolution makes it hard to capture the fine spatial variability of turbidity in lakes. The combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides an opportunity to monitor lake turbidity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study aims to generate consistent turbidity products in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022 using the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2A/B and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat-8/9. We first tested the performance of three atmospheric correction methods to retrieve consistent reflectance from MSI and OLI images. We found that the Rayleigh correction and a subtraction of the SWIR band from Rayleigh-corrected reflectance can generate the most consistent reflectance (the coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.84, the mean absolution percentage error (MAPE) < 7%, the median error (ME) < 0.0035, and slope > 0.92). Machine learning models outperformed an existing semi-analytical retrieval algorithm in retrieving turbidity (MSI: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 18.78%, and OLI: R2 = 0.93, MAPE = 16.20%). The consistency of turbidity from the same-day MSI and OLI images was also satisfactory (N = 3110 and MAPE = 26.48%). The distribution of turbidity exhibited obvious spatial and seasonal variability in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022. The results show the potential of MSI and OLI when combined to monitor inland lake water quality.

However, previous studies primarily focused on chlorophyll-a inversion and reconstruction, while methods for predicting Chl-a concentrations remain limited. To address this issue, we adopted four deep learning approaches, including Convolutional LSTM Network (ConvLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Eidetic 3D LSTM (E3D-LSTM), and Self-Attention ConvLSTM (SA-ConvLSTM) models, to predict Chl-a over the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea (YBS) in China. Furthermore, 14 environmental variables obtained from the remote sensing data of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) were utilized to predict the Chl-a concentrations in the study area. The results showed that all four models performed satisfactorily in predicting Chl-a concentrations in the YBS, with SA-ConvLSTM exhibiting a closer approximation to true values. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of the Self-Attention Memory Module (SAM) on the prediction results. Compared to the ConvLSTM model, the SA-ConvLSTM model integrated with the SAM module better captured subtle large-scale variations within the study area. The SA-ConvLSTM model exhibited the highest prediction accuracy, and the one-month Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.887. Our study provides an available approach for anticipating Chl-a concentrations over a large area of sea.

TI  - Surging Glaciers in High Mountain Asia between 1986 and 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High Mountain Asia (HMA) is one of the concentrated areas of surging glaciers in the world. The dynamic movement of surging glaciers not only reshapes the periglacial landscape but also has the potential to directly or indirectly trigger catastrophic events. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the distribution patterns, periodicities, and occurrence mechanisms of surging glaciers. Based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI remote sensing images from 1986 to 2021, a total of 244 surging glaciers were identified in HMA in this study, covering an area of 11,724 km(2) and accounting for 12.01% of the total area of glaciers in this region. There are 185 surging glaciers identified within the Karakoram Range and Pamirs, which constitute the primary mountainous regions in HMA. From 1986 to 2021, these surging glaciers advanced at least 2802 times and exhibited different temporal and spatial patterns. A total of 36 glaciers in HMA experienced 2 or more surges during this period, with the highest number observed in the Pamirs (19), followed by the Karakorum (13), with the other regions having fewer occurrences. Obvious differences exist in the surge phase and the quiescent phase of glaciers in different regions of HMA. The surge phase of surging glaciers in the Karakoram Range and Pamirs is generally short, mostly in the range of 2 similar to 6 years. The quiescent phase lasts for 5 similar to 19 years and the overall surge cycle ranges from 9 to 24 years. The complex nature of glacier surges in HMA suggests that multiple mechanisms may be at play, necessitating further research.

TI  - National dengue surveillance, Cambodia 2002-2020.
T2  - Bulletin of the World Health Organization
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Global dengue incidence has increased dramatically over the past few decades from approximately 500 000 reported cases in 2000 to over 5 million in 2019. This trend has been attributed to population growth in endemic areas, rapid unplanned urbanization, increasing global connectivity, and climate change expanding the geographic range of the Aedes spp. mosquito, among other factors. Reporting dengue surveillance data is key to understanding the scale of the problem, identifying important changes in the landscape of disease, and developing policies for clinical management, vector control and vaccine rollout. However, surveillance practices are not standardized, and data may be difficult to interpret particularly in low- and middle-income countries with fragmented health-care systems. The latest national dengue surveillance data for Cambodia was published in 2010. Since its publication, the country experienced marked changes in health policies, population demographics, climate and urbanization. How these changes affected dengue control remains unknown. In this article, we summarize two decades of policy changes, published literature, country statistics, and dengue case data collected by the Cambodia National Dengue Control Programme to: (i)identify important changes in the disease landscape; and (ii)derive lessons to inform future surveillance and disease control strategies. We report that while dengue case morbidity and mortality rates in Cambodia fell between 2002 and 2020, dengue incidence doubled and age at infection increased. Future national surveillance, disease prevention and treatment, and vector control policies will have to account for these changes to optimize disease control.
AB  - Le taux d'incidence de la dengue dans le monde a considerablement augmente au cours des dernieres decennies, passant d'environ 500 000 cas notifies en 2000 a plus de 5 millions en 2019. Cette tendance est attribuee a la croissance demographique dans les zones d'endemie, a l'urbanisation rapide non planifiee, au developpement de la connectivite a l'echelle internationale, ainsi qu'au changement climatique, qui agrandit le territoire geographique du moustique Aedes spp., entre autres. La communication des donnees de surveillance de la dengue est essentielle pour comprendre l'etendue du probleme, identifier les principales variations de contexte entourant la maladie et mettre au point des politiques pour la prise en charge clinique, la lutte contre les vecteurs et le deploiement des vaccins. Les pratiques en matiere de surveillance ne sont toutefois pas standardisees et les donnees peuvent etre difficiles a interpreter, surtout dans les pays a revenu faible et intermediaire oo les systemes de soins de sante sont fragmentes. Les donnees de surveillance les plus recentes concernant la dengue au Cambodge ont ete publiees en 2010. Depuis leur publication, le pays a subi de profondes mutations au niveau des politiques de sante, de l'evolution demographique, du climat et de l'urbanisation. L'impact de ces mutations sur la lutte contre la dengue reste a etablir. Dans le present article, nous resumons deux decennies d'amendements politiques, de documentation, de statistiques nationales et d'informations collectees sur les cas par le programme cambodgien de lutte contre la dengue afin de: (i) definir les changements importants survenus dans le contexte entourant la maladie; mais aussi (ii) tirer des lecons en vue d'elaborer, a l'avenir, des strategies de surveillance et de lutte contre la maladie. Nous signalons qu'en depit d'une baisse des taux de morbidite et de mortalite lies aux cas de dengue entre 2002 et 2020 au Cambodge, son incidence a double et l'age des patients au moment de l'infection a augmente. Les futures politiques nationales de surveillance, de prevention et de traitement de la dengue, mais aussi de lutte contre ses vecteurs, devront tenir compte de ces changements de facon a mieux maitriser la maladie.La incidencia del dengue a nivel mundial ha aumentado considerablemente en las ultimas decadas, desde aproximadamente 500 000 casos notificados en el ano 2000 a mas de 5 millones en 2019. Esta tendencia se ha atribuido al crecimiento de la poblacion en zonas endemicas, a una urbanizacion rapida y no planificada, al aumento de la conectividad a nivel mundial y al cambio climatico, que esta permitiendo una distribucion geografica mas amplia del mosquito Aedes spp., entre otros factores. Para comprender la magnitud del problema resulta clave la notificacion de datos sobre vigilancia del dengue, la identificacion de cambios importantes dentro del escenario de la enfermedad, la creacion de politicas enfocadas a la gestion clinica, asi como el control de vectores y la implantacion de la vacuna. Sin embargo, las practicas sobre vigilancia no estan estandarizadas y es posible que sea dificil interpretar los datos, especialmente en paises con ingresos medios y bajos, que cuentan con sistemas fragmentados de atencion sanitaria. Los datos nacionales mas recientes sobre vigilancia del dengue en Camboya se publicaron en 2010. Desde su publicacion, el pais experimento cambios significativos en las politicas sanitarias, la demografia de la poblacion, el clima y la urbanizacion. Aun no se sabe como afectaron dichos cambios al control del dengue. En el presente articulo, resumimos dos decadas de cambios politicos, de bibliografia publicada, de datos estadisticos a nivel nacional y datos sobre casos de dengue recopilados por el programa nacional de control de dengue en Camboya, con el fin de: (i) identificar cambios importantes en el escenario de la enfermedad; y (ii) extraer conclusiones para orientar futuras estrategias sobre vigilancia y control de la enfermedad. Informamos de que, aunque las tasas de morbilidad y mortalidad de los casos de dengue en Camboya descendieron entre 2002 y 2020, la incidencia del dengue se duplico y la edad de infeccion aumento. Las futuras politicas nacionales sobre vigilancia, prevencion y tratamiento de la enfermedad y control de vectores deberan tener en cuenta estos cambios para optimizar el control de la enfermedad.زاد معدل الإصابة بحمى الضنك على مستوى العالم بشكل كبير خلال العقود القليلة الماضية، من حوالي 500000 حالة تم الإبلاغ عنها في عام 2000 إلى ما يزيد عن 5 ملايين حالة في عام 2019. ويعزى هذا الاتجاه إلى النمو السكاني في المناطق الموبوءة، والتحضر السريع غير المخطط له، وزيادة الاتصال العالمي، وتغير المناخ الذي يمتد ليشمل النطاق الجغرافي لبعوضة Aedes spp ، إلى جانب عوامل أخرى. يعد الإبلاغ عن بيانات رصد حمى الضنك أمرًا أساسيًا لفهم حجم المشكلة، وتحديد التغييرات المهمة في واقع المرض، ووضع سياسات للإدارة الإكلينيكية، ومكافحة النواقل، وطرح اللقاح. ومع ذلك، فإن ممارسات الرصد ليست قياسية وقد يكون من الصعب تفسير البيانات خاصة في الدول ذات الدخل المنخفض والمتوسط الدخل، ذات أنظمة الرعاية الصحية المتدهورة. تم نشر أحدث بيانات الرصد الوطني لحمى الضنك في كمبوديا في عام 2010. ومنذ نشرها، شهدت البلاد تغيرات ملحوظة في السياسات الصحية، والتركيبة السكانية، والمناخ، والتوسع الحضري. إن كيفية تأثير هذه التغييرات على مكافحة حمى الضنك يظل غير معروف. نلخص في هذا المقال عقدين من التغييرات في السياسة، والأدبيات المنشورة، وإحصاءات الدولة، وبيانات حالة حمى الضنك التي جمعها برنامج مكافحة حمى الضنك الوطني في كمبوديا من أجل: (1) تحديد التغييرات المهمة في واقع المرض؛ و(2) استخلاص الدروس لتوجيه استراتيجيات رصد ومكافحة المرض في المستقبل. لقد أعلننا أنه في حين انخفضت معدلات الإصابة بالمرض ونسبة الوفيات بسبب حمى الضنك في كمبوديا بين عامي 2002 و2020، فقد تضاعف معدل الإصابة بحمى الضنك، وزاد العمر عند الإصابة. سيكون على الرصد الوطني في المستقبل، والوقاية من المرض وعلاجه، وسياسات مكافحة ناقلات الأمراض أن تأخذ في الاعتبار هذه التغييرات لتحسين مكافحة المرض.在过去的几十年里，全球登革热发病率急剧增加，从 2000 年的约 50 万例报告病例增至 2019 年的 500 多万例。出现该趋势的原因在于疾病流行区域人口增长、无规划地加快城市化进程、全球连通性增强以及气候变化导致伊蚊的地理分布范围扩大等等。报告登革热监测数据是了解问题严重程度、确定疾病情形相关重要变化以及制定临床管理、病媒控制和疫苗推广相关政策的关键。但是，监测工作无法实现标准化，且数据还有可能难以分析，特别是在医疗体系较为分散的中低收入国家。柬埔寨的最新全国登革热监测数据公布于 2010 年。自数据公布以来，该国的卫生政策、人口统计、气候和城市化方面均发生了显著变化。这些变化会对控制登革热产生何种影响仍然未知。在本文中，我们总结了 20 年来的政策变化、已发表文献、国家统计数据以及根据柬埔寨国家登革热控制计划收集的登革热病例数据，旨在：（i）确定疾病情形相关重要变化；以及（ii）汲取经验教训，为未来的监测工作和疾病控制战略提供实用信息。我们的报告指出，虽然在 2002-2020 年间，柬埔寨登革热病例的发病率和死亡率均有所下降，但登革热患病率翻了一番，且感染者的年龄范围扩大。未来的国家监测、疾病预防和治疗以及病媒控制相关政策均需考虑这些变化，以优化疾病控制。.За последние несколько десятилетий заболеваемость денге в мире резко возросла: спримерно 500000зарегистрированных случаев в2000году до более 5миллионов в2019году. Эта тенденция объясняется среди прочих факторов ростом населения на эндемичных территориях, быстрой незапланированной урбанизацией, растущей глобальной связью, атакже изменением климата, расширяющим географический ареал комара Aedesspp. Отчетность оданных эпиднадзора за денге имеет ключевое значение для понимания масштабов проблемы, выявления важных изменений в характере заболевания и разработки политики клинического лечения, борьбы с переносчиками и внедрения вакцин. Однако практика осуществления эпиднадзора не стандартизирована, и интерпретация данных может быть затруднена, особенно в странах снизким и средним уровнем доходов и фрагментированными системами здравоохранения. Последние данные эпиднадзора за денге на национальном уровне вКамбодже были опубликованы в2010году. Со времени этой публикации в стране произошли заметные изменения в политике здравоохранения, демографических характеристиках населения, климате и урбанизации. Как эти изменения повлияли на борьбу с денге, остается неизвестным. Вэтой статье подведены итоги двух десятилетий изменений в политике, опубликованной литературы, статистики по стране и данных о случаях денге, собранных в рамках национальной программы по борьбе с денге в Камбодже, чтобы: (i)выявить важные изменения в характере заболевания; и (ii)извлечь уроки для информирования будущих стратегий эпиднадзора и контроля заболевания. Впериод с2002по2020год заболеваемость и смертность от денге в Камбодже снизились, однако область распространения выросла в два раза и возраст инфицированных увеличился. Вбудущем эпиднадзор на национальном уровне, профилактика и лечение заболеваний, а также политика борьбы с переносчиками должны будут учитывать эти изменения в целях оптимизации борьбы с распространением заболеваний.

TI  - Clinical evidence of three traditional Chinese medicine drugs and three herbal formulas for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the Chinese population
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE-JIM
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide. Integrated Chinese and Western medicine have had some successes in treating COVID-19.Objective: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three traditional Chinese medicine drugs and three herbal formulas (3-drugs-3-formulas) in patients with COVID-19. Search strategy: Relevant studies were identified from 12 electronic databases searched from their establishment to April 7, 2022. Inclusion criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and cohort studies that evaluated the effects of 3-drugs-3-formulas for COVID-19. The treatment group was treated with one of the 3-drugs3-formulas plus conventional treatment. The control group was treated with conventional treatment. Data extraction and analysis: Two evaluators screened and selected literature independently, then extracted basic information and assessed risk of bias. The treatment outcome measures were duration of main symptoms, hospitalization time, aggravation rate and mortality. RevMan 5.4 was used to analyze the pooled results reported as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous data.Results: Forty-one studies with a total of 13,260 participants were identified. Our analysis suggests that compared with conventional treatment, the combination of 3-drugs-3-formulas might shorten duration of fever (MD = -1.39; 95% CI: -2.19 to -0.59; P < 0.05), cough (MD = -1.57; 95% CI: -2.16 to -0.98; P < 0.05) and fatigue (MD = -1.36; 95% CI: -2.21 to -0.51; P < 0.05), decrease length of hospital stay (MD = -2.62; 95% CI -3.52 to -1.72; P < 0.05), the time for nucleic acid conversion (MD = -2.92; 95% CI: -4.26 to -1.59; P < 0.05), aggravation rate (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.64; P < 0.05) and mortality (RR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.62; P < 0.05), and increase the recovery rate of chest computerized tomography manifestations (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.3; P < 0.05) and total effectiveness (RR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.42; P < 0.05).Conclusion: The 3-drugs-3-formulas can play an active role in treating all stages of COVID-19. No severe adverse events related to 3-drugs-3-formulas were observed. Hence, 3-drugs-3-formulas combined with conventional therapies have effective therapeutic value for COVID-19 patients. Further long-term highquality studies are essential to demonstrate the clinical benefits of each formula.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamic impacts of Lake Victoria water volume variations on sustainable economic development
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal changes in lake water resources critically affect the livelihoods and the sustainable development of the local social economy. Understanding the evolution of lake water resource and its influence on economic development is important for achieving sustainable development goals. Taking Africa's largest lake, Lake Victoria, as the study area, a framework was developed to investigate long-term (2000-2019) water volume variations and their influence on local economic sustainable development. First, an estimation model of water volume variations was constructed based on an optimized joint process of multi-mission altimetry data and water surface area calculations of multispectral images. Furthermore, based on nighttime light remote sensing data, three factors (namely economic level, growth, and inequality) were calculated and applied to quantify the sustainability of local economic development. Finally, the influence mechanism was explored using the Pearson correlation coefficient and grey-value relationship analysis. The results reveal significant interannual and seasonal variations in water volume of the Lake Victoria. Spatially, the western part of Lake Victoria experienced more frequent changes than the east. From the three economic perspectives, the spatiotemporal evolution of water volume variations strongly affected the economic level, whereas economic growth is influenced the least. Additionally, different effects were observed in the surrounding countries. The water volume variations had the greatest impact on Uganda's sustainable economic development from all three perspectives, with a significant lagged impact of three years on agricultural production. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic influence of water resources on sustainable economic development, offering a viable alternative to mass field surveys, especially relevant for developing and underdeveloped regions.

TI  - Combined Effects of Heat and Drought Stress on the Growth Process and Yield of Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) in Liaoning Province, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A method was put forward to identify the combined heat and drought (CHD) events that occurred in summer and affected spring maize in Liaoning province. The spatial and temporal characteristics of CHD and its effects on maize were evaluated based on daily meteorological data at 52 meteorological stations in Liaoning from 1961 to 2020, as well as agricultural data including details of the maize development periods. The effects of CHD on the photosynthetic capacity of maize were evaluated using SIF remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020. The differences in maize photosynthetic capacity in the summers of 2009 and 2018 were compared in detail. The results show that from 1961 to 2020, the occurrence range, frequency, and severity of summer CHD events increased in Liaoning. CHD events were more frequent in June/July, and higher-intensity CHD events were more frequent in July/August. From 1961 to 2020, CHD events occurred in 69% of the years of reduced meteorological yield, and reduced meteorological yield occurred in 41% of the years with CHD events. Maize solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an index of photosynthesis, was sensitive to temperature (negatively correlated) and precipitation (positively correlated). The CHD events slowed the increasing SIF from the three-leaf stage to the jointing stage, and they stopped the increasing SIF or decreased it at the tasseling-flowering to silking stages. Therefore, maize photosynthesis may be most sensitive to CHD during the flowering to silking stages, and CHD during the silking to milk stages may have the greatest impact on maize yield. Understanding the effects of CHD on maize growth/yield provides a scientific basis for reducing its negative impacts on maize production.

TI  - Partially Etched Piezoelectric Film Filled with SiO<sub>2</sub> Structure Applied to A1 Mode Resonators for Transverse Modes Suppression
T2  - MICROMACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the arrival of the Fifth Generation (5G) communication era, there has been an urgent demand for acoustic filters with a high frequency and ultrawide bandwidth used in radio-frequency (RF) front-ends filtering and signal processing. First-order antisymmetric (A1) lamb mode resonators based on LiNbO3 film have attracted wide attention due to their scalable, high operating frequency and large electromechanical coupling coefficients (K-2), making them promising candidates for sub-6 GHz wideband filters. However, A1 mode resonators suffer from the occurrence of transverse modes, which should be addressed to make these devices suitable for applications. In this work, theoretical analysis is performed by finite element method (FEM), and the admittance characteristics of an A1 mode resonator and displacement of transverse modes near the resonant frequency (f(r)) are investigated. We propose a novel Dielectric-Embedded Piston Mode (DEPM) structure, achieved by partially etching a piezoelectric film filled with SiO2, which can almost suppress the transverse modes between the resonant frequency (f(r)) and anti-resonant frequency (f(a)) when applied on ZY-cut LiNbO3-based A1 mode resonators. This indicates that compared with Broadband Piston Mode (BPM), Filled-broadband Piston Mode (FPM) and standard structures, the DEPM structure is superior. Furthermore, the design parameters of the resonator are optimized by adjusting the width, depth and filled materials in the etched window of the DEPM structure to obtain a better suppression of transverse modes. The optimized A1 mode resonator using a DEPM structure exhibits a transverse-free response with a high f(r) of 3.22 GHz and a large K-2 of similar to 30%, which promotes the application of A1 mode devices for use in 5G RF front-ends.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Aerosol Optical Depth and the Spatial Heterogeneity Relationship of Potential Factors Based on the Multi-Scale Geographically Weighted Regression Model in Chinese National-Level Urban Agglomerations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its driving factors is essential for assessing atmospheric environmental quality and alleviating air pollution. Based on a 22-year high-resolution AOD dataset, the spatiotemporal variations of AOD in mainland China and ten national urban agglomerations were explored based on the Mann-Kendall trend test and Theil-Sen median method. Random forest (RF) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) were combined to identify the main driving factors of AOD in urban agglomerations and to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of influencing factors. The results showed that areas with high annual average AOD concentrations were mainly concentrated in the Chengdu-Chongqing, Central Plains, Shandong Peninsula, and Middle Yangtze River urban agglomerations. Southern Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding areas revealed the highest AOD pollution during summer, whereas the worst pollution during the remaining three seasons occurred in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. Temporally, except for the Ha-Chang and Mid-Southern Liaoning urban agglomerations, where the average annual AOD increased, the other urban agglomerations showed a decreasing trend. Among them, the Central Plains, Middle Yangtze River, Guanzhong Plain, and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations all exhibited a decline greater than 20%. According to the spatial trends, most urban agglomerations encompassed much larger areas of decreasing AOD values than areas of increasing AOD values, indicating that the air quality in most areas has recently improved. RF analysis revealed that PM2.5 was the dominant factor in most urban clusters, followed by meteorological factors. MGWR results show that the influencing factors have different spatial scale effects on AOD in urban agglomerations. The socioeconomic factors and PM2.5 showed strong spatial non-stationarity with regard to the spatial distribution of AOD. This study can provide a comprehensive understanding of AOD differences among urban agglomerations, and it has important theoretical and practical implications for improving the ecological environment and promoting sustainable development.

AB  - Significance Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions represented by carbon dioxide and methane are an important driving force of global warming in the last century. The key to controlling global warming is to control greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas. Research and development of scientific carbon dioxide emission monitoring technology and scientific identification of regional carbon dioxide emission and absorption are of great significance to serving our country's carbon emission policies at different stages.Progress Traditional inventory methods calculate the total carbon emissions by counting the energy consumed by each emission source. Since statistics and emission factors cannot be updated quickly, it is difficult for these methods to capture the dynamic changes in emission sources. Flux data based on concentration measurement is updated frequently, and the measurement data is objective, which can provide a more accurate basis for greenhouse gas emissions and traceability. In recent decades, various methods have been proposed to measure fluxes based on concentration measurement. The measurement methods for the terrestrial biosphere flux include the chamber method, micrometeorology method, equilibrium boundary layer concepts, and inverse system for space-borne platforms. The measurement methods for the point sources flux contain the inverse diffusion technology represented by the Gaussian plume model, source pixel method, cross-sectional flux method, integrated mass enhancement method, Gaussian vector integral method, and horizontal net flux measurement method.The ground-based in-situ measurement technology represented by the flux tower features high measurement accuracy and strong time continuity and plays a vital role in the flux detection of forests, farmland, and other earth ecosystems. However, since the measurement area of the flux tower usually does not exceed 1 km(2), it is difficult to quantitatively understand the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases on a global scale due to the sparseness of the sites and limited representation distance.Satellite remote sensing data can obtain the global spatial distribution and changes of greenhouse gases with fast inversion speed, which can make up for the shortage of ground base stations. At present, satellite remote sensing can detect greenhouse gas emissions from the earth's ecosystems and point sources. Many countries and teams have inverted the greenhouse gas fluxes of global ecosystems based on satellite remote sensing. In 2021, the Chinese Institute estimated the global CO2 flux distribution based on the TanSat satellite, and the results are in good agreement with other satellites such as Japan's GOSAT and the US's OCO-2. There are also a number of studies that capture CO2 fluxes from terrestrial power plants through satellite measurements. However, satellite remote sensing still has many limitations in accuracy, resolution, and data coverage. The atmospheric chemical transport model can simulate the three-dimensional gas concentration field of the atmosphere, but due to the incomplete transport model and meteorological field, and uncertain initial field and emission sources, the obtained three-dimensional distribution of gas concentration deviates from the actual situation, and it needs to be combined with the actual situation. The observed data is further corrected to improve accuracy.Lidar technology is characterized by long detection distance, high spatial-temporal resolution, and all-day detection. Active remote sensing is an important direction for the development of satellite remote sensing. However, current satellite active remote sensing is mainly based on the path integration technology IPDA and can only obtain the concentration of the entire atmospheric column, thus making it difficult to accurately invert the vertical distribution of point source emissions and affecting the inversion effect of point source emission flux. The ground-based differential absorption lidar DIAL can obtain distance-resolved gas concentration distribution and simultaneously detect atmospheric wind field data with high precision. Although its coverage is not as good as that of satellites, it is wider than that of a single station. It is an effective means for local area gas flux monitoring.Conclusions and Prospects Although the measurement methods of greenhouse gas fluxes are becoming increasingly more abundant, the spatial-temporal resolution, data coverage, and measurement accuracy of the existing methods for the concentration distribution and emission flux of greenhouse gases are still very limited. In the future, greenhouse gas flux measurement technology can be further developed in several directions. Measurement data from satellites, and ground-based and airborne platforms is assimilated to obtain higher-precision three-dimensional distribution of greenhouse gas fluxes, the mechanism of greenhouse gas sources and sinks is analyzed, and natural and anthropogenic carbon emissions are identified. In addition, we develop a greenhouse gas assimilation forecast system and build accurate greenhouse gas source-sink models and inversion models at different scales. As a result, global high spatial-temporal resolution remote sensing is realized through satellite networking to form a global quality-uniform and continuous greenhouse gas observation dataset, and observe the greenhouse gas concentration and spatial-temporal changes of sources and sinks in an all-round way. Collaborative monitoring technologies for greenhouse gases and pollutants are also developed.

TI  - Using Machine-Learning Algorithms to Predict Soil Organic Carbon Content from Combined Remote Sensing Imagery and Laboratory Vis-NIR Spectral Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatial and temporal variability in soil organic carbon (SOC) content helps simultaneously assess soil fertility and several parameters that are strongly associated with it, such as structural stability, nutrient cycling, biological activity, and soil aeration. Therefore, it appears necessary to monitor SOC regularly and investigate rapid, non-destructive, and cost-effective approaches for doing so, such as proximal and remote sensing. To increase the accuracy of predictions of SOC content, this study evaluated combining remote sensing time series with laboratory spectral measurements using machine and deep-learning algorithms. Partial least squares (PLS) regression, random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN) models were developed using Sentinel-2 (S2) time series of 58 sampling points of bare soil and according to three approaches. In the first approach, only S2 bands were used to calibrate and compare the performance of the models. In the second, S2 indices, Sentinel-1 (S1) indices, and S1 soil moisture were added separately during model calibration to evaluate their effects individually and then together. In the third, we added the laboratory indices incrementally and tested their influence on model accuracy. Using only S2 bands, the DNN model outperformed the PLS and RF models (ratio of performance to the interquartile distance RPIQ = 0.79, 1.36 and 1.67, respectively). Additional information improved performances only for model calibration, with S1 soil moisture yielding the most stable improvement among three iterations. Including equivalent indices of the S2 indices calculated using soil spectra obtained under laboratory conditions improved prediction of SOC, and the use of only two indices achieved good validation performances for the RF and DNN models (mean RPIQ = 2.01 and 1.77, respectively).

TI  - Changes in vegetation greenness related to climatic and non-climatic factors in the Sudano-Sahelian region
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential drivers of vegetation changes in the Sudano-Sahelian region of Africa remain poorly understood due to complex interactions between climatic and anthropogenic processes. In this study, we analyzed the vegetation greenness trends in relation to rainfall variability that we considered the essence of climatic effects on vegetation in a well-known water-limited environment by using time series of satellite data in the Sudano-Sahelian region during 2001-2020. We quantified in more detail the relative contributions of rainfall variability (climatic factor), land use/land cover (LULC) change, and fire occurrence change (non-climatic factors) to vegetation greenness trends in selected sub-regions. The results showed that vegetation greening was widespread (26.9% of the total study area), while vegetation browning was more clustered in central West Africa (5% of the total study area). About half of the vegetation greening area can be explained by long-term rainfall variability during 2001-2020, but most of the area characterized by a browning trend was unrelated to rainfall variability. An analysis of the relative importance showed that LULC changes had significant local effects on vegetation greenness and that these changes were characterized by a strong spatial heterogeneity in specific sub-regions. Gains in cropland and natural vegetation related to positive land management were probably the dominant drivers of greening in Senegal and Ethiopia. Also, the combined impacts of rainfall variability and LULC changes contributed to greening trends in the arid zone, particularly in Mali and Sudan. In contrast, vegetation browning in central West Africa appeared to be driven by cropland gain and natural vegetation loss associated with extensive agricultural production activities. Furthermore, we found that repeated fires for agricultural expansion in central West Africa intensified vegetation browning. These results advanced our understanding of vegetation dynamics in response to climatic and non-climatic factors in Sudano-Sahelian drylands characterized by increasing pressures on land resources.

TI  - Phenology-assisted supervised paddy rice mapping with the Landsat imagery on Google Earth Engine: Experiments in Heilongjiang Province of China from 1990 to 2020
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial distribution maps of paddy rice played crucial roles in food security and market stability. Decades-spanning Landsat images were useful for long-term paddy rice mapping. However, it still remained challenging to achieve consistent paddy rice mapping using the Landsat series images due to many factors such as sparse observations, frequent weather contamination, and shortage of training samples. To address these challenges, this study proposed a flexible Phenology-assisted Supervised Paddy Rice (PSPR) mapping framework on Google Earth Engine (GEE). This was achieved by utilizing the automation of the phenological methods, training data generation and purification, and the all-season classification capacity of the machine learning methods. We demonstrated the method by generating high-resolution 30-m paddy rice maps of Heilongjiang Province of China from 1990 to 2020. The derived rice maps were validated using abundant reference samples, four existing paddy rice products, and available agricultural statistics. The result showed that improved performance was verified in comparison to previous studies and a high linear relationship was observed with an average R2 of 0.993. Based on the spatiotemporal analysis, it was discovered that the rice planting in Heilongjiang has significantly shifted northward in the last three decades and this northward shift surprisingly appeared earlier than the previous studies, which was to our best knowledge first to be revealed in related studies. The multi-year dataset is useful for rice monitoring, water management, and policy making. All data and codes used in this study can be accessed on GitHub (https://github.com/MKGenesis/PSPR-rice-HLJ).

TI  - Glacier Change in the West Kunlun Main Peak Area from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change, and investigation of their dynamics is crucial for ensuring regional ecological security as well as disaster prevention and mitigation measures. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery, the outlines and length of glaciers in the West Kunlun Main Peak Area (WKMPA) during 2000-2020 were obtained by combining a band ratio method with manual interpretation and an automatic extraction method for the glacier centerline, respectively. There were 440 glaciers in the WKMPA in 2020, covering an area of 2964.59 & PLUSMN; 54.87 km2, with an average length of 2916 & PLUSMN; 60 m. The glacier count increased due to division, while the area and length all exhibited a declining trend from 2000 to 2020, at rates of -0.04%& BULL;a-1 (24.83 km2) and -0.11%& BULL;a-1 (66 m), respectively. Glacier retreat was primarily observed during the early period (2000-2005). Except for glaciers located above an elevation of 6250 m, the glacier area decreased with each altitude interval from 2000 to 2020, and the rate of relative change in glacier area generally decreased with increasing altitude. Moreover, except for a slight increase in north-facing glaciers, the area of glaciers facing other orientations decreased during 2000-2020. The accuracy of the empirical formula fit for glacier length was highly dependent on glacier class, with greater precision observed for smaller glaciers and lower precision for larger valley-basin glaciers due to their complex morphological structures being neglected and only a single quantitative relationship being considered. There was a time lag of 12 years between temperature changes and glacier area response in this region. The mechanism by which glacier division affects glacier change is complex, requiring dissection of multiple factors such as area, length, and terminal elevation before and after division.

TI  - Using Time Series Sentinel Images for Object-Oriented Crop Extraction of Planting Structure in the Google Earth Engine
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate extraction of crop planting structure information is of great importance for food security and sustainable agricultural development. However, long time series data with high spatial resolution have a much larger data volume, which seriously limits the quality and efficiency of the application of remote sensing to agriculture in complex crop rotation areas. To address this problem, this paper takes Lujiang County, a typical complex crop rotation region in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China as an example, and proposes utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to extract the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Yellowness Index (NDYI) and Vertical-Horizontal Polarization (VH) time series sets of the whole planting year, and combining the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) multi-scale segmentation with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to realize the fast and high-quality planting information of the main crop rotation patterns in the complex rotation region. The results show that by combining time series and object-oriented methods, SVM leads to better improvement than RF, with its overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient increasing by 4.44% and 0.0612, respectively, but RF is more suitable for extracting the planting structure in complex crop rotation areas. The RF algorithm combined with time series object-oriented extraction (OB + T + RF) achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 98.93% and 0.9854, respectively. When compared to the pixel-oriented approach combined with the Support Vector Machine algorithm based on multi-temporal data (PB + M + SVM), the proposed method effectively reduces the presence of salt-and-pepper noise in the results, resulting in an improvement of 6.14% in overall accuracy and 0.0846 in Kappa coefficient. The research results can provide a new idea and a reliable reference method for obtaining crop planting structure information efficiently and accurately in complex crop rotation areas.

TI  - Forest Fire Driving Factors and Fire Risk Zoning Based on an Optimal Parameter Logistic Regression Model: A Case Study of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, China
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Planning the analyses of the spatial distribution and driving factors of forest fires and regionalizing fire risks is an important part of forest fire management. Based on the Landsat-8 active fire dataset of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture from 2014 to 2021, this paper proposes an optimal parameter logistic regression (OPLR) model, conducts forest fire risk zoning research under the optimal spatial analysis scale and model parameters, and establishes a forest fire risk prediction model. The results showed that the spatial unit of the optimal spatial analysis scale in the study area was 5 km and that the prediction accuracy of the OPLR was about 81%. The climate was the main driving factor of forest fires, while temperature had the greatest influence on the probability of forest fires. According to the forest fire prediction model, mapping the fire risk zoning, in which the medium- and high-risk area was 6021.13 km2, accounted for 9.99% of the study area. The results contribute to a better understanding of forest fire management based on the local environmental characteristics of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and provide a reference for related forest fire prevention and control management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Information Mining for Emergency Response of Urban Flood Based on Social Media and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergency response is crucial in preventing and mitigating urban floods. Both remote sensing and social media data offer distinct advantages in large-scale flood monitoring and near-real-time flood monitoring. However, current research lacks a thorough exploration of the application of social media data and remote sensing imagery in the urban flood emergency response. To address this issue, this paper, while extracting disaster information based on social media data, deeply mines the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and dynamic spatial accessibility of rescue points. Furthermore, SAR imagery and social media data for monitoring urban flooding are compared. This study took the Zhengzhou 7.20 urban flood as a case study and created a methodological framework to quickly extract flood disaster information (flood, landslide, and rescue points) using these two types of data; spatiotemporal analysis and random forest classification were also conducted to mine valuable information. Temporally, the study revealed that disaster information did not increase proportionally with the amount of rainfall during the rainfall process. Spatially, specific regions with higher susceptibility to flooding, landslides, and rescue points were identified, such as the central region characterized by low drainage standards and high-density urban areas, as well as the eastern region with low-lying terrain. Moreover, this study examined the spatial accessibility of rescue resources in real flood scenarios and found that their service coverage varied throughout the day during and after the disaster. In addition, social media excelled in high-density urban areas' flood point extraction, while SAR performed better in monitoring floods at the edges of low-density urban areas and large water bodies, allowing them to complement each other, to a certain extent. The findings of this study provide scientific reference value for the optimal selection of rescue paths and the allocation of resources in the emergency response to urban floods caused by extreme rainstorms.

TI  - Monitoring Waterlogging Damage of Winter Wheat Based on HYDRUS-1D and WOFOST Coupled Model and Assimilated Soil Moisture Data of Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterlogging harms winter wheat growth. To enable accurate monitoring of agricultural waterlogging, this paper conducts a winter wheat waterlogging monitoring study using multi-source data in Guzhen County, Anhui Province, China. The hydrological model HYDRUS-1D is coupled with the crop growth model WOFOST, and the Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to assimilate Sentinel-1 inversion soil moisture data. According to the precision and continuity of soil moisture, the damage of winter wheat waterlogging were obtained. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the soil moisture is improved after data assimilation compared with that before data assimilation, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of the simulated soil moisture values at three monitoring sites increased from 0.528, 0.541 and 0.575 to 0.752, 0.692 and 0.731, respectively. A new waterlogging identification criterion has been proposed based on the growth periods and probability distribution of soil moisture. The proportion, calculated from this identification criterion, of the waterlogging wheat farmland in total farmland shows a high correlation with the yield reduction rate. The correlation coefficient of the waterlogging farmland proportion and the yield reduction rate in 11 towns of Guzhen County reaches 0.78. Through the synchronization of geography, agriculture and meteorology, the framework shows great potential in waterlogging monitoring.

TI  - Multi-Factor Collaborative Analysis of Conservation Effectiveness of Nature Reserves Based on Remote Sensing Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play a crucial role in safeguarding biological resources and preserving ecosystems. However, the lack of standardized and highly operational criteria for evaluating their conservation effectiveness, particularly across different ecological types, remains a significant gap in the literature. This study aims to address this gap by constructing a conservation effectiveness evaluation model for two distinct types of PAs in Heilongjiang Province, China: the Zhalong National Nature Reserve (ZlNNR), a wetland ecological reserve; and the Mudanfeng National Nature Reserve (MdfNNR), a forest ecological reserve. We employed various methods, including land use dynamic index, visual analysis of landscape patterns, remote sensing inversion, and a multi-factor comprehensive assessment model, to assess changes in conservation effectiveness from 2000 to 2020. Our findings reveal a contrast between the two PAs. In the ZlNNR, croplands and water bodies increased significantly by 4069.4 ha (K = 1.5820%) and 2541.58 ha (K = 3.2692%). In the MdfNNR, impervious lands increased greatly by 65.35 ha (K = 7.4021%), whereas forest lands decreased by 125 ha (K = -0.067%). The core area of the two PAs displayed increased landscape regularity, whereas the experimental area showed heightened landscape diversity. In ZlNNR, the MPSL value increased by 134.91%, whereas the PDL value decreased by 57.43%, indicating a more regular landscape pattern. In MdfNNR, the SHDIL value decreased by 110.7%, whereas the PDL value increased by 52.55%, indicating a more fragmented landscape pattern. The area with improved vegetation trends in ZlNNR was 8.59% larger than in MdfNNR, whereas the area with degraded vegetation trends was 4.86% smaller than in MdfNNR. In all years, the high effectiveness area was larger in ZlNNR than in MdfNNR, whereas the medium and low effectiveness areas were smaller in ZlNNR compared to MdfNNR. This study provides a scientifically rigorous assessment method for evaluating the conservation effectiveness of different types of PAs, laying a solid theoretical foundation and practical guidance for future conservation strategies.

TI  - CD-MQANet: Enhancing Multi-Objective Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images through Channel Creation and Dual-Path Encoding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a crucial computer vision task, multi-objective semantic segmentation has attracted widespread attention and research in the field of remote sensing image analysis. This technology has important application value in fields such as land resource surveys, global change monitoring, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, multi-target semantic segmentation of remote sensing images faces challenges such as complex surface features, complex spectral features, and a wide spatial range, resulting in differences in spatial and spectral dimensions among target features. To fully exploit and utilize spectral feature information, focusing on the information contained in spatial and spectral dimensions of multi-spectral images, and integrating external information, this paper constructs the CD-MQANet network structure, where C represents the Channel Creator module and D represents the Dual-Path Encoder. The Channel Creator module (CCM) mainly includes two parts: a generator block and a spectral attention module. The generator block aims to generate spectral channels that can expand different ground target types, while the spectral attention module can enhance useful spectral information. Dual-Path Encoders include channel encoders and spatial encoders, intended to fully utilize spectrally enhanced images while maintaining the spatial information of the original feature map. The decoder of CD-MQANet is a multitasking decoder composed of four types of attention, enhancing decoding capabilities. The loss function used in the CD-MQANet consists of three parts, which are generated by the intermediate results of the CCM, the intermediate results of the decoder, and the final segmentation results and label calculation. We performed experiments on the Potsdam dataset and the Vaihingen dataset. Compared to the baseline MQANet model, the CD-MQANet network improved mean F1 and OA by 2.03% and 2.49%, respectively, on the Potsdam dataset, and improved mean F1 and OA by 1.42% and 1.25%, respectively, on the Vaihingen dataset. The effectiveness of CD-MQANet was also proven by comparative experiments with other studies. We also conducted a thermographic analysis of the attention mechanism used in CD-MQANet and analyzed the intermediate results generated by CCM and LAM. Both modules generated intermediate results that had a significant positive impact on segmentation.

TI  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence captures photosynthetic phenology better than traditional vegetation indices
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of plant phenology is of great importance for monitoring global carbon, water, and energy cycling. Remotely sensed satellite observations have been widely used to estimate land surface phenology across multiple spatial scales in the last three decades. Recent development on satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations have opened an opportunity to monitor the seasonality of plant growth from the perspective of photosynthesis phenology. The SIF observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with high spatial resolution (up to 7 km x 3.5 km pixels) and near-daily global coverage provide unprecedented opportunity to observe photosynthetic and land surface phenology from space. However, the performance of TROPOMI SIF-derived phenology has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we used flux tower gross primary productivity (GPP) and PhenoCam green chromatic coordinate (Gcc) data as the benchmark to verify phenology metrics derived from satellite observations. The phenology metrics including the start (SOS), end (EOS), length of growing season (LOS), and the peak of growing season (POS) were estimated from TROPOMI SIF, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), near infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and Global Vegetation Phenology product (MCD12Q2), and the latter four were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) across six vegetation types over North America during the period of 2018-2020. We found that the overall agreements of SIF (R2 ranging from 0.30 to 0.63) against GPP-estimated phenology were stronger than NDVI (0.17-0.41), EVI (0.19-0.39), NIRv (0.23-0.62), and MCD12Q2 (0.19-0.48) derived phenological events. In reference to GPP and Gcc-estimated phenology, SIF also generally has the least error and bias compared to other satellite remote sensing-derived phenology metrics. No significant differences were found between SIF and GPP-derived phenology (P>0.05, two-tailed t-test). In addition, we found that the spatial distribution of SIF-derived phenology reflected the expected latitudinal patterns in phenology dates. SOS, EOS, LOS, and POS observed by MCD12Q2 appeared to be earlier, later, longer, and earlier than TROPOMI SIF-derived phenology, respectively. SIF-based phenological transition dates more closely tracked GPP-based phenology dates, indicating TROPOMI SIF could be a great measure to track photosynthesis seasonality and land surface phenology.

TI  - Efficient Wheat Lodging Detection Using UAV Remote Sensing Images and an Innovative Multi-Branch Classification Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat lodging has a significant impact on yields and quality, necessitating the accurate acquisition of lodging information for effective disaster assessment and damage evaluation. This study presents a novel approach for wheat lodging detection in large and heterogeneous fields using UAV remote sensing images. A comprehensive dataset spanning an area of 2.3117 km2 was meticulously collected and labeled, constituting a valuable resource for this study. Through a comprehensive comparison of algorithmic models, remote sensing data types, and model frameworks, this study demonstrates that the Deeplabv3+ model outperforms various other models, including U-net, Bisenetv2, FastSCN, RTFormer, Bisenetv2, and HRNet, achieving a noteworthy F1 score of 90.22% for detecting wheat lodging. Intriguingly, by leveraging RGB image data alone, the current model achieves high-accuracy rates in wheat lodging detection compared to models trained with multispectral datasets at the same resolution. Moreover, we introduce an innovative multi-branch binary classification framework that surpasses the traditional single-branch multi-classification framework. The proposed framework yielded an outstanding F1 score of 90.30% for detecting wheat lodging and an accuracy of 86.94% for area extraction of wheat lodging, surpassing the single-branch multi-classification framework by an improvement of 7.22%. Significantly, the present comprehensive experimental results showcase the capacity of UAVs and deep learning to detect wheat lodging in expansive areas, demonstrating high efficiency and cost-effectiveness under heterogeneous field conditions. This study offers valuable insights for leveraging UAV remote sensing technology to identify post-disaster damage areas and assess the extent of the damage.

TI  - Infrared Dim Star Background Suppression Method Based on Recursive Moving Target Indication
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based infrared target detection can provide full-time and full-weather observation of targets, thus it is of significance in space security. However, the presence of stars in the background can severely affect the accuracy and real-time performance of infrared dim and small target detection, making star suppression a key technology and hot spot in the field of space target detection. The existing star suppression algorithms are all oriented towards the detection before track method and rely on the single image properties of the stars. They can only effectively suppress bright stars with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this problem, we propose a new method for infrared dim star background suppression based on recursive moving target indication (RMTI). Our proposed method is based on a more direct analysis of the image sequence itself, which will lead to more robust and accurate background suppression. The method first obtains the motion information of stars through satellite motion or key star registration. Then, the advanced RMTI algorithm is used to enhance the stars in the image. Finally, the mask of suppressing stars is generated by an accumulation frame adaptive threshold. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a less than 8.73% leakage suppression rate for stars with an SNR & LE; 2 and a false suppression rate of less than 2.3%. The validity of the proposed method is verified in real data. Compared with the existing methods, the method proposed in this paper can stably suppress stars with a lower SNR.

TI  - The divergence of energy- and water-balance evapotranspiration estimates in humid regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) calculated as the residual of catchment water balance (ETWB) has often been used as a benchmark to evaluate satellite-based ET retrievals that use the energy-balance approach (ETEB). However, errors from water balance components will accrue in ETWB, leading to considerable disparities with ETEB. In this study, we set out to investigate whether ETEB from multiple sources (MOD16, GLEAM, PT-JPL, and PT-hybrid) can capture the spatiotemporal variability of ETWB across 53 catchments in central-western Europe with a humid climate. Using ET retrievals from the Budyko framework that accounts for the control of energy demand on water supply and upscaled ET from FLUXCOM as references, we explored the causes of discrepancies between ETWB and ETEB at long-term, annual, and monthly scales. We found that (1) ETEB significantly diverged from ETWB at the mean annual scale (r = 0.35), particularly for energy-limited catchments, but Budyko-simulated ET considering energy limit correlated well with ETEB (r > 0.86); (2) neither ETEB nor upscaled ET can reproduce annual ETWB time series (r < 0.40), and the closure errors in water budgets closely follow excess precipitation beyond energy demand; (3) monthly ETWB exhibited better correspondences with ETEB (r = 0.73), presumably because of similarity in seasonal patterns. Our results demonstrate that errors from precipitation and terrestrial water storage anomalies introduce large uncertainties in ETWB, thereby complicating water balance validation in humid regions across multiple timesteps. To improve the application of ETWB for benchmarking ETEB in humid regions, high-quality input data should be used or - like the Budyko framework - energy constraints should be considered.

TI  - Deep Spatial Prediction via Heterogeneous Multi-source Self-supervision
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SPATIAL ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial prediction is to predict the values of the targeted variable, such as PM2.5 values and temperature, at arbitrary locations based on the collected geospatial data. It greatly affects the key research topics in geoscience in terms of obtaining heterogeneous spatial information (e.g., soil conditions, precipitation rates, wheat yields) for geographic modeling and decision-making at local, regional, and global scales. In situ data, collected by ground-level in situ sensors, and remote sensing data, collected by satellite or aircraft, are two important data sources for this task. In situ data are relatively accurate while sparse and unevenly distributed. Remote sensing data cover large spatial areas, but are coarse with low spatiotemporal resolution and prone to interference. How to synergize the complementary strength of these two data types is still a grand challenge. Moreover, it is difficult to model the unknown spatial predictive mapping while handling the tradeoff between spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity. Third, representing spatial relations without substantial information loss is also a critical issue. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Self-supervised Spatial Prediction (HSSP) framework that synergizes multi-source data by minimizing the inconsistency between in situ and remote sensing observations. We propose a new deep geometric spatial interpolation model as the prediction backbone that automatically interpolates the values of the targeted variable at unknown locations based on existing observations by taking into account both distance and orientation information. Our proposed interpolator is proven to both be the general form of popular interpolation methods and preserve spatial information. The spatial prediction is enhanced by a novel error-compensation framework to capture the prediction inconsistency due to spatial heterogeneity. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets and demonstrated our model's superiority in performance over state-of-the-art models.

TI  - Total-variation regularized U-Net for wildfire burned area mapping based on Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR backscattering data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is able to detect burned areas, serving as a key data source for monitoring active wildfires in situations where optical sensors are hindered by dense smoke or cloud cover. Radar remote sensing provides rich and useful data on historical burned areas, which are critical for large-scale wildfire burned area mapping. This study aims to unveil the potential inherent in Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data and to investigate the impact of reference masks on wildfire burned area mapping. SAR images frequently exhibit disruptive speckle noise, which manifests as isolated pixels or small regions, thereby hindering the seamless identification of burned areas through SAR data. To mitigate noise and enhance the connectivity of SAR-based burned area delineation, we propose a novel approach: a Total-Variation (TV) regularized U-Net model, tailored to learn from noisy pseudo masks derived from Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR backscattering data. To validate its efficacy, we assembled a dataset encompassing 16 geographically diverse wildfire events, incorporating SAR-based kMap, a SAR-based binary label (designated as SARREF), and an optical-based binary label (referred to as OptREF). The kMap, serving as a relative indicator of SAR backscattering change, is defined as the divergence between post-fire SAR backscattering and the temporal average, normalized by the temporal standard deviation of pre-fire SAR time series. Utilizing SAR-based kMap as input and SARREF or OptREF as labels, we systematically explored the impact of TV regularization on SAR-based burned area mapping. Our experimental findings highlight several key insights: 1) Vanilla U-Net considerably elevates the F1 score from 0.61 to 0.66 when compared to threshold-based approaches; 2) The TV -regularized U-Net exhibits a notable capacity for enhancing both accuracy and the connectivity of SAR-based burned areas. When trained with noisy SARREF, it achieves a substantial F1 score of 0.69 and an IoU score of 0.53. 3) In scenarios involving OptREF, the vanilla U-Net attains peak performance with the highest F1 (0.75) and IoU (0.61) scores, with the expected outcome of TV regularization yielding no additional enhancement.

TI  - Impacts of abiotic and biotic factors on tundra productivity near Utqiagvik, Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earlier snowmelt, warmer temperatures and herbivory are among the factors that influence high-latitude tundra productivity near the town of Utqiagvik in northern Alaska. However, our understanding of the potential interactions between these factors is limited. MODIS observations provide cover fractions of vegetation, snow, standing water, and soil, and fractional absorption of photosynthetically active radiation by canopy chlorophyll (fAPARchl) per pixel. Here, we evaluated a recent time-period (2001-2014) that the tundra experienced large interannual variability in vegetation productivity metrics (i.e. fAPARchl and APARchl), which was explainable by both abiotic and biotic factors. We found earlier snowmelt to increase soil and vegetation cover, and productivity in June, while warmer temperatures significantly increased monthly productivity. However, abiotic factors failed to explain stark decreases in productivity during August of 2008, which coincided with a severe lemming outbreak. MODIS observations found this tundra ecosystem to completely recover two years later, resulting in elevated productivity. This study highlights the potential roles of both climate and herbivory in modulating the interannual variability of remotely retrieved plant productivity metrics in Arctic coastal tundra ecosystems.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation of Critical Relative Humidity Based on Multiple Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds remain an important source of uncertainty in climate simulations, in large part because subgrid processes are not well represented. Critical relative humidity (RHc) is an important metric for subgrid-scale variability in humidity in cloud parameterization. Based on CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite data, we explored the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of RHc, assessed the ability of ERA-5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis and CMIP-6 climate models to characterise humidity subgrid variability and further explored the influence of meteorological factors and aerosols. The statistical results showed that there was significant variation in the spatial distribution of RHc, with large variations in both latitude and altitude, as well as more pronounced monthly variations, and that there were differences in monthly variations between regions. Both the reanalysis data and the climate models were able to reproduce similar spatial and temporal distribution patterns but differed significantly in their specific values. The temporal correlations with satellite observations were also relatively poor. In addition, aerosols and meteorological conditions affected the distribution of RHc by influencing the cloud fraction at a certain relative humidity level, indicating that their influence needs to be considered in future parameterization schemes.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph-Based Research on Agro-Meteorological Disaster Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there is a wealth of data and expert knowledge available on monitoring agro-meteorological disasters. However, there is still a lack of technical means to organically integrate and analyze heterogeneous data sources in a collaborative manner. This paper proposes a method for monitoring agro-meteorological disasters based on a spatio-temporal knowledge graph. It employs a semantic ontology framework to achieve the organic fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data, including remote sensing data, meteorological data, farmland data, crop information, etc. And it formalizes expert knowledge and computational models into knowledge inference rules, thereby enabling monitoring, early warning, and disaster analysis of agricultural crops within the observed area. The experimental area for this research is the wheat planting region in three counties in Henan Province. The method is tested using simulation monitoring, early warning, and impact calculation of the past two occurrences of dry hot wind disasters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide more specific and accurate warning information and post-disaster analysis results compared to raw records. The statistical results of NDVI decline also validate the correlation between the severity of wheat damage caused by dry hot winds and the intensity and duration of their occurrences. Regarding remote sensing data, this paper proposes a method that directly incorporates remote sensing data into spatio-temporal knowledge inference calculations. By integrating remote sensing data into the regular monitoring process, the advantages of remote sensing data granted by continuous observation are utilized. This approach represents a beneficial attempt to organically integrate remote sensing and meteorological data for monitoring, early warning, and evaluation analysis of agro-meteorological disasters.

TI  - Aircraft Detection from Low SCNR SAR Imagery Using Coherent Scattering Enhancement and Fused Attention Pyramid
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, methods based on deep learning have been applied to target detection using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, due to the SAR imaging mechanism and low signal-clutter-noise-ratio (SCNR), it is still a challenging task to perform aircraft detection using SAR imagery. To address this issue, a novel aircraft detection method is proposed for low SCNR SAR images that is based on coherent scattering enhancement and a fusion attention mechanism. Considering the scattering characteristics discrepancy between human-made targets and natural background, a coherent scattering enhancement technique is introduced to heighten the aircraft scatter information and suppress the clutter and speckle noise. This is beneficial for the later ability of the deep neural network to extract accurate and discriminative semantic information about the aircraft. Further, an improved Faster R-CNN is developed with a novel pyramid network constructed by fusing local and contextual attention. The local attention adaptively highlights the significant objects by enhancing their distinguishable features, and the contextual attention facilitates the network to extract distinct contextual information of the image. Fusing the local and contextual attention can guarantee that the aircraft is detected as completely as possible. Extensive experiments are performed on TerraSAR-X SAR datasets for benchmark comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aircraft detection approach could achieve up to 91.7% of average precision in low SCNR, showing effectiveness and superiority over a number of benchmarks.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Ecosystem Status in China's National Key Ecological Function Zones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Key Ecological Function Zones (NKEFZ) serve as crucial ecological security barriers in China, playing a vital role in enhancing ecosystem services. This study employed the theoretical framework of ecological benefits assessment in major ecological engineering projects. The primary focus was on the ecosystem macrostructure, ecosystem quality, and key ecosystem services, enabling quantitative analysis of the spatiotemporal changes in the ecosystem status of the NKEFZ from 2000 to 2019. To achieve this, remote sensing data, meteorological data, and model simulations were employed to investigate five indicators, including land use types, vegetation coverage, net primary productivity of vegetation, soil conservation services, water conservation services, and windbreak and sand fixation services. The analysis incorporated the Theil-Sen Median method to construct an evaluation system for assessing the restoration status of ecosystems, effectively integrating ecosystem quality and ecosystem services indicators. The research findings indicated that land use changes in NKEFZ were primarily characterized by the expansion of unused land and the in of grassland. The overall ecosystem quality of these zones improved, showing a stable and increasing trend. However, there were disparities in the changes related to ecosystem services. Water conservation services exhibited a decreasing trend, while soil conservation and windbreak and sand fixation services showed a steady improvement. The ecosystem of the NKEFZ, in general, displayed a stable and recovering trend. However, significant spatial heterogeneity existed, particularly in the southern region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and at the border areas between western Sichuan and northern Yunnan, where some areas still experienced deteriorating ecosystem conditions. Compared to other functional zones, the trend in the ecosystem of the NKEFZ might not have been the most favorable. Nonetheless, this could be attributed to the fact that most of these areas were situated in environmentally fragile regions, and conservation measures may not have been as effective as in other functional zones. These findings highlighted the considerable challenges ahead in the construction and preservation of the NKEFZ. In future development, the NKEFZ should leverage their unique natural resources to explore distinctive ecological advantages and promote the development of eco-friendly economic industries, such as ecological industry, ecological agriculture, and eco-tourism, transitioning from being reliant on external support to self-sustainability.

TI  - Detection of Tree Species in Beijing Plain Afforestation Project Using Satellite Sensors and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping tree species distributions in urban areas is significant for managing afforestation plans and pest infestations but can be challenging over large areas. This research compared the classification accuracy of three data sources and three machine learning algorithm combinations. It evaluated the cost benefit of various combinations by mapping the species distribution of the Beijing Plain Afforestation Project with a three-level hierarchical approach. First, vegetation and non-vegetation were mapped. Then, tree crowns were extracted from the vegetation mask. Finally, Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) were applied to the three data sources: Pleiades-1B, WorldView-2, and Sentinel-2. The tree species classification was based on the original bands and spectral and texture indices. Sentinel-2 performed well at the stand level, with an overall accuracy of 89.29%. WorldView-2 was significantly better than Pleiades-1 at the single-tree identification level. The combination of WorldView-2 and SVM achieved the best classification result, with an overall accuracy of 90.91%. This research concludes that the low-resolution Sentinel-2 sensor can accurately map tree areas while performing satisfactorily in classifying pure forests. For mixed forests, on the other hand, WorldView-2 and Pleiades-1, which have higher resolutions, are needed for single-tree scale classification. Compared to Pleiades-1, WorldView-2 produced higher classification accuracy. In addition, this study combines algorithm comparison to provide further reference and guidance for plantation forest classification.

TI  - Eco-Environment Quality Response to Climate Change and Human Activities on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities have caused a range of impacts on the ecological environment. The Loess Plateau (LP) is critical to the stability and health of ecosystems in central and western China, but there is still a lack of research on spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the effects of climate and human activities on the EEQ of the LP. We quantified the ecological environment quality of the study area from 2001 to 2019 based on the improved remote sensing ecological index (RSEI-2) and studied the spatial and temporal evolution of EEQ and its drivers during this period by trend analysis and multiscale geographic weighted regression (MGWR) model. The EEQ of the LP showed an increasingly slowing trend during 2001-2019, with apparent spatial heterogeneity, the south-central part was the hot spot area of change, and the center of gravity of change shifted 124.56 km to the southwest. The driving effects and ranges of each factor changed over time during the study period, and the positive effects of precipitation (PRE) and temperature (TEM) on the EEQ of the southern LP became more apparent, but the negative effects of TEM on the northwestern part have expanded. The negative effect of the intensity of land utilization (LUI) has increased from north to south and has the most profound impact, while population growth has less impact on the central region. The results of this research indicate that the execution of the Grain to Green Program (GGP) in the LP over the last two decades has been effective, but more attention should be paid to the maintenance of the restoration effect in the central region and the reasonable development of the land in the southern area. This research can enhance the comprehension of alterations in ecological factors that impact the environment of the LP. Additionally, it serves as a foundation for investigating strategies for ecological preservation and sustainable land development.

TI  - On-Orbit Geometric Calibration and Performance Validation of the GaoFen-14 Stereo Mapping Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-14 satellite is primarily utilized for global high-precision positioning and generating 1:10,000 scale geographic information products, making it one of the most accurate stereo mapping satellites in China. With a long-stitched CCD (charge couple device) consisting of nine chips for the forward view camera and six chips for the backward view camera, it is crucial to validate the satellite's geometric performance and achieve high uncontrolled global positioning precision. In this study, two calibration models were proposed for the on-orbit calibration of the GaoFen-14 satellite: one accounting for the inter-chip geometry constraint and another without the constraint. Correspondingly, five calibration schemes (A, B, C, D, and E) were designed, with varying settings of the external calibration parameters, interior parameters, and utilization of the optical axis measurement data. Schemes A and B utilized the same set of alignment angles for the forward and backward images and differed in the set of interior calibration parameters. Scheme A took a single set of interior calibration parameters for all chips within the same view, while Scheme B set independent interior calibration parameters for each chip in both the forward and backward views considering the inter-chip geometry constraint. Schemes C, D, and E set two groups of alignment angles for the forward and backward views, respectively. In addition, Schemes C, D, and E utilized GaoFen-14 & PRIME;s specific real-time recording data of the optical axis, incorporating a slight revision of the alignment angle calibration value using dichotomous search. The interior models of Schemes A and C were identical, and those of Schemes B and D were the same. In comparison with scheme D, scheme E only lacks the inter-chip geometry constraint. These five schemes were taken to validate the most suitable exterior model and interior model for the GaoFen-14 satellite. Calibration experiments were conducted using original multichip images and the stitched images from the Zhongwei, Ningxia, and Songshan (Henan) test fields. Additionally, four sets of data from around the world are used to verify the calibration effect. The results demonstrated significant improvements in uncontrolled positioning accuracy for all five calibration schemes, transitioning from the 100 m level to the meter or even the submeter level. However, Schemes A and B exhibited unstable controlled positioning accuracy, with fluctuations ranging from 1 m to 5 m. In contrast, Schemes C, D, and E achieved substantial enhancements in uncontrolled positioning accuracy, maintaining stability with variations ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 m in the X direction, 0.41 to 0.48 m in the Y direction, and 0.77 to 0.81 m in the Z direction. The positions of the CCD probes obtained from Schemes C and D demonstrated consistency, with over 80% of the probes falling within 0.1 pixels, and all of the sampled probes within 0.3 pixels. However, Scheme D behaves better in describing the geometric deformation of each CCD chip and keeping the integrity of the long-stitched CCD simultaneously. These experimental results validate the GaoFen-14 satellite's ability to achieve stable uncontrolled positioning accuracy worldwide and a stable geometric structure between multichips. For the GaoFen-14 satellite, it is more appropriate to adopt two sets of alignment angles for the forward and backward views, respectively.As the satellite's on-orbit operation time increases, it is recommended to employ Scheme D for monitoring inconsistent local geometric deformation in future calibration work.

TI  - Estimation of Coastal Wetland Soil Organic Carbon Content in Western Bohai Bay Using Remote Sensing, Climate, and Topographic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland soil organic carbon (CW-SOC) is crucial for wetland ecosystem conservation and carbon cycling. The accurate prediction of CW-SOC content is significant for soil carbon sequestration. This study, which employed three machine learning (ML) methods, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), aimed to estimate CW-SOC content using 98 soil samples, SAR images, optical images, and climate and topographic data. Three statistical metrics and leave-one-out cross-validation were used to evaluate model performance. Optimal models using different ML methods were applied to predict the spatial distribution of CW-SOC content. The results showed the following: (1) The models built using optical images had higher predictive accuracy than models built using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The model that combined SAR images, optical images, and climate data demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy. Compared to the model using only optical images and SAR images, the prediction accuracy was improved by 0.063 and 0.115, respectively. (2) Regardless of the combination of predictive variables, the XGBoost method achieved higher prediction accuracy than the RF and GBM methods. (3) Optical images were the main explanatory variables for predicting CW-SOC content, explaining more than 65% of the variability. (4) The CW-SOC content predicted by the three ML methods showed similar spatial distribution characteristics. The central part of the study area had higher CW-SOC content, while the southern and northern regions had lower levels. This study accurately predicted the spatial distribution of CW-SOC content, providing data support for ecological environmental protection and carbon neutrality of coastal wetlands.

TI  - A Flexible Spatiotemporal Thick Cloud Removal Method with Low Requirements for Reference Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thick cloud and shadows have a significant impact on the availability of optical remote sensing data. Although various methods have been proposed to address this issue, they still have some limitations. First, most approaches rely on a single clear reference image as complementary information, which becomes challenging when the target image has large missing areas. Secondly, the existing methods that can utilize multiple reference images require the complementary data to have high temporal correlation, which is not suitable for situations where the difference between the reference image and the target image is large. To overcome these limitations, a flexible spatiotemporal deep learning framework based on generative adversarial networks is proposed for thick cloud removal, which allows for the use of three arbitrary temporal images as references. The framework incorporates a three-step encoder that can leverage the uncontaminated information from the target image to assimilate the reference images, enhancing the model's ability to handle reference images with diverse temporal differences. A series of simulated and real experiments on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method is especially applicable to small/large-scale regions with reference images that are significantly different from the target image.

I then situate the view that is implied by these doctrines into the traditional Western environmental ethics literature on the value of nature. In particular, I argue that the Hmong religion provides a view in environmental ethics that is non-anthropocentric, individualistic, non-egalitarian, and non-biocentric.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of aerosol optical depth and its response to urbanization: a case study of Jinan City, China, 2009-2018.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the insidiously growing impact of urban development on the environment, the issue of air quality has attracted extensive attention nationally and globally. It is of great significance to study the influence of urbanization on air quality for the rational development of cities. MODIS-MAIAC (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) Aerosol optical depth (AOD) product, DMSP/OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System) and NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) night-light were used to explore the spatiotemporal variation and correlation between AOD and urbanization development before and after the promulgation of environmental governance policies in Jinan City from 2009 to 2018. Results show that (1) the spatial distribution of AOD in Jinan had the characteristics of high in the north and low in the south, high in the west and low in the east, and low in some parts of the central region; there was a significant seasonal variation in time, with the highest AOD in summer and the lowest in winter. During 2009-2013, the annual average variation of AOD increased by 20.6%, while during 2014-2018, it decreased by 35.3%; (2) The distribution of night-light in Jinan City has progressively expanded, mirroring the city's ongoing development. The spatial distribution of aerosols in urban areas was relatively low compared to the surrounding areas of the city. (3) From 2009 to 2013, there existed a significant positive correlation between the spatial and temporal distribution of AOD and night-light. However, from 2014 to 2018, with the implementation of environmental governance policies, this relationship shifted to a significant negative correlation between the spatial and temporal distribution of AOD and night-light. Through an analysis of the correlation between urban development and aerosol depth in Jinan City over the past decade, it can be concluded that urban development does not inevitably result in elevated AOD levels. Notably, the Jinan government has achieved remarkable results in controlling the atmospheric environment, as evidenced by recent years' improvements.

TI  - Numerical study on mean wave drift forces and moment of ships using Rankine panel method in frequency domain
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-dimensional frequency-domain seakeeping model based on the Rankine panel method is developed to compute the mean wave drift forces and moment acting on ships with forward speeds. Two different linearization models (the double-body and Neumann-Kelvin models) are applied to evaluate the mean wave drift forces and moment using a near-field method. In these models, the Rayleigh's artificial friction is adopted in the free-surface boundary condition to suppress longer wave components in computational regions apart from the ship. A novel upwind difference scheme is introduced to calculate the first-order and second-order derivatives of the velocity potential on the free surface. Wigley I, Wigley III and S175 containership are adopted in numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the developed model. In the present study, the motion response amplitude operators in head, beam and oblique seas obtained using the two models are compared, and their contributions to the mean wave drift forces and moment are analyzed. Results show that in head seas, the pitch motions have significant effects on the surge-directional wave drift force Fx. In beam seas, the heave motions have the most effect on the mean wave drift forces and moment (Fx, Fy and MO.

TI  - Effects of production-living-ecological space changes on the ecosystem service value of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of urbanization, exploring the relationship between production-living-ecological space (PLES) and ecosystem service value (ESV) is a major scientific issue in promoting regional sustainable development. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration is an ideal study area, which has the highest urbanization rate in China. Based on Landsat TM/ETM imaging data from 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, this study established a land use classification system of PLES. The spatial and temporal characteristics of PLES and ESV were analyzed, and the response of ESV to changes in PLES was investigated based on the elasticity formula. The results showed that from 2005 to 2018, production space and ecological space were the main types of PLES and exhibited an imbalance in transformation. Production space was the main transfer type, and living space significantly expanded. Moreover, from 2005 to 2018, the ESV of the YRD urban agglomeration showed an increasing and then decreasing trend. ESV presented a "high in the southwest and low in the northeast" spatial pattern. Furthermore, ESV was sensitive to changes in PLES, showing a trend of ecological space > production space > living space. However, the sensitivity of ESV to changes in PLES varied according to urbanization level.

TI  - Optimized Extraction Method of Fruit Planting Distribution Based on Spectral and Radar Data Fusion of Key Time Phase
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With China's fruit tree industry becoming the largest in the world, accurately understanding the spatial distribution of fruit tree growing areas is crucial for promoting socio-economic development and rural revitalization. Remote sensing offers unprecedented opportunities for fruit tree monitoring. However, previous research has mainly focused on UAV and near-ground remote sensing, with limited accuracy in obtaining fruit tree distribution information through satellite remote sensing. In this study, we utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) remote sensing cloud platform and integrated data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and SRTM sources. We constructed a feature space by extracting original band features, vegetation index features, polarization features, terrain features, and texture features. The sequential forward selection (SFS) algorithm was employed for feature optimization, and a combined machine learning and object-oriented classification model was used to accurately extract fruit tree crop distributions by comparing key temporal phases of fruit trees. The results revealed that the backscatter coefficient features from Sentinel-1 had the highest contribution to the classification, followed by the original band features and vegetation index features from Sentinel-2, while the terrain features had a relatively smaller contribution. The highest classification accuracy for jujube plantation areas was observed in November (99.1% for user accuracy and 96.6% for producer accuracy), whereas the lowest accuracy was found for pear tree plantation areas in the same month (93.4% for user accuracy and 89.0% for producer accuracy). Among the four different classification methods, the combined random forest and object-oriented (RF + OO) model exhibited the highest accuracy (OA = 0.94, Kappa = 0.92), while the support vector machine (SVM) classification method had the lowest accuracy (OA = 0.52, Kappa = 0.31). The total fruit tree plantation area in Aksu City in 2022 was estimated to be 64,000 hectares, with walnut, jujube, pear, and apple trees accounting for 42.5%, 20.6%, 19.3%, and 17.5% of the total fruit tree area, respectively (27,200 hectares, 13,200 hectares, 12,400 hectares, and 11,200 hectares, respectively). The SFS feature optimization and RF + OO-combined classification model algorithm selected in this study effectively mapped the fruit tree planting areas, enabling the estimation of fruit tree planting areas based on remote sensing satellite image data. This approach facilitates accurate fruit tree industry and real-time crop monitoring and provides valuable support for fruit tree planting management by the relevant departments.

TI  - High-Resolution Ratoon Rice Monitoring under Cloudy Conditions with Fused Time-Series Optical Dataset and Threshold Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ratoon rice, an effective rice cultivation system, allows paddy rice to be harvested twice from the same stubble, playing an important role in ensuring food security and adapting to climate change with its unique growth characteristics. However, there is an absence of research related to remote-sensing monitoring of ratoon rice, and the presence of other rice cropping systems (e.g., double-season rice) with similar characteristics poses a hindrance to the accurate identification of ratoon rice. Furthermore, cloudy and rainy regions have limited available remote-sensing images, meaning that remote-sensing monitoring is limited. To address this issue, taking Yongchuan District, a typical cloud-prone region in Chongqing, China, as an example, this study proposed the construction of a time-series optical dataset using the Modified Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (MNSPI) method for cloud-removal interpolation and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) model for fusing multi-source optical remote-sensing data, in combination with vegetation index features and phenological information to build a threshold model to map ratoon rice at high-resolution (10 m). The mapping performance of ratoon rice was evaluated using independent field samples to obtain the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings indicate that the combination of the MNSPI method and FSDAF model had a stable and effective performance, characterized by high correlation coefficient (r) values and low root mean square error (RMSE) values between the restored/predicted images and the true images. Notably, it was possible to effectively capture the distinct characteristics of ratoon rice in cloudy and rainy regions using the proposed threshold model. Specifically, the identified area of ratoon rice in the study region was 194.17 km2, which was close to the official data (158-180 km2), and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of ratoon rice identification result were 90.73% and 0.81, respectively. These results demonstrate that our proposed threshold model can effectively distinguish ratoon rice during vital phenological stages from other crop types, enrich the technical system of rice remote-sensing monitoring, and provide a reference for agricultural remote-sensing applications in cloudy and rainy regions.

TI  - Methane Emissions in Boreal Forest Fire Regions: Assessment of Five Biomass-Burning Emission Inventories Based on Carbon Sensing Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gases such as CH4 generated by forest fires have a significant impact on atmospheric methane concentrations and terrestrial vegetation methane budgets. Verification in conjunction with "top-down" satellite remote sensing observation has become a vital way to verify biomass-burning emission inventories and accurately assess greenhouse gases while looking into the limitations in reliability and quantification of existing "bottom-up" biomass-burning emission inventories. Therefore, we considered boreal forest fire regions as an example while combining five biomass-burning emission inventories and CH4 indicators of atmospheric concentration satellite observation data. By introducing numerical comparison, correlation analysis and trend consistency analysis methods, we explained the lag effect between emissions and atmospheric concentration changes and evaluated a more reliable emission inventory using time series similarity measurement methods. The results indicated that total methane emissions from five biomass-burning emission inventories differed by a factor of 2.9 in our study area, ranging from 2.02 to 5.84 Tg for methane. The time trends of the five inventories showed good consistency, with the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 (QFED2.5) having a higher correlation coefficient (above 0.8) with the other four datasets. By comparing the consistency between the inventories and satellite data, a lagging effect was found to be present between the changes in atmospheric concentration and gas emissions caused by forest fires on a seasonal scale. After eliminating lagging effects and combining time series similarity measures, the QFED2.5 (Euclidean distance = 0.14) was found to have the highest similarity to satellite data. In contrast, Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 with small fires (GFED4.1s) and Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFAS1.2) had larger Euclidean distances of 0.52 and 0.4, respectively, which meant that they had lower similarity to satellite data. Therefore, QFED2.5 was found to be more reliable while having higher application accuracy compared to the other four datasets in our study area. This study further provided a better understanding of the key role of forest fire emissions in atmospheric CH(4 )concentrations and offered reference for selecting appropriate biomass burning emission inventory datasets for bottom-up inventory estimation studies.

TI  - Action Mechanism of <i>Bacillus</i> on Microalgae During Nitrogen Metabolism in Urban Tailwater
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve deep denitrification of black and odorous water and improve the quality of surface water, we studied the characteristics of nitrogen metabolism and denitrification of urban tailwater by microalgae (Z), Bacillus (Y), and Bacillus microalgae (ZY). The results showed that there was a good removal effect of ammonia nitrogen of group Z and group ZY in urban tailwater. The degradation rate of both groups reached 95%. The best effect on the removal of nitrite nitrogen was of group Z in urban tailwater. The combined action of Bacillus and Micrococcus played a relatively strong and stable effect on the conversion of nitrite nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen in the nitrogen cycle reaction. Bacillus could effectively remove nitrate nitrogen and improve the removal efficiency of nitrate nitrogen by microalgae. Best removal effect of nitrate nitrogen was observed in group ZY in urban tailwater, with a degradation rate as high as 99%, in which the nitrate nitrogen was removed almost completely. The Bacteria with high proportions in Z were Chroococcidiopsis_PCC_7203 (24.38%), uncultured_bacterium-g_norank_f_A4b (23.65%), Exiguobacteriu (7.09%), Leptolyngbya_PCC-6306(9.41%), and Bacillus (1.99%). The bacteria with high proportions in ZY were Brevibacillus (22.94%), Clostridium (8.78%), and Bacillus (4.88%), and the proportion of Chroococcidiopsis_PCC_7203 was only 7.84% in ZY, which was considerably lower than that in Z samples. The conclusions were as follows:microalgae could effectively remove ammonia nitrogen in the system. Bacillus and microalgae had very good removal effect of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. During the nitrogen removal of black and odorous water by algae, the Bacillus inhibited the excessive growth of microalgae and prevented eutrophication and black odor in water. This study can provide data support for the deep treatment of urban tail water and prevention of surface water eutrophication.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change on the Major Eco-Hydrological Parameters in the Dongting Lake Basin
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the impacts of climate change on evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) in the Dongting Lake Basin is essential for assessing water scarcity and implementing sustainable development strategies. Premised on actual measurements and remote sensing data from 47 stations, the impact of climate change on eco-hydrological parameters in the Dongting Lake Basin was analyzed in the present study using the BESS model (The Breathing Earth System Simulator), ridge regression analysis, stepwise regression model and time-lag analysis. The results reveal that: (1) the Dongting Lake Basin has been warm and arid over the last four decades, with the frequent occurrence of extreme climate events. Vegetation carbon sequestration capacity exhibited a slightly upward trend with 0.0081 g C m-2 d-1/year from 2000-2017. ET changed with rates of -3.309 mm/year, with possible risk conflicts between water demand and supply in the future. (2) The increasing temperature was the main driver of ET enhancement in the Dongting Lake Basin. Meanwhile, both temperature and precipitation were found to be the dominant drivers of GPP enhancement. The effect of temperature on GPP was found to be greater in the areas covered by crops and tree vegetation, and natural vegetation was more strongly influenced by precipitation than radiation. (3) Extreme temperature events have had a significant impact on evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) in the Dongting Lake Basin. Specifically, the cold index in extreme temperature events was found to significantly affect ET, while the heat index in extreme temperature events significantly affected GPP. Additionally, both ET and GPP were found to respond to extreme precipitation events in the region. The results of the study established that vegetation is highly sensitive to temperature, especially temperature extremes, and that precipitation also has a stressful effect. Increasing temperatures and precipitation within a range benefit vegetation productivity. (4) In the Dongting Lake Basin, we found that different climatic factors produced different time lag effects on GPP and ET by time lag analysis. This study highlights the lag effects of climate factors and extreme climate events on eco-hydrological parameters. We suggest incorporating the effects into simulation models of eco-hydrological parameters. This will lead to a better understanding of the variation of eco-hydrological parameters under climate change.

TI  - Interpreting the Response of Forest Stock Volume with Dual Polarization SAR Images in Boreal Coniferous Planted Forest in the Non-Growing Season
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images with dual polarization modes have great potential to map forest stock volume (FSV) by excellent penetration capabilities and distinct microwave scattering processes. However, the response of these SAR data to FSV is still uncertain in the non-growing season. To further interpret the response of FSV to different dual polarization SAR images, three types of dual polarization SAR images (GF-3, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2) were initially acquired in coniferous planted forest in the non-growing season. Then, sensitivity between FSV and all alternative features extracted from each type of SAR image was analyzed to express the response of FSV to dual polarization SAR images with bands and polarization modes in the non-growing season in deciduous (Larch) and evergreen (Chinese pine) forests. Finally, mapped FSV using single and combined dual polarization images were derived by optimal feature sets and four machine learning models, respectively. The combined effects were also analyzed to clarify the difference of bands and polarization modes in deciduous and evergreen forests in the non-growing season. The results demonstrated that the backscattering energy from different sensors is significantly different in Chinese pine, and the difference is gradually reduced in Larch forests. It is also implied that the polarization mode is more important than penetration capability in mapping forest FSV in deciduous forest in the non-growing season. By comparing the accuracy of mapped FSV using single and combined images, combined images have more capability to improve the accuracy and reliability of mapped FSV. Meanwhile, it is confirmed that compensation effects with bands and polarization modes not only have great potential to delay the saturation phenomenon, but also have the capability to reduce errors caused by overestimation.

TI  - Study of the Application of FY-3D/MERSI-II Far-Infrared Data in Wildfire Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In general, the far-infrared channel in the wavelength range of 10.5-12.0 & mu;m plays an auxiliary role in wildfire detection as its sensitivity to high-temperature targets is far lower than the mid-infrared channel in the wavelength range of 3.5-4.0 & mu;m at the same spatial resolution (1 km, which is the spatial resolution of infrared channels in most satellites used for wildfire monitoring in daily operational mode). The Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager II onboard the Fengyun-3D polar orbiting meteorological satellite (FY-3D/MERSI-II) contains far-infrared channels with a spatial resolution of 250 m at the wavelengths of 10.8 & mu;m and 12.0 & mu;m, which promotes the application of far-infrared channels in wildfire monitoring. In this study, the features of FY-3D/MERSI-II far-infrared channels in fire monitoring are discussed. The sensitivity of 10.8 & mu;m (250 m) to fire spots and the influence of solar radiation reflection on the infrared channels are quantitatively analyzed. The method of using 10.8 & mu;m (250 m) as a major data source to detect fire spots is proposed, and several typical wildfire cases are used to verify the proposed method. The results show that the 10.8 & mu;m (250 m) far-infrared channel has the same advantages as the existing method in wildfire monitoring in terms of a more precise positioning of the detected fire pixel, avoiding interference by solar radiation reflections, and reflecting stronger fire regions in large fire fields.

TI  - Adaptive High Coherence Temporal Subsets SBAS-InSAR in Tropical Peatlands Degradation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Southeast Asia have been undergoing extensive and rapid degradation in recent years. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has shown excellent performance in monitoring surface deformation. However, due to the characteristics of high vegetation cover and large dynamic changes in peatlands, it is difficult for classical InSAR technology to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, an adaptive high coherence temporal subsets (HCTSs) small baseline subset (SBAS)-InSAR method is proposed in this paper, which captures the high coherence time range of pixels to establish adaptive temporal subsets and calculates the deformation results in corresponding time intervals, combining with the time-weighted strategy. Ninety Sentinel-1 SAR images (2019-2022) in South Sumatra province were processed based on the proposed method. The results showed that the average deformation rate of peatlands ranged from approximately -567 to 347 mm/year and was affected by fires and the changes in land cover. Besides, the dynamic changes of peatlands' deformation rate a long time after fires were revealed, and the causes of changes were analyzed. Furthermore, the deformation results of the proposed method observed 2 to 127 times as many measurement points as the SBAS-InSAR method. Pearson's r (ranged from 0.44 to 0.75) and Root Mean Square Error (ranged from 50 to 75 mm/year) were calculated to verify the reliability of the proposed method. Adaptive HCTSs SBAS-InSAR can be considered an efficient method for peatland degradation monitoring, which provides the foundation for investigating the mechanisms of peatland degradation and monitoring it in broader regions.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Fractional Vegetation Coverage Inversion Based on UAV and Sentinel-2 Data: A Case Study of Alpine Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) is an important indicator of ecosystem change. At present, FVC products are mainly concentrated at low and medium spatial resolution and lack high temporal and spatial resolution, which brings certain challenges to the fine monitoring of ecological environments. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of four remote sensing inversion models for FVC based on high-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field-measured FVC data in 2019. Then the inversion models were optimized by constructing a multidimensional feature dataset. Finally, the Source Region of the Yellow River (SRYR) FVC product was created using the best inversion model, and the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of the FVC in the region were analyzed. The study ' s findings revealed that: (1) The accuracies of the four FVC inversion models were as follows: the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model (R-2 = 0.967, RMSE = 0.045) > Random Forest (RF) model (R-2 = 0.962, RMSE = 0.049) > Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (R-2 = 0.925, RMSE = 0.072) > Pixel Dichotomy (PD) model (R-2 = 0.869, RMSE = 0.097). (2) Constructing a multidimensional feature dataset to optimize the driving data can improve the accuracy of the inversion model. NDVI and elevation are important factors affecting the accuracy of machine learning inversion algorithms, and the visible blue band is the most important feature factor of the GBDT model. (3) The FVC in the SRYR gradually increased from west to east and from north to south. The change trajectories of grassland FVC from 2017 to 2022 were not significant. The areas that tend to improve were mainly distributed in the southeast (1.31%), while the areas that tend to degrade were mainly distributed in the central and northwest (1.89%). This study provides a high-spatial-resolution FVC inversion optimization scheme, which is of great significance for the fine monitoring of alpine grassland ecological environments.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Mechanisms of Polder Land Use in the "Water-Polder-Village" System: A Case Study of Gaochun District in Nanjing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study tries to gain an understanding of the unique spatial patterns of polder areas. Starting from a typical "water-polder-village" combination of spatial elements, our study begins by identifying land use in the polder area using Sentinel-2 data and unsupervised machine learning techniques, taking Gaochun District, Nanjing (China), as an example. Next, we conducted a spatial analysis of change for different years using multiple land-use change indices. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was developed to account for the heterogeneity of spatial patterns and visualize the spatial distributions of the estimated coefficients. The results, derived from the indices we have constructed, indicate that the water-polder-village is the main subject of spatial pattern changes, with spatial replacement of water and polder and incremental quantitative changes in village areas. Additionally, the main source of existing village land comes from the occupation of polders. Furthermore, the impacts of natural and ecological, development and construction, population, and economic factors on the spatial patterns of the polder area exhibit spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Meanwhile, in rapidly developing areas, population, economy, and construction development may negatively impact the protection of polders. The results provide a reference for the construction and protection of production, living, and ecological spaces in polder areas.

TI  - Reducing the Cold Bias of the WRF Model Over the Tibetan Plateau by Implementing a Snow Coverage-Topography Relationship and a Fresh Snow Albedo Scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most climate models show systematic cold biases during snow-covered period over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is associated with snow and surface albedo overestimations. In this work, a snow cover fraction (SCF) scheme and a recently developed albedo scheme for shallow snow are implemented in the Noah-MP land surface model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The SCF scheme introduces subgrid orographic variability to reduce the SCF, and the shallow-snow albedo scheme parameterizes the fresh-snow albedo as a function of the snow depth (SD). Evaluations by remote sensing data show that both schemes can effectively alleviate the overestimation of the simulated surface albedo, SCF, snow water equivalent, and SD over the TP. The reductions in the modeled SCF and snow albedo directly lead to lower surface albedo values and thus more surface solar radiation absorption, which accelerates snow melting and causes surface warming effects. Further comparisons with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and station observations show that both schemes can significantly reduce the cold biases in the surface skin temperature (from -4.39 degrees C to 0.19 degrees C for the TP mean) and 2-m air temperature (from -4.48 degrees C to -1.05 degrees C for the station mean) during the cold season (October to May of next year) in the study region. This work provides guidance for advancing the snow-related physics in climate models and the improved WRF model could facilitate weather forecasting and climate prediction for the plateau region.

TI  - A Study of Sandy Land Changes in the Chifeng Region from 1990 to 2020 Based on Dynamic Convolution
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is the process of land degradation and the reduction or destruction of biological potential in arid, semi-arid, and semi-humid areas, and its impact on agricultural development and the ecological environment cannot be ignored. Therefore, many researchers have aimed to achieve the acquisition of large-scale sandy land areas using sandy land extraction algorithms based on remote sensing images. However, the sandy land extraction accuracy needs to be improved because of the variable contour features in the remote sensing images and the easy confusion with targets such as the Gobi and bare ground areas. In this study, we combine the dynamic convolution with a U-Net model and propose the DU-Net sandy land extraction model. The method is based on dynamic convolution, which can adaptively learn the complex features of the target and build a dynamic convolutional neural network to achieve high-accuracy extraction of complex targets. DU-Net achieved 86.32% in IoU, 93.22% in precision, 94.5% in recall, and 92.66% in F1-score in sandy land extraction accuracy, which are 4.68%, 2.33%, 3.09%, and 2.76% improvements, respectively, compared with the U-Net static neural network. Based on this, we obtained the spatial and temporal evolution trends of sandy land areas based on Landsat images in the Chifeng region in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Meanwhile, in order to investigate the mechanism of spatial and temporal changes in the sandy land area in the study region over the past 30 years, the direct and indirect effects of seven climatic and human socioeconomic activity factors on the changes in the sandy land area in the study region were evaluated based on a structural equation model. The results show that the sandy area in the Chifeng region tended to first increase and then decrease over the study period, with the sandy land area reaching its maximum around the year 2000. In addition, the main driving factor for the change in the sandy land area in the Chifeng region has been human socioeconomic activities, with climatic conditions as the secondary driving factor. The method proposed in this paper realizes the rapid extraction of sandy land areas with high accuracy at a large scale and with a long time series and provides a basis for assessing the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration projects.

TI  - Remote Sensing Classification of Offshore Seaweed Aquaculture Farms on Sample Dataset Amplification and Semantic Segmentation Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides an effective technical means for the precise extraction of information on aquacultural areas, which is of great significance in realizing the scientific supervision of the aquaculture industry. Existing optical remote sensing methods for the extraction of aquacultural area information mostly focus on the use of image spatial features and research on classification methods of single aquaculture patterns. Accordingly, the comprehensive utilization of a combination of spectral information and deep learning automatic recognition technology in the feature expression and discriminant extraction of aquaculture areas needs to be further explored. In this study, using Sentinel-2 remote sensing images, a method for the accurate extraction of different algae aquaculture zones combined with spectral information and deep learning technology was proposed for the characteristics of small samples, multidimensions, and complex water components in marine aquacultural areas. First, the feature expression ability of the aquaculture area target was enhanced through the calculation of the normalized difference aquaculture water index (NDAWI). Second, on this basis, the improved deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) algorithm was used to amplify the samples and create the NDAWI dataset. Finally, three semantic segmentation methods (UNet, DeepLabv3, and SegNet) were used to design models for classifying the algal aquaculture zones based on the sample amplified time series dataset and comprehensively compare the accuracy of the model classifications for achieving accurate extraction of different algal aquaculture information within the seawater aquaculture zones. The results show that the improved DCGAN amplification exhibited a better effect than the generative adversarial networks (GANs) and DCGAN under the indexes of structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The UNet classification model constructed on the basis of the improved DCGAN-amplified NDAWI dataset achieved better classification results (Lvshunkou: OA = 94.56%, kappa = 0.905; Jinzhou: OA = 94.68%, kappa = 0.913). The algorithmic model in this study provides a new method for the fine classification of marine aquaculture area information under small sample conditions.

TI  - Integration of microwave satellite soil moisture products in the contextual surface temperature-vegetation index models for spatially continuous evapotranspiration estimation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The contextual surface temperature-vegetation index (TVX) models have been widely used for the retrieval of soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration (ET). One of the key premises for their application is to determine quantitatively the theoretical boundaries of this contextual TVX space. Usually these theoretical boundaries are determined based on land surface energy balance principle. Although sound in physical mechanism, the complex parameterization involved has hampered its remote sensing (RS) applications. Our recent studies show that ground-based SM observations can be used for a quick and continuous retrieval of these theoretical boundaries. The main disadvantage lies in its reliance on in-situ SM observations. Fortunately the development of microwave RS technology has made it possible to monitor SM at both regional and global scale. Under this background, a practical framework based on the contextual TVX models was proposed in this paper for continuous ET estimation through the combination of microwave-based SM products and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products. Daily actual ET over the Southern Great Plains of the United States of America was calculated as the product of net radiation and evaporative fraction (EF). The focus of this framework was to investigate how optical and microwave RS can be combined to achieve a quick and continuous retrieval of EF independently of ground observations. Specifically, EF was retrieved from the contextual TVX models, the theoretical boundaries of which were calibrated at the annual scale based on an optimization scheme. Assuming the seasonal variation of the theoretical dry edge follows a cosine function of solar zenith, the essence of this optimization scheme is to search for the optimal amplitude parameter that maximizes the correlation between microwave-based SM observations and soil moisture index retrieved from the contextual TVX models. Two microwave-based SM products including SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) were adopted to demonstrate this optimization scheme. The correlation coefficient, root mean square error and bias of EF estimates calibrated by SMAP were 0.700, 0.146 and 0.047, and those achieved by SMOS were 0.663, 0.174 and 0.168, respectively. The optimization scheme has not only made it possible to conduct a continuous monitoring of ET based entirely on RS observations but also achieved the downscaling of microwave satellite SM products. Thus the combination of optical and microwave RS holds great potential for coupled and continuous estimation of SM and ET over large scale.

TI  - Novel Land Cover Change Detection Deep Learning Framework with Very Small Initial Samples Using Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection with heterogeneous remote sensing images (Hete-CD) plays a significant role in practical applications, particularly in cases where homogenous remote sensing images are unavailable. However, directly comparing bitemporal heterogeneous remote sensing images (HRSIs) to measure the change magnitude is unfeasible. Numerous deep learning methods require substantial samples to train the module adequately. Moreover, the process of labeling a large number of samples for land cover change detection using HRSIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Consequently, deep learning networks face challenges in achieving satisfactory performance in Hete-CD due to the limited number of training samples. This study proposes a novel deep-learning framework for Hete-CD to achieve satisfactory performance even with a limited number of initial samples. We developed a multiscale network with a selected kernel-attention module. This design allows us to effectively capture different change targets characterized by diverse sizes and shapes. In addition, a simple yet effective non-parameter sample-enhanced algorithm that utilizes the Pearson correlation coefficient is proposed to explore the potential samples surrounding every initial sample. The proposed network and sample-enhanced algorithm are integrated into an iterative framework to improve change detection performance with a limited number of small samples. The experimental results were achieved based on four pairs of real HRSIs, which were acquired with Landsat-5, Radarsat-2, and Sentinel-2 satellites with optical and SAR sensors. Results indicated that the proposed framework could achieve competitive accuracy with a small number of samples compared with some state-of-the-art methods, including three traditional methods and nine state-of-the-art deep learning methods. For example, the improvement rates are approximately 3.38% and 1.99% compared with the selected traditional methods and deep learning methods, respectively.

TI  - Early detection of potential landslides along high-speed railway lines: A pressing issue
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Early detection of landslides is important for prevention and mitigation of landslide disasters. Especially, accurately identifying potential landslides along high-speed railway is becoming a pressing issue for operation safety of high-speed railway. Here, 161 Sentinel-1A satellite images from March 2017 to September 2022 were acquired to detect potential landslides along the Lanzhou-Urumqi high-speed railway (LUHR) in Qinghai. Results show that rainfall is the main cause for the transition from secondary creep (steady state) to tertiary creep (accelerated) at the Jiujiawan landslide. The hot spot analysis method was used to cluster the average line-of-sight deformation velocity along the LUHR, effectively extracting five deformation zones that may pose a threat. Optical satellite image analysis revealed four potential landslides and one unstable slope. Furthermore, the rescaled range analysis documented that the Hurst exponent is greater than 0.8 for all four potential landslide instability points, implying that the identified potential landslide areas are still in motion and may pose a threat to the operation of the LUHR. On this basis, we propose a framework for early identification and monitoring of landslides along the high-speed railway lines that supports landslide hazard managing with the goal to reduce landslide risk.We propose a framework for detecting potential landslides along high-speed railway lines. The hot spot analysis method can quickly extract the deformation area based on InSAR result. Stability of potential landslide can be assessed by combining InSAR and Hurst exponent.image

TI  - Study on Accuracy Evaluation of MCD19A2 and Spatiotemporal Distribution of AOD in Arid Zones of Central Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Asian arid zone is the largest non-territorial arid zone in the world, so it is particularly important to understand the optical properties of aerosols in this region. In this paper, we validate the MCD19A2 atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) remote sensing data by using ground-based data and measured data. To explore the spatial and temporal changes in aerosols in the Central Asian arid zone as well as the interannual variations and seasonal variations, we characterize the spatial and temporal distributions of the AOD over 20 years. Finally, we analyze the spatial and temporal variations of the AOD in the Central Asian arid zone by using three methods, namely, the Theil-Sen median trend analysis combined with the Mann-Kendall test, coefficient of variation, and Hurst index; analyze the characteristics of the spatial and temporal variations of the AOD in the Central Asian arid zone; and explore the relationships among the AOD, wind speed, and NDVI. This study reveals the characteristics of the long-term changes in the aerosol optical properties in the Central Asian arid zone and provides a scientific basis for estimating the factors affecting climate change.

TI  - Characterizing Errors Using Satellite Metadata for Eco-Hydrological Model Calibration
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the origins of errors between model predictions and catchment observations is a critical element in hydrologic model calibration and uncertainty estimation. Difficulties arise because there are a variety of error sources but only one measure of the total residual error between model predictions and catchment observations. One promising approach is to collect extra information a priori to characterize the data error before calibration. We implement here a new model calibration strategy for an ecohydrological model, using the satellite metadata information as a means to inform the model priors, to decompose data error from total residual error. This approach, referred to as Bayesian ecohydrological error model (BEEM), is first examined in a synthetic setting to establish its validity, and then applied to three real catchments across Australia. Results show that (a) BEEM is valid in a synthetic setting, as it can perfectly ascertain the true underlying error; (b) in real catchments the model error is reduced when utilizing the observation error variance as added error contributing to total error variance, while the magnitude of total residual error is more robust when utilizing metadata about the data quality proportionality as the basis for assigning total error variance; (c) BEEM improves model calibration by estimating the model error appropriately and estimating the uncertainty interval more precisely. Overall, our work demonstrates a new approach to collect prior error information in satellite metadata and reveals the potential for fully utilizing metadata about error sources in uncertainty estimation.

AB  - A large number of raw data collected by satellites are processed by the production chain to obtain a large number of product data, of which the secure exchange and storage is of interest to researchers in the field of remote sensing information science. Authentic, secure data provide a critical foundation for data analysis and decision-making. Traditional centralized cloud computing systems are vulnerable to attack and, once the central server is successfully attacked, all data will be lost. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is an innovative computer technology that can ensure information security and traceability, is tamper-proof, and can be applied to the field of remote sensing. Although there are many advantages to using DLT in remote sensing applications, there are some obstacles and limitations to its application. Remote sensing data have the characteristics of a large data volume, a spatiotemporal nature, global scale, and so on, and it is difficult to store and interconnect remote sensing data in the blockchain. To address these issues, this paper proposes a trustworthy and decentralized system using blockchain technology. The novelty of this paper is the proposal of a multi-level blockchain architecture in which the system collects remote sensing data and stores them in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) network; after generating the IPFS hash, the network rehashes the value again and uploads it on the Ethereum chain for public query. The distributed data storage improves data security, supports the secure exchange of information, and improves the efficiency of data management.

TI  - Quantification of Diffusive Methane Emissions from a Large Eutrophic Lake with Satellite Imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are major emitters of methane (CH4); however, a longstanding challenge with quantifying the magnitude of emissions remains as a result of large spatial and temporal variability. This study was designed to address the issue using satellite remote sensing with the advantages of spatial coverage and temporal resolution. Using Aqua/MODIS imagery (2003-2020) and in situ measured data (2011-2017) in eutrophic Lake Taihu, we compared the performance of eight machine learning models to predict diffusive CH4 emissions and found that the random forest (RF) model achieved the best fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.65 and mean relative error = 21%). On the basis of input satellite variables (chlorophyll a, water surface temperature, diffuse attenuation coefficient, and photosynthetically active radiation), we assessed how and why they help predict the CH4 emissions with the RF model. Overall, these variables mechanistically controlled the emissions, leading to the model capturing well the variability of diffusive CH4 emissions from the lake. Additionally, we found climate warming and associated algal blooms boosted the long-term increase in the emissions via reconstructing historical (2003-2020) daily time series of CH4 emissions. This study demonstrates the great potential of satellites to map lake CH4 emissions by providing spatiotemporal continuous data, with new and timely insights into accurately understanding the magnitude of aquatic greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Stage-Specific Risk of Recurrence and Death From Melanoma in Denmark, 2008-2021 A National Observational Cohort Study of 25?720 Patients With Stage IA to IV Melanoma
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - IMPORTANCE To ensure optimal treatment and surveillance of patients with melanoma, knowledge of the clinical stage-specific risk of recurrence, mortality, and recurrence patterns across the American Joint Committee on Cancer Eighth Edition (AJCC8) substages is needed.OBJECTIVE To estimate stage-specific recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality rates, assess absolute stage-specific risks of recurrence and mortality, and describe stage-specific recurrence patterns, including conditional rates.DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected nationwide population-based registry data. SETTING Nationwide, population-based cohort study.PARTICIPANTS The 25 720 Danish patients, 18 years or older, diagnosed with first-time stage IA to IV cutaneous melanoma between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2019, were included and followed up from time of primary treatment until December 31, 2021.EXPOSURES First diagnosis of stage IA to IV cutaneous melanoma. MAIN OUTCOMES Stage-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality, melanoma-specific recurrence-free survival, and assessed absolute stage-specific risks of recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes were stage-specific recurrence patterns, including conditional rates, and melanoma-specific survival.RESULTS We followed up 25 720 patients for a median of 5.9 years (95% CI, 58.9-59.3 years). Mean age was 59.1 years (95% CI, 58.9-59.3 years). Patients with stage IIB to IIC melanoma were older, had more comorbidities at diagnosis, and had the lowest rate of pathologic staging by sentinel node biopsy (81.6%-87.4%). A total of 10.6% of patients developed recurrence; first recurrence included distant recurrence, alone or with synchronous locoregional recurrence, in 56.6% of patients. We found a comparable risk of recurrence in stages IIIA and IIB (29.7% vs 33.2%) and in stages IIIB and IIC (35.9% vs 36.8%), respectively. Melanoma-specific mortality was comparable between stages IIIA and IIA (13.0% vs 13.6%) and between stages IIIB and IIB (18.4% vs 22.0%), respectively. These risk patterns persisted in cause-specific hazards models.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This nationwide, population-based cohort study found that the increasing stages of the current AJCC8 staging system do not accurately reflect an increasing risk of recurrence and mortality in melanoma. The high proportion of distant recurrences suggests that hematogenous spread is a more common metastatic pathway than previously assumed, and surveillance with routine functional/cross-sectional imaging should be considered for stages IIB to IV. Future efforts should be put toward developing new tools for risk stratification and determining the survival effect of routine imaging in surveillance.

TI  - Retrieval of aerosol optical properties from GOCI-II observations: Continuation of long-term geostationary aerosol monitoring over East Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) was successfully launched in 2010, the GOCI Yonsei aerosol retrieval (YAER) algorithm has been continuously updated to retrieve hourly aerosol optical properties. GOCI-II has 4 more channels including UV, finer spatial resolution (250 m), and daily full disk coverage as compared to GOCI, and was launched in February 2020, onboard the GEO-KOMPSAT-2B (GK-2B) satellite. In this study, we extended the YAER algorithm to GOCI-II data based on its improved performance in many aspects and present the first results of aerosol optical properties retrieved from GOCI-II data. Utilizing the overlapping period between the GOCI-II and GOCI in geostationary Earth orbit, we present GOCI-II aerosol retrievals for high aerosol loading cases over East Asia and show that these have a consistent spatial distribution with those from GOCI. Furthermore, GOCI-II provides AOD at an even higher spatial resolution, revealing finer changes in aerosol concentrations. Validation results for one year data show that the GOCI-II AOD has a correlation coefficient of 0.83 and a ratio within the expected error (EE) of 59.4 % when compared with the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) data. We compared statistical metrics for the GOCI and GOCI-II AODs to assess the consistency between the two datasets. In addition, it was found that there is a strong correlation between the two datasets from the comparison of gridded GOCI and GOCI-II AOD products. It is expected that data from GOCI-II will continue long-term aerosol records with high accuracy that can be used to address air-quality issues over East Asia.

TI  - Satellite-based estimation of soil organic carbon in Portuguese grasslands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is one of the main ecosystem services provided by well-managed grasslands. In the Mediterranean region, sown biodiverse pastures (SBP) rich in legumes are a nature-based, innovative, and economically competitive livestock production system. As a co-benefit of increased yield, they also contribute to carbon sequestration through SOC accumulation. However, SOC monitoring in SBP require time-consuming and costly field work.Methods: In this study, we propose an expedited and cost-effective indirect method to estimate SOC content. In this study, we developed models for estimating SOC concentration by combining remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML) approaches. We used field-measured data collected from nine different farms during four production years (between 2017 and 2021). We utilized RS data from both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, including reflectance bands and vegetation indices. We also used other covariates such as climatic, soil, and terrain variables, for a total of 49 inputs. To reduce multicollinearity problems between the different variables, we performed feature selection using the sequential feature selection approach. We then estimated SOC content using both the complete dataset and the selected features. Multiple ML methods were tested and compared, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and artificial neural networks (ANN). We used a random cross-validation approach (with 10 folds). To find the hyperparameters that led to the best performance, we used a Bayesian optimization approach.Results: Results showed that the XGB method led to higher estimation accuracy than the other methods, and the estimation performance was not significantly influenced by the feature selection approach. For XGB, the average root mean square error (RMSE), measured on the test set among all folds, was 2.78 g kg-1 (r2 equal to 0.68) without feature selection, and 2.77 g kg-1 (r2 equal to 0.68) with feature selection (average SOC content is 13 g kg-1). The models were applied to obtain SOC content maps for all farms.Discussion: This work demonstrated that combining RS and ML can help obtain quick estimations of SOC content to assist with SBP management.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of catastrophic 2020 wildfires in the Brazilian Pantanal using MODIS data and Google Earth Engine: A case study in the world's largest sanctuary for Jaguars
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Encontro das Aguas State Park (EASP), renowned as the world's largest refuge for Jaguars (Panthera onca), is located within the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal biome, and it covers a vast area of approximately 1,080 square kilometers. This ecologically rich region suffered significant devastation from extensive fires in 2020. Given that the ongoing monitoring of wildfires is a crucial task for the preservation of fauna and flora in legally protected environments such as the Pantanal biome, this paper investigates the catastrophic 2020 fire incidents in the EASP reserve through a fully automated methodology capable of detecting and characterizing fire-devastated areas. By taking updated and accurate data from the Google Earth Engine platform, our approach integrates a comprehensive collection ofMODIS sensor images, spectral indices, and filtering processes to generate a spatial map of fire-affected areas in a given period of analysis. Specifically, given a surface reflectance and atmospheric corrected MODIS (MOD09Q/A1) image series, the NBR index is computed from each image and then processed through Savitzky-Golay filtering to remove noisy and missing data. Next, the Delta NBR index is calculated for each consecutive pair of images so as to produce a frequency map of burned areas. In order to quantify and analyze the recent changes due to these successive wildfires that took place in this Pantanal portion, we focused on the devastating fire events that occurred in the EASP park from July to September 2020. The fire mappings were assessed and statistically validated using the kappa coefficient and significance tests computed through reference samples collected from official databases and visual inspection. The findings revealed that, tragically, 84% of the study area experienced at least one instance of fire during the three-month investigation period. The high temporal resolution of MODIS sensors proves to be extremely valuable in promptly and effectively detecting changes in land use.

TI  - Snowpack and groundwater recharge in the Atlas mountains: New evidence and key drivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Atlas Mountains of Morocco, specifically the High Oum Er-rbiaa (HOER) and Ourika catchments.Study focus: to identify the recharge processes within the semi-arid watersheds, in the Atlas Mountains, through monthly monitoring of snow, rainfall, surface water, and groundwater isotope signal, but also the usage of remote sensing data.New hydrological insights for the region: The spatial-temporal analysis of groundwater and precipitation isotopes reveals significant spatial heterogeneity, primarily influenced by the geological variations in each aquifer. Temporal variations indicate that direct recharge occurs in response to winter precipitation, whereas a delayed response is observed during the summer when snow replenishes groundwater towards the end of the melting season. The findings are further supported by the "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment" (GRACE) dataset, which demonstrates that high values of Total Water Storage (TWS) align with groundwater isotopes. This highlights the substantial groundwater abstraction rate between March and June to compensate for the lack of precipitation during this period. The analysis of isotope data indicates that 50% of groundwater recharge in the upstream Jurassic aquifer and 80% in the downstream Triassic-Paleozoic aquifers in the HOER catchment is sourced from snowmelt. Similarly, in the Ourika catchment, snowmelt contributes 30% and 50% of groundwater recharge in the upstream and downstream portions of the catchments respectively. This disparity is due to different melting rates across altitudinal ranges and variations in the lithology of each catchment.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of aerosol optical depth and its response to urbanization: a case study of Jinan City, China, 2009-2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the insidiously growing impact of urban development on the environment, the issue of air quality has attracted extensive attention nationally and globally. It is of great significance to study the influence of urbanization on air quality for the rational development of cities. MODIS-MAIAC (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) Aerosol optical depth (AOD) product, DMSP/OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System) and NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) night-light were used to explore the spatiotemporal variation and correlation between AOD and urbanization development before and after the promulgation of environmental governance policies in Jinan City from 2009 to 2018. Results show that (1) the spatial distribution of AOD in Jinan had the characteristics of high in the north and low in the south, high in the west and low in the east, and low in some parts of the central region; there was a significant seasonal variation in time, with the highest AOD in summer and the lowest in winter. During 2009-2013, the annual average variation of AOD increased by 20.6%, while during 2014-2018, it decreased by 35.3%; (2) The distribution of night-light in Jinan City has progressively expanded, mirroring the city's ongoing development. The spatial distribution of aerosols in urban areas was relatively low compared to the surrounding areas of the city. (3) From 2009 to 2013, there existed a significant positive correlation between the spatial and temporal distribution of AOD and night-light. However, from 2014 to 2018, with the implementation of environmental governance policies, this relationship shifted to a significant negative correlation between the spatial and temporal distribution of AOD and night-light. Through an analysis of the correlation between urban development and aerosol depth in Jinan City over the past decade, it can be concluded that urban development does not inevitably result in elevated AOD levels. Notably, the Jinan government has achieved remarkable results in controlling the atmospheric environment, as evidenced by recent years' improvements.

TI  - Novel Approach to Wind Retrieval from Sentinel-1 SAR in Tropical Cyclones
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The strong winds in tropical cyclones (TCs) are commonly retrieved from cross-polarized SAR images using a geophysical model function (GMF). However, the accuracy of wind retrieval in cross-polarization is significantly reduced at the edges of sub-swaths. In this study, a novel approach to TC wind retrieval from VV polarized SAR images is proposed based on using the azimuthal cutoff wavelength to represent the effect of velocity bunching. A total of 12 dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1 (S-1) images acquired in the interferometric wide (IW) mode were used, five of which were collocated with measurements taken by the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) on board an NOAA aircraft. The SAR-based azimuthal cutoff wavelengths were found to be linearly related to the SFMR wind speeds. Based on this finding, an empirical GMF for TC wind speed retrieval from VV S-1 images was constructed. The inversion results from seven images using this approach were validated against the wind products from the Advanced Scatterometer and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The RMSE of the wind speed was 2.15 m s-1 and the correlation coefficient (COR) was 0.83 at wind speeds of less than 25 m s-1, while the RMSE was 2.66 m s-1 and the COR was 0.97 when compared with wind retrieval using the VH-polarized GMF S1IW.NR at wind speeds greater than 25 m s-1. The proposed algorithm performs well and has two advantages: (1) it is not subject to the saturation problem of the VV backscattering signal and (2) the discontinuity of the retrieval results obtained using VH GMF at the edges of sub-swaths is improved.Les vents forts dans les cyclones tropicaux (TC) sont generalement recuperes a partir d'images RSO en polarisation croisee a l'aide d'une fonction d'un modele geophysique (GMF). Cependant, la precision de l'extraction du vent en polarisation croisee est considerablement reduite sur les bords des fauchees. Dans cette etude, une nouvelle approche d'extraction du vent TC a partir d'images SAR en polarisation VV est proposee basee sur l'utilisation de la longueur d'onde de coupure azimutale pour representer l'effet du regroupement de vitesse. Au total, 12 images Sentinel-1 (S-1) a double polarisation (VV et VH) acquises en mode interferometrique large (IW) ont ete utilisees, dont cinq ont ete colocalisees avec des mesures prises par le radiometre a micro-ondes a frequence echelonnee (SFMR) a bord d'un avion de la NOAA. Les longueurs d'onde de coupure azimutales basees sur le RSO se sont averees lineairement liees aux vitesses du vent SFMR. Sur la base de cette decouverte, un GMF empirique pour l'extraction de la vitesse du vent TC a partir d'images S-1 VV a ete construit. Les resultats d'inversion de sept images utilisant cette approche ont ete valides par rapport aux produits eoliens du diffusometre avance et ceux du Centre europeen pour les previsions meteorologiques a moyen terme. Le RMSE de la vitesse du vent etait de 2.15 m s-1 et le coefficient de correlation (COR) etait de 0.83 a des vitesses de vent inferieures a 25 m s-1, tandis que le RMSE etait de 2.66 m s-1 et le COR etait de 0.97 par rapport a la recuperation du vent a l'aide du GMF en polarisation VH S1IW.NR a des vitesses de vent superieures a 25 m s-1. L'algorithme propose fonctionne bien et presente deux avantages : (1) il n'est pas soumis au probleme de saturation du signal en bande VV et (2) la discontinuite des resultats de recuperation obtenus en utilisant le GMF en bande VH sur les bords des fauchees est reduite.

This study used the Gontougo Region as a study area, which is fast changing in land occupation and most vulnerable to climate change. The machine learning (ML) method through Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a widely used technique for the spatiotemporal evaluation of LULC changes and their effects on land surface temperature (LST). Using Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS images from 2015 to 2022, we analyzed vegetation cover using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and computed LST. Their correlation was significant, and the Pearson correlation (r) was negative for each correlation over the year. The correspondence of the NDVI and LST reclassifications has also shown that non-vegetation land corresponds to very high temperatures (34.33 degrees C-45.22 degrees C in 2015 and 34.26 degrees C-45.81 degrees C in 2022) and that high vegetation land corresponds to low temperatures (17.33 degrees C-28.77 degrees C in 2015 and 16.53 29.11 degrees C in 2022). Moreover, using a random forest algorithm (RFA) and Sentinel-2 images for 2015 and 2022, we obtained six LULC classes: bareland and settlement, forest, waterbody, savannah, annual crops, and perennial crops. The overall accuracy (OA) of each LULC map was 93.77% and 96.01%, respectively. Similarly, the kappa was 0.87 in 2015 and 0.92 in 2022. The LULC classes forest and annual crops lost 48.13% and 65.14%, respectively, of their areas for the benefit of perennial crops from 2015 to 2022. The correlation between LULC and LST showed that the forest class registered the low mean temperature (28.69 degrees C in 2015 and 28.46 degrees C in 2022), and the bareland/settlement registered the highest mean temperature (35.18 degrees C in 2015 and 35.41 degrees C in 2022). The results show that high-resolution images can be used for monitoring biophysical parameters in vegetation and surface temperature and showed benefits for evaluating food security.

TI  - Estimating the health burden of foodborne gastroenteritis caused by non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> in Zhejiang province, China
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As acute gastrointestinal (AGI) disease patients only sometimes seek medical care or submit stool samples for testing, and laboratories cannot detect or identify the pathogen, most cases of foodborne gastroenteritis still need to be identified through public health monitoring. We conducted a population survey and sentinel hospital surveillance to determine the burden of foodborne gastroenteritis caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica (NTS) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, from July 2018 to June 2019 in Zhejiang province, China, and a model for calculating disease burden established. Using the burden of illness pyramid model, we estimated that there were 140.3 cases of NTS infection and 136.2 cases of V. parahaemolyticus infection. We estimated annual incidence per 100,000 population in Zhejiang province as 236 (95% confidence interval [CI] 208-267) and 206 (95% CI 155-232) cases for foodborne NTS and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis, respectively. The results show that AGI caused by these two pathogens constitutes a substantial burden in the Zhejiang population. The health burden of AGI estimations caused by NTS and V. parahaemolyticus in this study can serve as a strategic framework to direct policy and intervention.

TI  - Efficient Test and Characterization of Space Transmit-Receive Modules Using Scalable and Multipurpose Automated Test System
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transmit-Receive (TR) modules are essential requirements of a space borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) used in the earth observation satellites with all-weather and day-night applications. Active array space radars use typically hundreds of TR modules in each satellite. These modules need extensive testing to ensure that they are well matched across the array. The TR modules are tested during the multiple stages of the assembly and integration process and traceability is required at every step. The functioning of the onboard radar hugely depends on the TR module test performance and hence the accurate, fast, and reliable testing of such modules becomes critical to their mass production. Each of the TR module has 15 parameters to test with 20 spot frequencies and the tests are repeated at typically 30 stages implying 9000 readings. To realize the automatic testing of hundreds of the C band dual TR modules of a Radar Imaging Satellite, an advanced automatic test system (ATS) is successfully developed. Conventional testing and set up time for each TR module has been brought down from around 5 hours to 30 mins using the ATS which has additional features of testing single and multiple modules at ambient and environmental test phases. The set-up clearance time is reduced by 96% and test engineer requirement is significantly brought down from 448 to 14 engineer-hours. Multiple TR module test capability using this ATS has reduced the requirement of expensive environmental chambers by 75%. The ATS also has the hardware and software features to store, analyze and present the statistical test results of the large-scale data captured for TR modules over their journey prior to the launch of the satellite. In this paper, the need for an automated, reliable, scalable, and multipurpose test solution for large numbers of space TR module testing and characterisation is explained. The measurable improvements in resource utilization, speed, efficiency, productivity, and flexibility are covered in detail. The test parameters and multi-utility features of the automated test station are detailed along with the test philosophy.

T2  - AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The examination is to emphasize the coastal dynamics and aquaculture site exploration through multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methods in parts of the Indian Sundarbans. The aim of this examination is to ecological disturbances and potential aquaculture land identification by applying satellite Landsat datasets and other certain datasets. Saltwater intrusion because of flood inundation and anthropogenic actions were triggering factors for deforestation, salinity increase, and shoreline change; therefore, diagraming the environmental problems was also significant. Flood-inundated lands are calculated through Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Index-based mapping was applied for environmental degradation throughout the study periods. Around 12 certain criteria are applied for the examination of potential fishery site selection. In this process, the area is characterized by different suitable sites for aquaculture land development. The model output designates the place and magnitude for the expansion of this region in different suitability measures viz., very high suitable 0.16% (1.91 km2), high suitable 20.98% (244.59 km2), moderate suitable 54.94% (640.43 km2), low suitable 12.43% (144.83 km2), very low suitable 0.12% (1.35 km2), and not suitable 11.37% (132.53 km2).Remote sensing (RS) and GIS applications are applied for the aquaculture land identification based on selected criteria. These outcomes help to generate employment, creative application of the region, and informally fluctuated and economically retrograde people of this location. The analysis helps organizers to design plans to connect maximum fish biomass and to originate community assistance from inland open waters in the area.

TI  - The influence of heterogeneity on the strength of volcanic rocks and the stability of lava domes
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse of lava domes, inherently heterogeneous structures, represents a significant volcanic hazard. Numerical and analogue models designed to model dome instability and collapse have incorporated heterogeneity in the form of discrete zones with homogeneous properties. Based on an assessment of dome rock heterogeneity, we explore whether material property heterogeneity ("diffuse" heterogeneity) within these discrete zones can promote dome instability. X-ray computed tomography shows that dome samples are characterised by high microstructural heterogeneities; e.g. porosity varies from 0.07 to 0.20 over millimetric length scales. To explore how microstructural heterogeneity influences sample-scale strength, we performed numerical simulations using Rock Failure and Process Analysis. The mean mechanical properties of the numerical samples were constant, and we introduced heterogeneity by varying their distribution using a Weibull probability function. The models show that increasing heterogeneity can reduce sample-scale strength by more than a factor of 2. To explore the influence of dome-scale heterogeneity, we numerically generated lava domes in Particle Flow Code. The domes have the same bulk strength but are characterised by different degrees of heterogeneity by varying the distribution of cohesion using a Weibull probability function. The models show that a greater degree of heterogeneity induces higher dome-scale displacements and that, when there is also a discrete weakened zone, the addition of diffuse heterogeneity leads to more widely distributed deformation. Therefore, alongside discrete zones defined by different material properties, we find that the diffuse heterogeneity inherent to a dome is sufficient to compromise dome stability and should be incorporated in future modelling endeavours.

TI  - An improved change detection method for tacking remote sensing time series trends
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - To improve the accuracy of detecting changes in remote sensing time series, an improved algorithm based on the combination of the antileakage least-squares spectral analysis (ALLSSA) algorithm and detecting breakpoints and estimating segments in trends (DBEST) algorithm is proposed and applied. The method uses the ALLSSA algorithm to decompose the time series and identify the trend components in the time series. Then, the trend segmentation mechanism of the DBEST algorithm is used to detect the changes in the trend component. In this paper, the improved algorithm is evaluated using a simulated time series data set, a time series data set with multiple change points, and data set based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) remote sensing time series. The results demonstrate that the average detection accuracies of the improved algorithm and DBEST algorithm are 98.4% and 85.2%, respectively, for the simulated time series data set. For the time series data set with multiple change points, the average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the trend data for the improved and DBEST algorithms are 0.0386 and 0.0331, respectively. The mean normalized residual norms (MNRNs) of the improved and DBEST algorithms are 0.0252 and 0.0351, respectively. Finally, the improved algorithm, DBEST algorithm, and breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) algorithm are applied to MODIS NDVI data, and their performance with remote sensing data is compared. The improved algorithm has higher detection accuracy and a smaller MNRN, indicating that more information is included in the trend and seasonal components. Therefore, the proposed method is useful for analysing trends in remote sensing time series data.

TI  - Assessment of satellite-based Net Primary Productivity models in different biogeochemical provinces over the northern Indian Ocean
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The biological productivity in the oceanic ecosystem plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle and energy flow in the oceanic food chain. Therefore, proper monitoring of phytoplankton primary production in the ocean is essential to understand the role and responses of aquatic ecosystems to global climate change. Its quantification is also important for higher trophic-level studies and sustainable ecosystem management. The advent of satellite technology has provided an opportunity to retrieve Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, for efficient utilization of satellite NPP it is imperative to assess the models for their accuracy and variability. The present study described NPP estimated from MODIS-Aqua satellite data (2003-2021) using five models (VGPM, Eppley-VGPM, CbPM, CAFE, and SABPM) and their variability in the four biogeochemical provinces (ARAB, MONS, INDW and INDE) in the northern Indian Ocean. The temporal variability indicated all models exhibit seasonal variability in ARAB and INDW with two prominent peaks during peak southwest monsoon (June-August) and winter monsoon (December-January). However, there was significant difference in the magnitude. The seasonal peak was primarily due to increase in NPP due to summer upwelling and winter mixing. The spatially averaged diversity index indicated maximum variability in INDW (74.6-77.1%), followed by INDE (77.2-78.0%), ARAB (77.2-78.4%), and MONS (78.6-78.9%). The satellite retrieved NPP by various models showed maximum diversity in the region above 15 & DEG;N and west of 60 & DEG;E in AS and 20 & DEG;N and east 90 & DEG;E in the BoB indicating a significant influence of discharge from perennial rivers resulting in poor performance of the models in these regions. The variability of other models was then assessed with respect CbPM as the model was known to perform better. The Eppley-VGPM showed a maximum (55%) and SABPM showed a minimum (11%) Mean Absolute Percentage Difference with respect to CbPM. The long-term spatio-temporal and quantifiable variability between the NPP models, and biogeochemical provinces, indicated that the study provided useful information on the selection and utilization of an appropriate model for future sustainability and climate change studies.

TI  - Behavioural, demographic and fitness consequences of social instability in cooperatively breeding dwarf mongoose groups
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Social instability frequently arises in group-living species, but the potential costs have rarely been investigated in free-living cooperative breeders, especially across different timeframes. Using natural observations, body mass measurements and life-history data from dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula), we determined the short- and long-term consequences of a change in one of the dominant breeding pairs. We found that a new breeder led to alterations in both collective and individual behaviours (i.e. increases in communal scent-marking, engagement in intergroup interactions, sentinel activity and within-group grooming), as well as reduced body mass gain, further demographic changes and decreased reproductive success (i.e. fewer pups surviving to adulthood). The effects were particularly apparent when it was the female breeder who changed; new female breeders were younger than more experienced counterparts. Our findings support the idea that stability and cooperation are strongly linked and provide potential reasons for previously documented health and fitness benefits of social stability.

TI  - Development of novel tracers for sentinel node identification in cervical cancer
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is used for lymphatic mapping. However, binding of ICG to blood proteins like serum albumin can shorten its retention time in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Here, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a new fluorescence tracer comprising phytate and liposome (LP)-encapsulated ICG. Coadministration of phytate with LP containing phosphatidic acid promotes chelation mediated by Ca2+ in bodily fluids to enhance SLN retention. Uniformly sized LPs (100 nm) encapsulating ICG under conditions that minimized fluorescence self-quenching during storage were produced. We analyzed the behavior of the new tracer (ICG-phytate-LP) and control tracers (ICG and ICG-LP) in the lymphatic flow of mice in terms of lymph node retention time. We also tested lymphatic flow and safety in pigs that have a more human-like lymphatic system. LPs encapsulating stabilized ICG were successfully prepared. Mixing LP with phytate in the presence of Ca2+ increased both the particle size and negative surface charge. In mice, ICG-phytate-LP had the best lymph node retention, with a fluorescence intensity ratio that increased over 6 h and then decreased slowly over the next 24 h. In pigs, administration of ICG and ICG-phytate-LP resulted in no death or weight loss. There were no obvious differences between blood test results for the ICG and ICG-phytate-LP groups, and the overall safety was good. ICG-phytate-LP may be a useful new tracer for gynecological cancers that require time for lymph node identification due to a retroperitoneal approach.

TI  - Estrogens and endocrine-disrupting chemicals differentially impact the bioenergetic fluxes of mammary epithelial cells in two- and three-dimensional models
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its sensitivity to hormonal signaling, the mammary gland is often referred to as a sentinel organ for the study of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), environmental pollutants that can interfere with the estrogen signaling pathway and induce mammary developmental defects. If and how EDCs impact mammary epithelial cell metabolism has not yet been documented. Herein, to study how estrogens and EDCs modulate mammary gland metabolism, we performed bioenergetic flux analyses using mouse mammary epithelial organoids compared to cells grown in monolayer culture. Several EDCs were tested, including bisphenol A (BPA), its close derivative BPS, a new BPA replacement copolyester called TritanTM, and the herbicide glyphosate. We report that estrogens reprogrammed mammary epithelial cell metabolism differently when grown in two- and threedimensional models. Specific EDCs were also demonstrated to alter bioenergetic fluxes, thus identifying a new potential adverse effect of these molecules. Notably, organoids were more sensitive to low EDC concentrations, highlighting them as a key model for screening the impact of various environmental pollutants. Mechanistically, transcriptomic analyses revealed that EDCs interfered with the regulation of estrogen target genes and the expression of metabolic genes in organoids. Furthermore, co-treatment with the anti-estrogen fulvestrant blocked these metabolic impacts of EDCs, suggesting that, at least partially, they act through modulation of the estrogen receptor activity. Finally, we demonstrate that mammary organoids can be used for long-term studies on EDC exposure to study alterations in organogenesis/morphogenesis and that past pregnancies can modulate the sensitivity of mammary epithelial organoids to specific EDCs. Overall, this study demonstrates that estrogens and EDCs modulate mammary epithelial cell metabolism in monolayer and organoid cultures. A better understanding of the metabolic impacts of EDCs will allow a better appreciation of their adverse effects on mammary gland development and function.

TI  - Wildlife as sentinels of compliance with law: An example with GPS-tagged scavengers and sanitary regulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Monitoring compliance with environmental laws is essential to overcoming possible implementation shortfalls jeopardizing their effectiveness. Besides improving our ecological understanding of wildlife, remote tracking technologies also allow us to take advantage of such ecological knowledge to use wildlife as sentinels of compliance with law.We illustrate this sentinel potential of wildlife using GPS tracking of large scavengers with complementary functional traits (i.e. 21 griffon vultures and 13 wolves) to assess compliance with EU sanitary regulations allowing livestock carcass disposal in the field.Wildlife sentinels allowed the systematic evaluation of 489 livestock carcasses left in the field, which revealed an important mismatch between on-paper and in-reality implementation of these regulations. While <45% of the carcasses were placed in authorized areas, compliance with all the criteria required by the regulations on livestock carcass disposal (e.g. from carcass characteristics such as species, age or production system to its location far away from water, buildings or roads) ranged from 0% to 4.2%, with no major differences between regions with uneven implementation.Major gaps in compliance pointed towards insufficient and over-bureaucratized designation of scavenger feeding zones, where livestock carcass disposal is authorized. The indiscriminate nature of distance criteria from carcasses to watercourses, buildings and infrastructure further affected compliance.Synthesis and applications. GPS-tagged scavengers allow the on-ground monitoring of carcasses, the addressing of potential risks for wildlife, livestock and human health, the quantitative assessment of compliance with the law and would improve estimates of carcass availability, substantially contributing to more effective legislation enforcement. Our results show the huge potential of GPS-tagged wildlife as sentinels for monitoring compliance to enhance the environmental rule of law.

TI  - Accelerometer-based detection of African swine fever infection in wild boar
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Infectious wildlife diseases that circulate at the interface with domestic animals pose significant threats worldwide and require early detection and warning. Although animal tracking technologies are used to discern behavioural changes, they are rarely used to monitor wildlife diseases. Common disease-induced behavioural changes include reduced activity and lethargy ('sickness behaviour'). Here, we investigated whether accelerometer sensors could detect the onset of African swine fever (ASF), a viral infection that induces high mortality in suids for which no vaccine is currently available. Taking advantage of an experiment designed to test an oral ASF vaccine, we equipped 12 wild boars with an accelerometer tag and quantified how ASF affects their activity pattern and behavioural fingerprint, using overall dynamic body acceleration. Wild boars showed a daily reduction in activity of 10-20% from the healthy to the viremia phase. Using change point statistics and comparing healthy individuals living in semi-free and free-ranging conditions, we show how the onset of disease-induced sickness can be detected and how such early detection could work in natural settings. Timely detection of infection in animals is crucial for disease surveillance and control, and accelerometer technology on sentinel animals provides a viable complementary tool to existing disease management approaches.

AB  - On the one hand, research on religious education is done according to a transnational scientific paradigm, on the other hand, it is performed within particular institutional contexts which vary from nation to nation.This raises the question of how institutional context affect research on religious education. The paper addresses this question on the basis of an international study. N = 49 colleagues across Europe as well as Israel, South Africa, South Korea, and Turkey filled in an online-questionnaire regarding their own research. Despite the international character of the sample, research on religious education seems to be practiced quite coherently in regard of the objects of inquiry, the applied methods, and the disciplines the colleagues refer to. The few significant differences indicate that theology and educational studies are slightly more important in contexts of denominational religious education as well as analysing both pupils and processes of teaching and learning. In the context of non-denominational RE, instead, religious studies is slightly more important. These results will be discussed.

TI  - InSAR-based landslide detection method with the assistance of <i>C</i>-index
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been increasingly used in landslide detection over wide areas. However, atmospheric delays, phase unwrapping errors, and noise, which behave like deformation signals in InSAR deformation results, pose a challenge for semi-automatic and automatic landslide detection. C-index can assistant in landslide interpretation by assessing the rationality of InSAR deformation and filtering out non-real landslide deformation signals. Yet, few studies have analyzed its applicability in identifying landslide from InSAR results. In this study, we develop a method that uses C-index to assist in landslide detection using InSAR. We validate our method in a selected region of the Jinsha River basin, China. We first using multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) to obtain the deformation rate of the study area. Sixty-nine and 47 suspicious slope deformation areas are extracted from the ascending and descending deformation results, respectively. Next, C-index is used to automatically exclude 28 and 12 false deformation areas from the ascending and descending InSAR results, respectively. Remarkably, all the excluded false deformation areas do not correspond to landslides, suggesting the reliability of the proposed method. Finally, by visually interpreting the optical images of the remaining deformation results, we successfully detect 54 landslides. Among these, 9 landslides can be detected by both the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data, and 15 landslides are located on the riverbanks, posing a potential risk of river blockage in the event of failure. The presented landslide detection method effectively filters out false deformation areas, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of landslide detection over wide areas using InSAR.

TI  - A review of contrast-enhanced ultrasound using SonoVue® and SonazoidTM in non-hepatic organs
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a dependable modality for the diagnosis of various clinical conditions. A judicious selection of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) is imperative for optimizing imaging and improving diagnosis. Approved UCAs for imaging the majority of organs include SonoVue, a pure blood agent, and Sonazoid, which exhibits an additional Kupffer phase. Despite the fact that the two UCAs are increasingly being employed, there is a lack of comparative reviews between the two agents in different organs diseases. This review represents the first attempt to compare the two UCAs in non-hepatic organs, primarily including breast, thyroid, pancreas, and spleen diseases. Through comparative analysis, this review provides a comprehensive and objective evaluation of the performance characteristics of SonoVue and Sonazoid, with the aim of offering valuable guidance for the clinical application of CEUS. Overall, further clinical evidences are required to compare and contrast the dissimilarities between the two UCAs in non-hepatic organs, enabling clinicians to make an appropriate selection based on actual clinical applications.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variations in surface NO2 for Beijing reconstructed from surface data and satellite retrievals.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Remote sensing data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) play important roles in estimating surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2), but few studies have compared their differences for application in surface NO2 reconstruction. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of incorporating the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) from OMI and TROPOMI (hereafter referred to as OMI and TROPOMI, respectively, for conciseness) for deriving surface NO2 and to apply the resulting data to revisit the spatiotemporal variations in surface NO2 for Beijing over the 2005-2020 period during which there were significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions. In the OMI versus TROPOMI performance comparison, the cross-validation R2 values were 0.73 and 0.72, respectively, at 1km resolution and 0.69 for both at 100m resolution. The comparisons between satellite data sources indicate that even though TROPOMI has a finer resolution it does not improve upon OMI for deriving surface NO2 at 1km resolution, especially for analyzing long-term trends. In light of the comparison results, we used a hybrid approach based on machine learning to derive the spatiotemporal distribution of surface NO2 during 2005-2020 based on OMI. We had novel, independent passive sampling data collected weekly from July to September of 2008 for hindcasting validation and found a spatiotemporal R2 of 0.46 (RMSE=7.0ppb). Regarding the long-term trend of surface NO2, the level in 2008 was obviously lower than that in 2007 and 2009, as expected, which was attributed to pollution restrictions during the Olympic Games. The NO2 level started to steadily decline from 2015 and fell below 2008's level after 2017. Based on OMI, a long-term and fine-resolution surface NO2 dataset was developed for Beijing to support future environmental management questions and epidemiological research.

TI  - Development and testing of an integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model for simulations of agro-hydrological processes in a groundwater-fed plain in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater depletion due to irrigation pumping in major food-producing regions has become a global concern. There is a need to establish a useful tool that can simulate the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Groundwater Continuum (SPAGC) system to evaluate various water-saving measures and agronomic practices for groundwater conser-vation and food security. This study developed an integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model, that could make full use of the advantages of APEX and SWAT-GW. The APEX-SWAT-GW model is applied to a representative groundwater overexploited area (22,753 km2) in the North China Plain (NCP). Good agreements were obtained in simulated results of wheat and maize yields, evapotranspiration (ET), and groundwater table depth in comparison with statistical data, remote sensing data, and monitoring well data. By testing simulations of water-limited irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, the model was found to be a useful tool for simulating agro-hydrological processes in areas where groundwater is over-exploited and selecting alternative irrigation management practices.

TI  - Variability of Sentinel Lymph Node Location in Patients with Trunk Melanoma.
T2  - Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - (1) Background: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of neoplasia, and the management of this pathology requires a correct staging, as well as a personalized modern oncological treatment. The main objective of the study is to determine the variability of the lymphatic drainage for patients with melanomas located on the trunk and, secondarily, to determine the features of individuals who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) depending on the exact location on the trunk. (2) Methods: This retrospective, observational, single-center study included 62 cases of trunk melanoma operated between July 2019 and March 2023, in which SLNB was performed and a total of 84 lymph nodes were excised. (3) Results: Patients had a median age of 54.5 (33-78) years, with 58.1% being male; the melanomas had a median Breslow index of 2.3 (0.5-12.5) mm. Approximately 64.3% of the cohort had melanoma on the upper part of the trunk (54 cases) and 35.7% had it on the lower part (30 cases). The type of anesthesia chosen was general anesthesia in 53 cases and spinal anesthesia in 9 cases (85.5% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.001). The number of sentinel lymph nodes excised was 54 for melanomas located on the upper part of the trunk (8 cervical and 46 axillary) and 30 sentinel lymph nodes for melanomas of the lower part of the trunk (16 at the axillary level and 14 at the inguinal level). Out of the 54 LNs identified in patients with melanoma on the upper part of the trunk, 13 were positive, with a total of 12 positive lymph nodes (LNs) from the axillar basin, and only one from the cervical region. Additionally, the incidence of patients with a minimum of two identified sentinel lymph nodes was 32.2%, with a total of seven having LN involvement in two basins, and only one of these cases showed positivity for malignancy. (4) Conclusions: SLNBs were more frequent in the axillary region overall, and had more positive SLNs. Moreover, melanoma on the upper part of the trunk had a higher rate of positive SLNs compared to the lower part. Tumors located on the lower part of the truck had more positive SLNs in the axillary region than in the inguinal one.

TI  - Detection of forest windthrows with bitemporal COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind represents a primary source of disturbances in forests, necessitating an assessment of the resulting damage to ensure appropriate forest management. Remote sensing, encompassing both active and passive techniques, offers a valuable and efficient approach for this purpose, enabling coverage of large areas while being costeffective. Passive remote sensing data could be affected by the presence of clouds, unlike active systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which are relatively less affected. Therefore, this study aims to explore the utilization of bitemporal SAR data for windthrow detection in mountainous regions. Specifically, we investigated how the detection outcomes vary based on three factors: i) the SAR wavelength (X-band or C-band), ii) the acquisition period of the pre- and post-event images (summer, autumn, or winter), and iii) the forest type (evergreen vs. deciduous). Our analysis considers two SAR satellite constellations: COSMO-SkyMed (band-X, with a pixel spacing of 2.5 m and 10 m) and Sentinel-1 (band-C, with a pixel spacing of 10 m). We focused on three study sites located in the Trentino-South Tyrol region of Italy, which experienced significant forest damage during the Vaia storm from 27th to 30th October 2018. To accomplish our objectives, we employed a detailpreserving, scale-driven approach for change detection in bitemporal SAR data. The results demonstrate that: i) the algorithm exhibits notably better performance when utilizing X-band data, achieving a highest kappa accuracy of 0.473 and a balanced accuracy of 76.1%; ii) the pixel spacing has an influence on the accuracy, with COSMO-SkyMed data achieving kappa values of 0.473 and 0.394 at pixel spacings of 2.5 m and 10 m, respectively; iii) the post-event image acquisition season significantly affects the algorithm's performance, with summer imagery yielding superior results compared to winter imagery; and iv) the forest type (evergreen vs. deciduous) has a noticeable impact on the results, particularly when considering autumn/winter data.

TI  - Lithology classification of igneous rocks using C-band and L-band dual-polarization SAR data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing different kinds of igneous rocks is difficult because of their subtle differences. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is sensitive to rock surface morphology, which can help a lot in classification. Dual-pol SAR data have the advantages of low cost, but few articles are using only dual-pol SAR data for igneous rock classification. In this study, we explored the performance of dual-pol SAR data in distinguishing granitoid, tuff, and syenite porphyry. Backscatter coefficients, polarization decomposition parameters, and texture features from gray-level co-occurrence matrix extracted by Sentinel-1 or PALSAR were classified using several machine learning algorithms. The results are as follows. First, the texture information has greater potential for igneous rock classification, but the polarization decomposition parameters contribute less. Second, after comparing machine learning algorithms, AdaBoost algorithm has the highest overall accuracy for either C-band or L-band SAR data. C-band SAR data provide better classification results than L-band. Finally, tuff is the easiest igneous rock to be successfully classified, and L-band dual-pol SAR data have advantages in the discrimination of syenite porphyry. This study outlines the effectiveness of dual-pol SAR data for igneous rock classification, which will help to select SAR data of appropriate wavelengths for specific types of lithology discrimination.

TI  - Analyzing the role of soil and vegetation spatial variability in modelling hydrological processes for irrigation optimization at large scale
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The main purpose of this paper was to study the effect of spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties (HP) and vegetation parameters (VP) (e.g., leaf-area index, LAI, and crop coefficient, Kc) on modelling agro-hydrological processes and optimising irrigation volumes at large scale. Based on this analysis, the effect of partly overlooking the spatial variability of soil HP and/or VP inputs was verified on a 140 ha irrigation sector in "Sinistra Ofanto" irrigation system in Apulia Region, Southern Italy. Five soil profiles were excavated and the HP were measured in all the soil horizons. Additionally, measurements of soil HP were taken in the surface soil layer in ninety sites distributed over the whole irrigation sector. All the HP measurements were carried out using tension infiltrometer. Remote sensing applications were used to obtain LAI and Kc using European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 images with 10 m resolutions. First, distributed (on ninety polygons with an average area of about 1.5 ha) optimal irrigation volumes and related deep percolation volumes at a depth of 80 cm, were computed using an agro-hydrological model and accounting for the actual observed variability of soil HP and VP inputs. The sector scale irrigation and deep percolation volumes were obtained by aggregating the distributed irrigation volumes. This was considered as the reference scenario (hereafter DVS-Detailed Variability Scenario). Then, reduced variability scenarios (hereafter RVS-Reduced Variability Scenario) were considered, where the information on the actual spatial variability of the soil HP and VP was gradually overlooked to find the minimum data set needed to still have sector scale irrigation volumes and related deep percolation volumes comparable to those obtained under the DVS. Results showed that overlooking VP (RVS-VP) variability did not significantly change the optimal irrigation volumes and the deep percolation fluxes. By contrast, neglecting the HP variability (RVS-HP) showed significant effects on both the irrigation and percolation volumes compared to the DVS. The main practical finding was that, at least for the area investigated in this study, hydraulic characterization of one soil profile in an area of approximately 30 ha provides sector scale irrigation volumes and percolation fluxes comparable to those obtained under the DVS, thus by accounting for all the observed local variability.

TI  - Unraveling the complexities of land transformation and its impact on urban sustainability through land surface temperature analysis
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the ongoing population increase over the past years, fast and unchecked urbanization has been occurring in the urban centers of developing nations like India. As a result, land transformation is taking place at a fast pace leading to the creation of urban heat island (UHI). Urban heat island (UHI) constitutes a significant human alteration to the Earth system. Hence, this study presents a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the impact of land use and cover on land surface temperature (LST) in Aligarh City, Uttar Pradesh, India, using multi-dimensional satellite data. The research collected Landsat data for four different phases (1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021) and analyzed it in conjunction with land use and cover (LULC) data to identify trends and variations. The result shows a consistent increase in LST since 1991, with built-up and bare land areas exhibiting the highest temperatures across all phases. Moreover, the study found that impervious land had the most significant effect on LST, followed by water bodies and vegetation cover. The analysis of the proportion of the area with the lowest and highest LST showed interesting trends, with a greater portion of Aligarh City experiencing a temperature range between 15 and 16 & DEG;C in 2021 compared to previous years. However, the study also found that 13.55% of the area had a maximum LST of over 17 & DEG;C, which is higher than the previous measurement of 9.04%, and has been steadily increasing since 1991. The accuracy of the study was verified by detecting elevated temperatures in non-porous areas and cooler temperatures near green zones and water bodies. This study's contribution to the research community lies in the data-driven, systematic analysis of the complex relationship between land use and cover and LST in an urban environment. The study's findings suggest that alterations in land use/cover patterns have a significant impact on LST, which has important implications for urban planning policies. The research provides valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and city officials, as it highlights the need for sustainable and efficient urban planning policies to mitigate the effects of urban heat islands and rising temperatures. The study's results have broader implications beyond Aligarh City and can inform land-use planning and policymaking in other cities facing similar challenges. This research presents a comprehensive analysis that can serve as a framework to inform land-use planning and policymaking, contributing to the development of sustainable and efficient urban environments.

AB  - BackgroundElective neck dissection improves survival in early oral cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may also do this with less morbidity. This systematic review compared health-related quality of life, functional outcomes, and complications after sentinel lymph node biopsy and elective neck dissection in early oral cancer.MethodsPRISMA guidelines were followed. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria.ResultsResults favoring sentinel lymph node biopsy were found in complications, scar length and appearance, length of hospital stay, time to drain removal, and objective shoulder measures at timepoints up to 12 months. Where differences in health-related quality of life were found, methodological issues make their clinical significance questionable.ConclusionsSentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with fewer complications and statistically better outcomes in a number of physical measures. There is as yet no strong evidence to suggest it is associated with better health-related quality of life outcomes. While a number of health-related quality of life outcome measures show promise, their interpretation is hampered by methodological concerns. Further rigorous research is required to address this.

TI  - Variability of the phytoplankton biomass in the southwestern Bay of Bengal from 2003 to 2018
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bay of Bengal (BoB) has distinctive hydrological characteristics, and various physical mechanisms strongly influence the growth of phytoplankton in this region. In this work, we investigated the monthly and interannual variations of phytoplankton biomass (PB) in the southwestern (SW) BoB (78-88 degrees E, 0-15 degrees N) utilizing satellite data from 2003 to 2018. Bivariate wavelet coherence (BWC) and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC) analyses were conducted to assess the temporal fluctuations in various physical oceanographic parameters. The findings revealed that wind speed (WSP) and sea surface temperature (SST) were the main drivers for the monthly variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The southwest monsoon promoted the formation of upwelling by offshore Ekman transport via the southwest monsoon current (SMC) and the upward Ekman pumping induced by the strong positive wind stress curl, which brought nutrient-rich, cold waters from the subsurface to the surface, stimulating phytoplankton growth. The BWC analysis results identified WSP as the most effective individual factor accounting for the interannual fluctuations in Chl-a concentrations. The MWC analysis results unraveled that the combinations of WSP-SST, WSP-Nin & SIM;o 3.4, WSP-EPV, and WSP-DMI exhibited the strongest relationships with the changes in Chl-a in the SW BoB. The PB in 2015 demonstrated abnormally low values. The El Nin & SIM;o event in 2015 substantially weakened the southwest monsoon and current, possibly weakening the Ekman transport on the southern coast of Sri Lanka and India. Moreover, an abnormally intensified anticyclonic eddy occurred in this region. These processes disrupted the vertical exchange of nutrients, obstructing the vertical transport of nutrient-enriched subsurface waters and leading to abnormally decreased levels of Chl-a in 2015.

T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite the known efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, the rates of individuals undergoing such testing have remained lower than target thresholds, even prior to the healthcare disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CRC screening within a nationally representative US population and assessed disparities in screening across racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic (SES) strata.Methods: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study using all eligible TRICARE beneficiaries aged 45-64 years between FY 2018 and 2021. High-risk individuals, those with a previous or current CRC diagnosis, and/or a personal/family history of colonic polyps, were excluded. The pre-COVID-19 period (September 1, 2018-March 31, 2020) was compared to the COVID-19 period (April 1, 2020-September 30, 2021). Secondary analyses were performed, evaluating the interaction between the COVID-19 time period, race, and our proxy for socioeconomic status.Results: During the study period, we identified 1,749,688 eligible individuals. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CRC screening overall decreased from 34% in the pre-pandemic period to 30% following the onset of the pandemic (p < 0.001). This finding persisted even after adjusting for confounders in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR] for the pandemic timeframe: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.31; p < 0.001). In the setting of SES, in the pandemic period, the odds of individuals from both Senior Enlisted (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.56) and Junior Enlisted sponsor ranks (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.30) were diminished as compared to Senior Officers.Conclusions and Relevance: We found a 21% reduction in the odds of CRC screening in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reductions in colonoscopies and other types of screening tests were not offset by changes in the use of at-home tests such as Cologuard.

TI  - Systematic investigation of surgical site infections (SSI) in plastic reconstructive and aesthetic surgery (ERCS): Feedback
T2  - ANNALES DE CHIRURGIE PLASTIQUE ESTHETIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical site infection (SSI) in plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery (ERCP) is quite uncommon compared to other surgical specialities but remains one of the main complications. The aim of our study was to provide feedback on the systematic investigation of SSI in ERCP.This is a monocentric retrospective study, including all paediatric and adult patients who have undergone ERCP surgery between 01/01/2014 and 31/12/2021. During this period, the department systematically investigated all SSI cases.Eight thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight surgical procedures were performed. The SSI rate was 0.34%. Thirty SSIs (19 W,11 M), with a mean age of 56 years (none paediatric), were investigated.Twenty-seven patients suffered from comorbidities. The surgical indications included 17 cases of skin cancer, 7 cases of weight loss, 4 cases of breast reconstruction, 1 lipoma, 1 pectus excavatum.Eleven surgeries consisted in lymphnode procedures (8 sentinel lymphnodes, 3 curage). The average operating time was 116 minutes. Nineteen patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. The average time to onset of SSI after surgery was 10 days. The most prevalent bacteria were commensals of the skin flora and the digestive tract. Apart from surgical management, 100% of patients were treated with antibiotics.High age, multiple comorbidities, long, combined procedures, placement of equipment, lymph node surgery, post-operative punctures on implanted equipment, are all risks factors for SSI.The implementation of a systematic monitoring of SSI within our department has provided us with the opportunity to analyse our data in real time and allow us to adjust our practices if necessary. This process can be used in other plastic reconstructive and aesthetic surgery departments. The collection and analysis of SSIs is both easily done and the procedure is well standardized. The assistance of the operational hygiene team is a key asset for the success of this project. The development of this type of procedure on a national level could be an asset to improve the management of SSI by taking advantage of the experience of a larger number of centres.

TI  - The role of land use and land cover changes in triggering soil losses in the SE Alentejo, Portugal
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study analyses and interprets the effects of historical and contemporary land use and cover changes (LULC) on soil erosion in the Serra de Mertola region, Portugal, by using the 58 years of measurements in 8 x 22 m erosion plots at the Vale Formoso Erosion Centre and employing methodologies including field observations, aerial image analysis and Landsat NDVI trend assessment. Land cover and management changes, influenced by agricultural policies since the early 20th century, notably during the wheat campaigns of the fascist regime, have exacerbated soil erosion, with the highest rates observed in vertical fallow (964 g m(-2) yr(-1)), wheat (90 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and horizontal fallow (66 g m(-2) yr(-1)). These practices continue to be somewhat relevant today, as cereal production is still being subsidized. However, Quercus, Pines-introduced since agrarian reforms and Portugal's entry into the common agricultural policy (CAP)-and spontaneous vegetation from CAP's set-aside policies and recent land abandonment trends show lower erosion rates, underlining vegetation's role in erosion protection. Using NDVI trend analysis, we distinguish between natural fluctuations and land cover changes impacts. Understanding these changes and how they relate to slope and valley floor dynamics, such as incision, aggradation or stabilization, is crucial for recognizing human influences on the earth's surface. Our research highlights sustainable land management's role in reducing soil erosion in desertification-prone areas.

TI  - Developing a new technology for demonstrating environmental sustainability in the Australian grassfed beef industry
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meeting the increasing consumer and market expectations for sustainably produced beef requires measurement and demonstration of the producers' sustainability practices. Typically, demonstration of sustainable production relies on time consuming and costly on-ground audits. Online tools using combinations of remotely sensed data and other information sources could offer a cost-effective alternative. However, there are also concerns about the merits and risks of such tools. This paper presents a case of the development process of an online platform for Australian beef producers to demonstrate their sustainable production practices, connected with learning opportunities for continual improvement of their sustainability performance. The project is led by an innovative cross-sectoral collaboration of beef industry, non-government organisation and university partners. Our approach combines producer and market perspectives; focusing on the "value proposition" of the proposed technology for producers, and value chains' priorities in sustainability markets and in having the ability to demonstrate sustainability in a cost-effective manner. The development process adopted co-design at three levels: (1) the "Consortium" of project partners (2) collaborative co-design through small online groups with producers and value chain representatives; and (3) consultative co-design through producer testing of the platform as it is built by software developers. The design process focused on five themes: tree cover, ground cover, biodiversity stewardship, carbon balance, and drought resilience. We present the main platform design characteristics sought by the co-design groups, and the indicators and measures they considered important for each of the five themes. We then discuss a set of key issues and their implications for technology development, according to a framework expressing interactions between people and their properties, processes and technology. This case shows the importance of taking a "demand-led" rather than a "supply-driven" approach, for the best possible fit of new technology to its users. Since co-design is more often consultative than treating users as equals or leaders in a technology design process, our case highlights the desirability of a fully collaborative approach to co-design.

TI  - The sovereign citizen superconspiracy: Contemporary issues in native title anthropology
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Australian Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) provides for the recognition of rights and interests which arise from the traditional laws and customs of Australian First Nation peoples. Processing applications for a determination of native title can take many years and involves numerous stakeholders, presentation of evidence of ongoing connection with the land and sea within a claim area, negotiations with other parties including from industry and government, as well as negotiations between Indigenous groups. The process can be long, arduous, and often outcomes fail to satisfy the expectations of native title claimants. In this paper we investigate how individuals who either disagree with the premise underlying native title, or who have suffered negative impacts through the course of native title claims, may be either targeted by, or swept up in, Australian sovereign citizen rhetoric. We aim to contextualise presentations of sovereign citizen ideas in native title claim processes by providing an overview of the history of sovereign citizen thought, and examples of its contemporary expression in some Australian online forums. In doing this we aim to provide a broad foundation for future research into the issue. The dialogue in sovereign citizen online communities exposes people to extremism and superconspiracies. This article will provide a theoretical framework and historical context to the Australian sovereign citizen phenomena and describe online amplification of disinformation in Australia that has the potential to cause harm. We illustrate how stakeholders who are drawn to relatively moderate online content (such as opposing native title) may be radicalised through gradual exposure to extremist anti-government sentiment and hate speech. This article highlights the need for further research into sovereign citizenry in Australia, and strategies for native title practitioners to engage claimants who subscribe to and disseminate sovereign citizen disinformation in native title processes.

TI  - Drought characteristics and dominant factors across China: Insights from high-resolution daily SPEI dataset between 1979 and 2018
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, a complex phenomenon exacerbated by climate change, is influenced by various climate factors. The escalating global temperatures associated with climate change, impact precipitation patterns and water cycle processes, consequently intensifying the occurrence and severity of droughts. To effectively address and adapt to these challenges, it is crucial to identify the dominant climate factors driving drought events. In this study, we utilized the 1979-2018 Chinese meteorological forcing dataset to calculate the daily Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall (M-K) tests were employed to analyze the spatial and temporal trends of drought severity and duration. Additionally, partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between climate factors (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET)) and drought characteristic (drought severity and duration). Through this comprehensive analysis, we aimed to identify the primary factors influencing drought severity and duration. The findings revealed the following key results: (1) Over the 40-year period from 1979 to 2018, drought trends in China and its seven climate divisions exhibited an increasing pattern. (2) During drought periods, most regions exhibited a positive correlation between PET and drought severity and duration, while precipitation demonstrated a negative correlation. However, certain areas experiencing severe drought displayed a negative correlation between PET and drought severity and duration, precipitation demonstrated a positive correlation with drought severity and duration. (3) PET emerged as the dominant climatic factor for meteorological drought in the majority of China. These findings contribute valuable insights for policymakers in the development of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. By understanding the dominant climate factors driving drought events, policymakers can implement effective measures to mitigate the adverse socioeconomic and environmental impacts associated with climate change.

TI  - Validation of the multi-satellite merged sea surface salinity in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) is an essential variable of ocean dynamics and climate research. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Aquarius, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite missions all provide SSS measurements. The European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Sea Surface Salinity (CCI-SSS) project merged these three satellite SSS data to produce CCI L4 SSS products. We validated the accuracy of the four satellite products (CCI, SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP) using in-situ gridded data and Argo floats in the South China Sea (SCS). Compared with in-situ gridded data, it shows that the CCI achieved the best performance (RMSD: 0.365) on monthly time scales. The RMSD of SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP (SMOS: 0.389; Aquarius: 0.409; SMAP: 0.391) are close, and the SMOS takes a slight advantage in contrast with Aquarius and SMAP. Large discrepancies can be found near the coastline and in the shelf seas. Meanwhile, CCI with lower RMSD (0.295) perform better than single satellite data (SMOS: 0.517; SMAP: 0.297) on weekly time scales compared with Argo floats. Overall, the merged CCI have the smallest RMSD among the four satellite products in the SCS on both weekly time scales and monthly time scales, which illustrates the improved accuracy of merged CCI compared with the individual satellite data.

TI  - Aboveground wheat biomass estimation from a low-altitude UAV platform based on multimodal remote sensing data fusion with the introduction of terrain factors
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aboveground biomass is an important indicator used to characterize the growth status of crops, as well as an important physical and chemical parameter in agroecosystems. Aboveground biomass is an important basis for formulating management measures such as fertilization and irrigation. We selected four irrigated wheat fields in a region near Kaifeng, Henan Province, for this study. The terrain in that region was undulating and had spatial differences. We used a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform equipped with a multispectral camera, thermal infrared camera, and RGB camera to simultaneously obtain different remote sensing parameters during the key growth stages of wheat. Based on the extracted spectral reflectivity, thermal infrared temperature, and digital elevation information, we calculated the spatial variability of remote sensing parameters and growth indices under different terrain characteristics. We also analyzed the correlations between vegetation indices, temperature parameters, structural topographic parameters and aboveground biomass. Three machine learning methods were used, including the multiple linear regression method (MLR), partial least squares regression method (PLSR) and random forest regression method (RFR). We compared the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation capability of single-modal data versus multimodal data fusion frameworks. The results showed that slope was an important factor affecting crop growth and aboveground biomass. We therefore analyzed several remote sensing parameters for three different slope scales. We found significant differences among them for soil water content, water content of plants, and aboveground biomass at four growth stages. Based on the strength of their correlation with aboveground biomass, seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE, MSR, OSAVI, SAVI, and MCARI), four canopy structure parameters (CH, VF, CVM, SLOPE) and two temperature parameters (NRCT, CTD) were selected as the final input variables for the model. There was some variability in the accuracy of the models at different growth stages. The average accuracy of the models was anthesis stage > booting stage > filling stage > jointing stage. For the single-modal data framework, the model constructed with the vegetation indices was better than the aboveground biomass model constructed using the temperature or structure parameters, and the highest accuracy was obtained with an RFR model based on vegetation indices at the anthesis stage (R2 = 0.713). For the double modal data fusion approach, the highest accuracy resulted at the anthesis stage, using the structural parameters combined with the vegetation indices of the RFR model (R-2 = 0.842). Even higher accuracies were obtained using the multimodal data fusion approach with an RFR model based on vegetation indices, temperature parameters and structure parameters at the anthesis stage (R-2 = 0.897). By introducing terrain factors and combining them with the RFR algorithm to effectively integrate multimodal data, the complementary and synergistic effects between different remote sensing information sources could be fully exerted. The accuracy and stability of the aboveground biomass estimation models were effectively improved, and a high-throughput phenotype acquisition method was explored, which provides a reference and basis for real-time monitoring of crop growth and decoding the correlation between genotype and phenotype.

M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Eight million Ukrainians have taken refuge in the European Union. Many have asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and/or urticaria, and around 100,000 may have a severe disease. Cultural and language barriers are a major obstacle to appropriate management. Two widely available mHealth apps, MASK air (R) (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK) for the management of rhinitis and asthma and CRUSE (R) (Chronic Urticaria Self Evaluation) for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, were updated to include Ukrainian versions that make the documented information available to treating physicians in their own language. The Ukrainian patients fill in the questionnaires and daily symptom-medication scores for asthma, rhinitis (MASK air) or urticaria (CRUSE) in Ukrainian. Then, following the GDPR, patients grant their physician access to the app by scanning a QR code displayed on the physician's computer enabling the physician to read the app contents in his/her own language. This service is available freely. It takes less than a minute to show patient data to the physician in the physician's web browser. UCRAID- developed by ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) and UCARE (Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence)- is under the auspices of the Ukraine Ministry of Health as well as European (European Academy of Allergy and Clinical immunology, EAACI, European Respiratory Society, ERS, European Society of Dermatologic Research, ESDR) and national societies.

TI  - Retrieval of Monsoon Landslide Timings With Sentinel-1 Reveals the Effects of Earthquakes and Extreme Rainfall
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monsoon rainfall triggers hundreds of landslides across Nepal every year, causing significant hazard and mass wasting. Annual inventories of these landslides have been mapped using multi-spectral satellite images, but these images are obscured by cloud cover during the monsoon, making it impossible to use them to constrain landslide timing. We employ recently developed techniques to derive individual timings from Sentinel-1 for 579 landslides in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in Nepal. We use this new timing information alongside satellite rainfall data to identify spatio-temporal clusters of landslides and associate these with periods of particularly intense rainfall. We also observed that during the 2015 monsoon, many landslides failed earlier and in dryer conditions than in 2017-2019. We use physical models to demonstrate how this requires a temporary loss of hillslope strength following the M-w 7.8 Gorkha Earthquake sequence and suggest a modeled cohesion loss in the range 1-3 kPa.

TI  - A qualitative study on traditional healers' perceptions and management of epidermolysis bullosa
T2  - HEALTH SA GESONDHEID
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, incurable genodermatosis causing blisters that can result in multisystemic complications and death. Limited data exists on EB in South Africa. Research indicates that the majority of African patients consult traditional health practitioners (THPs) before seeking allopathic healthcare.Aim: This study aims to understand THPs belief systems, experiences, perceptions and management of EB patients and their families in the social and cultural context to improve the healthcare of EB patients. Setting: The study setting is Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, Durban, and Grey's hospital, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 THPs. A non-probability, purposive sampling method was used. A two-site qualitative study was guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Guba's trustworthiness framework was used to ensure rigour.Results: Three male and seven female THPs were interviewed, including sangoma, inyanga and umthandazi. The integration presented five global themes: (1) THP practices, (2) perceptions of THP, (3) experiences of THP with patients with EB, (4) diagnosis and management plans of THP and (5) vision and role of THPs. There were multiple divergent perspectives among the THPs with the shared African worldview.Conclusion: Understanding THPs belief systems and therapeutic options is crucial for holistic patient management. Knowledge exchange can promote safe healthcare practices and facilitate collaboration between traditional and allopathic health practitioners.Contribution: This is the first study to explore THPs perceptions and practices regarding EB, a rare disease.

TI  - The hologenome of Daphnia magna reveals possible DNA methylation and microbiome-mediated evolution of the host genome
T2  - NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Properties that make organisms ideal laboratory models in developmental and medical research are often the ones that also make them less representative of wild relatives. The waterflea Daphnia magna is an exception, by both sharing many properties with established laboratory models and being a keystone species, a sentinel species for assessing water quality, an indicator of environmental change and an established ecotoxicology model. Yet, Daphnia's full potential has not been fully exploited because of the challenges associated with assembling and annotating its gene-rich genome. Here, we present the first hologenome of Daphnia magna, consisting of a chromosomal-level assembly of the D. magna genome and the draft assembly of its metagenome. By sequencing and mapping transcriptomes from exposures to environmental conditions and from developmental morphological landmarks, we expand the previously annotates gene set for this species. We also provide evidence for the potential role of gene-body DNA-methylation as a mutagen mediating genome evolution. For the first time, our study shows that the gut microbes provide resistance to commonly used antibiotics and virulence factors, potentially mediating Daphnia's environmental-driven rapid evolution. Key findings in this study improve our understanding of the contribution of DNA methylation and gut microbiota to genome evolution in response to rapidly changing environments.Graphical Abstract

TI  - Connectivity as a driver of river-floodplain functioning: A dynamic, graph theoretic approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Connectivity is a crucial property of the river-floodplain ecosystem. Reduction of connectivity, fragmentation and isolation effects, impacting ecological functions and biodiversity, is one of the most critical threats to floodplain systems. We use a graph theoretical approach for analyzing possible transport pathways in the system (directed, undirected, overland, seepage) and relate them to ecosystem functions in a river-floodplain system impacted by engineering structures (Danube River, Vienna, Austria). We studied essential ecological functions using indicators on sediment composition and quality, hydrochemical conditions, and macrophyte coverage. Our results indicate that sediment transport and composition are widely driven by directional flow and connectivity. In contrast, the exchange of water and nutrients is dominated by seepage exchange in the system. Macrophytes are dominating in water bodies which are not relevant for directed transport. The graph theoretical approach solely based on remotely sensed data can be used to classify floodplain water bodies related to their essential function and importance in the network and identify main deficits and potential restoration measures. It can, therefore, be an essential tool for prioritizing systems for management measures and restoration actions.

TI  - The topographical distribution of lymph node metastases in colon cancer resections
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In accordance with international guidelines all lymph nodes in colon cancer specimens must be examined to obtain accurate staging. This study aimed to determine the topographical location of lymph node metastases and evaluate if a more limited sampling approach could be an alternative. Partial colectomies received at the Department of Pathology, Zealand University Hospital during a six-month period were included. At the macroscopic examination, each specimen was divided into three different segments: a segment containing the index tumor and the tumor-feeding artery, an oral and an anal segment. The number of lymph nodes and lymph node metastases were registered separately for each segment. Resections from 93 patients were included. Of 2466 lymph nodes, 1839 (74.6 %) were located in the tumor segment, 308 (12.5 %) in the oral, and 319 (12.9 %) in the anal segment, respectively. In 133 (5,4 %) lymph nodes a metastasis was present. Of these 129 (97.0 %) were located in the tumor segment, one (0.8 %) in the oral segment, and three (2.3 %) in the anal segment. No patients had metastasis in the oral or anal segments without metastases also being present in the tumor segment leading to consideration of the need for lymph node harvest of the complete specimen upon initial examination. As such, the segment containing the index tumor and tumor-feeding artery could be regarded as a sentinel segment indicating a potential need for lymph node dissection in the oral and anal segments.

TI  - Reducing Retained Foreign Objects in the Operating Room: A Quality Improvement Initiative.
T2  - Journal of the American College of Surgeons
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the incidence of pediatric retained foreign objects (RFOs) during surgery is diminutive (1/32,000), RFOs are often the most common sentinel events reported. In 2021, our institution noted an increase in RFOs evidenced by a substantial decrease in days between events. We aimed to minimize the incidence of RFO which was measured as an increase days between events at our institution by implementation of a Quality Improvement (QI) initiative.STUDY DESIGN: This effort was conducted across four surgical centers within a tertiary children's healthcare system in December 2021. Patients undergoing surgery within this healthcare system across all surgical specialties were included. The QI initiative was developed by a multidisciplinary team and included six steps focusing on quiet time, minimizing interruptions, and closed loop communication during final surgical count. Seven Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were used to test, refine, and implement the protocol. Adherence to the final surgical count protocol was monitored throughout the study period.RESULTS: In 2021, prior to protocol implementation, average time between RFO events was 29 days. After implementation of our quality initiative, the final surgical count protocol, we improved to 451 days between RFO events by February 2023, exceeding the upper control limit (235 days). Following implementation, the number of RFO events dropped from 7 in 2021 to 0 in 2022. Adherence to the final surgical count protocol implementation was 96.4% by the end of cycle 7.CONCLUSIONS: Retained foreign objects (RFOs) during pediatric surgical procedures can be successfully reduced using quality improvement methodology focusing on standardizing the procedure of the final surgical count.

TI  - Omission of Completion Lymph Node Dissection in Sentinel Node Biopsy Positive Head and Neck Cutaneous Melanoma Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundRecent studies evaluating patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB+) show no melanoma-specific survival difference between patients undergoing lymph node basin surveillance and completion lymph node dissection (CLND). This has been broadly applied, despite underrepresentation of head and neck (HN) cutaneous melanoma patients. We evaluated whether this was upheld in the HN melanoma cohort.MethodsPatients with HN melanoma with a SLNB+ were selected from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2012 to 2019. Overall survival (OS) of patients who underwent SLNB only versus SLNB + CLND were compared. Subgroup analyses were performed based on pathologic N (pN) and receipt of immunotherapy. Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.ResultsAnalysis of 634 patients with multivariable Cox regression showed no difference in OS in SLNB only versus SLNB + CLND cohorts (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-1.81; p = 0.610). Charlson-Deyo score (CDS) 1 versus 0 (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.10-2.63; p = 0.016), pN2+ versus pN1 (HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.23-2.45; p = 0.002), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) versus no (HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.34-3.19; p = 0.001) were associated with worse prognosis. Subgroup analysis by pN showed no OS benefit for CLND in either pN1 (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.51-2.10; p = 0.922) or pN2+ (HR 1.31; 95% CI 0.67-2.57; p = 0.427) patients or in patients who received immunotherapy (HR 1.32; 95% CI 0.54-3.22; p = 0.549).ConclusionsThis study of SLNB + HN melanoma patients showed no OS difference in SLNB only versus SLNB + CLND. Further studies need to be performed to better define the role of CLND.

TI  - Sensitivity of Pyrocumulus Convection to Tree Mortality During the 2020 Creek Fire in California
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the sensitivity of pyrocumulonimbus (PyroCb) induced by the California Creek fire of 2020 to the amount and type of surface fuels, within the WRF-SFIRE modeling system. Satellite data were used to derive fire arrival times to constrain fire progression, and to augment the fuel characterization with better estimates of combustible vegetation accounting for tree mortality. Machine learning was employed to classify standing dead vegetation from aerial imagery, which was then added as a custom fuel class along with the standard Anderson fuel categories. Simulations using this new fuel class produced a larger and more vigorous PyroCb than the control run, however, still under-predicted the cloud top. Additional augmentation of fuel mass to represent the accumulation of dead vegetation on the forest floor further improved the simulations, demonstrating the efficacy of representing both dead standing and fallen vegetation to produce more realistic PyroCb and smoke simulations.

TI  - Quantifying the Geomorphic Effect of Floods Using Satellite Observations of River Mobility
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphologists have long debated the relative importance of disturbance magnitude, duration, and frequency in shaping landscapes. For river-channel adjustment by floods, some argue that the cumulative hydrograph, rather than magnitude or duration, matters most. However, studies of flood-induced river-channel change often draw upon small data sets. Here, we combine Sentinel-2 imagery with flow data from laterally active rivers to address this question using a larger data set. We apply automated algorithms in Google Earth Engine to map rivers and detect their lateral shifting; we generate a large data set to quantify planform erosion during 175 floods at 34 selected sites. Erosion during these floods is best explained by their duration and then their cumulative hydrograph. We use a random forest regression model to predict flood-induced erosion, with potential applications for hazard management. Ultimately, better global data on sediment supply and caliber would help us to understand flood-driven change to river planforms.We develop a method to quantify river planform change after flood events, using Google Earth Engine We do so for a data set of 175 floods that exceeded the 80th percentile stage, at 34 flow gauging sites on laterally active rivers Planform erosion during these high-flow events was most correlated with the event duration, and then the summed hydrograph

TI  - Strain Threshold for the Formation of Coseismic Surface Rupture
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2021 M-w 7.4 Maduo earthquake (eastern Tibetan Plateau), with a surface deformation zone that is characterized by multiple distinct surface rupture segments separated by segments with no surface ruptures, provides an excellent opportunity to constrain the strain threshold (minimum strain) for the formation of surface ruptures. Through sub-pixel correlation of pre- and post-event SPOT-6/7 satellite images (pixel = 1.5 m), we derive surface displacement and shear-strain fields of the Maduo earthquake. By quantifying the minimum shear strain along the surface rupture segments and the maximum shear strain along the segments with no surface ruptures, we estimate a rupture strain threshold, which ranges from 0.8% to 1.8% and appears to decrease with structural maturity of the causative fault. This threshold is generally consistent with a rupture strain limit (0.5%-1.5%) of intact rocks from laboratory measurements, and is higher than a commonly-assumed strain threshold (0.5%) for inelastic deformation.

TI  - Predicting maize yield in Northeast China by a hybrid approach combining biophysical modelling and machine learning
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: China produces more than 20 % of maize grain in the world, and Northeast China (NEC) accounts for similar to 30 % of the nation's total maize production. Previous studies have used either climate data, satellite data, or crop growth model (CGM) to predict or forecast maize yield. However, maize is highly susceptible to the effect of extreme climate events (such as drought, heat) in NEC, and there is a lack of studies to predict/forecast maize yield by integrating climate data, satellite data, extreme climate events, and CGM-simulated data.Objective: We aim to develop a hybrid approach with machine learning to blend different sources of data (climate data, satellite data, extreme climate events) and process-based modelling results to improve predictive accuracy of maize yield in NEC.Methods: Using maize data from 44 sites during the period of 2000-2013 in NEC, we firstly optimized Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM) using Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis combined with Gaussian likelihood function and Bayesian multiplication method. Next, we divided the growing season into five phases, and selected variables of different phases using exploratory data analysis and Random Forest. Then, we developed a hybrid model using Random Forest by blending of multiple sources of data and APSIM simulations to predict maize yield from the start to the end of the growing season, and quantified the relative contribution of predictors.Results and conclusions: A hybrid model developed with random forest by combining climate data, NDVI, extreme climate events and APSIM simulations can achieve high performance for predicting yield toward the end of the growing season. The accuracy of in-season yield prediction showed a linear increase with MAPE/KGE changing from 19 %/0.05 to 13 %/0.53 from start to end of the growing season. Yield forecasts are acceptable with RMSE/MAE of 1.20/1.01 Mg ha(-1) (16 %/13 % of the observed mean yield) approximately one-month prior to harvest. The most important predictor that affect yield forecast was APSIM-simulated biomass or yield, and the most important extreme climate event was drought during early grain-filling stage.Significance: With the increasing availability of crop-related data, we expect that the in-season forecasting capacity of the proposed methodology could be further improved, and the methodology can be extended to other crops and other regions for yield forecast.

TI  - Multi-criteria land suitability assessment for mulberry-based agroforestry using AHP and GIS approach in Anantnag district of the Kashmir valley, India, to achieve sustainable agriculture
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In order to minimize human impact on the environment, it is crucial to determine the best way to utilize land through assessments of its suitability. This research focuses on the Anantnag district in the Kashmir valley, exploring its potential as a suitable area for mulberry agroforestry. Consequently, the selection of suitable sites for mulberry-based agroforestry has become an essential element of sustainable land use planning and agriculture, with the aim of maintaining ecological equilibrium. In the context of a Geographic Information System (GIS), we employ a method called multi-criteria assessment to evaluate the suitability of a specific site for mulberry agroforestry in the study area. This assessment involves considering various factors such as slope, temperature, rainfall, land use and land cover (LULC), as well as the physical and chemical properties of the soil. To assign scores to these criteria, we utilized the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, conducted interviews with local experts, and referred to existing literature. By applying a weighted overlay analysis, which takes into account the importance of each parameter, we generated a map depicting the suitability of the research area for mulberry agroforestry. The map for mulberry agroforestry suitability in the study area indicates that 16.59% of the land is highly suitable, 28.16% is moderately suitable, 40.29% is marginally suitable, and 14.96% is unsuitable. To ensure the accuracy of the findings, satellite images, Sentinel-2b LULC mapping, and GPS-enabled field surveys were extensively employed to verify the results. These findings can be utilized by farmers, regional developers, and the government to inform their decisions regarding potential mulberry agroforestry areas and develop sustainable agroforestry management strategies for the region.

TI  - Value of Breast MRI and Nomogram After Negative Axillary Ultrasound for Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Clinically T1-2 N0 Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are increasing concerns about that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) could be omitted in patients with clinically T1-2 N0 breast cancers who has negative axillary ultrasound (AUS). This study aims to assess the false negative result (FNR) of AUS, the rate of high nodal burden (HNB) in clinically T1-2 N0 breast cancer patients, and the diagnostic performance of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nomogram.Methods: We identified 948 consecutive patients with clinically T1-2 N0 cancers who had negative AUS, subsequent MRI, and breast conserving therapy between 2013 and 2020 from two tertiary medical centers. Patients from two centers were assigned to development and validation sets, respectively. Among 948 patients, 402 (mean age & PLUSMN; standard deviation, 57.61 & PLUSMN; 11.58) were within development cohort and 546 (54.43 & PLUSMN; 10.02) within validation cohort. Using logistic regression analyses, clinical-imaging factors associated with lymph node (LN) metastasis were analyzed in the development set from which nomogram was created. The performance of MRI and nomogram was assessed. HNB was defined as & GE; 3 positive LNs. Results: The FNR of AUS was 20.1% (81 of 402) and 19.2% (105 of 546) and the rates of HNB were 1.2% (5/402) and 2.2% (12/546), respectively. Clinical and imaging features associated with LN metastasis were progesterone receptor positivity, outer tumor location on mammography, breast imaging reporting and data system category 5 assessment of cancer on ultrasound, and positive axilla on MRI. In validation cohorts, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI and clinical-imaging nomogram was 58.5% and 86.5%, and 56.0% and 82.0%, respectively. Conclusion: The FNR of AUS was approximately 20% but the rate of HNB was low. The diagnostic performance of MRI was not satisfactory with low PPV but MRI had merit in reaffirming negative AUS with high NPV. Patients who had low probability scores from our clinical-imaging nomogram might be possible candidates for the omission of SLNB.

TI  - Integrating vegetation phenological characteristics and polarization features with object-oriented techniques for grassland type identification
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the small size, variety, and high degree of mixing of herbaceous vegetation, remote sensing-based identification of grassland types primarily focuses on extracting major grassland categories, lacking detailed depiction. This limitation significantly hampers the development of effective evaluation and fine supervision for the rational utilization of grassland resources. To address this issue, this study concentrates on the representative grassland of Zhenglan Banner in Inner Mongolia as the study area. It integrates the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 active-passive synergistic observations and introduces innovative object-oriented techniques for grassland type classification, thereby enhancing the accuracy and refinement of grassland classification. The results demonstrate the following: (1) To meet the supervision requirements of grassland resources, we propose a grassland type classification system based on remote sensing and the vegetation-habitat classification method, specifically applicable to natural grasslands in northern China. (2) By utilizing the high-spatial-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) synthesized through the Spatial and Temporal Non-Local Filter-based Fusion Model (STNLFFM), we are able to capture the NDVI time profiles of grassland types, accurately extract vegetation phenological information within the year, and further enhance the temporal resolution. (3) The integration of multi-seasonal spectral, polarization, and phenological characteristics significantly improves the classification accuracy of grassland types. The overall accuracy reaches 82.61%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.79. Compared to using only multi-seasonal spectral features, the accuracy and kappa coefficient have improved by 15.94% and 0.19, respectively. Notably, the accuracy improvement of the gently sloping steppe is the highest, exceeding 38%. (4) Sandy grassland is the most widespread in the study area, and the growth season of grassland vegetation mainly occurs from May to September. The sandy meadow exhibits a longer growing season compared with typical grassland and meadow, and the distinct differences in phenological characteristics contribute to the accurate identification of various grassland types.

TI  - Disintegration and Buttressing Effect of the Landfast Sea Ice in the Larsen B Embayment, Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The speed-up of glaciers following ice shelf collapse can accelerate ice mass loss dramatically. Investigating the deformation of landfast sea ice enables studying its resistive (buttressing) stresses and mechanisms driving ice collapse. Here, we apply offset tracking to Sentinel-1A/B synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a 2014-2022 time-series of horizontal velocity and strain rate fields of landfast ice filling the embayment formerly covered by the Larsen B Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula until 2002. The landfast ice disintegrated in 2022, and we find that it was precipitated by a few large opening rifts. Grounded glaciers did not accelerate instantaneously after the collapse, which implies little buttressing effect from landfast ice, a conclusion also supported by the near-zero correlation between glacier velocity and landfast ice area. Our observations suggest that buttressing stresses are unlikely to be recovered by landfast sea ice over sub-decadal timescales following the collapse of an ice shelf.

AB  - Optical remote sensing provides optimal technical support for the detection and quantification of floating macroalgae. Although the spatial scale effect on optical estimation of floating macroalgae coverage or biomass from different images has been clarified, the directional effect on them has not been investigated until now. In this study, synchronous multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) and MODIS images were collected to investigate the multi-angle remote sensing of green tides. A dual thresholding method, based on the difference vegetation index (DVI) and scaled algae index, was employed to determine algae pixels. In addition, piecewise empirical models were developed for MISR and MODIS images to estimate the total biomass of green tides based on laboratory measurements and DVI values. Comparative analysis of DVI histograms and total biomass shows that the sensor zenith angle has a significant impact on the quantification of green tides. Under the same solar conditions, as the sensor zenith angle increases, the optical signals received from algae pixels weaken, resulting in a decrease in the quantification of green tides. In future research, the observation geometry (including the solar/sensor zenith angle and the solar/sensor azimuth angle) needs to be considered to improve the accuracy of optical remote detection and quantification of floating macroalgae.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Spatially explicit accuracy assessment of deep learning-based, fine-resolution built-up land data in the United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial datasets derived from remote sensing data by means of machine learning methods are often based on probabilistic outputs of abstract nature, which are difficult to translate into interpretable measures. For example, the Global Human Settlement Layer GHS-BUILT-S2 product reports the probability of the presence of built-up areas in 2018 in a global 10 m x 10 m grid. However, practitioners typically require interpretable measures such as binary surfaces indicating the presence or absence of built-up areas or estimates of sub-pixel built-up surface fractions. Herein, we assess the relationship between the built-up probability in GHS-BUILT-S2 and reference built-up surface fractions derived from a highly reliable reference database for several regions in the United States. Furthermore, we identify a binarization threshold using an agreement maximization method that creates binary built-up land data from these built-up probabilities. These binary surfaces are input to a spatially explicit, scale-sensitive accuracy assessment which includes the use of a novel, visual-analytical tool which we call focal precision-recall signature plots. Our analysis reveals that a threshold of 0.5 applied to GHS-BUILT-S2 maximizes the agreement with binarized built-up land data derived from the reference built-up area fraction. We find high levels of accuracy (i.e., county-level F-1 scores of almost 0.8 on average) in the derived built-up areas, and consistently high accuracy along the rural-urban gradient in our study area. These results reveal considerable accuracy improvements in human settlement models based on Sentinel-2 data and deep learning, as compared to earlier, Landsat-based versions of the Global Human Settlement Layer.

TI  - A qualitative study on traditional healers' perceptions and management of epidermolysis bullosa
T2  - HEALTH SA GESONDHEID
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, incurable genodermatosis causing blisters that can result in multisystemic complications and death. Limited data exists on EB in South Africa. Research indicates that the majority of African patients consult traditional health Aim: This study aims to understand THPs belief systems, experiences, perceptions and management of EB patients and their families in the social and cultural context to improve the healthcare of EB patients. Setting: The study setting is Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, Durban, and Grey's hospital, Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 THPs. A non-probability, purposive sampling method was used. A two-site qualitative study was guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Guba's trustworthiness framework was used to ensure rigour. Results: Three male and seven female THPs were interviewed, including sangoma, inyanga and umthandazi. The integration presented five global themes: (1) THP practices, (2) perceptions of THP, (3) experiences of THP with patients with EB, (4) diagnosis and management plans of THP and (5) vision and role of THPs. There were multiple divergent perspectives among the THPs with the shared African worldview. Conclusion: Understanding THPs belief systems and therapeutic options is crucial for holistic patient management. Knowledge exchange can promote safe healthcare practices and facilitate collaboration between traditional and allopathic health practitioners. Contribution: This is the first study to explore THPs perceptions and practices regarding EB, a rare disease.

TI  - Estimating Reservoir Sedimentation Rates and Storage Capacity Losses Using High-Resolution Sentinel-2 Satellite and Water Level Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In nearly all reservoirs, storage capacity is steadily lost due to trapping and accumulation of sediment. Despite critical importance to freshwater supplies, reservoir sedimentation rates are poorly understood due to sparse bathymetry survey data and challenges in modeling sedimentation sequestration. Here, we proposed a novel approach to estimate reservoir sedimentation rates and storage capacity losses using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellites and daily in situ water levels. Validated on eight reservoirs across the central and western United States, the estimated reservoir bathymetry and sedimentation rates have a mean error of 4.08% and 0.05% yr-1, respectively. Estimated storage capacity losses to sediment vary among reservoirs, which overall agrees with the pattern from survey data. We also demonstrated the potential applications of the proposed approach to ungauged reservoirs by combining Sentinel-2 with sub-monthly water levels from recent satellite altimeters.

TI  - Efficacy of transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery versus multi-port laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer: a retrospective comparison study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although single-port laparoscopy surgery has been evaluated for several years, it has not been widely adopted by gynecologic oncologists. The objective was to compare the perioperative outcomes and survival of endometrial cancer (EC) patients undergoing transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (TU-LESS) with multi-port laparoscopic surgery (MLS).Materials and methods This is a retrospective comparative monocentric study including patients treated between December 2017 and October 2021. The perioperative outcomes and survival of EC patients who had surgery via TU-LESS or MLS were compared, by propensity matching.Results A total of 156 patients were included (TU-LESS vs. MLS: 78 vs. 78). The conversion rate of TU-LESS and MLS was 5.13% and 2.56%, respectively (P=0.681). The operation time was comparable between the two groups [207.5min (180-251) vs. 197.5min (168.8-225), P=0.095]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in exhaustion time, perioperative complications, or postoperative complications. While, the TU-LESS group had a shorter out-of-bed activity time [36 hours (24-48) vs. 48 hours (48-72), P<0.001] and a lower visual analog pain scale 36 hours after surgery [1 (1-2) vs. 2 (1-2), P<0.001] than the MLS group. The length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups [5(4-6) vs. 5(4-5), P=0.599]. Following surgery, 38.5% of the TU-LESS patients and 41% of the MLS patients got adjuvant therapy (P=0.744). The median follow-up time for TU-LESS and MLS cohorts was 45 months (range: 20-66) and 43 months (range: 18-66), respectively. One TU-LESS patient and one MLS patient died following recurrence. The 4-year overall survival was similar in both groups (98.3% vs. 98.5%, P=0.875).Conclusion TU-LESS is a feasible and safe option with comparable perioperative outcomes and survival of MLS in endometrial cancer. With the growing acceptance of sentinel lymph node biopsy, TU-LESS of endometrial cancer may be a viable option for patients and surgeons.

TI  - Mapping hydrothermal alteration of the Pulang porphyry copper deposit, SW China, using ASTER and ZY1-02D satellite data
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alteration minerals are important prospecting indicators, and multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing technologies are important prospecting tools. Multispectral remote sensing data such as ASTER have been widely used for extracting alteration mineral information. The dataset is easy to access, cost-effective to use, and rich in rock and ore spectrum information. Recently, the use of alteration mineral identification technology and hyperspectral satellite data for fine prospecting has become feasible in China, considering the development of hyperspectral remote sensing technology, especially the launch of the ZY1-02D satellite in China. Pulang por-phyry copper deposit, Southwest China, is a largescale, explored deposit with unclear peripheral prospecting. Therefore, principal component analysis (PCA) and mixed tuned matched filtering (MTMF) methods were used in this study to extract the mineralized alteration minerals of the Pulang porphyry copper deposit area from the ASTER multispectral data and ZY1-02D hyperspectral data. Then, Al-OH and Fe-Mg-OH alteration information was obtained from the ASTER data using the PCA method. Meanwhile, sericite, chlorite, and epidote alteration information was extracted using the MTMF method and ASTER data. With the ZY1-02D data, the alterations of sericite, chlorite, and epidote were extracted by the PCA and MTMF methods. A field verification showed that the overall accuracy of the ASTER-based alteration extraction was up to 0.57, and the overall accuracy of the ZY1-02D-based alteration extraction was up to 0.88. And circled six favorable areas of copper deposit based on alteration mapping. Therefore, the ZY1-02D data can be regarded as a reliable and promising tool for delineating potential prospecting areas according to the mapping of hydrothermal alteration information, which can be explored further in the prospecting field in the future. The eastern and northern parts of the first mining area should be further explored for potential prospecting.

TI  - Duration of the influence of snowmelt on land surface temperature and humidity after snowmelt on the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of snowmelt on surface hydrothermal conditions is a research hot spot given the background of global warming. However, existing remote sensing-based studies have mostly focused on demonstrating the impacts of snow and are based on large time scales. How to measure the duration of snowmelt impact on surface hydro thermal conditions more accurately is a problem that needs to be addressed. We used a method to quantify the impact duration of snowmelt based on the characteristics of the phase change in land surface temperature (LST) and land surface water index (LSWI) after melting. We analyzed the snow factors that have caused the difference in impact duration and the interaction on the impact duration. The results are described as follows: (1) The LST and LSWI changes after snow melting are characterized by distinct phases. (2) The duration of the snowmelt impact on LST ranged from 4.61 days in the south to 21.23 days in the north; the effect of snow on the LSWI ranged from 8.06 days in the south to 25.38 days in the north. (3) The two durations have a significant positive correlation with snow depth and snow melt date. The combination of several snow parameters and other meteorological factors has a significant interaction effect on the duration of snowmelt influence. In most combinations where there is no interaction, the duration is significantly affected only by snow elements. The interaction can change the direction and extent of the effect of a single snow or meteorological element on the duration of snow impact. This research can supplement the theoretical basis for solving ecological problems and production in the study area, such as spring drought, forage mowing, and cold protection of livestock.

TI  - Evaluation of a forest radiative transfer model using an extensive boreal forest inventory database
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest reflectance and transmittance model (FRT) is applicable over a wide swath of boreal forest landscapes mainly because its stand-specific inputs can be generated from standard forest inventory variables. We quantified the accuracy of this model over an extensive region for the first time. This was done by carrying out a simulation study over a large number (12,369) of georeferenced forest plots from operational forest management inventories conducted in Southern Finland. We compared the FRT simulated bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) with those measured by Landsat 8 satellite Operational Land Imager (OLI). We also quantified the relative importance of several explanatory factors that affected the magnitude of the discrepancy between the measured and simulated BRFs using a linear mixed effects modelling framework. A general trend of FRT overestimating BRFs is seen across all tree species and spectral bands examined: up to -0.05 for the red band, and -0.10 for the near infrared band. The important explanatory factors associated with the overestimations included the dominant tree species, understory type of the forest plot, timber volume (acts as a proxy for stand maturity), vegetation heterogeneity and time of the year. Our analysis suggests that approximately 20% of the error is caused by the non-representative spectra of canopy foliage and understory. Our results demonstrate the importance of collecting representative spectra from a diverse set of forest stands, and over the full range of seasons.

TI  - Satellite Observations and a Numerical Study of Recurring Atmospheric Gravity Waves Along the South China Sea Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several groups of diurnal recurring atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) were observed on an Environmental Satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar image and six Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images acquired along the South China Sea coast for 4 days from 3 to 6 March 2010. The unique observations are that the previously observed AGWs seldom recurred in a region for multiple days. Each cycle of these observed AGWs had undergone three stages: generation, propagation, and dissipation daily. Both SAR-imaged sea surface roughness patterns and MODIS-observed cloud imprints show that the AGWs were a group of transverse waves along the coast. We implemented the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to understand the physical characteristics and dynamical mechanisms of these AGWs. The WRF simulated results indicated that the AGWs were upstream waves triggered by the interaction of the southerly wind and topography and dissipated by the diurnal warming. We applied the spectral analysis to the model-simulated vertical wind field and explored that the leading wave crest length and crest-to-crest wavelength are 156.25 and 7.14 km, respectively. The wave period and phase speed of the upstream AGWs within the vital observation of SAR are 1.81 hr and 1.26 m/s, respectively. The fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis hourly data was used to explore the rarity of the recurring AGWs and proved that the stable air-sea temperature difference was the main reason for the rarity of this event. And sufficient cloud content (>50%) was necessary for the MODIS to capture the AGWs' imprints.

TI  - Global Gridded Aerosol Models Established for Atmospheric Correction Over Inland and Nearshore Coastal Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of standard aerosol models for atmospheric correction over inland and nearshore coastal waters generates large uncertainties due to their inability to appropriately characterize aerosols in those regions. To address this problem, we developed new aerosol models using data acquired from 1,475 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites distributed in inland and coastal regions throughout the globe. We established spatially gridded (5 degrees x 5 degrees) aerosol models on a climatological monthly scale, with a total of 3,207 new aerosol models developed for 310 grid cells worldwide. The monthly aerosol model for each grid was derived using mean monthly values of microphysical aerosol properties from AERONET data. The optical properties (i.e., single scattering albedo and Angstrom coefficient) of our global gridded aerosol models demonstrated considerable spatial and seasonal dynamics and deviated substantially from the aerosol models currently utilized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We built associated lookup tables for all aerosol models and incorporated them into two atmospheric correction algorithms: the combined near-infrared and shortwave infrared algorithm (NIR-SWIR) and the Atmospheric Correction algorithm for inLand and Nearshore Coastal waters (ACLANC). For both algorithms, the accuracies of atmospherically corrected satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) improved markedly when the new aerosol models were used, and improvements were noted across all spectral bands and across all six inland and nearshore water bodies used in this study. Our new aerosol models can be easily applied to all ocean color satellite missions to obtain accurate Rrs products for inland and coastal waters worldwide.

TI  - Outpatient Worsening Among Patients With Mildly Reduced and Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure in the DELIVER Trial.
T2  - Circulation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Hospitalization is recognized as a sentinel event in the disease trajectory of patients with heart failure (HF), but not all patients experiencing clinical decompensation are ultimately hospitalized. Outpatient intensification of diuretics is common in response to symptoms of worsening HF, yet its prognostic and clinical relevance, specifically in patient with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction is uncertain. Methods: In this prespecified analysis of the DELIVER trial, we assessed the association between various non-fatal worsening HF events (those requiring hospitalization, urgent outpatient visits requiring intravenous HF therapies, and outpatient oral diuretic intensification) and rates of subsequent mortality. We further examined the treatment effect of dapagliflozin on an expanded composite endpoint of CV death, HF hospitalization, urgent HF visit, or outpatient oral diuretic intensification. Results: In DELIVER, 4,532 (72%) patients experienced no worsening HF event, while 789 (13%) had outpatient oral diuretic intensification, 86 (1%) required an urgent HF visit, 585 (9%) had a HF hospitalization, and 271 (4%) died of CV causes as a first presentation. Patients with a first presentation manifesting as outpatient oral diuretic intensification experienced rates of subsequent mortality that were higher (10[8-12] per 100py) than those without a worsening HF event (4[3-4] per 100py) but similar to rates of subsequent death following urgent HF visit (10[6-18] per 100py). Patients with a HF hospitalization as a first presentation of worsening HF had the highest rates of subsequent death (35[31-40] per 100py). The addition of outpatient diuretic intensification to the adjudicated DELIVER primary endpoint (CV death, HF hospitalization, or urgent HF visit) increased the overall number of patients experiencing an event from 1,122 to 1,731 (a 54% increase). Dapagliflozin reduced the need for outpatient diuretic intensification alone (HR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64-0.82) and when analyzed as a part of an expanded composite endpoint of worsening HF or CV death (HR 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69-0.84). Conclusions: In patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, worsening HF requiring oral diuretic intensification in ambulatory care was frequent, adversely prognostic, and significantly reduced by dapagliflozin.

TI  - A decadal review of the CREST model family: Developments, applications, and outlook
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Review
AB  - Hydrologic models are a powerful tool to predict water-related natural hazards. Of all hydrologic models, CREST (Coupled Routing and Excess STorage) was developed to facilitate hydrologic sciences and applications across various spatial and temporal scales. The CREST model was the earliest implementation of a quasi-global flood model integrating remote-sensing data and is the first operational deployment of a real-time model in the National Weather Service functioning at flash flood scales across a continent. Since being published in 2011, the CREST model has been evolving to empower flood predictions and to inform water resources management practices. Moreover, the CREST model is convenient to couple with other models/schemes (e.g., weather forecast model, snowmelt model, land surface model, hydrodynamic model, groundwater model, landslide model, vectorbased routing) for border practices of investigating water-related natural hazards. To date its 10th anniversary, more than 80 peer-reviewed journal articles that have used the CREST model are curated and reviewed from the aspects of model development, worldwide applications, and outreach to emerging regions. Finally, the future directions for the CREST model family are outlined in the hope of stimulating new research endeavors. A digital collection of CREST model family is archived online at https://crest-family.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

AB  - Climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum has caused both plant communities and human behaviour to adapt. Humans relied heavily on wood as fuel to sustain their daily subsistence. Thanks to efficient fuel management, they were able to persist in a challenging environment. Cova del Parco (Iberian Pre-Pyrenees) was inhabited as a settlement in different periods of the Late Pleistocene (16.4-12.7 cal kyr BP). The site has one of the most comprehensive assemblages of Magdalenian hearths, allowing several specialized and daily activity areas to be reconstructed. This study aims to provide new anthracological data regarding the transformation of the forests in the Iberian Pre-Pyrenees, as well as showing how humans adapted their behaviour as regards fuel management and the use of space around the hearths. Furthermore, we present a spatial distribution analysis of the woody taxa from Magdalenian occupations that were identified during the anthracological study. A total of 1993 charcoal fragments from Cova del Parco were identified at a taxonomic level. The anthracological results revealed the presence of 11 woody taxa, with the pine-juniper phase as a characteristic transformation of pre forest formations in the cold climates of certain locations in the southwestern Mediterranean region. The results of our spatial analysis found that pinewood was the preferred fuel in the cave chamber, whereas juniper was most abundant in the rock shelter. However, the latest occupations revealed a shift in fuel use, with juniper becoming the primary fuel in the cave chamber. This change in behaviour is indicative of the changing needs of humans and their ability to adapt to new surroundings. It implies that strategies are contingent on context and dynamic, responding to changes in the environment. Overall, this study suggests that humans adapted to the changing environment by changing their fuel management strategies.

TI  - Uniplanar multirod TDR probe for soil water content measurement over a larger spatial scale
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study developed a uniplanar multirod time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and evaluated it in laboratory experiments for soil water measurement over a larger spatial scale. The sampling volume of the probe was determined by simulating the electric potential distribution around the probe rods by using the HYDRUS-2D software package and verified by comparison with the measured dielectric constant in saturated sand. The performance of the probe was evaluated by comparing its dielectric measurements in wet sand over a wide range of water content during evaporative drying with that measured by CS640 probes. Additionally, the dependency of visible light reflection on the water content of the sand was evaluated. The results revealed that the average effective thickness of the probe's sampling volume was 5-6 cm on both sides of the plane of the probe rods. The probe accurately measured the soil water content over a 0.88 m2 spatial area. The visible light reflectance of the variably saturated sand surface and the corresponding water content of the sand follow a soil water retention function-type relationship. The usage of the multirod TDR measurement system at a larger spatial scale carries practical implications, especially in increasing the accuracy of remote sensing data.Cette etude a mis au point une sonde TDR uniplanaire a plusieurs tiges et l'a evaluee lors d'experiences en laboratoire pour mesurer l'eau du sol sur une plus grande echelle spatiale. Le volume d'echantillonnage de la sonde a ete determine en simulant la distribution du potentiel electrique autour des tiges de la sonde a l'aide du progiciel HYDRUS 2D et verifie par rapport a la constante dielectrique mesuree dans le sable sature. Les performances de la sonde ont ete evaluees en comparant ses mesures dielectriques dans le sable humide sur une large gamme de teneurs en eau pendant le sechage par evaporation avec celles mesurees par les sondes CS640. En outre, on a evalue la dependance de la reflexion de la lumiere visible sur la teneur en eau du sable. Les resultats ont montre que l'epaisseur effective moyenne du volume d'echantillonnage de la sonde etait de 5 a 6 cm de part et d'autre du plan des barres de sonde. La sonde a mesure avec precision la teneur en eau du sol sur une surface spatiale de 0,88 m2. La reflectance de la lumiere visible de la surface de sable saturee de facon variable et la teneur en eau correspondante du sable suivent une relation de type fonction de retention de l'eau-du sol. L'utilisation du systeme de TDR a plusieurs tiges a une plus grande echelle spatiale a des implications pratiques, notamment en ce qui concerne l'augmentation de la precision des donnees de teledetection.

TI  - Investigating changes in atmospheric aerosols properties over the Indo-Gangetic Plain during different phases of COVID-19-induced lockdowns
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Impact of COrona VIrus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) restrictive measures on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and black carbon (BC) concentration is investigated for the western, central, and eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) using satellite-based observations. Due to COVID-19-induced lockdown measures, a noticeable decline in AOD and BC concentrations was observed across the IGP when compared to pre-lockdown period of 2020 and the lockdown concurrent period of 2015-2019. During the total lockdown period, a maximum drop in AOD and BC was observed in the central IGP (26.5 % and 10.1 %), followed by western IGP (24.9% and 5.2%) and eastern IGP (23.2 % and 4.9 %) with respect to the same period of 2015-2019. We have removed seasonal influences on aerosol properties during the COVID-19 lockdown, by taking average seasonal variations during the period of 2015-2019 as reference and projecting the hypothetical AOD and BC for the lockdown period under normal scenario. The difference between the hypothetical AOD and BC (under normal scenario) and the retrieved AOD and BC for the lockdown period is the absolute percentage change in AOD and BC concentration due to the lockdown alone. This elimination of seasonal influence is a novel approach. Central IGP showed an absolute decrease in AOD and BC of 38.5% and 18.2% during the lockdown period followed by western IGP (34.6% and 7.7%) and eastern IGP (25.9% and 11.5%). The observed absolute reduction in AOD, 26-39 %, is significantly higher than the global average reduction in AOD of 2-5%. CALIPSO-derived aerosol sub-types over major location of the western, central, and eastern IGP suggests prevalence of anthropogenic activities during pre- and post-lockdown periods. During the lockdown, IGP was influenced by aerosols from natural sources, with mineral dust and polluted dust in the western and central IGP, and aerosols from marine regions in the eastern IGP. Replenishment of aerosols within the boundary layer were far quicker when compared to total column during post-lockdown. Overall, the study reveals a reduction in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19-induced lockdowns, leading to temporary improvements in air quality over the IGP. Our study presents a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 lockdown impact on aerosols properties over the IGP and highlights unprecedented reductions in AOD (similar to 40 %) and BC (similar to 20 %), due to imposition of lockdown and subsequent cessation of aerosol sources, by removing seasonal influences.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation in the water quality of Vembanad Lake, Kerala, India: a remote sensing approach.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Water quality is one of the essential parameters of environmental monitoring; even a slight variation in its characteristics may significantly influence the ecosystem. The water quality of Vembanad Lake is affected by anthropogenic effects such as industrial effluents and tourism. The optical parameters representing water quality, such as diffuse attenuation (Kd), turbidity, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), are considered in this study to evaluate the water quality of Vembanad Lake, Kerala, India. As this lake is regarded as of ecological importance by the Ramsar Convention and has faced severe concerns over recent years, there was a substantial change in the water quality during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic. This research is aimed at examining the change in water quality using optical data from Sentinel-2 satellites in the ACOLITE processing software from 2016 to 2021. The analyses showed a 2.5% decrease in the values of Kd, whereas SPM and turbidity show a reduction of about 4.3% from the year 2016 to 2021. The flood and the COVID lockdown had an impact on the improvement in the quality of water from 2018 to 2021. The findings indicated that the reduction in industrial activities and tourism had a more significant effect on the improvement in the water quality of the lake. There was no substantial change in the Chl-a until 2020, whereas an average decrease of 12% in Chl-a values was observed throughout 2021. This decrease can be attributed to the reduction in the lake's hydrological residence time (HRT). Thus, these findings will be a valuable reference to help the government and non-government organizations (NGO) during strategic planning.

TI  - Chad's cabinet of icy curiosities: Sharpening the interpretation of subglacial and ice marginal environments during the LPIA glaciation of the Ennedi Plateau
T2  - SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ennedi Plateau in Chad in north-central Africa exposes an outstanding example of a palaeo-ice stream glacial landsystem of late Palaeozoic age, with an assemblage of geomorphological structures of comparable preservation quality to those found in Quaternary deglaciated landscapes. Satellite images and various methods to combine acquired satellite data (e.g. band-ratio technique) have been used to interpret proglacial, ice-marginal and subglacial structures. The main goal of the study is to produce a detailed and more in-depth analysis of newly found structures that enhance our understanding of ice sheet behaviour in the Ennedi Plateau during the LPIA. We report the first known evidence of soft-sediment striated surfaces from outcrop, testifying to the existence of a soft-deformable bed. This deformable bed interpretation can probably be upscaled to explain the extensive swarms of mega-scale glacial lineations mapped previously across the plateau. Furthermore, we identify the first known fully preserved grounding zone wedge (GZW), replete with three-dimensional geometry, in the rock record. This unique structure exhibits a well pronounced slope and a convex topography. Its presence allows the position of the former coastline to be reconstructed as it is assumed that ice streams terminated into a former ocean basin. Building on the studies by Le Heron (2018) and Kettler et al. (this issue), our analyses permit unprecedented insights into the behaviour of a significant, mid-latitude, marine-terminating ice sheet during the LPIA. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Does urban growth mean the loss of greenness? A multi-temporal analysis for Chinese cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth is recognized as the conversion of vegetated surface to built-up surface. However, there is still no consensus about the urbanization-induced dynamic of vegetation greenness in view of existing literatures. In this study, we aimed to empirically investigate whether urban growth mean the loss of vegetation greenness. We selected 340 Chinese cities as the study areas, relied on consistent multi-temporal remotely sensed data and adopted linear regression analysis, annual growth area, Tail-Sen slope and Mann-Kendall models. Results show that although vegetation greening generally lagged behind urban growth in the monitoring period, a tendency of their consistent speeding up can be observed over time. By categorizing four forms and four trends of vegetation greenness dynamics related to urban growth, we revealed the diversity of Chinese cities. The former focused on the velocity of urban growth and vegetation greenness dynamics within newly urbanized area in three phases, i. e., 2003-2008, 2008-2013 and 2013-2018. The latter focused on the interannual trends of vegetation greenness dynamics among the previously existing and newly urbanized areas. The key finding is that, in over 85 % of the cities, we measured an increase of vegetation greenness along with urban growth. In addition, our detailed results allow quantifying the impact of urbanization in Chinese cities on vegetation protection and sustainable development.

TI  - Reimagining Relationships: Multispecies Justice as a Frame for the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - COVID-19 catalyzed a renewed focus on the interconnected nature of human health. Together with the climate crisis, it highlighted not only intra-human connections but the entanglement of human health with the health of non-human animals, plants, and ecological systems more broadly. In this article, we challenge the persistent notion that humans are ontologically distinct from the rest of nature and the ethics that flow from this understanding. Imposing this privileged view of humans has devastating consequences for beings other than humans and for humans and impedes effective responses to crises. We situate the COVID-19 pandemic within the "polycrisis," and argue that one component of addressing multidimensional crises must involve fully embracing a relational ontology and ethics. We discuss two approaches to relationality, one articulated by ecofeminists and the second inhering in an Indigenous Maori worldview. Two dominant approaches, One Health and Planetary Health, purport to take account of relational ontologies in their approaches to health, but, we argue, persist in casting the more-than-human world in an instrumental role to secure human health. We suggest that Multispecies Justice, which draws on ecofeminist and Indigenous approaches, affords a fully relational approach to health and well-being. We explore the implications of relationality, and suggest fresh ways of understanding humans' connections with the more-than-human world.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Cooperative laparoscopic or robotic-endoscopic surgery has emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of early-stage colorectal cancers that are difficult to treat with endoscopic techniques alone. Cooperative surgery allows organ and function preservation by complementing the advantages of each modality, providing minimally invasive, precise and personalized treatment options. Laparoscopic-endoscopic cooperative surgery includes laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic resection, combined laparoscopic-endoscopic full-thickness resection, endoscopic-assisted laparoscopic wedge resection, endoscopic-assisted laparoscopic segmental resection, and laparoscopic-endoscopic cooperative surgery with sentinel lymph node dissection. Nearly three decades of clinical research and practice have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery in the treatment of colorectal tumors. With the progress of the minimally invasive concept, the development of minimally invasive technology and the innovation of minimally invasive equipment, laparoscopy and endoscopy cooperative surgery is expected to have a proper place in the treatment of colorectal tumors.

TI  - The association between patients' frailty status, multimorbidity, and demographic characteristics and changes in primary care for chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic: a pre-post study
T2  - FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of SARS-COV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic on primary care management (frequency of monitoring activities, regular prescriptions, and test results) of older adults with common chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease) and to examine whether any changes were associated with age, sex, neighbourhood income, multimorbidity, and frailty.Methods: A research database from a sub-set of McMaster University Sentinel and Information Collaboration family practices was used to identify patients >= 65 years of age with a frailty assessment and 1 or more of the conditions. Patient demographics, chronic conditions, and chronic disease management information were retrieved. Changes from 14 months pre to 14 months since the pandemic were described and associations between patient characteristics and changes in monitoring, prescriptions, and test results were analysed using regression models.Results: The mean age of the 658 patients was 75 years. While the frequency of monitoring activities and prescriptions related to chronic conditions decreased overall, there were no clear trends across sub-groups of age, sex, frailty level, neighbourhood income, or number of conditions. The mean values of disease monitoring parameters (e.g. blood pressure) did not considerably change. The only significant regression model demonstrated that when controlling for all other variables, patients with 2 chronic conditions and those with 4 or more conditions were twice as likely to have reduced numbers of eGFR (Estimated glomerular filtration rate) measures compared to those with only 1 condition ((OR (odds ratio) = 2.40, 95% CI [1.19, 4.87]); (OR = 2.19, 95% CI [1.12, 4.25]), respectively).Conclusion: In the first 14 months of the pandemic, the frequency of common elements of chronic condition care did not notably change overall or among higher-risk patients.

TI  - Regional modeling of groundwater recharge in the Basin of Mexico: new insights from satellite observations and global data sources
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Regional groundwater recharge (GWR) is crucial to improving water management strategies; however, the lack of available data constrains its computation. Here, a practical approach using remote sensing data and global hydrological products was implemented to estimate regional GWR in the Basin of Mexico, a similar to 9,000-km(2) basin in central Mexico with a population of similar to 25 million people, where groundwater represents the most important water source. The soil-water-balance (SWB) model was applied to estimate the regional GWR from 2000 to 2021 in the Basin of Mexico using four model setups, including climatological records from ground stations (M1), remotely based precipitation from CHIRPS (M2), bias-corrected precipi-tation from CHIRPS (M3), and CHIRPS with temperature from the Daymet product (M4), and other global soil and land use datasets. Furthermore, the regional GWR model was calibrated using runoff from streamflow gauges and evapotranspira-tion from empirical equations and remote sensing data. The mean regional GWR values estimated in the Basin of Mexico using the M1, M2, M3, and M4 setups were 37, 45, 38, and 45 mm/year (10.38, 12.57, 10.73, 12.61 m(3)/s), respectively. All setups agreed that the Sierra de las Cruces represents the dominant GWR area; still, larger differences were obtained at high elevations due to the lack of climatological stations. Results suggest that annual precipitation and GWR follow a potential relationship dominated by elevation and surficial lithology. Finally, remote sensing and global sources could be successfully used to depict regional changes in recharge patterns within dat a-limited basins.

TI  - Comprehensive study of algal blooms variation in Jiaozhou Bay based on google earth engine and deep learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jiaozhou Bay ecosystem, a crucial marine ecosystem in China, has been plagued by frequent harmful algal blooms as due to deteriorating water quality and eutrophication. This study analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of harmful algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay from 2000 to 2022 using the Floating Algae Index (FAI) calculated from MODIS (2000-2022) and Sentinel-2 (2015-2022) satellite image datasets. The calculation results of the image datasets were compared. The frequency of planktonic algal outbreaks was low and constant until 2017, but has increased annually since then. Algae blooms are most common in the summer and primarily concentrated along the bay's coast, middle, and mouth, with obvious seasonal and spatial distribution characteristics. Several factors influencing algal outbreaks were identified, including sea surface temperature, wind speed, air pressure, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus ratios, chemical oxygen demand, and petroleum pollutants. Algal bloom outbreaks in Jiaozhou Bay are expected to remain high in 2023. The findings provide crucial information for water quality management and future algal outbreak prediction and prevention in Jiaozhou Bay.

TI  - Distribution and main sources of oil spills in the Persian Gulf based on satellite monitoring with synthetic aperture radar
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Persian Gulf is characterized by a huge number of offshore oil and gas platforms, large number of many oil terminals, and busy shipping lines for supporting oil transportation. In this regard, developing various methods for assessing the oil pollution of the Gulf, including remote sensing, is extremely important. For the first time, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the European Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites were used routinely to monitor the entire Gulf in 2017-2019. To effectively analyse the SAR images and their detected dark patches, a monitoring method based on manual detection and all contextual information available using web-GIS approach, was used. This involved the creation of a dedicated geoportal with oceanographic, physical - geographical, industrial and navigational information on the water basin, including the offshore oil and gas infrastructure. Using this approach, as well as data from automatic ship identification system, most oil spills were detected, recognized and mapped. The summary oil spill distribution maps and main statistical results of the monitoring are presented and discussed. It is shown that the main sources of oil pollution in the Persian Gulf (oil slicks/spills from 0.5 to about 700 km2) are (in decreasing order) oil production, oil transportation, and local shipping.

TI  - Mapping historical forest biomass for stock-change assessments at parcel to landscape scales
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding historical forest dynamics, specifically changes in forest biomass and carbon stocks, has become critical for assessing current forest climate benefits and projecting future benefits under various policy, regulatory, and stewardship scenarios. Carbon accounting frameworks based exclusively on national forest inventories are limited to broad-scale estimates, but model-based approaches that combine these inventories with remotely sensed data can yield contiguous fine-resolution maps of forest biomass and carbon stocks across landscapes over time. Here we describe a fundamental step in building a map-based stock-change framework: mapping historical forest biomass at fine temporal and spatial resolution (annual, 30 m) across all of New York State (USA) from 1990 to 2019, using freely available data and open-source tools.Using Landsat imagery, US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and off-the-shelf LiDAR collections we developed three modeling approaches for mapping historical forest aboveground biomass (AGB): training on FIA plot-level AGB estimates (direct), training on LiDAR-derived AGB maps (indirect), and an ensemble averaging predictions from the direct and indirect models. Model prediction surfaces (maps) were tested against FIA estimates at multiple scales. All three approaches produced viable outputs, yet tradeoffs were evident in terms of model complexity, map accuracy, saturation, and fine-scale pattern representation. The resulting map products can help identify where, when, and how forest carbon stocks are changing as a result of both anthropogenic and natural drivers alike. These products can thus serve as inputs to a wide range of applications including stock-change assessments, monitoring reporting and verification frameworks, and prioritizing parcels for protection or enrollment in improved management programs.

TI  - Mental Health Treatment-Seeking Appraisal, Afrocentric Cultural Norms, and Mental Health Functioning: Buffering Factors of Young Black Men's Externalizing Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Depression rates are disproportionately high among Black American Men. This disparity--compounded by low mental healthcare seeking rates and high incorrect diagnosis rates in men--could be related to masculine norms, including self-reliance, restrictive emotionality, and stoicism. Furthermore, men are more likely to engage in externalized behavior, such as aggression, to cope with mental health challenges; this pattern is influenced by cultural and environmental factors. Contrary to these detrimental factors, social relationships, belief in social networks, and collectivism have been associated with positive mental health in these populations. Similarly, an Afrocentric worldview (including concepts like Ubuntu and African self-consciousness) has been hypothesized to promote positive mental health outcomes among Black American men. However, little research exists on harnessing these factors as a means of increasing health-seeking behaviors in young Black males.Aim To elucidate the effect of region, depression, African humanism, collectivism, and help-seeking values and needs concerning aggression in young Black males.Method This study included Black or African American participants (n = 428) identifying as male, aged 18- 25 years, who responded to a Qualtrics survey with questions on region, aggression, depression, African humanism, collectivism, and help-seeking value and need.Results Hierarchical linear regression revealed that collectivism, humanness, value, and the need for seeking treatment were inversely associated with aggression (p < 0.001).Discussion/Conclusion Highlighting the effect of cultural norms and help-seeking behaviors and the aggravating effect of depression on aggression in young Black males can help to develop aggression-mitigating interventions rooted in Afrocentric Norms.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the introduction of minimally invasive methods into the field of surgery, the concept of early gastric cancer (EGC) treating has gradually changed from the pursuit of standardized traditional surgical methods to precise, individualized, interdisciplinary collaborative management. Both endoscopic therapy and laparoscopic surgery have their limitations for early gastric cancer treatment. Meanwhile, Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) combines the advantages of endoscopy and laparoscopy to perform local gastric resection and regional lymph node dissection, providing a more effective surgical approach for radical resection of early gastric cancer. The application of LECS in the treatment of early gastric cancer has been increasing, from the initial laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection to the evolvement of a variety of improved procedures such as combined laparoscopic and endoscopic approach for neoplasia with a non-exposure technique, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery, and the possibility of combined (sentinel lymph node drainage area) regional lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node navigation surgery, which expands the indications for endoscopic surgery and maximizes the preservation of normal gastric tissue structure and function while ensuring radical treatment, and will certainly become an important development direction in the treatment of early gastric cancer in the future.
AB  - 随着微创技术的发展，早期胃癌的治疗理念逐渐由追求标准化的传统手术方式转变为精准化、个体化和交叉学科间的合作诊疗。内镜下切除和腹腔镜手术是目前早期胃癌治疗的主流手段，但两者均存在一定局限性。腹腔镜与内镜联合手术（LECS）则结合内镜和腹腔镜优点，进行胃局部切除和区域淋巴结清扫，为早期胃癌的根治性切除提供了一种更为有效的手术方式。LECS在早期胃癌治疗方面的应用不断增多，从最初的腹腔镜辅助内镜下全层切除术，逐步衍生出非暴露技术腹腔镜-内镜联合入路肿瘤切除术、非暴露内镜下胃壁翻转术等多种改良术式，并可联合（前哨淋巴结引流区）区域淋巴结清扫或前哨淋巴结导航手术，扩大了内镜手术适应证，在确保根治的前提下，最大限度保留了正常胃的组织结构和功能，必将成为未来早期胃癌治疗中的重要发展方向。.

TI  - The extent, perceived causes and impacts of land use and land cover change in Tyhume Valley, South Africa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is limited knowledge on how people living in communal areas perceive land use and land cover (LULC) change and the impacts it has on sustainable access to essential ecosystem goods and services. This study used seven wet season Landsat images covering 1989 to 2019 and the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to map LULC in Tyhume Valley, South Africa. Analyses of trends in LULC and long-term changes in rainfall over the same period were based on the Mann Kendall (MK) statistical technique. Perceptions on the causes and impacts of the observed trends were solicited from 102 respondents and summarized through frequency analysis. Major trends that emerged from image-based analysis include the expansion of Vachellia karroo by 25% (t = 0.98; p = 0.004), decrease in pastureland by 18% (t = -0.90, p = 0.007), decrease in cropland by 9.6% (t = -0.90, p = 0.007), decrease in surface water by 1.1% (-0.90, p = 0.007), and increase in built-up area by 2.5% (t = 1.00, p = 0.003). Perceived causes of these trends include the eradication of land access control systems, poor management of surface water, lack of farmer support programs, and 14 years of negative rainfall anomalies. The impacts of these changes include long-distance trekking of animals to pastures and watering points, increased livestock malnutrition and mortality, decline of medicinal and culturally significant trees, increased purchasing of stock feed, increased unemployment, and consumption of unhealthy food. The study concludes by highlighting the need to accommodate local perceptions in the formulation of policies and practices for sustainable use of ecosystem services.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The deterioration of the urban surface thermal environment has seriously affected regional environments and human health, becoming a critical ecological problem faced by cities worldwide. This study focused on surface urban heat island effect in metropolitan area and selected the emerging metropolitan area of Zhengzhou, China, as a case study. Based on the MODIS land surface temperature data obtained from the Google Earth Engine the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) was calculated and its temporal and spatial dynamics were analyzed from 2003 to 2022. The main findings indicated that Zhengzhou, the core city of the metropolitan area, had the strongest urban heat island effect with day surface urban heat island intensity of 1.10 & DEG;C and night SUHII of 1.39 & DEG;C). Generally, the average annual SUHII was higher during the day than at night, and the maximum value was detected in summer (2.43 & DEG;C). SUHII showed an increasing trend at night, especially in summer during the study period. It decreased obviously in urban centers during the day, while it increased obviously in the outer urban areas at night. The results of this study contributed to the understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban heat island effect in the Zhengzhou metropolitan area.

TI  - Japanese encephalitis virus: epidemiology and risk-based surveillance approaches for New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The introduction and subsequent rapid spread of Japanese encephalitis virus genotype IV across all Australian mainland states and the Northern Territory since late 2021 has increased the risk of an incursion of this mosquito-transmitted zoonotic virus disease into New Zealand, with serious implications for both animal and human health. The potential modes of entry are through introduction of infected mosquitoes as hitchhikers on ships or aircraft, windborne transfer of mosquitoes, or arrival of infected reservoir bird species. A competent vector mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, is endemic in New Zealand and other mosquito species may also become involved. If infection becomes established in New Zealand, the scale of transmission may be considerably less than has occurred in Australia because climatic and epidemiological factors are not so favourable. Early evidence of an incursion could come from detection of clinical disease in horses or pigs, or from human cases. Targeted surveillance to confirm or refute indications of an incursion could be undertaken by antibody detection in a number of species. Dogs have been shown to be a particularly valuable sentinel species due to their cohabitation with people and high seroconversion rate. Other novel methods of surveillance could include reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on oronasal secretions of pigs. Should evidence of the disease be detected, prompt action would be required to vaccinate at-risk human populations and clarify the epidemiological situation with respect to mammalian hosts and mosquito vector species, including whether a new mosquito species had arrived in the country.Abbreviations: AHL: Animal Health Laboratory; JE: Japanese encephalitis disease; JEV: Japanese encephalitis virus; RT-PCR: Reverse transcriptase PCR

TI  - Current Forest-Savanna Transition in Northern South America Departs from Typical Climatic Thresholds
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The forest-savanna transition is the most widespread ecotone in the tropics, with important ecological, climatic, and biogeochemical implications at local to global scales. However, the factors and mechanisms that control this transition vary among continents and regions. Here, we analyzed which factors best explain the transition in northern South America (Llanos ecoregion and northwestern Amazon), where common thresholds on typical environmental factors (for example, mean annual precipitation (MAP), wet season precipitation) fail to predict it. For instance, savannas in the Llanos occur at MAP levels (> 1500 mm) which are typical of forests in other tropical regions. We examined the transition's climate features, soils, and disturbance (fire frequency) spaces using remotely sensed data. We used logistic generalized linear models to assess the effect of seasonal (season length) and intra-seasonal (daily precipitation frequency and intensity) precipitation metrics during the dry season, soil silt content, and fire frequency, on the transition using canopy cover, tree cover, and the maximum Plant Area Volume Density as vegetation structure descriptor variables. Fire frequency and precipitation frequency were the most important variables explaining the transition. Although most fires occur in savannas, we found that a significant percentage of savanna pixels (46%) had no fires. This study indicates that the transition should be characterized regionally in response to biogeographic differences (for example, climatic space) among regions and continents. Our results highlight the importance of fire frequency and intra-seasonal precipitation in determining the transition in northern South America. Furthermore, future studies should consider regional differences in the climatic space of forest and savanna to improve projections of global change impacts on these highly diverse ecosystems.

TI  - De-Implementation of Low-Value Care for Women 70 Years of Age or Older with Low-Risk Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. Older women with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) invasive breast cancer (IBC) are at risk for overtreatment. Guidelines allow for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and radiotherapy omission after breast conserving surgery (BCS) for women 70 years of age or older with T1, clinical node negativity (cN0), and ER+ IBC. The study objective was to evaluate radiotherapy and SLNB de-implementation in older women with low-risk IBC after the resource limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. An institutional database was analyzed to identify women 70 years of age or older who received BCS for IBC from 2012 to 2022. The patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with low-risk IBC (pT1, cN0, and ER+/HER2-) who were eligible for radiotherapy and SLNB omission and (2) patients with high-risk IBC (pT2-T4, cN+, ER-, or HER2+) who were ineligible for therapy omission. Clinicopathologic variables in both cohorts were analyzed.Results. The study enrolled 881 patients. For the patients with low-risk IBC, the annual rates of radiotherapy were stable from 2012 to 2019. However, radiotherapy utilization decreased significantly from 2020 to 2022 (58% in 2012 vs 36% in 2022; p = 0.04). In contrast, radiotherapy usage among the patients with high-risk IBC was stable from 2012 to 2022 (79% in 2012 vs 79% in 2022; p = 0.95). Among the patients with low-risk IBC, SLNB rates decreased from 86% in 2012 to 56% in 2022, but this trend predated those in 2020. The factors significantly associated with SLNB and receipt of radiotherapy among the patients with low risk IBC were younger age, larger tumors, grade 3 disease, and involved nodal status (p < 0.01).Conclusion. This study demonstrated appropriate and sustained de-escalation of radiotherapy in older women with low-risk IBC after the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Healthcare utilization during the first two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa: A cross-sectional household survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthcare utilization surveys contextualize facility-based surveillance data for burden estimates. We describe healthcare utilization in the catchment areas for sentinel site healthcare facilities during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional healthcare utilization survey in households in three communities from three provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and North West). Field workers administered structured questionnaires electronically with the household members reporting influenza-like illness (ILI) in the past 30 days or severe respiratory illness (SRI) since March 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with healthcare utilization among individuals that reported illness. From November 2020 through April 2021, we enrolled 5804 households and 23,003 individuals. Any respiratory illness was reported by 1.6% of individuals; 0.7% reported ILI only, 0.8% reported SRI only, and 0.1% reported both ILI and SRI. Any form of medical care was sought by 40.8% (95% CI 32.9% - 49.6%) and 71.3% (95% CI 63.2% - 78.6%) of individuals with ILI and SRI, respectively. On multivariable analysis, respiratory illness was more likely to be medically attended for individuals at the Pietermaritzburg site (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.5, compared to Klerksdorp), that were underweight (aOR 11.5, 95% CI 1.5-90.2, compared to normal weight), with underlying illness (aOR 3.2, 95%CI 1.2-8.5), that experienced severe illness (aOR 4.8, 95% CI 1.6-14.3) and those with symptom duration of =10 days (aOR 7.9, 95% CI 2.1-30.2, compared to <5 days). Less than half of ILI episodes and only 71% of SRI episodes were medically attended during the first two COVID-19 waves in South Africa. Facility-based data may underestimate disease burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire occurrence is synonymous to terrestrial ecosystems and an important component of the Earth system. Climate change, vegetation characteristics, and human activity regulate fire occurrence and spread, however, fires also interact with them in multiple ways. Due to the complicated mechanisms of interactions between fire and land use or cover, the spatial distribution, change trends and land use or cover types of fire occurrences exist wide discrepancies in different regions or countries around the world. Therefore, the quantitative and spatial relationship and differences between fire and land use or cover at the global scale remain poorly understood systematically. Here, we combine active fire and land cover products during 2001-2020 to explore the spatiotemporal features, trends, and types of active fires from global to continental scales. Globally, the annual changes of monthly active fire occurrences kept a dramatic increase in first two or three years but a circuitous decrease since then. Most areas prevailingly experienced active fires for once to five times, a small part of areas clustered in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America experienced active fires for over five times in the last 20 years. In particular, above 60 % of active fires (re-)occurred in forest and 20-25 % in cropland, whereas grassland and construction land only accounted for about 5 % and less than 2 % respectively. Driven by active fires, the conversion of forest to cropland accounted for nearly 60 % and the transition of cropland to forest (about 10 %) followed and formed an interactive circle. Our findings improve the understanding of fire-land cover change interactions, particularly agricultural expansion and forest loss driven by active fires. Future efforts on agricultural expansion, urban safety, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation should take the results of this research into account.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Thaw Slumps Based on Neural Network Methods and Thaw Slumping Susceptibility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Thaw slumping is a periglacial process that occurs on slopes in cold environments, where the ground becomes unstable and the surface slides downhill due to saturation with water during thawing. In this study, GaoFen-1 remote sensing and fused multi-source feature data were used to automatically map thaw slumping landforms in the Beilu River Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The bi-directional cascade network structure was used to extract edges at different scales, where an individual layer was supervised by labeled edges at its specific scale, rather than directly applying the same supervision to all convolutional neural network outputs. Additionally, we conducted a 5-year multi-scale feature analysis of small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar deformation, normalized difference vegetation index, and slope, among other features. Our study analyzed the performance and accuracy of three methods based on edge object supervised learning and three preconfigured neural networks, ResNet101, VGG16, and ResNet152. Through verification using site surveys and multi-data fusion results, we obtained the best ResNet101 model score of intersection over union of 0.85 (overall accuracy of 84.59%).The value of intersection over union of the VGG and ResNet152 are 0.569 and 0.773, respectively. This work provides a new insight for the potential feasibility of applying the designed edge detection method to map diverse thaw slumping landforms in larger areas with high-resolution images.

TI  - Modeling Soil Loss and Its Association to Site Physical Characteristics in Majang Watershed, Baro Abobo River Basin
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of Ethiopia's threatening environmental problems is soil erosion. Minimizing soil erosion to the tolerable level needs evidence-based sustainable land management. This study aimed to investigate the soil erosion rate and its relation with site physical characteristics (slope, land use/cover, and soil properties) using the GIS-based RUSLE model in the Majang watershed. Climate data, DEM, Landsat image, and soil map were used to model soil erosion by applying the RUSLE model. The results showed that cultivated land is the most vulnerable type of land use to soil loss (35.1 & BULL;t ha-1 year-1) followed by grasslands (19.6 & BULL;t ha-1 year-1) in the watershed. Conversely, forest land is the least vulnerable land use and generates a very low amount of soil loss (12 & BULL;t ha-1 year-1). Similarly, the average soil loss of the watershed is strongly related to the slope gradient. The model result indicated that a high amount of soil loss was observed in very steep slope land (62.8 & BULL;t ha-1 year-1) but lower in the gentle slope (13.6 & BULL;t ha-1 year-1). Soil types and their characteristics have greater roles in generating a high amount of soil loss. Acrisols, which lack organic matter content, have experienced a high soil loss rate (20 & BULL;t ha-1 year-1). This implies soil loss is highly associated with site-specific characteristics such as slope gradient, land cover/use, and soil condition. The greatest share of the soil loss was estimated from steep slopes, bare and cultivated land, and less fertile soils. Therefore, building an integrated participatory approach needs immediate attention, and all farmers and stakeholders need to focus on on-site prioritization and invest more in conserving vulnerable areas.

AB  - Change detection methods based on Earth Observations are increasingly used to monitor rainforest in the intertropical band. Until recently, deforestation monitoring was mainly based on remotely sensed optical images which often face limitations in humid tropical areas due to frequent cloud coverage. This leads to late detections of disturbance events. Since the launch of Sentinel-1 acquiring images with a revisit time of 12 days and a spatial resolution of 5 x 20 m in Brazil, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have been increasingly used to monitor deforestation. In this study, we propose a multitemporal version of the change detection method we previously applied to timeseries of Sentinel-1 SAR images, to monitor deforestation/degradation in the Congo rainforest. Our approach is based on a Cumulative Sum (CuSum) method combined with a spatial recombination of Critical Thresholds (CuSum cross-Tc). The newly developed multitemporal CuSum method (ReCuSum) was applied to a time-series of 82 dual polarization (VH, VV) Ground Range Detected (GRD) Sentinel-1 images acquired in the Para State, in the Brazilian Amazonia, from 29/09/2016 to 01/07/2019. The ReCuSum method consists of iteratively applying the CuSum cross-Tc to monitor multiple changes in a time-series by splitting the time-series at each date of detected change and by independently iterating over the time periods resulting from the splits. The number of changes in the time-series was then analysed according to the vegetation type (Forest, non-forest vegetation) determined by visual inspection of optical Sentinel-2 image and PlanetScope monthly mosaic. This showed a difference between non-forest vegetation and forested areas. A threshold based on the number of changes (Tnbc) was then developed to differentiate forest from non-forest disturbances. The ability to monitor non-forest vegetation was analysed: the CuSum cross-Tc detected up to 90% of the total non-forest vegetation area over the study region in the past period. After removing past disturbances and past non-forest vegetation, then removing the pixels covered with non-forest vegetations based on Tnbc, the application of the ReCuSum led to a precision of 81%, a recall of 68%, a kappa coefficient of 0.72 and a F1-score of 0.74 in forest disturbance monitoring. According to these results, ReCuSum applied to Sentinel-1 time-series of images can be used for efficient forest disturbance monitoring and for generating a forest / non-forest map after the application of newly developed post-processing steps. Sentinel-1 imagery can be used for both Forest / Non-forest mapping and for forest disturbance detection. ReCuSum was released as an open-source GIT project available at: https://forgemia. inra.fr/bertrand.ygorra/cusum-deforestation_monitoring.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with a prescription of a Lyme borreliosis serology for erythema migrans diagnosis in general practice: a study from the French sentinel network, 2009-2020
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Serological testing of patients consulting for typical erythema migrans (EM) is not recommended in European recommendations for diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis (LB). Little is known on the level of adherence of French general practitioners to these recommendations. The objectives were to estimate the proportion of Lyme borreliosis serological test prescription in patients with erythema migrans seen in general practice consultations in France, and to study the factors associated with this prescription.Methods LB cases with an EM reported by the French general practitioners (GPs) of the Sentinelles network between January 2009 and December 2020 were included. To assess the associations with a prescription of a serological test, multilevel logistic regression models were used.Results Among the 1,831 EM cases included, a prescription for a LB serological test was requested in 24.0% of cases. This proportion decreased significantly over the study period, from 46.8% in 2009 to 15.8% in 2020. A LB serological prescription was associated with patients with no reported tick bite (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.95; 95% confidence interval [1.23-3.09]), multiple EM (OR: 3.82 [1.63-8.92]), EM of five centimeters or more (OR: 4.34 [2.33-8.08]), and GPs having diagnosed less than one EM case per year during the study period (OR: 5.28 [1.73-16.11]).Conclusions Serological testing of patients consulting for EM is not recommended in European recommendations for diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Therefore, the significant decrease in the rate of LB serological test for EM over the study period is encouraging. The factors identified in this study can be used to improve messaging to GPs and patients. Further efforts are needed to continue to disseminate diagnostic recommendations for LB to GPs, especially those who rarely see patients with EM.

TI  - Proposal of a new Mining and Geology Impact Factor (MaGIF) index for the study of post-mining environment
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Babina mine closed almost 50 years ago, and reclamation works for reforestation began shortly after. Despite various technical and biological measures, the area is still experiencing negative consequences from mining, exacerbated by its complex glaciotectonic structure. These phenomena have an impact on the post-mining environment. The presented study aimed to identify areas within a mining area of the Babina mine, where the former mining activities and geological structure had the strongest influence on the changes in flora and soil conditions between 1989 and 2019. The research also revealed previously undocumented mining excavations. The study used the Mining and Geology Impact Factor, combining OLS models and spatial statistics based on spectral indices. Eighteen explanatory factors described the geological-mining and topographic conditions, while five dependent variables represented changes in vegetation and soil over 30 years. MaGIF values ranged between 0.13 and 0.97. The highest values indicated a significant impact on soil and vegetation in six regions. Extrapolation of the index values identified three areas where past mining activities may have occurred outside of archival records. This study confirms the substantial environmental influence of previous mining and the glaciotectonic structure. The use of remote sensing and spatial analysis aids in identifying vulnerable areas and preventing potential environmental damage.

TI  - Potential of and constraints on the application of remote sensing in Tunisia
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing is becoming a useful operational tool for decision support. Information obtained from space is increasingly available. Since the American Landsat program in 1972, many countries have embarked on Earth observations, and there are now about 100 operational satellites in orbit. The potential and the results offered by remote sensing are remarkable if we consider the relative ease of obtaining information of any kind (especially environmental parameters) in a short period of time and at a certain distance, which is then repeated over time or even, in some cases, almost continuously. It allows a wide spatial coverage, greater objectivity and accuracy, as well as a lower cost overall than conventional sensing methods. For developed countries, remote sensing represents a revolution in the field of environmental monitoring, since these countries are the main suppliers of spatial data and software for processing these data. Developing countries, including Tunisia, have found themselves obligated to align themselves with these changes and transitions, and to actively work for greater participation in the elaboration of these changes in the most effective way. Remote sensing has been used for more than 40 years in Tunisia. It has been applied in various fields of research and development, such as agriculture, mapping, and planning. The main objective of this work was to assess the potential of remote sensing to be applied in each of these domains in Tunisia through a comparative multi-criteria analysis using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Four criteria (data used, tools and software, acquired competence, and financial resources) that have a significant impact on the potential for remote sensing application were included in our analysis. Weights were assigned to each parameter through a pairwise comparison matrix based on the AHP method. The results showed that agriculture and land use planning are the areas where remote sensing has the greatest potential, with high weights for all criteria studied. Regarding the criteria studied, it was observed that the criterion of data used is important for all application areas, followed by skills. For agriculture and land use planning, the criterion of data used (c1) is considered the most important, with a high weight of 59.4%. This suggests that the data used are a crucial influence on the application of remote sensing in these application areas. For its application to mapping, the choice of tools used (c2) is crucial, with a high weight of 31.3% for this criterion. For the environment, costs can be an important factor to consider, with a relatively high weight of 12.9% for the financial resources criteria (c4). The results of our study were validated by comparing them with those of a technology needs assessment report for climate adaptation conducted in Tunisia by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development [United Nations Development Programme (2016) Tunisia: technology needs assessment. Report on climate change adaptation. https://tech-action.unepccc.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/05/tunisia-tna-report-1feb2016-adaptation.pdf]. According to this report, the highest-priority sectors for the use of new technologies such as remote sensing in Tunisia are agriculture and water resources management as well as coastal, marine, and urban area management.These sectors were selected because of their weight in the country's economy and their vulnerability to climate change among the various sectors analysed in the report (agriculture and water resources management, management of urban, coastal and marine areas, ecosystem management, tourism and health). We used a sensitivity analysis method called the Morris method. This method estimates the importance of each criterion and each interaction between criteria to the variation in the results. The results of this analysis show that criterion c1 (data used) is the most important for all domains, with sensitivity indices ranging from 12.8 to 17.8%. Criterion c2 (tools and software) is also important for the mapping and environmental domains, with sensitivity indices of 11% and 10.2%, respectively. Criterion C3 (acquired competence) is important for the agriculture and environment domains, with sensitivity indices of 13% and 12.3%, respectively. Finally, criterion c4 (financial resources) is also important for the mapping and agriculture domains, with sensitivity indices of 12.1% and 13%, respectively. In conclusion, the sensitivity analysis shows that the overall results are quite robust to variations in the criteria.

TI  - An energy-efficient hierarchical data fusion approach in IoT
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Data Fusion (DF) involves merging data from various heterogeneous sources to generate fused data that is reduced in volume while preserving its integrity, consistency, and veracity. However, DF methodologies often pose challenges for low computational-powered sensor nodes (SNs) in energy-constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) enabled Internet of Things (IoT). This study introduces a hierarchical data fusion (HDF) technique specifically designed to distribute the computational load among SNs with a focus on addressing the challenges of spatiotemporal data (STD). The hierarchy consists of three levels: A spatiotemporal data fusion (STDF) method, employed at the SNs level that efficiently handles the complex relationships between STD attributes; A fuzzy data fusion method, implemented at the cluster head (CH) level that effectively addresses the imprecise and fuzzy nature of real-world; The final fusion, applied at the sink (SKN) level that is based on the count of encoded icon values (EIVs). The proposed method achieves high accuracy (ACC), low error rates (ERR), and improved precision (PRE), recall (REC), and f1-score (F1S) values compared to avant-garde methods. Moreover, the analysis of the proposed technique reveals reduced computational complexity by distributing the computational load across different levels of hierarchy. Additionally, the proposed HDF technique exhibits lowered energy consumption and reduced communication overhead, making it well-suited for implementation in WSNs-enabled IoT.

TI  - Accuracy of the FY-L formula in calculating intraocular lens power after small-incision lenticule extraction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe study aimed to assess the accuracy of the FY-L formula in calculating intraocular lens (IOL) power after small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).MethodsFor the post-SMILE IOL calculation of the same eye, the IOL power targeting the pre-SMILE eyes' lowest myopic refractive error was used. The FY-L formula, the Emmetropia Verifying Optical Formula (EVO-L), the Barrett True-K no history, and the Shammas-L, respectively, were used to calculate the predicted refractive error of target IOL power. A comparison was made between the change in spherical equivalent induced by SMILE (SMILE-Dif) and the variance between IOL-Dif (IOL-Induced Refractive Error) before and after SMILE. The prediction error (PE) was defined as SMILE-Dif minus IOL-Dif. The proportion of eyes with PEs within & PLUSMN;0.25 D, & PLUSMN;0.50 D, & PLUSMN;0.75 D, and & PLUSMN;1.00 D, the numerical and absolute prediction errors (PEs and AEs), and the median absolute error (MedAE) were compared.ResultsIn total, 80 eyes from 42 patients who underwent SMILE were included in the study. The FY-L formula generated the sample's lowest mean PE (0.06 & PLUSMN; 0.76 D), MAE (0.58 & PLUSMN; 0.50 D), and MedAE (0.47 D), respectively. The PEs in & PLUSMN;0.25 D, & PLUSMN;0.50 D, & PLUSMN;0.75 D, and & PLUSMN;1.00 D comprised 28.8%, 46.3%, 70.0%, and 87.5%, respectively, for the FY-L formula. Compared to other formulas, the FY-L formula produced the highest value with PEs for the percentage of eyes in & PLUSMN;0.50 D, & PLUSMN;0.75 D, and & PLUSMN;1.00 D.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that the FY-L formula provides satisfactory outcomes in estimating the IOL power in the eyes after SMILE.

TI  - Identification and assessment of the drift velocity of green tides using the maximum cross-correlation method in the Yellow Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The green tides outbreak events seriously threaten the ecological balance of the coastal areas. Quickly and accurately obtaining the spatial distribution and drift state of green tides is key to early warning. Based on Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) image pair, the green tides drift velocity was extracted using the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method, and windage was calculated by combining ocean current and wind data. The results of the MCC method were validated. Ulva's drift in the Yellow Sea is shaped by both ocean currents and wind, closely aligning with the direction of the currents. Notably, the northward drift velocity of Ulva exhibits a clear boundary around 34 degrees 40 & PRIME;N. Windage shows similar characteristics with the Ulva drift velocity, as its values vary with time and space. This study will enhance our comprehension of the dynamic mechanism of green tides drift.

TI  - Potential of Multi-temporal InSAR for Detecting Retrogressive Thaw Slumps: A Case of the Beiluhe Region of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Permafrost degradation due to climate warming is severely reducing slope stability by increasing soil pore water pressure and decreasing shear strength. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are among the most dynamic landforms in permafrost areas, which can result in the instability of landscape and ecosystem. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface deformation of RTSs are still unclear, and the potentials of deformation properties in mapping large-scale RTSs need to be further assessed. In this study, we applied a multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method to map the spatiotemporal variations in surface deformation of RTSs in the Beiluhe region of the Tibetan Plateau by using 112 scenes of Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired from 2017 to 2021. The deformation rates of RTSs ranged from - 35 to 20 mm/year, and three typical motion stages were inferred by analyzing the deformation variation trend of the headwall of RTSs: stable, abrupt thaw, and linear subsidence. A total of 375 RTSs were identified in the Mati Hill region by combining InSAR-based deformation results with visual interpretation of optical remote sensing images. Among them, 76 RTSs were newly developed, and 26% more than the inventory derived from the optical images alone. This study demonstrated that the combination of InSAR-derived deformation with optical images has significant potential for detecting RTSs with high accuracy and efficiency at the regional scale.

TI  - Moral injury in post-9/11 combat-experienced military veterans: A qualitative thematic analysis.
T2  - Psychological services
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - War zone exposure is associated with enduring negative mental health effects and poorer responses to treatment, in part because this type of trauma can entail crises of conscience or moral injury. Although a great deal of attention has been paid to posttraumatic stress disorder and fear-based physiological aspects of trauma and suffering, comparatively less attention has been given to the morally injurious dimension of trauma. Robust themes of moral injury were identified in interviews with 26 post-9/11 military veterans. Thematic analysis identified 12 themes that were subsumed under four categories reflecting changes, shifts, or ruptures in worldview, meaning making, identity, and relationships. Moral injury is a unique and challenging clinical construct with impacts on the individual as well as at every level of the social ecological system. Recommendations are offered for addressing moral injury in a military population; implications for community public health are noted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Maintaining rich biodiversity and being a habitat and resource for humans, tropical forests are one of the most important global biomes. These forest ecosystems have been experiencing a host of unregulated anthropogenic activities including illegal tourism, and shifting cultivation. The presence of human-habitats in the restricted zones of forest ecosystems is a direct indicator of the human activities that may accelerate deterioration of forest quality by area and tree species composition. Remote sensing data have been extensively used for mapping forest types, and biophysical characterization at various spatial scales. Several remote sensing datasets from multispectral, hyperspectral and LIDAR sensors are available for developing and validating a host of methodologies for remote sensing application in forestry. However, quantifying the quality of forest stands and detecting potential threats from the sporadic and small-scale human activities requires sub-pixel level remote sensing data analysis methods such as, spectral mixture modelling. Generally, most of the studies employ pixel-level supervised learning-based analysis techniques to detect infrastructure and settlements. However, if the settlements are smaller than the ground sampling distance and are under the canopy, pixel-based techniques are not suitable. Reinvigorated with progressive availability of hyperspectral imagery, spectral mixture modelling based sub-pixel image analysis is gaining prominence in the contemporary remote sensing application development. However, there is a paucity of high-resolution hyper spectral imagery and associated ground truth spectral measurements for assessing various methodological approaches on studies related to anthropogenic activities and forest disturbance. Most of the studies have relied upon simulating and synthesising the hyperspectral imagery and its associated ground truth spectra for implementation of methods and algorithms. This article presents a distinct dataset of high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and associated ground truth spectra of various vegetable crops acquired over a tropical forest ecosystem. The dataset is valuable for research on developing new discrimination models of forest and cultivated vegetation, classification methods, spectral matching analysis techniques, and sub-pixel target detection methods.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The neural network algorithm approach was adopted in Kolavai Lake to retrieve the inherent optical properties (IOP) of active constituents. The retrieval of IOP by absorption and the scattering of optically active constituents (OAC) through employing Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance and field measured the salinity and temperature. The result illustrates the relationship between the IOP and measured OAC's concentrations and its sensitivity towards spectral wavelength. It shows that the phytoplankton absorption a(p) is highly related with chlorophyll-a concentration and has an R-2 value of 0.808. Furthermore, a(t) the total absorption of water has high correlation with chl-a which indicates the significant dominance in the lentic water. Also, the pigment constituents are showing an R-2 value of 0.754. The total backscattering of water (b(tot)) is strongly related to the total suspended matter with R value > 0.73. The spatial distribution of OAC in Kolavai Lake helps monitor the lake water quality. This approach is well-performed in estimating the inherent optical properties of optically active constituents that gives insight for assessing the relationship between IOP and water quality. The research has proved to be a good potential for monitoring lentic water quality through Sentinel-2 MSI.

AB  - Background Lymphedema (LE) is the most notable complication of axillary surgery. The axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique was created to decrease LE. This study aims to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with ARM in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer.Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent SLNB or ALND. Tumor characteristics and treatments received were evaluated. Surgical intervention and use of ARM were compared to assess LE rates. A subgroup analysis was also performed of patients who underwent NAC.Results LE was initially reported in 7.1% (n = 10) of patients; 3.3% (n = 4) with SLNB and 35% (n = 6) with ALND. At initial follow-up, LE was reported 16.4% more often in patients who underwent ALND with no ARM, and 38.8% more often in patients who underwent ALND plus ARM. An increased risk of LE was found in patients treated with ALND (OR = 16.0, P < .001). All patients who underwent ARM were 12.75% more likely to develop LE if they received NAC (P < .05). Patients in the ALND group who also received NAC were more likely to undergo ARM as compared with patients in the SLNB group (P < .01).Discussion Our study showed that ARM failed to decrease the incidence of LE. Until better surgical outcomes are shown for the prevention of LE using ARM, other approaches should be utilized. However, larger prospective studies are needed to evaluate ARM.

TI  - Indocyanine Green (ICG) and Colorectal Surgery: A Literature Review on Qualitative and Quantitative Methods of Usage.
T2  - Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Due to its many benefits, indocyanine green (ICG) has gained progressive popularity in operating rooms (ORs) globally. This literature review examines its qualitative and quantitative usage in surgical treatment. Method: Relevant terms were searched in five international databases (1. Pubmed, 2. Sciencedirect, 3. Scopus, 4. Oxfordjournals, 5. Reaxys) for a comprehensive literature review. The main benefits of using ICG in colorectal surgery are: intraoperative fluorescence angiography; fluorescence-guided lymph node involvement detection and the sentinel technique; the fluorescent emphasis of a minute liver tumour, counting just 200 tumour cells; facilitation of fistula diagnosis; and tumour tattooing. This methodology can also be used with quantitative characteristics such as maximum intensity, relative maximum intensity, and in-flow parameters such as time-to-peak, slope, and t1/2max. This article concludes that fluorescence surgery with ICG and near-infrared (NIR) light is a relatively new technology that improves anatomical and functional information, allowing more comprehensive and safer tumour removal and the preservation of important structures.

TI  - The impact of maternal morbidity on cesarean section rates: exploring a Latin American network of sentinel facilities using the Robson's Ten Group Classification System
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Latin America has the highest Cesarean Section Rates (CSR) in the world. Robson's Ten Group Classification System (RTGCS) was developed to enable understanding the CSR in different groups of women, classified according to obstetric characteristics into one of ten groups. The size of each CS group may provide helpful data on quality of care in a determined region or setting. Data can potentially be used to compare the impact of conditions such as maternal morbidity on CSR. The objective of this study is to understand the impact of Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) on CSR in ten different groups of RTGCS.Methods Secondary analysis of childbirth information from 2018 to 2021, including 8 health facilities from 5 Latin American and Caribbean countries (Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic), using a surveillance database (SIP-Perinatal Information System, in Spanish) implemented in different settings across Latin America. Women were classified into one of RTGCS. The frequency of each group and its respective CSR were described. Furthermore, the sample was divided into two groups, according to maternal outcomes: women without SMM and those who experienced SMM, considering Potentially Life-threatening Conditions, Maternal Near Miss and Maternal Death as the continuum of morbidity.Results Available data were obtained from 92,688 deliveries using the Robson Classification. Overall CSR was around 38%. Group 5 was responsible for almost one-third of cesarean sections. SMM occurred in 6.7% of cases. Among these cases, the overall CSR was almost 70% in this group. Group 10 had a major role (preterm deliveries). Group 5 (previous Cesarean section) had a very high CSR within the group, regardless of the occurrence of maternal morbidity (over 80%).Conclusion Cesarean section rate was higher in women experiencing SMM than in those without SMM in Latin America. SMM was associated with higher Cesarean section rates, especially in groups 1 and 3. Nevertheless, group 5 was the major contributor to the overall CSR.

TI  - Morphological changes and future projections of the Getz Ice shelf, western Antarctica-A statistical and geospatial approach
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study assessed the extent of the Getz Ice Shelf over a 19-year period using satellite data and divided it into three sectors. The average of rates (AOR), end point rate (EPR), and linear regression (LR) methods were employed to estimate the rate of change, with the LR method showing the strongest correlation. The analysis revealed a shrinkage rate of 42 m/year during February from 2003 to 2019. Over the last 17 years, recession was observed in 60% of transects, while progradation occurred in 40%. The recent decline in Getz ice shelf extent is closely linked to the record low sea ice extent in the Amundsen Sea sector. Predictions for 2024 and 2029 indicated progradation in Sector I and recession in Sectors II and III, as determined by LR analysis. The root mean square error values of transects in Sectors II and III showed good correlation with past positions and satellite-based observations of ice shelves. To validate the predicted ice shelf extent cross-verified with the satellite and predicted data from 2020 to 2022. These findings highlight the complex interactions between climatic forcings, such as wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Positive SAM and increased zonal winds can contribute to warm water upwelling near the Antarctic coast, impacting ice shelf extent. The relationship between ice mass loss and SST provides valuable insights into the dynamic processes of melting and progradation in the Getz Ice Shelf during February. Ocean warming plays a significant role in increased basal melting and changes in sea ice mass. The study emphasizes the significant impact of ocean-atmospheric factors on Antarctic ice shelf dynamics and highlights the necessity for ongoing satellite observations and enhanced comprehension of these processes to accurately predict future changes in Antarctic ice shelves.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Approximation of multi-year time series of XCO2 concentrations using satellite observations and statistical interpolation methods
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term time series of CO2 concentrations are required for studying e.g., the effects of rising CO2 concentrations on plants and ecosystems. Different methods for approximating column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) have been developed to substitute missing local CO2 measurements. This study presents a novel method (XCO2SAT+) for determining monthly XCO2 concentrations for selected sites, based entirely on observations from multiple satellites as well as statistical methods in the case of missing satellite data. The product currently covers a period of 16 years from 2003 to 2018. XCO2SAT+ results were validated against data of five European sites of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and compared to two established XCO2 approximation methods. All three approximation methods were compared to CO2 measurements of German towers from the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). The mean absolute error (MAE) between the XCO2SAT+ method and TCCON site Karlsruhe, Germany ranges between 0.5 and 1.1 ppm (0.1-0.3%) for years 2014-2018. Mean differences between XCO2SAT+ and XCO2 approximation method CAMS-GCM shows a slightly better MAE of 0.1-0.3 ppm for CAMS-GCM at two German TCCON sites. Multi-year comparisons with ground-level ICOS measurements revealed a comparable seasonality of CO2 concentrations during the vegetation period, but underestimated high winter concentrations, a pattern also observed when comparing with CAMS-GCM. XCO2SAT+ is a suitable alternative and simple method for providing long-term time series of monthly averaged XCO2 concentrations for selected sites, expanding the methodological toolbox for in-situ CO2 research. The new method, which so far provides XCO2 concentrations, will thus serve as a first step towards providing further CO2 data sources, which could be used to further improve numerical models such as atmospheric models or crop growth models and to study CO2 impacts in agriculture and natural ecosystems.

TI  - Learning-Based Temporal Estimation of In-Situ Wind Speed From Underwater Passive Acoustics
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Wind speed retrieval at the sea surface is of primary importance for scientific and operational applications. Besides weather models, in-situ measurements and remote sensing technologies, especially satellite sensors, provide complementary means to monitor wind speed. As sea-surface winds produce sounds that propagate underwater, underwater acoustics recordings can also deliver fine-grained wind-related information. Whereas model-driven schemes, especially data assimilation approaches, are the state-of-the-art schemes to address inverse problems in geoscience, machine learning techniques have become more and more appealing to fully exploit the potential of observation data sets. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach for the retrieval of wind speed time series from underwater acoustics possibly complemented by other data sources such as weather model reanalyses. Our approach bridges data assimilation and learning-based frameworks that benefit from both prior physical knowledge and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments on real data demonstrate that we outperform the state-of-the-art data-driven methods with a relative gain of up to 16% in terms of root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Interestingly, these results support the relevance of the time dynamics of underwater acoustic data to better inform the time evolution of wind speed. They also show that multimodal data, here underwater acoustics data combined with European Center of Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis data, may further improve the reconstruction performance, including the robustness with respect to missing underwater acoustics data.

TI  - Surgical Management of the Axilla in HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer in the Z1071 Era: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis of the National Cancer Database.
T2  - Annals of surgical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary management varies between sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with clinical N1 (cN1), hormone receptor-positive (HR+), humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-negative (HER2-), infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC) who achieve a complete clinical response (cCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST). This study sought to evaluate clinical practice patterns and survival outcomes of SLNB versus ALND in this patient subset.METHODS: Patients with cN1, HR+/HER2-, unilateral IDC demonstrating a cCR to NAST were identified from the 2012-2017 National Cancer Database (NCDB) and stratified based on final axillary surgery management (SLNB vs ALND). After propensity score-matching, overall survival (OS) was compared using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and significant OS predictors were identified using Cox regression.RESULTS: Of the 1676 patients selected for this study, 593 (35.4%) underwent SLNB and 1083 (64.6%) underwent ALND. Use of SLNB increased by 28 % between 2012 and 2017. Among a total of 584 matched patients, 461 matched ypN0 patients, and 108 matched ypN+ patients, mean OS did not differ between SLNB and ALND (all patients [92.1±0.8 vs 90.2±1.0 months; p=0.157], ypN0 patients [92.4±0.8 vs 89.9±0.9months; p=0.105], ypN+ patients [83.5±2.3 vs 91.7±2.7 months; p±0.963). Cox regression identified age, Charlson score, clinical T stage, and pathologic nodal status as significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSION: The final surgical management strategy used for cN1, HR+/HER2- IDC patients who achieved a cCR to NAST did not have a significant impact on survival outcomes in this analysis. Potential opportunities for de-escalation of axillary management among this patient subset exist, and validation studies are needed.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study investigates the distribution of coseismic slip of the 19th August 2018 M-w 7.2 Lombok earthquakes, Indonesia, using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Two look directions on ascending, with a maximum displacement of 27 cm and 35 cm, and one on descending of Sentinel-1 SAR data, with a maximum displacement of 12 cm, are used. In addition, static offsets from the GPS data, which are located at the most western part of the island and the northern part of the island, detect similar to 2 cm and similar to 5 cm coseismic displacement due to the earthquake. Using combined InSAR and GPS data, this study estimates the fault location, fault geometry and the coseismic slip distribution by a joint inversion using a trans-dimensional Bayesian method. This method solves for the contiguous area of the fault that is allowed to slip in the inversion whilst also solving for the magnitude. This dampens the spurious smoothing that can occur in distributed slip solutions, in particular with far-field geodetic data or deep sources. The maximum slip of similar to 3.5 m is located at deeper portion of the fault at similar to 21 km, adjacent to the epicenter of the earthquake. This study demonstrates that the coseismic slip of the 19th August 2018 earthquakes occurred on a structure further south towards Lombok, a parallel fault structure with Flores back arc thrust.

TI  - Changes and driving forces analysis of alpine wetlands in the first meander of the Yellow River based on long-term time series remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAs a vital component of the ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, alpine wetlands coexist with their vulnerability, sensitivity, and abundant biodiversity, propelling the material cycle and energy flux of the entire plateau ecosystem. In recent decades, climate change and human activities have significantly altered the regional landscape. Monitoring and assessing changes in the alpine wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau requires the efficient and accurate collection of long-term information.MethodsHere, we interpreted the remote sensing data of the first meander of the Yellow River of alpine wetlands from 1990 to 2020 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using geographic information system (GIS) and landscape pattern index to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of wetland landscape patterns, and the primary drivers of changes in wetland area were explored by GeoDetector.ResultsOur result showed that most wetland areas were found in regions with gradients less than 12 & DEG; and elevations between 3315 and 3600 m. From 1990 to 2010, the area of alpine wetland in the study area decreased by 25.43%. During the period between 2010 and 2020 to the 1990s, the wetland area decreased by 322.9 km2. Conversion to and from grassland was the primary form of wetland transfer out and in, respectively. The overall migration of the wetland centroid in the study area was to the southwest between 1990 and 2010 and to the north between 2010 and 2020. The geometry of the wetland landscape was relatively simple, the landscape was relatively intact, and patches retained a high level of agglomeration and connectivity. However, their level of agglomeration and connectivity was disrupted. A quantitative analysis of the factor detector in GeoDetector revealed that the DEM, slope, and evaporation were the most important driving factors influencing the change of wetland area, with socioeconomic development also influencing changes in the wetland area to a lesser extent.DiscussionUsing interaction detectors, it was discovered that the interaction of various driving factors could better explain the long-term variations in wetland areas, with a greater degree of explanation than that of each driving factor alone.

TI  - Decentering Mindfulness: Toward Greater Meditative Diversity in Global Public Health
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Editorial Material
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this commentary on "Mindfulness for Global Public Health: Critical Analysis and Agenda," the authors affirm Oman's emphasis on the need for alternative religious-derived meditative programs and interventions, placed alongside Buddhist-derived mindfulness, for global public health. To begin, we highlight areas of agreement with Oman, then provide a metaphor we believe fittingly captures the current dilemma faced by those ambitiously attempting to globalize mindfulness for public health. Next, we advocate for the decentering of mindfulness, via developing and distributing evidence-based meditative practices derived from other religions, so public health strategies can be more diverse for global consumption. To do so, we offer examples from our own efforts to operationalize and experimentally investigate meditative and contemplative practices housed within the millennia-old Christian religious tradition for contemporary Christian communities experiencing psychological and spiritual suffering. Such examples include contemplation within the classic Medieval work The Cloud of Unknowing, the Jesus Prayer in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Puritan meditation in Protestant Christianity, and Ignatian meditation and contemplation in Catholic Christianity. To conclude, we offer basic steps for the further development of such alternative religious-derived meditative practices, along with a more detailed account of a recent empirical study of our own. Overall, our hope is to promote greater meditative diversity in the noble pursuit of global public health, with mindfulness offered alongside a plethora of other religious meditative practices, which can provide local communities around the world with a broader range of worldview-dependent and -sensitive options.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - In our study, we set out to collect a multimodal annotated dataset for remote sensing of Maya archaeology, that is suitable for deep learning. The dataset covers the area around Chactun, one of the largest ancient Maya urban centres in the central Yucatan Peninsula. The dataset includes five types of data records: raster visualisations and canopy height model from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, and manual data annotations. The manual annotations (used as binary masks) represent three different types of ancient Maya structures (class labels: buildings, platforms, and aguadas - artificial reservoirs) within the study area, their exact locations, and boundaries. The dataset is ready for use with machine learning, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition, object localization (detection), and semantic segmentation. We would like to provide this dataset to help more research teams develop their own computer vision models for investigations of Maya archaeology or improve existing ones.

AB  - The relevance of this work stems from the under-researched nature of the concept of "conscience", including its key attributes and functionality across various national contexts. This concept's analysis is shaped by the worldviews and cultures of distinct populations, as viewed through the lens of linguocognitive examination. This article aims to conduct an in-depth conceptual analysis of the term "conscience", examining its national nuances, linguistic paradigms, cognitive perception, the influence of mental processes on communication, and syntactic and stylistic markers. The methodology of the research is based on a conceptual approach to the study of the problem. The paper comprehends in detail the problems associated with established linguistic traditions on the example of English, French, German, Kazakh and Russian languages in linguocognitive terms of expression of extralinguistic reality, a comparative characteristic between different language systems is carried out, factors of influence on the perception of the term "conscience" in the national plan are indicated. The article's content is useful for examining conceptual fields and cultural spheres, analyzing mechanisms of lexical, structural, and stylistic design of concepts, identifying core and peripheral concepts, and considering worldviews, historical factors, and moral foundations of distinct ethnic groups.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal variation in AOD over four coal mine sites of Assam through satellite observation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD), an important parameter for ecological studies, is paramount when assessing modifications in climate patterns. To evolve a regional aerosol representation of four varied coalfields across Assam, sixteen years (2003-2019) of aerosol variability and trends in aerosol loading through spectral AOD using MODIS-Terra (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) was interpreted. Assam is part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), India, and can be considered a key hotspot for the continuous contribution of aerosols. This first-of-its-kind study analyzed the long-term spatio-temporal variations in AOD in Assam's coal mines by combining it with the long-term satellite observations from MODIS. The Assam region revealed a varied and distinct spatio-temporal variability in aerosol distribution. For the annual average AOD in coal mines, Assam varied from 0.61 to 0.35, where Singrimari reported the highest mean AOD, indicating it is home to the state's high-polluting coal mines, whereas Sheelveta reported the lowest AOD value. Seasonal variation was additionally extrapolated, with minimum AOD during post-monsoon and monsoon and maximum AOD during summers and winter months. Moreover, a statistically significant increasing trend in the aerosol concentration was noticed in all four regions, namely, Singrimari (27.29%), Sheelveta (14.59%), Dilli-Jeypore (11.58%), and Mikir (16.27%). This study is significant since it evaluates the air pollution produced over mines, as well as the degree of aerosol concentration produced. The study also suggests effective strategies for decreasing mining-induced air pollution. The findings of this study support future climate projections and provides baseline data for policymakers and model simulation for climate change analysis.

AB  - The author of the target article hypothesizes that introductory psychology textbook authors aim to "indoctrinate" students toward a more liberal political worldview. In our response, we offer a counterhypothesis that introductory psychology authors are more likely to be biased against updating older research in general, given the enormous amount of new research that must be incorporated, as opposed to specifically ignoring findings that fit with a conservative political worldview. We point to content that is generally overlooked that would fit with a liberal perspective, and we suggest an empirical investigation that the author could conduct to evaluate these competing hypotheses. Finally, we encourage a pivot in how we think about the introductory psychology course from an emphasis on content to an emphasis on skills and values, offering psychological literacy as a framework for the renewal of the introductory psychology curriculum.

TI  - The SENTINEL study of differentiated service delivery models for HIV treatment in Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia: research protocol for a prospective cohort study
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly scaling up "differentiated service delivery" (DSD) models for HIV treatment to improve the quality of care, increase access, reduce costs, and support the continued expansion and sustainability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. Although there is some published evidence about the health outcomes of patients in DSD models, little is known about their impacts on healthcare providers' job satisfaction, patients' quality of life, costs to providers or patients, or how DSD models affect resource allocation at the facility level.Methods SENTINEL is a multi-year observational study that will collect detailed data about DSD models for ART delivery and related services from 12 healthcare facilities in Malawi, 24 in South Africa, and 12 in Zambia. The first round of SENTINEL included a patient survey, provider survey, provider time-and-motion observations, and facility resource use inventory. A survey of clients testing for HIV and a supplement to the facility resource use component to describe service delivery integration will be added for the second round. The patient survey will ask up to 10 patients enrolled in each DSD model at each study site about their experiences in HIV care and in DSD models, costs incurred seeking treatment, and preferences for HIV service delivery. The provider survey will ask up to 10 providers per site about the impact of DSD models on their positions and clinics. The time-and-motion component will directly observe the time use of a sample of providers implementing DSD models. Finally, the resource utilization component will collect facility-level data about DSD model availability and enrollment and the human and other resources needed to implement them. SENTINEL is planned to include four or more approximately annual rounds of data collection between 2021 and 2026.Discussion As national DSD programs for HIV treatment mature, it is important to understand how individual healthcare facilities are interpreting and implementing national guidelines and how healthcare workers and clients are adapting to new models of service delivery. SENTINEL will help policy makers and program managers understand the benefits and costs of differentiated service delivery and improve resource allocation going forward.

TI  - Incidental Thyroid Tissue in Sentinel Nodes From Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectiveSentinel node biopsy (SNB) is a surgical staging test in which sentinel nodes (SNs) undergo intensive histological analysis. SNB diagnoses early cancer spread, but can also reveal unexpected findings within the SNs. We review cases of incidental thyroid cells (TC) found in SNs from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to assess the prevalence of TC, and the clinical significance of these.MethodsMulticenter retrospective review of SNB performed for cT1-T2N0 OSCC. Incidental TC were identified by TTF-1 or thyroglobulin positivity. Anatomical location of nodes containing TC, TC morphology, and ongoing management/follow up of this incidental finding was recorded. Neck dissections performed during the same period were reviewed to establish the expected incidence of TC in neck nodes without serial sectioning analysis.Results278 SNB cases were reviewed. Ten procedures detected TC in nine patients (10/278, 3.6%). During the same time period 725 neck dissections were performed, six containing TCs (6/725, 0.8%). One patient underwent SNB twice with TC identified on both occasions. Three patients had both OSCC metastasis and thyroid cells. All SNB patients with TC identified underwent thyroid USS with no primary tumours identified. Three patients underwent thyroidectomy, in all cases no primary thyroid tumour was found.ConclusionPrevalence of incidental TC in SNs appears to be higher than that reported in neck dissections, these are not likely to be clinically relevant and can be managed on a conservative basis in the absence of clear metastatic features.

TI  - Global trends in indocyanine green fluorescence navigation in the field of gastric cancer: bibliometrics and knowledge atlas analysis
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence navigation can enhance the visualization of gastric cancer (GC) lesions, increase the lymph node detection rate, and reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage in the treatment of GC. It thus holds considerable potential for application in GC clinical surgery and has attracted widespread research interest. The purpose of this study was to visualize the current topics and emerging trends in research regarding ICG in GC.Methods: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for articles relevant to the use of ICG in GC. The resulting information was then analyzed from a bibliometric and knowledge graph analysis perspective using CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica, and R Studio so that the key trends and hot spots in research within this field could be identified and visualized.Results: Ultimately, 1,385 papers from 58 countries or regions published from 1991 to 2022 were included in this study. The largest number of publications were from China, followed by Japan and the United States. High-yield institutions were concentrated in Asian countries, especially China. The top publication contributors were Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Li Y and Bang YJ ranked first among the top 10 most productive authors and top 10 most cocited authors, respectively. World Journal of Gastroenterology was the most productive academic journal on ICG in GC, while Cancer Research was the most commonly cocited journal. The keyword "indocyanine green" was among the top 5 keywords, and will likely remain a popular topic in future research. Furthermore, the emerging themes including surgery, biopsy, lymphadenectomy, dissection, and gastrectomy have attracted increasing attention.Conclusions: Current research hotspots in this area focus on the clinical implementation of ICG in precision surgery for GC. Given the imaging tracer characteristics of ICG and its utility in GC surgery, the optimization and application of ICG-guided precision surgery techniques for GC will be a research hot spot going forward.

TI  - A novel approach for quantifying similarities between different debris flow sites using field investigations and numerical modelling
T2  - TERRA NOVA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Debris flows are geomorphological processes that affect the landscape evolution process of any region. In this study, an integrated methodology is proposed to identify the chance of further debris flows and quantify the similarities between debris flow locations, materials and rheology, using field and laboratory investigations and remote sensing data. The method was tested for four failure-triggered debris flow sites in the Western Ghats of India, using dimensionless parametric similarity values ranging from 0 to 1. The maximum parametric similarity was observed as 0.84 when comparing the flow accumulation values of Sites 3 and 4, and the maximum overall site similarity was 0.68. The calibrated rheological parameters of one site were found to be satisfactory in modelling the shape of debris flow at all other sites. The findings can be used to identify similar hotspots in the region and to simulate debris flows for quantitative hazard assessment.

TI  - A nuclear orthologue of the dNTP triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 controls dNTP homeostasis and genomic stability in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintenance of dNTPs pools in Trypanosoma brucei is dependent on both biosynthetic and degradation pathways that together ensure correct cellular homeostasis throughout the cell cycle which is essential for the preservation of genomic stability. Both the salvage and de novo pathways participate in the provision of pyrimidine dNTPs while purine dNTPs are made available solely through salvage. In order to identify enzymes involved in degradation here we have characterized the role of a trypanosomal SAMHD1 orthologue denominated TbHD82. Our results show that TbHD82 is a nuclear enzyme in both procyclic and bloodstream forms of T. brucei. Knockout forms exhibit a hypermutator phenotype, cell cycle perturbations and an activation of the DNA repair response. Furthermore, dNTP quantification of TbHD82 null mutant cells revealed perturbations in nucleotide metabolism with a substantial accumulation of dATP, dCTP and dTTP. We propose that this HD domain-containing protein present in kinetoplastids plays an essential role acting as a sentinel of genomic fidelity by modulating the unnecessary and detrimental accumulation of dNTPs.

T2  - PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Hard work and chance are nearly always among the deciding factors in finding new, important, and productive paleontological localities. Fossil locality predictive models have the potential to maximize field time and increase chances to find important localities. This study uses remotely sensed data to design and test a fossil locality predictive model for the Early Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data from known localities were summarized, reclassified, and used in a weighted suitability analysis to categorize fossil locality potential of the study area. Field work was conducted to test model functionality. Field observations were used to refine the weighted suitability analysis. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data alone offers a less accurate prescription of fossil locality potential. Additional physical and environmental factors play a role in determining the chance of finding fossils. Slope degree and aspect data from known localities were summarized and analyzed to further refine the model. Forty percent of existing fossil localities within the final model boundaries were located on areas having the highest fossil locality potential as identified by the model. The usefulness of fossil locality predictive models is dependent upon the quality of input data and methods used to determine fossil locality potential. To fully determine the quality of a fossil locality predictive model, field testing is ideal.

TI  - Systematic Literature Review of Various Neural Network Techniques for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - The popularity of using various neural network models and deep learning-based models to predict environmental temperament is increasing due to their ability to comprehend and address complex systems. When examining oceans and marine systems, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is a critical factor to consider in terms of its impact on species, water availability, and natural events such as droughts and floods. This evaluation supplements a detailed analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models that have been employed for several decades to predict SST. The study highlights familiar data, data sources, performance metrics, and a range of models for SSTP (Sea Surface Temperature Prediction), including artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and ensemble neural networks. The research also examines the latest trends in this field and suggests possible future research directions. The primary focus of this survey is to showcase the significant advancements made by numerous researchers, especially in the areas of DL techniques and ensemble methods for SSTP. It also provides an in-depth analysis of the most commonly used SST datasets along with their data generation source, record period, accessible resolution criteria, strengths, and weaknesses. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to provide a theoretical framework and ontology to support SSTP.

TI  - Noumea: a new multi-mission calibration and validation site for past and future altimetry missions?
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, monitoring the evolution of sea level in coastal areas is of importance, since almost 11% of the world's population lives in low-lying areas. Reducing uncertainties in sea level estimates requires a better understanding of both altimetry measurements and local sea level dynamics. In New Caledonia, the Noumea lagoon is an example of this challenge, as altimetry, coastal tide gauge, and vertical land motions from global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) do not provide consistent information. The GEOCEAN-NC 2019 field campaign addresses this issue with deployments of in situ instruments in the lagoon (GNSS buoy, pressure gauge, etc.), with a particular focus on the crossover of one Jason-series track and two Sentinel-3A missions tracks. In this study, we propose a method to virtually transfer the Noumea tide gauge at the altimetry crossover point, using in situ data from the field campaign. Following the philosophy of calibration and validation (Cal/Val) studies, we derive absolute altimeter bias time series over the entire Jason and Sentinel-3A periods. Overall, our estimated altimeter mean biases are slightly larger by 1-2 cm compared to Corsica and Bass Strait results, with inter-mission biases in line with those of Bass Strait site. Uncertainties still remain regarding the determination of our vertical datum, only constrained by the three days of the GNSS buoy deployment. With our method, we are able to re-analyse about 20 years of altimetry observations and derive a linear trend of -0.2 +/- 0.1mmyr(-1) over the bias time series. Compared to previous studies, we do not find any significant uplift in the area, which is more consistent with the observations of inland permanent GNSS stations. These results support the idea of developing Cal/-Val activities in the lagoon, which is already the subject of several experiments for the scientific calibration phase of the SWOT wide-swath altimetry mission.

TI  - Detecting Air Pollution Clusters in Japan: A Spatial Analysis Approach
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE JAPAN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We rely on satellite data to study the spatial distribution of air pollutants and economic activity for 1,650 municipalities of all four main islands of Japan: Honshu, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku. Specifically, we analyze atmospheric particulate matter and ozone concentrations, as well as population density, accessibility to cities, and night lights for the above islands. We then make use of principal component analysis, spatial dependence analysis, and methods of regionalization to endogenously classify the municipalities based on their similarity in attributes and geographic location. The spatial dependence analysis provides results which show us the specific sites where the high-value clusters (hot spots) and low-value clusters (cold spots) are located. These show a high positive correlation between economic activity and air pollution. Additionally, we perform a regionalization analysis of the variables under consideration, which specifies how the four main islands can be regionalized into six to nine geographical regions or structures, each. The regionalization takes into consideration both pollution levels and economic activity. We then conclude by discussing how these different analyses can complement each other, and how they contribute in finding the locations where policies related to air quality can help in improving the quality of life of the population.

T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With global warming, changes in glaciers and glacial lakes on the Tibetan Plateau call for a serious inspection. The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) is a typical monsoonal marine glacier area that is extremely vulnerable to climate change. It is affected by both humid and warm Indian Ocean currents. Outlines of glaciers and glacial lakes in SETP have been extracted from Landsat satellite images with an automatic extraction method based on image compositing with Google Earth Engine and Random Forest algorithm. Alongside the outlines, meteorological data have been collected from 1990 to 2021. The results show that since 1990 the glacier area of SETP has retreated by about 2165.33 km(2) (similar to 25.28%), the glacial lake area has increased by about 36.41 km(2) (similar to 21.45%), and their number has increased by 477 (similar to 27.32%). The reliability and scientific validity of this study is proven by comparison with existing glacier inventories. By analyzing the meteorological data, the inverse correlation between the glacier area and temperature has been found. Despite decreases in cumulative precipitation, the glacial lake level rise and consequent area expansion have been observed. A fitting equation for the response pattern of glacier changes to temperature and precipitation change is presented and will provide a basis for future studies.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Availability of Cloud-free Optical Observations in the Tropics to Monitor Deforestation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - State-of-the-art methodologies to monitor deforestation rely mostly on optical satellite observations. High-density optical time series can enable the detection of deforestation almost as soon as it occurs. However, deforestation monitoring in the tropics can be hindered by high cloud coverage, and thus the responsiveness of managers, enforcement agencies, and scientists. To understand the implications of cloud contamination in freely available optical data we analyzed combined time series from Landsat 7, 8, and Sentinel-2 over the tropics from 2017-2021. Datasets derived for each 30 m x 30 m of the 59.4 M km2 domain include a) number of cloud-free observations per year, b) maximum consecutive days without clear imagery within a year, and c) final date of the longest waiting period. The datasets reflect where and when data gaps in optical time series exist due to cloud contamination. Scripts to access and extend the datasets are shared and documented. The datasets can be used to prioritize areas where complementary observations, such as radar imagery, are needed for implementing effective deforestation alert systems.

TI  - The Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances: DEFID2
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Insect and disease outbreaks in forests are biotic disturbances that can profoundly alter ecosystem dynamics. In many parts of the world, these disturbance regimes are intensifying as the climate changes and shifts the distribution of species and biomes. As a result, key forest ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, regulation of water flows, wood production, protection of soils, and the conservation of biodiversity, could be increasingly compromised. Despite the relevance of these detrimental effects, there are currently no spatially detailed databases that record insect and disease disturbances on forests at the pan-European scale. Here, we present the new Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances (DEFID2). It comprises over 650,000 harmonized georeferenced records, mapped as polygons or points, of insects and disease disturbances that occurred between 1963 and 2021 in European forests. The records currently span eight different countries and were acquired through diverse methods (e.g., ground surveys, remote sensing techniques). The records in DEFID2 are described by a set of qualitative attributes, including severity and patterns of damage symptoms, agents, host tree species, climate-driven trigger factors, silvicultural practices, and eventual sanitary interventions. They are further complemented with a satellite-based quantitative characterization of the affected forest areas based on Landsat Normalized Burn Ratio time series, and damage metrics derived from them using the LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm (including onset, duration, magnitude, and rate of the disturbance), and possible interactions with windthrow and wildfire events. The DEFID2 database is a novel resource for many large-scale applications dealing with biotic disturbances. It offers a unique contribution to design networks of experiments, improve our understanding of ecological processes underlying biotic forest disturbances, monitor their dynamics, and enhance their representation in land-climate models. Further data sharing is encouraged to extend and improve the DEFID2 database continuously. The database is freely available at https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opend ata/FOREST/DISTU RBANCES/DEFID2/.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged exclusive breastfeeding is a public health priority and a personal desire by mothers; however, rates are low with milk supply challenges as a predominant cause. Early breastfeeding management at home is key. Milk electrolytes, mainly sodium ions, are accepted as biomarkers of secretory activation processes throughout the first weeks after birth and predictors for prolonged breastfeeding success, although they are not incorporated into routine care practice.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a novel handheld smartphone-operated milk conductivity sensing system that was designed to compute a novel parameter, milk maturation percent (MM%), calculated from milk sample conductivity for tracking individual secretory activation progress in a real-world home setting.METHODS: System performance was initially evaluated in data collected from laboratory-based milk analysis, followed by a retrospective analysis of observational real-world data gathered with the system, on the spot in an at-home setting, implemented by lactation support providers or directly by mothers (N=592). Data collected included milk sample sensing data, baby age, and self-reported breastfeeding status and breastfeeding-related conditions. The data were retroactively classified in a day after birth-dependent manner. Results were compared between groups classified according to breastfeeding exclusivity and breastfeeding problems associated with ineffective breastfeeding and low milk supply.RESULTS: Laboratory analysis in a set of breast milk samples demonstrated a strong correlation between the system's results and sodium ion levels. In the real-world data set, a total of 1511 milk sensing records were obtained on the spot with over 592 real-world mothers. Data gathered with the system revealed a typical time-dependent increase in the milk maturation parameter (MM%), characterized by an initial steep increase, followed by a moderate increase, and reaching a plateau during the first weeks postpartum. Additionally, MM% levels captured by the system were found to be sensitive to breastfeeding status classifications of exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding problems, manifested by differences in group means in the several-day range after birth, predominantly during the first weeks postpartum. Differences could also be demonstrated for the per-case time after birth-dependent progress in individual mothers.CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrates that the use of smart milk conductivity sensing technology can provide a robust, objective measure of individual breastfeeding efficiency, facilitating remote data collection within a home setting. This system holds considerable potential to augment both self-monitoring and remote breastfeeding management capabilities, as well as to refine clinical classifications. To further validate the clinical relevance and potential of this home milk monitoring tool, future controlled clinical studies are necessary, which will provide insights into its impact on user and care provider satisfaction and its potential to meet breastfeeding success goals.

TI  - Global 3-D distribution of aerosol composition by synergistic use of CALIOP and MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - For the observation of the global three-dimensional distribution of aerosol composition and the evaluation of the shortwave direct radiative effect (SDRE) by aerosols, we developed a retrieval algorithm that uses observation data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Aqua. The CALIOP-MODIS retrieval optimizes the aerosol composition to both the CALIOP and MODIS observations in the daytime. Aerosols were assumed to be composed of four aerosol components: water-soluble (WS), light-absorbing (LA), dust (DS), and sea salt (SS) particles. The outputs of the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval are the vertical profiles of the extinction coefficient (ffa), singlescattering albedo (omega(0)), asymmetry factor (g) of total aerosols (WS CLA CDS CSS), and alpha(a) of WS, LA, DS, and SS. Daytime observations of CALIOP and MODIS in 2010 were analyzed by the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval. The global means of the aerosol optical depth ( iota(a)) at 532 nm were 0 :147 +/- 0 :148 for total aerosols, 0 :072 +/- 0 :085 for WS, 0 :027 +/- 0 :035 for LA, 0 :025 +/- 0 :054 for DS, and 0 :023 +/- 0 :020 for SS. iota(a) of the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval was between those of the CALIPSO and MODIS standard products and was close to the MODIS standard product. The global means of omega(0) and g were 0:940 +/- 0:038 and 0:718 +/- 0:037; these values are in the range of those reported by previous studies. The horizontal distribution of each aerosol component was reasonable; for example, DS was large in desert regions, and LA was large in the major regions of biomass burning and anthropogenic aerosol emissions. The values of iota(a), omega(0), g, and fine and coarse median radii of the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval were compared with those of the AERONET products. iota(a) at 532 and 1064 nm of the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval agreed well with the AERONET products. The !0, g, and fine and coarse median radii of the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval were not far from those of the AERONET products, but the variations were large, and the coefficients of determination for linear regression between them were small. In the retrieval results for 2010, the clear-sky SDRE values for total aerosols at the top and bottom of the atmosphere were 4:99 +/- 3:42 andD 13:10 +/- 9:93Wm(-2), respectively, and the impact of total aerosols on the heating rate was from 0.0 to 0.5Kd(-1). These results are generally similar to those of previous studies, but the SDRE at the bottom of the atmosphere is larger than that reported previously. Consequently, comparison with previous studies showed that the CALIOP-MODIS retrieval results were reasonable with respect to aerosol composition, optical properties, and the SDRE.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of cyanobacterial exposure and liver cancer in the contiguous United States.
T2  - Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cyanobacteria are commonly found in water bodies and their production of hepatotoxins can contribute to liver damage. However, the population health effects of cyanobacteria exposure (CE) are unknown. Our objectives were to determine the effect of chronic exposure to cyanobacteria through proximity to waterbodies with high cyanobacteria counts on the incidence and mortality of liver disease and cancers, as well as to identify location-based risk factors.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Across the contiguous United States, regions with high cyanobacteria counts in waterbodies were identified using satellite remote sensing data. The data was geospatially mapped to county boundaries, and disease mortality and incidence rates analyzed. Distinctive spatial clusters of CE and mortality related to liver diseases or cancer were identified. There was a highly significant spatial association between CE and liver disease and liver cancer, but not between CE and all cancers. Hot spots of CE and mortality were identified along the Gulf of Mexico, eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, and cold spots across the Appalachians. Social vulnerability index was identified as a major location-based determinant by logistic regression, with counties in the fourth or fifth quintiles having the highest prevalence of hot-spots of CE and mortality from liver cancer.CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the importance of environmental exposure to cyanobacteria as a location-based determinant of mortality from liver cancer. Public health initiatives addressing CE may be considered to reduce mortality, particularly in areas of high social vulnerability.

TI  - Gut bacterial communities in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) throughout a disease-driven (Morbillivirus) unusual mortality event
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gut microbiomes are important determinants of animal health. In sentinel marine mammals where animal and ocean health are connected, microbiome impacts can scale to ecosystem-level importance. Mass mortality events affect cetacean populations worldwide, yet little is known about the contributory role of their gut bacterial communities to disease susceptibility and progression. Here, we characterized bacterial communities from fecal samples of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, across an unusual mortality event (UME) caused by dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed similar diversity and structure of bacterial communities in individuals stranding before, during, and after the 2013-2015 Mid-Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin UME and these trends held in a subset of dolphins tested by PCR for DMV infection. Fine-scale shifts related to the UME were not common (10 of 968 bacterial taxa) though potential biomarkers for health monitoring were identified within the complex bacterial communities. Accordingly, acute DMV infection was not associated with a distinct gut bacterial community signature in T. truncatus. However, temporal stratification of DMV-positive dolphins did reveal changes in bacterial community composition between early and late outbreak periods, suggesting that gut community disruptions may be amplified by the indirect effects of accumulating health burdens associated with chronic morbidity.

TI  - Extraction of the bare rock rate in counties of typical karst areas based on unmanned aerial vehicle images and satellite data, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rocky desertification is a land degradation process. The bare rock rate (BRR) is an important index. Satellite-based methods for BRR estimation can generate BRR datasets, but the spatial resolution and accuracy are low. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data can be used for BRR extraction with much higher resolution and higher accuracy, but the data are laborious and costly to collect. This study proposed a stepwise upscaling method employing the UAV-extracted BRR as the ground truth to establish a multiband regression model and calibrated the BRR derived from 30-m resolution LANDSAT 8 data, which was then used to calibrate 500-m resolution moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We compared the results with the satellite-based BRR and the results of UAV-MODIS upscaling methods. The results showed that (1) the UAV provides high-resolution data, and exposed rocks can be efficiently extracted from UAV images. This method could replace ground surveys. (2) The accuracy of the stepwise upscaling method was higher than that of the nonstepwise upscaling method in large areas. R-2 increased by 64.9%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 82.9%. (3) Compared with that of the satellite-based BRR, the accuracy of the multiband regression model-extracted BRR was higher. R-2 increased by 21.5%, and the RMSE decreased by 62.2%. This study demonstrated that the stepwise upscaling method and multiband regression can be combined to extract high-precision and large-scale BRR data, which can be used to serve ecological engineering monitoring and ecological governance.

TI  - River-influenced beluga<i> (Delphinapterus</i><i> leucas)</i> summer habitat use in western Hudson Bay, Canada
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - River estuaries along western Hudson Bay, Canada, are important summer habitats for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucus (Pallas, 1776)) and subject to increasing industrial development activities including vessel traffic. The feasibility of establishing a National Marine Conservation Area (NMCA) in western Hudson Bay is under consideration, requiring baseline studies and habitat monitoring. In this study, beluga whale locations were identified using aerial photographs collected during summer 2018 of the Seal, Knife, Churchill, and Nelson River estuaries. Sentinel 2 wavelength bands were used to outline river plume boundaries for the Seal, Knife, and Churchill Rivers. Multiple discriminant analysis was used to differentiate between beluga habitat areas according to their environmental characteristics including concentration of total suspended sediments (TSS), and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The Seal River estuary, Knife River estuary, Churchill River outer estuary, Churchill River estuary, and Nelson River estuary were identified as distinct habitat areas. Resource selection functions and model selection were used to determine that habitat variables related to prey availability were important for beluga habitat selection, including TSS, CDOM, and the distance to river mouth or river plume. Identification of preferred habitat and habitat areas in this study are imperative for future management decisions including establishment of an NMCA.

TI  - The integrated structure of care: evidence for the efficacy of models of clinical governance in the prevention of fragility fractures after recent sentinel fracture after the age of 50 years
T2  - ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Randomized clinical trials and observational studies on the implementation of clinical governance models, in patients who had experienced a fragility fracture, were examined. Literature was systematically reviewed and summarized by a panel of experts who formulated recommendations for the Italian guideline.PurposeAfter experiencing a fracture, several strategies may be adopted to reduce the risk of recurrent fragility fractures and associated morbidity and mortality. Clinical governance models, such as the fracture liaison service (FLS), have been introduced for the identification, treatment, and monitoring of patients with secondary fragility fractures. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the association between multidisciplinary care systems and several outcomes in patients with a fragility fracture in the context of the development of the Italian Guidelines.MethodsPubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were investigated up to December 2020 to update the search of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that analyzed clinical governance models in patients who had experienced a fragility fracture were eligible. Three authors independently extracted data and appraised the risk of bias in the included studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Effect sizes were pooled in a meta-analysis using random-effects models. Primary outcomes were bone mineral density values, antiosteoporotic therapy initiation, adherence to antiosteoporotic medications, subsequent fracture, and mortality risk, while secondary outcomes were quality of life and physical performance.ResultsFifteen RCTs and 62 observational studies, ranging from very low to low quality for bone mineral density values, antiosteoporotic initiation, adherence to antiosteoporotic medications, subsequent fracture, mortality, met our inclusion criteria. The implementation of clinical governance models compared to their pre-implementation or standard care/non-attenders significantly improved BMD testing rate, and increased the number of patients who initiated antiosteoporotic therapy and enhanced their adherence to the medications. Moreover, the treatment by clinical governance model respect to standard care/non-attenders significantly reduced the risk of subsequent fracture and mortality. The integrated structure of care enhanced the quality of life and physical function among patients with fragility fractures.ConclusionsBased on our findings, clinicians should promote the management of patients experiencing a fragility fracture through structured and integrated models of care. The task force has formulated appropriate recommendations on the implementation of multidisciplinary care systems in patients with, or at risk of, fragility fractures.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundNear-infrared (NIR) fluorescence-guided surgery with indocyanine green (ICG) has been demonstrated to provide high sensitivity in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer but has several limitations, such as unstable pharmacokinetics, limited fluorescence brightness, and undesired diffusion to neighboring tissues. This paper investigates the use of Voluven & REG; as the solvent for ICG fluorescence-guided SLNB (ICG-SLNB).MethodsThe photophysical properties of ICG in water and Voluven & REG; were evaluated in laboratory experiments and in a mouse model. Nine patients with early breast cancer underwent subareolar injection of diluted ICG (0.25 mg/ml) for ICG-SLNB. Six of the nine patients received ICG dissolved in Voluven & REG; (ICG:Voluven & REG;), while three were administered ICG dissolved in water (ICG:water); a repetitive injection-observation protocol was followed for all patients. The mapping image quality was evaluated.ResultsLaboratory experiments and in vivo mouse study showed improved fluorescence and better targeting using Voluven & REG; as the solvent. ICG-SLNB with a repetitive injection-observation protocol was successfully performed in all nine patients. ICG:Voluven & REG; administration had an overall better signal-to-background ratio (SBR) in sequential sentinel lymph nodes. The rates of transportation within the lymphatics were also improved using ICG:Voluven & REG; compared with ICG:water.ConclusionsFrom basic research to animal models to in-human trial, our study proposes a repetitive injection-observation technique with ICG:Voluven & REG;, which is characterized by better transportation and more stable mapping quality for ICG-SLNB in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of the impact of land urbanization on the gross primary productivity of vegetation in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Urban Agglomeration: new evidence from the township scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The urgent need to maintain ecosystem provisioning services and achieve urban sustainable development goals has led to a long-standing focus on the driving effects of land urbanization (LU) in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Urban Agglomeration (MRYRU) on vegetation cover system productivity. Previous studies have lacked consideration for the long-term correlation between land urbanization (LU) and the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) of vegetation, as well as the spatial non-stationarity of LU's impact in the region. This study is based on land cover remote sensing data and GPP imagery data to monitor the long-term evolution trends of LU and GPP in MRYRU from the perspectives of townships and grids. It further investigates the spatial correlation and clustering characteristics between the two using bivariate spatial autocorrelation method. Additionally, a Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model was employed to analyze the spatial effects of LU on GPP. The results indicate that the GPP of MRYRU grows to 1572.88gCm-2a-1 with an average annual growth rate of 0.848% from 2000 to 2020. High-value areas are distributed in the central and eastern mountainous of the urban agglomeration, while low-value areas gradually formed an "n"-shaped clustered distribution pattern. The negative spatial autocorrelation between LU and GPP shows a general upward trend, and Low-High is the dominant agglomeration type, concentrated in Hengyang and some mountainous cities in Jiangxi Province. The overall negative impact of land urbanization on GPP in MRYRU is maintained in the spatially nonstationary pattern of driving coefficients, with negative impact areas mostly concentrated in the city's main city zone and positive impact areas concentrated in the urban agglomeration's mountainous townships. This study provides support for MRYRU to adopt more resilient land optimization management strategies and vegetation ecological restoration plans.

TI  - Towards affordable 3D physics-based river flow rating: application overthe Luangwa River basin
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), affordable precise global navigation satellite system hardware, multi-beam echo sounders, open-source 3D hydrodynamic modelling software, and freely available satellite data have opened up opportunities for a robust, affordable, physics-based approach to monitoring river flows. Traditional methods of river discharge estimation are based on point measurements, and heterogeneity of the river geometry is not contemplated. In contrast, a UAV-based system which makes use of geotagged images captured and merged through photogrammetry in order to generate a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) provides an alternative. This UAV system can capture the spatial variability in the channel shape for the purposes of input to a hydraulic model and hence probably a more accurate flow discharge. In short, the system can be used to produce the river geometry at greater resolution so as to improve the accuracy in discharge estimations. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling offers a framework to establish relationships between river flow and state variables such as width and depth, while satellite images with surface water detection methods or altimetry records can be used to operationally monitor flows through the established rating curve. Uncertainties in the data acquisition may propagate into uncertainties in the relationships found between discharge and state variables. Variations in acquired geometry emanate from the different ground control point (GCP) densities and distributions used during photogrammetry-based terrain reconstruction. In this study, we develop a rating curve using affordable data collection methods and basic principles of physics. The basic principal involves merging a photogrammetry-based dry bathymetry and wet bathymetry measured using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). The output is a seamless bathymetry which is fed into the hydraulic model so as to estimate discharge. The impact of uncertainties in the geometry on discharge estimation is investigated. The impact of uncertainties in satellite observation of depth and width is also analysed. The study shows comparable results between the 3D and traditional river rating discharge estimations. The rating curve derived on the basis of 3D hydraulic modelling was within a 95 % confidence interval of the traditional gauging-based rating curve. The 3D-hydraulic-model-based estimation requires determination of the roughness coefficient within the stable bed and the floodplain using field observation at the end of both the dry and wet season. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that variations in the density of GCPs beyond an optimal number have no significant influence on the resultant rating relationships. Finally, the study observes that which state variable approximation (water level and river width) is more accurate depends on the magnitude of the flow. Combining stage-appropriate proxies (water level when the floodplain is entirely filled and width when the floodplain is filling) in data-limited environments yields more accurate discharge estimations. The study was able to successfully apply advanced UAV and real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) technologies for accurate river monitoring through hydraulic modelling. This system may not be cheaper than in situ monitoring; however, it is notably more affordable than other systems such as crewed aircraft with lidar. In this study the calibration of the hydraulic model is based on surface velocity and the water depth.The validation is based on visual inspection of an RTK-based waterline.

TI  - Increasing landscape heterogeneity as a win-win solution to manage trade-offs in biological control of crop and woodland pests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture and forestry cover more than 75% of Europe, and invertebrate pests are a costly challenge for these two economic sectors. Landscape management is increasingly promoted as a solution to enhance biological pest control, but little is known on its effects on adjacent crop fields and woodlands. This study aims to explore the effect of the proportion of woodlands and permanent grasslands as well as crop diversity on biological pest control simultaneously in cereals fields and woodland patches, in south-western France. We used different types of sentinel prey as well as bird and carabid community metrics to assess biological pest control potential in these two ecosystems. We first show that land cover variables influence biological pest control both in cereal fields and woodland patches, but have antagonistic effects in the two ecosystems. Although results vary according to the biological control indicator considered, we show that increasing landscape heterogeneity represents a valuable solution to manage trade-offs and promote higher average predation rates across forests and cereal fields. Our study therefore calls for more integrative studies to identify landscape management strategies that enable nature-based solutions across ecosystems.

TI  - Monitoring the ecological restoration effect of land reclamation in open-pit coal mining areas: An exploration of a fusion method based on ZhuHai-1 and Landsat 8 data.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land reclamation is a long-term, dynamic process; postreclamation monitoring and management are particularly important, and the use of remote sensing technology is a good way to conduct ecological quality monitoring and evaluations. In this study, we fused ZhuHai-1 and Landsat 8 data; selected the best band combinations to calculate ecological quality indicators such as the inverted red-edge chlorophyll index, modified soil moisture monitoring index, normalized difference built-up and soil index and land surface temperature; and constructed the fusion remote sensing ecological index to monitor the ecological restoration effect of the reclaimed area in Pingshuo, China. The results showed that the inverted red-edge chlorophyll index and modified soil moisture monitoring index had positive contributions, the normalized difference built-up and soil index had a low impact on the ecological quality of the study area, and the land surface temperature had a negative effect on ecological quality. The environment of the reclaimed area was better than that of the surrounding areas where these areas were affected by mining. The mean value of the fusion remote sensing ecological index showed a trend of "rising first, then falling" with increasing reclamation time. The ecological quality of the reclaimed area was best in areas with 20-22years of reclamation time. The ecological condition of the area has been declining for 25years or more of reclamation, so it is suitable to apply artificial intervention to ensure good ecological quality. The use of remote sensing technology for monitoring the effects of ecological restoration can provide a reference basis for the targeted and accurate implementation of land reclamation management measures.

TI  - Frequency and polymorphism of acetylcholinesterase gene involved in the organophosphate resistance of <i>Musca domestica</i> in Guizhou Province, China
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Organophosphate (OP) resistance has been prevalent in Musca domestica populations worldwide since 1960s. Previous studies have demonstrated that point mutations of the acetylcholinesterase gene (Ace) are one of the important molecular mechanisms underlying OP resistance. However, few studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms of OP resistance in the past 10 years in China. In this study, we investigated the status of OP resistance and genetic diversity of Ace in the field populations of houseflies in Guizhou Province of China. The bioassays showed that the houseflies had 142-304-fold resistance to dichlorvos (DDVP) and 122-364-fold resistance to temephos, compared to the susceptible houseflies. Five nonsynonymous mutations (Y226F, V260L, G342A/V, F407Y) in Ace were detected among the 7 field populations, with an average frequency of 5.4%, 55%, 68%, 32%, and 94%, respectively, of which the Y226F mutation had not been reported previously. Eleven combinations of triple mutations (at positions 260, 342, and 407) were observed, of which the combination 260L/V+342A/V+407Y was predominant. The ZY and AS populations showed greatest diversity of allelic combination and the other five populations showed different distributions among different regions. These results indicate that the resistance to OPs is prevalent among the housefly populations and target-site insensitivity is the main cause of resistance in Guizhou Province. The difference in distribution and the allelic diversity of Ace in field populations may be due to the complexity and variability of insecticide application. It is necessary to monitor resistance to insecticides and conduct management of houseflies in Guizhou Province.

TI  - Distribution patterns and drivers of urban green space and plant diversity in Haikou, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating historical and ongoing changes in urban green space (UGS) and urban plant diversity (UPD) provides critical insights into urban ecology and urban planning development. The present study illuminates some of the transformations which can occur in rapidly developing urban landscapes. In this work, we used 30 m resolution images from the Landsat 5 satellite from 2015 to investigate UGS patterns in Haikou City, China. Metrics of UPD were obtained using field surveys, allowing the proportion of UGS and UPD to be determined in each urban functional unit (UFU) of Haikou. The results revealed that leisure and entertainment areas (such as parks) had the highest diversity, whereas roads and transportation hubs had the lowest. More frequent anthropogenic maintenance had a positive effect on the total number of species, including cultivated, tree, and herb species. Similarly, increased watering frequency had a positive impact on the diversity of cultivated and shrub species. By providing demonstrating a crucial link between UGS and UPD, the results provide valuable information for planning sustainable urban development in Haikou City and other tropical regions. They highlight the important role of UGS in maintaining biodiversity and providing a range of ecosystem services. This research will inform policymakers and urban planners about the need to consider UGS and UPD in urban planning and management process, in order to promote sustainability and conservation of biodiversity.

TI  - Integrated use of GIS and remote sensing techniques for landscape-scale archaeological analysis: the case study of Metaponto, Basilicata, Italy
T2  - EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study focuses on the integrated use of multiscale and multisensor remote sensing techniques and big data analysis for the identification of buried archaeological remains or areas of potential archaeological interest. Satellite multispectral data (at very high and high resolution), drone based visible, multispectral, and thermal imagery, and geophysical prospecting (gradiometer) were used. The ancient city of Metaponto was chosen as case study, as it was a very important city in the formative panorama of Italian Magna Graecia and it also is one of the most important and best preserved archaeological sites in southern Italy. The analysis of remote sensing data from different sensors, with different resolutions, and referable to different physical parameters, allowed to deepen archaeological knowledge on a landscape scale, as well as on a site scale, going from the analysis of traces of the ancient landscape (e.g. palaeo-channels, canalisation system, main roads), to the discovery of small features (e.g. secondary roads, houses, facilities).

TI  - Land use and land cover classification using machine learning algorithms in google earth engine
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Natural resources are under tremendous amounts of threat as a result of the expanding human population, which over time intensifies changes in Land use and Land cover (LULC). Understanding how various machine learning classifiers function is crucial as the demand for an accurate estimate of LULC from satellite images. The purpose of this research was to classify the LULC in the entire Karnataka state, using three distinct methods on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) namely RF (Random Forest), SVM (Support Vector Machine) and CART (Classification Regression Trees), are examples of machine learning techniques. The LULC is classified by the training sets using supervised classification. The NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) was assessed and used to increase classification accuracy. The LULC classification for the years 2015 to 2021 utilizes multi-temporal images like Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS data with spatial resolution of 10 m, 30 m, and 250 m. Agricultural land, Built-up land, Forest land, Fallow land, wasteland, water body and others, are major LULC classes, it lies on a level I classification. According to the findings, the change % of agricultural land is high from 2015 (64.03%) to 2021 (67.81%), this roughly increased about 3.78% during the study year. While water bodies increased by 5.25 to 6.3%. Based on the results, the largest LULC group is agricultural land (122,789.4 km(2) or 64.03%), followed by forest land (37,678.56 km(2) or 19.65%). Increased built-up land in the studied area indicates extraordinarily rapid urban growth in major cities of the state. This research offers a reliable approach for comprehensive, automated, and LULC classification in Karnataka State.

TI  - Land use and land cover (LULC) performance modeling using machine learning algorithms: a case study of the city of Melbourne, Australia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information on Land use and land cover (LULC) plays a crucial role in city planning. A widely used method of obtaining accurate LULC maps is a classification of the categories, which is one of the challenging problems. Attempts have been made considering spectral (Sp), statistical (St), and index-based (Ind) features in developing LULC maps for city planning. However, no work has been reported to automate LULC performance modeling for their robustness with machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this paper, we design seven schemes and automate the LULC performance modeling with six ML algorithms-Random Forest, Support Vector Machine with Linear kernel, Support Vector Machine with Radial basis function kernel, Artificial Neural Network, Na & iuml;ve Bayes, and Generalised Linear Model for the city of Melbourne, Australia on Sentinel-2A images. Experimental results show that the Random Forest outperforms remaining ML algorithms in the classification accuracy (0.99) on all schemes. The robustness and statistical analysis of the ML algorithms (for example, Random Forest imparts over 0.99 F1-score for all five categories and p value =0.05 from Wilcoxon ranked test over accuracy measures) against varying training splits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Thus, providing a robust measure of LULC maps in city planning.
