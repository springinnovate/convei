AB  - The metaverse is an experiential virtual reality and has the potential as an empty world that can create a new reality beyond the constraints of time, space and resources. Therefore, this study intends to examine the meaning of metaverse as a new paradigm beyond technical and industrial discussions. To this end, the metaverse was typified by applying the possible world theory that explores the real world and unrealized possibilities surrounding it.In the possible world theory, the Actual World(AW), the Textual Actual World(TAW), the world embodied in the text, and the Textual Reference World(TRW) that is not included in the Textual Actual World(TAW) but can be inferred through it are distinguished. At this time, it is important how readers(users) accept the relationship between the Actual World(AW), the Textual Actual World(TAW), and the Textual Reference World(TRW). In this study, four types of metaverse were presented: standalone, frame, borderline, and substitution types, focusing on the relationship between these worlds.First, the standalone-type metaverse is a world that has its own worldview and rules independent of the Actual World(AW), and is represented by a game-type virtual world. Users not only experience the independent Textual Actual World(TAW), but also continuously create new Textual Reference World(TRW) through emergent play.Second, the frame-type metaverse is a form in which users' emergent play goes beyond the creation and experience of the Textual Reference World(TRW), and leads to the creation of the Textual Actual World(TAW). This includes the user creation system of <Roblox> and <Minecraft>.Third, the borderline-type metaverse is a world where users can create and experience various Textual Actual World(TAW) based on the Actual World(AW) through everyday media authoring technology. The Textual Reference World(TRW) is created at the boundary between the Actual World(AW) and the Textual Actual World(TAW), and includes <Weverse>, a fan community platform.Lastly, the substitution-type metaverse includes virtual exhibitions in a form in which the Textual Actual World(TAW) replaces the experiences and activities of the Actual World(AW). The Textual Reference World(TRW) is consistent with the Actual World(AW) in which users live their daily lives, or is oriented toward the Actual World(AW).This study is a preliminary study that examines the concept and types of metaverse through possible world theory, and examines various forms of metaverse appearing in media culture in general. It is also significant in that it provided an opportunity to discuss the future potential of the metaverse.

TI  - A Study on the Literature and Traditionalism of Park Jae-sam in the 1950s

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study tried to reveal the traditional image and emotion embodied in the early works of Park Jae-sam, a representative poet of traditionalism in the 1950s. Park Jae-sam, who inherited the genealogy of Seo Jeong-ju and Jo Ji-hoon's traditional poetry, created a unique sense of chastity by drawing a poetic world using traditional narratives such as Chunhyangjeon and Simcheongjeon with sadness and sorrow as the main emotions. The sadness that Park Jae-sam portrays has a unique emotional system. By arranging the inexhaustible distance between the object of hope and the person who desires it in a poem, he dissolves the motives of sadness of the subject matter or subject in the tension of language. Through this semantic structure, the specific sadness that originates from individual experiences is not limited to one individual, but is transferred to the form of universal emotion that is potentially inherent in everyone. What Park Jae-sam pays attention to can be said to be ‘han’, a Korean type of universal emotion. Park Jae-sam's poems show that the lyrical tradition of modern poetry after Seo Jeong-ju has been inherited not only on the material dimension, but on the essential dimension. The fact that he was obsessed with traditional sentiments can be found when considering the circumstances of the 1950s. The ‘view of nature’ that appeared in Park Jae-sam’s early works does not return to the imaginary world of nationalistic archetypes as in the case of Seo Jeong-ju, but depicts the cyclical perception of life and death as a universal life dimension. In other words, Park Jae-sam's early works dealt with the traditional emotions symbolized by 'Chunhyang' and 'Han', but did not converge to nationalist ideology, but rather the problems of life and death and the pain and suffering of real life in the cyclical world of 'nature'. It leads to the perception of a universal world that is comforting with permanence. In the background of the 1950s, it creates 'nature', a part of the universal worldview that comforts the misfortunes and pains of the post-war generations, and discovers the will to live, as well as the realities of post-war life and personal experiences. It is a literary achievement of Park Jae-sam who sought succession.

TI  - Clarice Lispector A Retro Ethics of Errors
T2  - PHILOSOPHIA-A JOURNAL OF CONTINENTAL FEMINISM
M3  - Article
AB  - If there's a riddle scholarship has not yet cracked, it is what Clarice Lispector-arguably Brazil's most notorious writer-meant when she dedicated the entire Chinese nation to a single egg ("To the egg I dedicate the Chinese nation"). Lispector's infatuation with China, by way of the Daodejing, the I-Ching, and the work of philosophers such as Lin Yutang has also not yet been sufficiently explored. Following Lispector's own evocative-rather than overly analytical-writing style, this article posits that her fascination with Chinese philosophy and mysticism is deeply rooted in a (Daoist) distrust toward mundane and forward-looking notions of success, opting instead for embracing failure as a counterintuitive, "proregressive" politics of resistance-or, as Lin Yuntang (he himself a very retro figure at this point in time) would put it: "the Chinese are cynics and poets only when they have failed." Drawing from the little-explored Chinese influences in her writings, this article sheds light on the Daoist roots of Clarice Lispector's worldview and the role failure plays in her oeuvre.

TI  - Comparison of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI spaceborn datasets for geological mapping: a case study for the Palu - Hazar Golu region along the East Anatolian Fault (Elazig, Turkey)
T2  - GEOMATIK
M3  - Article
AB  - It is an increasing trend to use multi spectral satellite imagery in geological mapping, especially for remote regions. Moreover, the quality and quantity of such satellites have significantly increased parallel to the technological evolution. In the frame of this study, I use and compare multi spectral imagery of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A MSI satellites for geological mapping of a region between Palu and Hazar Golu (Elazig). This region is also known to host one of the most important earthquake belts of Turkey, the East Anatolian Fault (EAF), thus, it is quite crucial to generate precise geological maps in order to document the long- and short-term kinematics of this fault zone. I processed both data sets by using RGB band combinations, bant ratio, Minumum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. The RGB band combination and MNF provide the best results for both Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. When I compare the results of both data sets, the RGB band combination of Sentinel 2 shows the richest image with respect to the geological map of the region. It is quite obvious that multi spectral imagery are powerful tools to increase the precision of geological maps, especially for remote regions. Sentinel 2A MSI imagery is an ideal source for geological mapping with their relatively high resolution and band quality.

TI  - Sentinel bowel loop as a marker for primary segmental intestinal volvulus in extreme low birth weight neonates.
T2  - Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Primary segmental intestinal volvulus is a rare condition that may affect neonates. This condition occurs when a loop of bowel torses around the axis of its mesentery without any other abnormality or malrotation. In the earlier stages, the diagnosis can be challenging due to the lack of specific clinical and radiographic signs. Prompt surgical management is critical as a delay in diagnosis may result in bowel loss or death. We present a series of three cases of extremely low birth weight infants with primary segmental volvulus. A sentinel bowel loop was critical in guiding each patient's surgical management as there were no other clinical markers concerning a pending intra-abdominal catastrophe. This case series suggests that a sentinel bowel loop may be a radiographic marker for primary segmental intestinal volvulus in extremely low birth weight infants.

TI  - ANTHROPOMORPHIC FACES IN THE ANCIENT ART OF WESTERN AND EASTERN SIBERIA
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of this research is anthropomorphic images in the form of a human face (masks), which are recorded in the monumental (rock paintings, statues) and mobile art of the ancient peoples of Western and Eastern Siberia in the Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. The article discusses the genesis of local artistic traditions, interregional cultural contacts. In Western Siberia, a large number of images of masks of anthropomorphic figures were recorded on ceramics of the Samus culture. According to the results of stylistic analysis, a semicircular contour of masks prevails here. In Eastern Siberia, images of masks are common among the rock paintings of the Angara. Most looks have a heart- shaped outline. The borderland (Middle Yenisei) has the largest number of anthropomorphic images. They are recorded both among the rock paintings and on the statues of the Okunev culture. Many masks of the Okunev culture have a rounded outline with different entourage.Each region had its own artistic tradition origins. On the example of anthropomorphic images, close intercultural ties can be traced. They are reflected in the iconography of the masks. The art of Okunev culture had a strong influence on the artistic traditions of neighboring regions. In the art of Western Siberia, it can be traced on the example of the external design of masks of anthropomorphic figures: "horns", central vertical line / triangular contour, "sun" rays. On the Angara - on the example of the horizontal manner of "tattooing" masks. The Angara traditions can be traced in the art of the Okunev and Samus cultures by the example of masks with a heart-shaped outline. The influence of the art of the Samus culture is marked by the presence of semicircular masks on anthropomorphic figures, the presence of three identical lines of "horns" among the petroglyphs of the Lower Angara and the Middle Yenisei. The appearance of masks in the ancient art of Eastern and Western Siberia is a stage phenomenon in the socio-economic and cultural development of human society, when already in the Neolithic era anthropomorphic images resembling a human face began to appear to replace zoomorphic objects of worship. It was a revolutionary event: frontal projection onto the plane of a person's body and face. This tradition was born on a Neolithic basis. It received artistic embodiment first on organic media (wood, bone, leather, etc.), and later on stone.In the Early Bronze Age, sacred centers were marked with statues (Middle Yenisei), boulders, rocks with petroglyphs (Angara). In Western Siberia, one of the sacred centers was the settlement Samus-IV. The lack of monumental, durable carriers of sacred information led to the mass production of ceramics with anthropomorphic images. The plots of the decoration of vessels illustrate the basic positions of the worldview, mythical plots, the appearance of objects of worship. The iconography of images was formed both on a local basis and under the influence of other cultures.Using the example of anthropomorphic images, one can trace the cardinal changes in the worldview of the ancient societies of Siberia, the features of their artistic culture, vectors of intercultural contacts in the Neolithic-Early Bronze Age.

TI  - Assessment of the Risk of Disturbance Impact on Primeval and Managed Forests Based on Earth Observation Data Using the Example of Slovak Eastern Carpathians
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests of Slovak Eastern Carpathians provide essential services to society ensuring human well-being. Primeval forests that remained there untouched have exceptional value. Unsustainable logging and climate change intensify forest disturbances and may cause substantial forest loss. The engagement of remote sensing allows timely monitoring and prediction of negative consequences. The leaf area index is selected from the other forest's condition indicators to assess the forests' quantity and disturbance. The conceptual approach for risk assessment of forest disturbance is proposed. This approach uses multiscale multi-temporal Earth observation data, such as synthetic aperture radar imagery and high-level satellite data products. The output response of the forest's condition was restored by multivariate regression with radar backscattering coefficients, relative difference polarization index, and local incidence angle. The low-resolution leaf area index pre-developed Copernicus data products make it possible to characterize the forest's condition without ground truth measurements. According to the elaborated methodology, a time series of the leaf area index was mapped, and risks analysis was performed according to hazard functions. A resulting risk's gradations map is a good tool for future research and decision-making support in nature management. The high spatial resolution of the output maps allows getting a more detailed assessment of forest disturbance behavior.

TI  - The Theory of Post-Industrial Society
T2  - AKADEMIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - This articles attempts at firstly looking at Daniel Bell's background and thereafter discussing selected themes of his thoughts regarding to the future society. This will be done by scrutinising his main intellectual works, particularly with regards to his theoretical analysis on the future society, namely the post-industrial society. The books are The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting (1973), The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism (1976) and The End of ideology (1960). Other materials written by Bell were also consulted wherever related. The methodology applied in this article is content analysis whereby key words related to post-industrial society such as knowledge, change and technology were analysed, criticised and thereafter used to understand the underlying framework or worldview that constitute the scholar's ideas. The discussion on the results of this worldview suggests that the logical movement of history works in its deterministic way in which problems faced by the societies such as injustices, inequalities, poverty, racial divisions and so on will cease away and that the society will move towards a better and more desirable order. It is hoped that this article would contribute significantly to deepening our understanding on the discourse of the post-industrial society, and how it relates to our current context.

AB  - The landscape taxonomy has a complex structure and hierarchical classification with indicators of their recognition, which is based on a variety of heterogeneous geographic territorial and expert knowledge. This inevitably leads to difficulties in the interpretation of remote sensing data and image analysis in landscape research in the field of classification and mapping. This article examines an approach to the analysis of intra-season Landsat 8 OLI images and modeling of ASTER GDEM data for mapping of mountain permafrost landscapes of Northern Siberia at the scale of 1: 500,000 as well as its methods of classification and geographical recognition. This approach suggests implementing the recognition of terrain types and vegetation types of landscape types. The 8 types of the landscape have been identified by using the classification of the relief applying Jenness's algorithm and the assessment of the geomorphological parameters of the valley. The 6 vegetation types have been identified in mountain tundra, mountain woodlands, and valley complexes of the Adycha river valley in the Verkhoyansk mountain range. The results of mapping and the proposed method for the interpretation of remote sensing data used at regional and local levels of studying the characteristics of the permafrost distribution. The work contributes to the understanding of the landscape organization of remote mountainous permafrost areas and to the improvement of methods for mapping the permafrost landscapes for territorial development and rational environmental management.

AB  - Experiments for the retrieval of the high-detailed spatial NO2 distribution in the troposphere using measurements of the GSA instrument onboard satellites of Resurs-P series were performed in 2016-2017. The authors developed an algorithm to obtain the tropospheric NO2 2D distribution with the horizontal spatial resolution reaching 2,4 km for the first time at the world level and provided on a grid with a step of 120 m. The high spatial resolution of the NO2 space measurements allowed the identification of local sources of NO2 pollution and their plumes from space observations.To validate the fine structures detected in the NO2 fields of GSA/Resurs-P, we perform comparisons with chemical transport models. The paper presents preliminary results of a comparison with a new model which is based on a numerical-asymptotic approach. The comparison was performed for NO2 observations on September 29, 2016 over Hebei province, the North China Plain. We propose, in particular, a new efficient approach using this model to obtain estimates of emissions from local anthropogenic sources based on GSA/Resurs-P observational data.To validate the coarse structures in the GSA/Resurs-P NO2 field, in this paper, we perform comparisons of our data based on spectral imagery of Tokyo region, Japan, taken in March-April 2017 with observations of OMI/Aura and TROPOMI/Sentinel-5P. The comparison confirmed the reliability of the GSA NO2 fields in general.

TI  - The Novel of One Life" by V.S. Baevsky: The Lyricism of Narration in a Memoir Novel
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The memoir novel by V.S. Baevsky has incorporated his previously published autobiographical stories and essays. At the same time, the "Novel of One Life" is a single mnemonic narrative, with the image of a scientist in the centre. "The Novel of One Life" is an autobiographical narrative, the unifying core of which is the image of the narrator and his story. The autobiographical narrator links up all the levels of the mnemonic text, as it combines a specific author, narrator, and protagonist. The narrative of the memoir novel implements the narrative strategy of life description, and the probabilistic worldview is formed from the description of real historical events and the trials that the protagonist overcomes. The novel creates a time of memory, where the past is not only inextricably linked with the present, but also continues in it. The center of the narrative strategy is the narrator. In memoirs, the narrator's image combines several categories, namely that of a particular author, the "I" - being told about and the "I" telling. In "The Novel of One Life" the story and image of the narrator are formed on the basis of personal documents: the author's diary and correspondence with poets and scientists. The author's attitude to the documentality of history also testifies to the objectification of the narrative. Despite the autobiographic nature, stylistically, the narrative is based on distancing the narrator from the specific author. One of the most important components of the narrator's image in the "The Novel of One Life" is an attempt to escape from the egocentric narrative typical of any autobiography. The dominant feature of the narrator is the lyrical origin, the feeling of being a lyric poet.

The studies were conducted in the forest and agricultural ecosystems. Thermal data were acquired on June 9, 2019, between 8:10 and 14:00 (CET). The temperature was recorded by the ImageIR 9400 sensor with a spectral range of 3.6-4.9 mum. The results indicate that the canopy leaf temperatures of species under study differ statistically significantly irrespective of data acquisition time. Between 8:10 and 14:00 the temperature of the tree canopies increased on average for the individual species by 4.86oC. The smallest increase in temperature of 4.10oC was recorded for Alnus glutinosa, and the highest increase of 5.76oC was noted for Juglans regia. The studies showed that the smallest variation in the canopy leaf temperature occurs at about noon between 12:00 and 13:00. Comparison of the temperatures of trees growing in and outside the forest also showed the forests significant impact in decreasing the average temperature of a tree canopy by about 1oC.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Machine Learning for Networking (MLN)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Computer networks are veins of modern distributed systems. Array DBMS (Data Base Management Systems) operate on big data which is naturally modeled as arrays, e.g. Earth remote sensing data and numerical simulation. Big data makes array DBMS to be distributed and highly utilize computer networks. The R&D area of array DBMS is relatively young and machine learning is just paving its way to array DBMS. Hence, existing work is this area is rather sparse and is just emerging. This paper considers distributed, large matrix multiplication (LMM) executed directly inside array DBMS. LMM is the core operation for many machine learning techniques on big data. LMM directly inside array DBMS is not well studied and optimized. We present novel LMM approaches for array DBMS and analyze the intricacies of LMM in array DBMS including execution plan construction and network utilization. We carry out performance evaluation in Microsoft Azure Cloud on a network cluster of virtual machines, report insights derived from the experiments, and present our vision for the future machine learning R&D directions based on LMM directly inside array DBMS.

TI  - Quantitative Approach to Studying Film Pollution of the Sea Surface Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Numerous studies of various film pollutions (oil spills, surfactants etc.) are performed by means of satellite monitoring of seas and oceans. However, the problem of formal ranking the water areas of the regions under study by frequency and intensity of pollution is still unsolved. The conditions and periodicity of satellite survey can differ greatly depending on the monitoring region that determines both spatial variability of the probability of film pollution detection and the need to take this feature into consideration. Here we attempt to develop a quantitative approach to studying the sea surface film pollutions based on processing of large volumes of satellite optical and radar imagery.Methods and Results. The concept "index of sea surface exposure to film pollutions", d(fpMON), and the method for calculating its quantitative value on a regular spatial grid are proposed. The value of d(fpMON) is defined as a ratio of the pollution area observed at the site to the area of the analyzed resolution elements (where detection of film pollution is theoretically possible). Within the framework of this approach, the already existing methods for analyzing the results of long-term satellite seawater pollution monitoring were improved due to taking into account the meteorological conditions and the spatial distribution of the observation amount. Having been applied, the proposed approach permitted to study spatial distribution of the non-biogenic film pollutions in the northern part of the Black Sea; they were detected resulting from interpretation of 4428 satellite images obtained in 2019 by the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-1A/B satellites (2499 cases of pollution processed). The average value of the d(fpMON) index was 0.012%. Three regions, where the d(fpMON) values exceeded the average one by more than 30 times were identified.Conclusions. The example of a site in the northern Black Sea has shown the possibility of obtaining representative information products of satellite oceanography, which quantitatively characterize spatial variability of the sea surface film pollution recorded during the long-term episodes of satellite monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of water balance in Aral Sea and the influencing factors from 1990 to 2019
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea is located in Central Asia. Under the impact of climate change and human activity, the lake surface has shrunk sharply and triggered a regional ecological crisis. It is of great significance to study the changes of water balance and their driving factors for water resources management and ecological protection in the Aral Sea region. Based on the dense time-series Landsat imagery from 1990 to 2019, T/P satellite, Jasonl/2 altimetry satellite, and digital bathymetry model ( DBM) of the Aral Sea, time serieses of the Aral Sea area and water level in the past 30 years were extracted, to reconstruct the Aral Sea water level area -volume capacity curve and explore the characteristics of the Aral Sea volume changes. A water balance equation was also established to quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal changes of the water balance elements in the study area and their impacts on the Aral Sea volume. The results show that the water volume decreased by 2271.6x10(8) m(3)(about 75.15%) with an average decreasing rate of 78.3x 10(8) m(3)/a from 1990 to 2019 in the Aral Sea, a similar variation trend was detected in the South Aral Sea. Except for the minimum value in 1999, the water volume in other years showed a fluctuating and rising state in the North Aral Sea. By 2019, the water level had returned to the level of 1984. Since the 1990s, the inflow from the Amu Darya River to the Aral Sea showed a decreasing trend, and the spatiotemporal differences in the water balance structure of the South and the Nouth Aral Sea are significant. As the Aral Sea continues to shrink, and water evaporation continues to decrease, the regional water expenditure and income ratio decreases from 2.46 in 1990 to 0.87 in 2015. In recent years, the groundwater in the South Aral Sea changed from deficit to surplus, and the water area changed into a relatively stable state. The evapotranspiration of the North Aral Sea increased with the increase of the water area. Since the early 1990s, the water income has exceeded its expenditure, regional groundwater has bacome surplus, and the lake water level has been constantly rising. On the regional scale of the Aral Sea, the inflow and evaporation are the main factors affecting the change of the water volume in the Aral Sea. On the catchment scale, climate change and human activities jointly affect the inflow of the Aral Sea. The inflow of the South Aral Sea is significantly correlated with the runoff from the upper Amu Darya River and the cultivated land area of the basin, while the inflow of the North Aral Sea is mainly correlated with the runoff from the upper Syr River.

TI  - CBF-Net: An Adaptive Context Balancing and Feature Filtering Network for Point Cloud Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Point cloud classification is regarded as a critical task in remote sensing data interpretation, which is widely used in many fields. Recently, many proposed methods tend to develop an end-to-end network to directly operate on the raw point cloud, which has shown great power. However, most of these methods abstract local features by equally considering the neighboring points. The features learned may neglect to distinguish contributions of different points especially the edge points and outliers, leading to a coarse classification result especially for boundaries. Moreover, the extracted features are high redundant and intercorrelated with similar categories, posing difficulty in identifying classes sharing similar characteristics especially in complex scenes. Therefore, we propose an adaptive context balancing and feature filtering network (CBF-Net) to tackle the aforementioned problems. First, we introduce a balanced context encoding module to balance semantically the features of neighboring points, which can help the model learn more from the edge points and, therefore, contribute to a finer classification. Then, considering that the interference for similar classes probably causes confusion among them, a filtered feature aggregating module is proposed to filter the extracted features by mapping them into a cleaner subspace with a lower rank. We have conducted thorough experiments on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 3-D labeling dataset. Experimental results show that our CBF-Net can obtain high accuracy and achieve state-of-the-art level in the categories of Powerline, Car, and Facade. In addition, we also conduct experiments on the RueMonge2014 dataset, which further reveals the strong ability of our model.

TI  - Mapping spatio-temporal changes in mangroves cover and projection in 2050 of their future state in Benin
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are precious ecosystems that provide vital socio-economic, environmental and cultural benefits to humanity. However, they are declining alarmingly due to human activities and natural hazards. Assessment of their spatio-temporal dynamics is essential to monitor these ecosystems and guide their management to ensure their sustainability. We assessed the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangroves and predicted their future trends using remote sensing techniques and Markovian chain analysis. Landsat images TM/ETM+/OLI (for 1988, 2001 and 2019) were obtained, processed, classified and analyzed using remote sensing techniques and GIS. The changes observed during these periods (1988-2001, 2001-2019 and 1988-2019) were used to predict future trends up to 2050, using Markovian chain analysis. The results showed that the mangrove area studied, which occupied 5205.24 ha in 1988, declined by 62.07% between 1988 and 2001 but increased by 18.84% from 2001 to 2019. This increase is attributed to strengthened mangrove restoration efforts. The mangroves had mainly been converted into grassland (52.35% in 1988-2001 and 7.31% in 2001-2019) and other vegetation types (17.57% in 1988-2001 and 27.05% in 2001-2019). Their decline was most severe in the municipalities of Abomey-Calavi and Ouidah, which therefore require greater conservation efforts. Our projection based on Markovian chain analysis suggests that these mangroves will continue to decline, but slowly. This study provides essential information to guide future mangrove conservation action in the study area.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in upper tract urothelial cancers: an experience with intraoperative radiotracer injection
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The feasibility of the sentinel node mapping in upper tract urothelial cancers (UTUC) was evaluated, using a radiotracer as the mapping material.Material and methods: To identify the sentinel lymph nodes, 37 MBq of [Tc-99m] phytate was injected in five patients with the renal pelvis or ureter cancer, who were candidates for ureterectomy and lymphadenectomy. The radiotracer was injected in a peritumoral fashion following the surgical exposure of the tumour. The sentinel lymph nodes were detected using a hand-held gamma probe.Results: By intraoperatively injecting the radiotracer immediately after surgical exposure of the tumour, at least one sentinel lymph node could be detected in each patient, and the detection rate was 100%. The location of sentinel nodes was in the paracaval, renal hill, retro-aortic, para-aortic, common iliac, and external iliac areas, which was dependent on the tumour location. No false-negative case was identified.Conclusions: Sentinel node mapping is feasible in UTUC. Injection technique (intra-vesical approach vs peri-tumoral injection after exposure of the tumour) and location of the tumour (proximal vs distal) may affect the technique's feasibility.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is currently under discussion. The aim of our study was to determine the false negativity rate (FNR) of SLNB, the accuracy of ultrasound examination in the evaluation of the status of lymph nodes and the accuracy of perioperative cryobiopsy of the sentinel lymph node (SLN).METHODS: Prospective multicentre study, which took place in years 20182020 at three centres in the Czech Republic. A total of 59 patients were evaluated.RESULTS: The FNR of SLNB in the group of patients with cN1 before NAC and ycN0 after NAC was 12.5%. The FNR of perioperative histological examination of the SLN was 38.5%. The FNR of ultrasound examination of axillary lymph nodes in patients after NAC was 35.5%, and the false positivity rate was 16.7%. The incidence of inflammatory complications in our cohort was 3.3%.CONCLUSION: The FNR of SLNB in the group of patients with cN1 before NAC and ycN0 after NAC exceeds the tolerable limit of 10%. The FNR of perioperative histological examination of the SLN is high; definitive histological examination of the SLN may change the original diagnostic-therapeutic plan. Ultrasound examination of the axillary lymph nodes in patients after NAC is a method with high false negativity and positivity and may not correspond with the perioperative finding. The incidence of inflammatory complications in our cohort in patients after NAC is comparable to literature data on the frequency of complications in patients without NAC.

TI  - Utopia as an Anti-Utopia (Andrey Platonov's Short Novel <i>Bread and Reading</i>)
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes A. Platonov's short novel Bread and Reading, which is the first part of an unfinished trilogy called Technical Novel. Different approaches to the analysis of the writer's anti-utopian strategy are considered, and certain terms related to the intra-genre typology of his works, which are still the subject of controversy in Platonov studies, i.e., utopia, anti-utopia, metautopia, dystopia, and cacotopia are clarified. The article offers a new perspective on this problem and concludes that the short novel is characterized by a complex conflict between utopia and anti-utopia, namely, utopian consciousness is embodied in the form of anti-utopia, which leads to the ambivalence in meaning and the appearance of internal antinomies. This mainly revealed in the title of the short novel, the epigraph, a special type of plot situation and the character system structure. Platonov's work is characterized not only by the problem of the relationship between man and nature, but also that of between man and technology, which becomes a part of the anthropological worldview and acquires human features. Platonov's characters dream of a time when technology, nature and man are in a harmonious relationship, helping each other overcome universal entropy. The motif of construction sacrifice, traditional in the poetics of Platonov's works, plays an important role in the short novel: it is premature and shameful to think about personal happiness in the world of socialism that has not yet been built, without enough " bread and reading." The work reflects Platonov's own hopes and doubts, and if the "principle of hope" (E. Bloch) is the main principle of utopian consciousness, then the writer's doubt becomes the main feature of his anti-utopia strategy. On the one hand, this makes it difficult to identify the genre of the short novel Bread and Reading (utopia or anti-utopia), on the other, it does not lead to an "imbalance" of forces, but, rather, to a meek awareness of the place of man in the world and his limited capabilities. An important role is also played by the fact that The Juvenile Sea was supposed to become the second part of the trilogy, and Dzhan may have made up the third part: the three works not only complement, but also "explain" each other. In the finale of Bread and Reading, the characters remain focused on the "distant," as they stay in the same utopian dream space. Likely never having found a way out of the "impasse of utopia," Platonov leaves Technical Novel unfinished.

AB  - Using satellite imagery and remote sensing data for supervised and self-supervised learning problems can be quite challenging when parts of the underlying datasets are missing due to natural phenomena (clouds, fog, haze, mist, etc.). Solving this problem will improve remote sensing data augmentation and make use of it in a world where satellite imagery represents a great resource to exploit in any big data pipeline setup. In this paper, the authors present a generative adversarial network (GANs) model that can generate natural atmospheric noise that serves as a data augmentation preprocessing tool to produce input to supervised machine learning algorithms.

TI  - Factors shaping students' perception of climate change in the western Himalayas, Jammu & Kashmir, India
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayas are considered highly vulnerable to climate change, and hence making adaptation strategies for the area to cope with the effects of climate change is crucial. These strategies should be developed and implemented with grassroots participation at local to regional levels. For informed participation, the local inhabitants need to be conscious of climate change and its implications. Hence, we explored the level of awareness among school students and their participation in actions and advocacy concerning climate change. We assumed that in Rajouri, being a small city with traditional values and worldview, the students' responses would largely reflect that of their immediate surroundings. We examined the variations in the responses of the students with respect to the type of schools (private versus public), location (urban versus rural), education level (secondary versus higher secondary), and gender. A ques-tionnaire survey on awareness, advocacy, and action received 717 responses, of which 27% showed high awareness of climate change, 60% were highly proactive to advocacy and 88% were willing to be involved in actions concerning their environment. However, students who were found to be aware of climate change through the formal education system were not involved in adaptation and mitigation actions. We assume that no direct or indirect involvement pos-sibly indicates a need of motivation in the curricular system. Hence suggest more attention be given to climate change in formal education with appropriate changes in curricula and pedagogy, with opportunity for hands-on exposure, to inspire the students to be more proactive in adaptation and mitigation efforts. That would facilitate the future gener-ation to take active participation in developing appropriate adaptation strategies towards climate change.

M3  - Article
AB  - Azad Kashmir has undergone sever landslide episodes in the past. The main reasons behind the occurrence of landslides in this area are heavy rainfall, weak geological strata, seismic zones and active faults. Several episodes of roads blockage due to landslide is one of the major problem in this area, therefore, this study is carried out for landslide susceptibility analysis along the roads of Kotli to Trar Khel, Azad Kashmir, NW Sub-Himalayas. Geographic information system (GIS) is used to interpret remote sensing, geological strata and topographical data. Total ten anthropogenic and physical factors (aspects, fault, lithology, drainage density, curvature, distance to roads, landuse landcover, slope, seismic and elevation) were examined by Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) technique. The thematic layers of all factors were prepared for the preparation of the final susceptibility map by using a weighted overlay method (WOM). The susceptibility map classified the study area into four susceptible classes of low, moderate, high and very high. The spatial analysis and result outcomes depicted that active faults, slope gradient and landuse landcover may facilitate landslide phenomena. The results were verified by landslide density analyses (LDA), receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) with predictive accuracy of 77 % that is rated as satisfactory by many researchers.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Necessity for accurate spatial and timely information of water resources is growing up. In this study, with using Landsat images, the dynamic changes of the water body and surface vegetation and water withdrawal in the Anzali International wetland during the period 1985-2018 were evaluated. NDWI and NDVI indices were used for this purpose. The results of the area study showed that the area of the wetland increased during 1985 to 2007 and decreased during 2007 to 2018. The largest area was in 2007 (100.06 km(2)). The western part of the wetland was also watered during the studied period and did not make any significant changes, and the major changes were in the eastern and central parts. According to NDVI obtained in 2018, there is less dispersal and less vegetation cover in the wetland. In general, it can be said that the dynamic of the water body and the vegetation cover of Anzali wetland is influenced by the fluctuations of the Caspian Sea surface and changes in the water body of the wetland respectively.

TI  - Comparison of Masking Algorithms for Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Masking of clouds, cloud shadow, water and snow/ice in optical satellite imagery is an important step in automated processing chains. We compare the performance of the masking provided by Fmask ("Function of mask" implemented in FORCE), ATCOR ("Atmospheric Correction") and Sen2Cor ("Sentinel-2 Correction") on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe covering a wide variety of environments and climates. All three methods use rules based on physical properties (Top of Atmosphere Reflectance, TOA) to separate clear pixels from potential cloud pixels, but they use different rules and class-specific thresholds. The methods can yield different results because of different definitions of the dilation buffer size for the classes cloud, cloud shadow and snow. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter using at least 50 polygons per class randomly selected for each image. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or "truth". The interpreter carefully assigned a class label based on the visual assessment of the true color and infrared false color images and additionally on the bottom of atmosphere (BOA) reflectance spectra. The most important part of the comparison is done for the difference area of the three classifications considered. This is the part of the classification images where the results of Fmask, ATCOR and Sen2Cor disagree. Results on difference area have the advantage to show more clearly the strengths and weaknesses of a classification than results on the complete image. The overall accuracy of Fmask, ATCOR, and Sen2Cor for difference areas of the selected scenes is 45%, 56%, and 62%, respectively. User and producer accuracies are strongly class- and scene-dependent, typically varying between 30% and 90%. Comparison of the difference area is complemented by looking for the results in the area where all three classifications give the same result. Overall accuracy for that "same area" is 97% resulting in the complete classification in overall accuracy of 89%, 91% and 92% for Fmask, ATCOR and Sen2Cor respectively.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Retrieval from Nighttime Middle and Thermal Infrared Images of Chinese Fengyun-3D MERSI-II
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The second-generation Chinese polar-orbit meteorological satellite Fengyun-3D carries the MEdium-Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II). MERSI-II has 19 solar channels and 6 middle and thermal infrared channels and can provide daily global coverage observation at daytime and nighttime. Land surface temperature (LST) products have a wide range of application requirements. Unfortunately, there is no official LST product of MERSI-II yet. This article proposed a temperature-emissivity separation algorithm to estimate LST and emissivity from two mid-infrared (MIR) and two thermal infrared (TIR) nighttime MERSI-II images. The sensitive analysis and ground validation show the following. First, the algorithm can theoretically retrieve LST with an error of less than 0.7 K, emissivity with errors of about 0.025 for MIR channel and 0.01 for TIR channel, respectively. Second, the nighttime LST retrieval error was approximately 2.19 K, and the bias was approximately 0.60 K among 6 SURFRAD sites and 2 PKULSTNet sites. The retrieved emissivity was cross-validated using MODIS emissivity product over a desert area and its difference was obtained as 0.01 and 0.016 for two TIR channels. Finally, the TES algorithm was applied to obtain LST and emissivity images over North China Plain as an example, and the nighttime LST and land surface emissivity (LSE) were obtained well. As a result, this study shows that the proposed TES algorithm provides an effective way to get LST and LSE image from FY-3D/ MERSI-II nighttime observation, which will improve their applications in different fields.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Suspended Sediment Concentration in Lakes Based on Satellite Remote Sensing and Internet of Things
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of the concentration of suspended sediment in a water body is a very important content in the observation of hydrological elements, and it is also one of the important parameters for calculating the sediment resuspension flux. In order to accurately predict the distribution of lake sediment, this paper uses satellite remote sensing data to invert the suspended sediment concentration. The key to the quantitative inversion is the atmospheric correction and the suspended sediment concentration inversion algorithm. In this paper, satellite remote sensing technology and Internet of Things technology are combined to establish a new type of lake suspended sediment concentration distribution model. First of all, this paper combines the results of satellite remote sensing inversion and the results of on-site water sample inspections of the Internet of Things to obtain the original hydrological data of suspended sediment in the lake. Secondly, this paper combines ADAM with deep learning technology to simulate the lake flow field and predict the dynamic process of suspended sediment pollution under different conditions. Finally, through experimental simulation and field sampling experiments, the validity of the lake suspended sediment concentration model established in this paper is verified. This model can provide assistance for relevant agencies to grasp the temporal and spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration in regional lakes in a comprehensive and timely manner, and can obtain the overall characteristics of the study area and the impact of humanistic engineering construction.

TI  - OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD/SPEECH ABOUT THE WORLD
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines some salient points in the historical usage of "worldview" and "picture of the world" as concepts that were developed in various versions by European thinkers and scholars during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. (Although the common, non-technical use of those terms may differ from the scholarly one and even illuminate it in a new way, that task is set aside.) The article's analysis of the construction of the concepts in texts by Wilhelm von Humboldt, Heinrich Rickert, Wilhelm Dilthey, Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, Karl Mannheim, Lucien Goldmann, Vladimir Bibikhin and other authors employs three conceptual axes: totality/plurality, individual/intersubjective, and vision/speech. The conclusion is that as these concepts evolved, philosophy and the humanities increasingly emphasized the communicative aspect of a worldview, which is interpreted no longer as the product of a single consciousness, but as an object of exchange and discussion between different subjects. At the same time, the "visual" inner form of these concepts is explicated and criticized. The visibility of the world implied in the concept of it as a picture is called into question; the world appears not so much as an object of contemplation from the outside but as a problematic "orientation" within it.The critique of authoritarian rationalism in the twentieth century eventually deconstructed the visual grounding of the worldview concept, which came to be associated with non-theoretical moments of inner life. Traces of it are found in ruined forms (as fragmentary features of a work of art), and it is criticized for being bound to the pictorial or objective representation of the world that was characteristic of modern European civilization. The visual perspective of the worldview is turned inside out -the subject of vision becomes its object.

TI  - Selecting phototrophic species of native biocrusts in arid and semi-arid regions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Biological soil crusts (BSCs) that are able to produce sticky extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an important role in the formation of soil aggregates, thereby, reducing soil erosion. In this study, experiments were undertaken to identify biocrust species that produce EPS, in order to combat desertification in the Sejzi desert of Iran.Methods: A biocrust distribution map of Sejzi plain was prepared using Landsat 8 OLI images, then, various sampling points were selected. Some physicochemical parameters of samples from lichendominated and non-biocrusted areas were measured. The relationship between soil parameters and biocrusts presence was confirmed based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient and principal component analysis (PCA) method. The type of chemical compounds in the soil content were determined via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), including polysaccharides. To estimate the degradability of polysaccharides, each soil sample was placed under defined UV-B radiation for 24, 48, and 72 hours at three replications.Results: There was no significant correlation between moss and lichen species with the amount of EPS (%) values and various occurring cyanolichen species in three biocrusted soil samples, which included Collema coccophorum, Collema tenax, Peccania terricola, and Placidium squamulosum. It was speculated that these polysaccharides were produced by the photobiotic partners (microalgae or cyanobacteria) and secreted to the soil.Conclusion: According to the results, the cyanobacteria species of biocrusted samples might have high potential to combat desertification and soil stabilization in Sejzi desert.

TI  - Desertification Detection Using an Improved Variational Autoencoder-Based Approach Through ETM-Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate land cover change detection is critical to improve the landscape dynamics analysis and mitigate desertification problems efficiently. Desertification detection is a challenging problem because of the high degree of similarity between some desertification cases and like-desertification phenomena, such as deforestation. This article provides an effective approach to detect deserted regions based on Landsat imagery and variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE model, as a deep learning-based model, has gained special attention in features extraction and modeling due to its distribution-free assumptions and superior nonlinear approximation. Here, a VAE approach is applied to spectral signatures for detecting pixels affected by the land cover change. The considered features are extracted from multitemporal images and include multispectral information, and no prior image segmentation is required. The proposed method was evaluated on the publicly available remote sensing data using multitemporal Landsat optical images taken from the freely available Landsat program. The arid region around Biskra in Algeria is selected as a study area since it is well-known that desertification phenomena strongly influence this region. The VAE model was evaluated and compared with restricted Boltzmann machines, deep learning model, and binary clustering algorithms, including Agglomerative, BIRCH, expected maximization, k-mean clustering algorithms, and one-class support vector machine. The comparative results showed that the VAE consistently outperformed the other models for detecting changes to the land cover, mainly deserted regions. This study also showed that VAE outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI  - New technology for mineral deposits prediction to identify prospective areas in the Zhezkazgan ore region
T2  - MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Exploration and predicting the prospective areas in the Zhezkazgan ore region to set up detailed prospecting and evaluation works using new integrated technologies of prediction constructions in the mineral deposits geology.Methods. An integrated methodological approach is used, including methods for deciphering the Earth's remote sensing (ERS) data, the use of geophysical data and methods of analogy and actualism. All constructions are made in accordance with the principles of shock-explosive tectonics (SET). Prediction constructions are started with the selection of remote sensing data for the studied region and interpretation based on the processing of radar satellite images obtained from the Radarsat-1 satellite. The radar satellite images are processed in the Erdas Imagine software package.Findings. New local prospective areas have been identified, within which it is expected to discover the deposits. Their reserves are to replenish the depleted ore base in the Zhezkazgan region. Area of the gravity maximum 1 (the Near), considered to be the most promising, is located in close proximity to the city of Zhezkazgan; area of the gravity maximum 2 (the Middle); area of the gravity maximum 3 (the Distant-Tabylga); area of the gravity maximum 6 (the Central). A prospective area has been also revealed, overlaid by a loose sediment cover and located inside the Terekty ring structure, as well as the area of a thick stratum of pyritized grey sandstones, which is adjacent to the Sh-2 well drilled to the south of the Zhezkazgan field.Originality. The use of a new prediction technology, in contrast to the known ones, is conditioned by the widespread use of the latest remote information from satellite images, which increases the accuracy of identifying the prospective areas of fields.Practical implications. The new technology for predicting mineral deposits makes it possible to significantly reduce the areas exposed to priority prospecting, which provides significant cost savings.

CL  - Chongqing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - As a national-level economic zone, Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone has played an important role in the economic development of Northwest China During its development, urban expansion and ecological environment have also undergone tremendous changes. This paper uses the three Landsat remote sensing images in 2010, 2015, and 2018 as the data source, and uses the land use classification system and CART decision tree classification method to analyze the geographical expansion of six cities in Xi'an, Xianyang, Weinan, Tongchuan, Baoji, and Tianshui. Temporal and spatial changes and the characteristics of temporal and spatial changes of natural vegetation. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Since 2009, the expansion of urban construction land in the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone has shown a slow growth (first fast and then slow). The high spatial expansion density is concentrated in Xi'an (including Xian yang) and Weinan In addition, the connectivity between cities is not strong, and there is no trend of contiguous development. Urban expansion is mainly due to the conversion of cultivated land to construction land. (2) The mode of urban expansion is mainly marginal and infill, and each city has its own characteristics in the direction of expansion. Among them, Baoji City and Tianshui City mainly expanded from east to west, while Xi'an (including Xian yang), Wei nan City, and Tong chuan City expanded in all directions. (3) In the process of urban expansion, the overall greenness of vegetation showed a downward trend, and the areas with significant decline were all located in the periphery of the city, and the urban construction land in this area was significantly expanded. The research conclusions of this article will provide a strong scientific basis for urban construction and planning in this area.

M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of the society. the relationship between human activities and ecological environment becomes increasingly closer, and the contradictions of population, resources and environment are gradually more obvious. Accurate evaluation of regional ecological environment is beneficial to decision makers to learn about the current regional ecological environment, and then take proactive measures to realize a better regional sustainable development. In order to analyze the change characteristics of urban ecological environment, this paper, based on the data of remote sensing images from Landsat in 1999 and 2019. used the principal component analysis (PCA) method to determine the weights of four ecological indexes (greenness, dryness, wetness and heat), and then selected an evaluation model of remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) to monitor and analyze the ecological environment quality of Weinan City from 1999 to 2019. The results showed that the mean values of RSEI in Wcinan City increased from 0.489 to 0.556 during 1999-2019, which indicated the ecological environment quality had been improved. The improved area of ecological quality was mainly distributed in the central area of Wcinan City and its proportion was 49.6%, While the proportion of ecological environment degradation was 15.4%. and such areas were mainly distributed in some mining areas of Han-cheng City and in the southern districts and counties of Weinan City (Weinan Section in North Qinling Mountains).

TI  - PERSONAL NAMES OF THE BULTEGER TUNGUS CLAN OF THE URULGIN STEPPE DUMA (Based on Early 19th Century Census Lists)
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explores personal names of Tungusic people belonging to the Bulteger clan of the Urulgin Steppe Duma, based on State Archive census data from the Trans-Bailkal area of the early 19th century. This is a first approximation to creating a full corpus of male and female names of the Tungus within a particular clan including its population figures across different periods. The author establishes nationally motivated strategies of naming and uses morphemic analysis to draw correlations with Evenk names. In addition to the characteristic affix -cha of Evenk personal names (Bukacha, Iglancha, Irkencha, Kivuncha, Magalcha, Tevancha, Uvulcha, Cholboncha), the study has revealed some other affixes: -(v)ul (Gatavul, Genevul, Dekevul, Toepul / Toepvul), -ga/ -gu/ -ka (Wamchigu, Dambuga, Damkinka, Sopchinga, Eldinga, Emkinga). This multiplicity of name forms is due to both objective (e.g., dialectal differences) and subjective factors (phonetical spelling cases that distort the original name). It is concluded that the historical name-list of the Tungus-Orochon people of the Bulteger clan shares the common naming principles of the peoples of Siberia and the Far East. The article describes nine anthroponymic patterns. In terms of motivation, all of them reflect the ethnocultural specificity of Siberian aboriginal peoples attributable to the nomadic reindeer herding type of farming, lifestyle, and relationships between man and nature. The same archaic worldview is unconditionally reflected in the naming patterns. Based on semantic correlations between the anthroponymic stems of the studied names and appellatives of other Tungus-Manchu languages, the author also hypothesizes about the multi-ethnic structure of the vagrant Orochon tribes.

TI  - MODIS-Based Research on Secchi Disk Depth Using an Improved Semianalytical Algorithm in the Yellow Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi disk depth is a commonly measured parameter representing the optical properties of water bodies. Assessment of water transparency in seas is highly significant to marine-environment monitoring. In this study, an improved Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) inversion algorithm was proposed based on the Poole-Atkins model by determining the parameter A in the original model. The Forel-Ule index (FUI) is a water color parameter that can be obtained from remote sensing data. Through the analysis of the International Ocean Color Coordinating Group dataset, it was found that there are strong logarithmic and quadratic correlations between the FUI and parameter A, whose R-2 values are 0.929 and 0.925, respectively. Comparing the results derived from MODIS product data with the in situ measured data in the Yellow Sea showed that the RMSE and MRE of the quadratic formula are 1.83 m and 43.74%, respectively, which reflect better performance than the other empirical formulas. Thus, parameter A can be expressed in quadratic form with FUI as a variable. Finally, we mapped the Z(SD) inversion results for the Yellow Sea and analyzed the spatial changes. This study provides new insight for inverting Z(SD) transparency algorithms and highlights the value of marine transparency monitoring.

AB  - Compared with conventional optical satellites, ZY-3(03) has its outstanding advantage in the combination of camera stereo observation and laser altimeter to directly obtain elevation control points, which can provide high-precision data for real three-dimensional China construction, geographic national conditions monitoring, farmland protection, geological disaster prevention, etc. In order to meet the demand of laser altimeter that the divergence angle is less than 0.1mrad, a laser beam expanding system is developed. The optical system with Galileo structure is composed of a negative lens group and a positive lens. Through the adjustment of the lens spacing and centering adjustment, the installation and adjustment of the beam expanding system under normal pressure is completed, and the wave-front error, defocusing and magnification are tested. In order to meet the conditions of vacuum use, vacuum presets are performed by adjusting the spacing between the front and rear lens groups. The vacuum divergence test of the transmitting system is carried out together with the laser. The measured divergence angle of the transmitting system is 0.084mrad, which meet the system design requirements. Subsequently, a mechanical environment test and a thermal vacuum environment test are carried out. The divergence angles before and after the tests, during the high and low temperature conditions are stable and are all less than 0.1mrad.

TI  - An automated rice mapping method based on flooding signals in synthetic aperture radar time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world, feeding over 50% of the global population. A quick and accurate mapping of the extent of paddy rice is of critical importance for ensuring food security, studying climate change and monitoring water resources. Based on Sentinel-1A data and rice flooding features, we proposed a rice mapping method called the Automated Rice Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar Flooding Signals (ARM-SARFS), in which the key "V" shaped feature in the Sentinel-1A VH backscatter time series rising from the flooding before and after rice transplanting was used for rice mapping. The ARM-SARFS was validated at three study sites in Hubei, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces in China under different rice cropping systems and different geographical and climate conditions. The results showed that even without any training samples, the ARM-SARFS was able to provide a satisfying classification result with an overall accuracy of over 86% and an F-1 score of over 0.85 at all three study sites. With the aid of training samples, the classification performance increased further. When compared with the previously proposed Sentinel-1-based rice mapping methods, the ARM-SARFS improved the overall accuracy by 13.3-37.2%, and the most significant improvement was in the producer's accuracy. The sensitivity test showed that the ARM-SARFS is not sensitive to thresholding, and a high classification accuracy can be achieved at thresholds ranging from -0.025 to 0. These results demonstrated the robustness of ARM-SARFS for automated rice mapping with a high accuracy at large scales.

AB  - A recent development in Interferometric  Synthetic  Aperture  Radar  (InSAR)  technology is integrating  multiple  SAR  satellite  data  to  dynamically extract ground features. This paper addresses two relevant challenges: identification of common ground targets from different SAR datasets in space, and concatenation of time series when dealing with temporal dynamics. To address the first challenge, we describe the geolocation uncertainty of InSAR measurements as a three-dimensional error ellipsoid. The points, among InSAR measurements, which have error ellipsoids with a positive cross volume are identified as tie-point pairs representing common ground objects from multiple SAR datasets. The cross volumes are calculated using Monte Carlo methods and serve as weights to achieve the equivalent deformation time series. To address the second challenge, the deformation time series model for each tie-point pair is estimated using probabilistic methods, where potential deformation models are  efficiently tested and evaluated. As an application, we integrated two Radarsat-2 datasets in Standard and Extra-Fine modes to map the subsidence of the west of the Netherlands between 2010 and 2017. We identified 18128 tie-point pairs, 5 intersection types of error ellipsoids, 5 deformation models, and constructed their long-term deformation time series. The detected maximum mean subsidence velocity in Line-Of-Sight direction is up to 15mm/yr. We conclude that our method removes limitations that exist in single-viewing-geometry SAR when integrating multiple SAR data. In particular, the proposed time-series modeling method is useful to achieve a long-term deformation time series of multiple datasets.

TI  - Estimating Tropical Cyclone Wind Structure and Intensity From Spaceborne Radiometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a relatively simple method to estimate tropical cyclone (TC) surface wind structure (34-, 50-, and 64-kt wind radii) and intensity [maximum wind speed (MWS)] from wind fields acquired from the L-band SMAP radiometer and C-band Sentinel-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) between 2015 and 2020. The radiometer and SAR-derived wind radii and MWS are systematically compared with the best-track estimates. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of R34, R50, and R64 are 31.2, 21.8, and 17.0 nmi (1 nmi = 1.852 km) for radiometer, and 21.7, 16.5, and 16.3 nmi for SAR, respectively. These error values are smaller than the averaged best-track uncertainty estimates for the three wind radii. Compared with the best-track reports, the bias and RMSE for the MWS estimates are -0.2 m/s and 5.8 m/s for radiometer, and 4.4 m/s and 9.1 m/s for SAR, respectively. These results are for the wind speeds in the range of 17-80 m/s. For the two typical TCs (Lionrock and Noru) in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, our results show that a combination of the radiometer and SAR wind data acquired within a very short time interval has the potential to simultaneously obtain reasonable measurements of the wind radii and intensity parameters. Moreover, for a TC with a long lifecycle, such as Typhoon Noru, we demonstrate that the high-resolution and multitemporal synergistic observations from SAR and radiometer are valuable for studying fine-scale features of the wind field and characteristics of wind asymmetry associated with intensity change, as well as the evolution of TC surface wind structure and intensity.

TI  - Learning Higher Quality Rotation Invariance Features for Multioriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multioriented object detection, an important yet challenging task because of the bird's-eye-view perspective, complex background, and densely packed objects, is in the spotlight of detection in remote sensing images. Although existing methods have recently experienced substantial progress based on oriented head, they learn little about essential rotation invariance of the objects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed that can learn high-quality rotation invariance features of the multioriented objects by three measures. Given a remote sensing image, the multiscale semantic segmentation feature fusion module first merges the global semantic segmentation features predicted by the semantic segmentation branch and the multiscale features extracted by the backbone with FPN in order to distinguish complex background. Then, the discriminative features are used by rotation mainstream, whose structure is similar to cascade R-CNN and can extract higher quality rotation invariance features and predict more accurate location information by adaptively adjusting the distribution of the samples through progressive intersection over union thresholds. And in order to improve the performance of mainstream to predict more accurate oriented bounding box, the horizontal tributaries that can fully leverage the reciprocal relationship between the oriented detection and horizontal detection were added to the latter two stages. Extensive experiments on three public datasets for remote sensing images, i.e., Gaofen Airplane, HRSC2016, and DOTA demonstrate that without bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves superior performances compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods for multioriented detection. Moreover, our overall system achieves 59.264% mAP of airplane Detection in 2020 Gaofen challenge, ranking third in the final.

TI  - ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF URBANIZATION ON REGIONAL GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN WUHAN URBAN AGGLOMERATION ENVIRONMENT, CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of urbanization has rapidly changed the land use pattern and occupied a large amount of cropland and forest. Its influence on the global ecological environment is a hot topic of geography research. Studying the influence of urbanization process on regional gross primary productivity is essential to understand the carbon cycle of regional terrestrial ecosystem. At present, the central region of China is the fastest growing region in the process of urbanization in China. In this study, taking Wuhan Urban Agglomeration as the research area, we aim to estimate the impact of urbanization on the variation of gross primary productivity (GPP), analyze land use change combined with the MODIS GPP/NPP data products to study the change of GPP in 2004-2016 by using Landsat TM and OLI image data to obtain land use information. The land use analysis shows that the urban sprawl is the most striking land use change, embodied by the conversion of cropland to urban, the conversion and supplement of cropland from forest, and the conversion of small part of the forest land into urban directly. During 2004-2006, the mean of annual GPP of Wuhan Urban Agglomeration decreased from 1129.23 gCm(-2)year(-1) to 981.98 gCm(-2)year(-1), and the total GPP decreased by 7969.89 GgC, corresponding to a reduction of 12911.22 GgC in the absorption of CO2 within a year. Among them, the existing cropland in 2004 accounts for 69.46% of the total decline, and the forest land accounts for 12.9%. The main reason for the decline of GPP in the whole region lies in the occupation of cropland by the urban land and the conversion of forest land into cropland. The migration of non-urban population to urban areas has contributed to this decline.

AB  - In recent years, methods based on deep learning have become a hot spot and trend in the field of remote sensing object detection, and a series of encouraging results have been achieved. With the development of science and technology, people's technology and ability to acquire remote sensing data have been comprehensively improved, and high-resolution large-scale remote sensing image data has increased dramatically. However, the current mainstream object detection models cannot directly input large-scale high-resolution images for prediction. This paper proposes a remote sensing object parallel detection algorithm, which uses the mpi4py module to realize multi-CPU+GPU distributed parallel processing. Based on the yolov4 object detection model, it can detect remote sensing images of any scale without reducing the prediction accuracy. And shorten the object detection time according to the number of distributed nodes. The experimental results show that the parallel algorithm has a high speedup ratio, and the parallel detection technology has a good development prospect in the field of remote sensing image object detection.

TI  - Research on Retrieval of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Danjiangkou-Fancheng Reach of Han River Based on Sentinel-2 Satellite Data

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Conference on Digital Image Processing (ICDIP)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The chlorophyll-a concentration is one of the main indicators to evaluate water quality and measure the degree of eutrophication of the water body. It is of great significance to the environmental protection of rivers and lakes. At present, the commonly used empirical/semi-empirical remote sensing inversion models have low inversion accuracy in rivers with low chlorophyll-a concentration and narrow chlorophyll-a concentration ranges. At the same time, the semianalytical models require specific wavelengths, which makes it more suitable for hyperspectral remote sensing data. But it is difficult to obtain high-resolution hyperspectral satellite data. Taking the Danjiangkou-Fancheng reach of the Han River as the research area, this paper establishes a partial least squares regression model to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration using Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing images and synchronously measured chlorophyll-a concentration data. Considering the impact of Wangfuzhou Hydropower Station on the upstream and downstream, a segmented modeling was adopted and verified. The results show that the average relative errors of the verification samples in the Danjiangkou-Wangfuzhou reach and Wangfuzhou-Fancheng reach are 22.53% and 11.75%, respectively and the root mean square errors are 0.65ug/L and 0.17ug/L, respectively. The prediction accuracy is high. It indicates that the partial least squares method can be applied to the inversion of chlorophyll-a in rivers with low chlorophyll-a concentration and narrow chlorophyll-a ranges based on multispectral data.

CP  - Photonics and Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS)
CL  - Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Wuhai City is an important coal resource area in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. High-intensity underground mining will cause large land subsidence. Differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) is a popular monitoring method of land subsidence in recent years. This paper uses two-pass D-InSAR method to monitor land subsidence in Wuhai City. The experimental data selects 7 scenes of C-band Sentinel-1A images from September 2019 to March 2020. The final deformation results are shown in the Figure 3. The two-pass D-InSAR processing flow includes data focusing, baseline estimation, interferogram generation, adaptive filtering and coherence generation, phase unwrapping, orbit refining and re-flattening, deformation map generation. The result shows: During the monitoring time, the most serious subsidence areas are concentrated near the mine clusters on the east and west sides of Wuhai City. Maximum settlement value up to 242 mm. The subsidence values in heavy industrial and residential areas are slightly smaller compared to the former. Settlement values are generally ranged from 56 to 87 mm. The settlement is lightest in the southern part of Hainan district. It indicates that mining can greatly accelerate surface subsidence. Meanwhile, human activities and groundwater extraction can increase subsidence. From the perspective of time, Settlement in Wuhai City is more pronounced during September to December 2019 but it decreases sharply in January 2020.This should be related to the outbreak of COVID-19. The subsidence value increased slightly from February to March 2020, which showed that the epidemic had been preliminarily controlled and people began to return to work.

TI  - Enhanced scaling effects significantly lower the ability of MODIS normalized difference snow index to estimate fractional and binary snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS fractional (FSC) and binary (BSC) snow-cover data are important for obtaining accurate spatiotemporal snow-cover information for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) where rapid warming is closely related to snow-cover changes. However, FSC and BSC data are no longer provided in the newly released version (v6) of the MODIS snow cover product, having been replaced with normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data. Recent studies have observed clearly lower accuracy of MODIS snow cover data on the TP than in other areas, possibly implying that there are strong scaling effects due to the complex terrain and land cover which are not well understood. A total of 353 Landsat-8 scenes covering most parts of the TP are used to establish a new empirical relationship between FSC and MODIS NDSI for FSC estimation and a new NDSI threshold for BSC estimation. The results indicate that the new regression model (mean root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD): 0.22) has a better FSC estimation accuracy than the previously used global reference equation (mean RMSD: 0.24) and that the new NDSI threshold of 0.29 (mean Cohen's Kappa (CK): 0.49) outperforms the global reference NDSI threshold of 0.4 (mean CK: 0.40) in BSC estimation. The relatively low accuracy could be due to an enhanced scaling effect. The 30-m Landsat-8 NDSI data are upscaled to 500-m (MODIS) to analyze the scaling effects on FSC and BSC estimates made using MODIS NDSI. We find that the methods using MODIS NDSI have much lower estimation accuracy, for both FSC and BSC, compared with those using upscaled Landsat-8 NDSI. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test which considers 512 combinations of aspect, slope and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) further demonstrates that the enhanced scaling effects are mainly caused by terrain factors (i.e. aspect and slope). The optimal NDSI threshold for estimating BSC generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from the southeast to northwest. This study has important implications for the optimal use of MODIS NDSI snow cover data on the TP and highlights the importance of developing more advanced methods which take more factors into account.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion technique can combine the advantages of temporal resolution and spatial resolution of different images to achieve continuous monitoring for the Earth's surface, which is a feasible solution to resolve the trade-off between the temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images. In this paper, an object-based spatiotemporal fusion model (OBSTFM) is proposed to produce spatiotemporally consistent data, especially in areas experiencing non-shape changes (including phenology changes and land cover changes without shape changes). Considering different changes that might occur in different regions, multi-resolution segmentation is first employed to produce segmented objects, and then a linear injection model is introduced to produce preliminary prediction. In addition, a new optimized strategy to select similar pixels is developed to obtain a more accurate prediction. The performance of proposed OBSTFM is validated using two remotely sensed dataset experiencing phenology changes in the heterogeneous area and land cover type changes, experimental results show that the proposed method is advantageous in such areas with non-shape changes, and has satisfactory robustness and reliability in blending large-scale abrupt land cover changes. Consequently, OBSTFM has great potential for monitoring highly dynamic landscapes.

TI  - Interannual and Seasonal Variability of Glacier Surface Velocity in the Parlung Zangbo Basin, Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring glacier flow is vital to understand the response of mountain glaciers to environmental forcing in the context of global climate change. Seasonal and interannual variability of surface velocity in the temperate glaciers of the Parlung Zangbo Basin (PZB) has attracted significant attention. Detailed patterns in glacier surface velocity and its seasonal variability in the PZB are still uncertain, however. We utilized Landsat-8 (L8) OLI data to investigate in detail the variability of glacier velocity in the PZB by applying the normalized image cross-correlation method. On the basis of satellite images acquired from 2013 to 2020, we present a map of time-averaged glacier surface velocity and examined four typical glaciers (Yanong, Parlung No.4, Xueyougu, and Azha) in the PZB. Next, we explored the driving factors of surface velocity and of its variability. The results show that the glacier centerline velocity increased slightly in 2017-2020. The analysis of meteorological data at two weather stations on the outskirts of the glacier area provided some indications of increased precipitation during winter-spring. Such increase likely had an impact on ice mass accumulation in the up-stream portion of the glacier. The accumulated ice mass could have caused seasonal velocity changes in response to mass imbalance during 2017-2020. Besides, there was a clear winter-spring speedup of 40% in the upper glacier region, while a summer speedup occurred at the glacier tongue. The seasonal and interannual velocity variability was captured by the transverse velocity profiles in the four selected glaciers. The observed spatial pattern and seasonal variability in glacier surface velocity suggests that the winter-spring snow might be a driver of glacier flow in the central and upper portions of glaciers. Furthermore, the variations in glacier surface velocity are likely related to topographic setting and basal slip caused by the percolation of rainfall. The findings on glacier velocity suggest that the transfer of winter-spring accumulated ice triggered by mass conservation seems to be the main driver of changes in glacier velocity. The reasons that influence the seasonal surface velocity change need further investigation.

TI  - Water Body Detection in High-Resolution SAR Images With Cascaded Fully-Convolutional Network and Variable Focal Loss
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water body detection in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a challenging task due to the changing interference caused by multiple imaging conditions and complex land backgrounds. Inspired by the excellent adaptability of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the structured modeling capabilities of probabilistic graphical models, the cascaded fully-convolutional network (CFCN) is proposed to improve the performance of water body detection in high-resolution SAR images. First, for the resolution loss caused by convolutions with large stride in traditional convolutional neural network (CNN), the fully-convolutional upsampling pyramid networks (UPNs) are proposed to suppress this loss and realize pixel-wise water body detection. Then considering blurred water boundary, the fully-convolutional conditional random fields (FC-CRFs) are introduced to UPNs, which reduce computational complexity and lead to the automatic learning of Gaussian kernels in CRFs and the higher boundary accuracy. Furthermore, to eliminate the inefficient training caused by imbalanced categorical distribution in the training data set, a novel variable focal loss (VFL) function is proposed, which replaces the constant weighting factor of focal loss with the frequency-dependent factor. The proposed methods can not only improve the pixel accuracy and boundary accuracy but also perform well in detection robustness and speed. Results of GaoFen-3 SAR images are presented to validate the proposed approaches.

TI  - The Extraction of Urban Built-Up Areas by Integrating Night-Time Light and POI Data-A Case Study of Kunming, China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the urban built-up area becoming one of the most prominent forms of urban expansion, accurately extracting the urban built-up area is becoming more and more important to judge the urbanization process and evaluate the urban environment. Since it is difficult to significantly improve the accuracy of single satellite data in the extraction of urban built-up areas, this study proposes a method integrating POI (Point of Interest) data and Luojia-1A data to improve the extraction accuracy of urban built-up areas. In this study, integrated Density Graph, OSTU and geometric mean are used to extract urban built-up areas respectively. The highest precision of urban built-up areas extracted before data integration is 74.3% with the highest Kappa value of 0.54; while the highest precision of urban built-up area extracted after data integration is 91.4%, with the highest Kappa value of 0.91. Therefore, it can be concluded that compared with the existing widely used night-light-based methods, this method can integrate the advantages of POI data and Luojia-1A data, that is, it can not only solve the long-term oversaturation phenomenon of night light data, but also can extract urban built-up areas in a more refined way. The method used in this study, which integrates POI data and Luojia-1A data, can not only provide a new method for urban built-up area extraction, but also can play an active guiding role in urban planning and construction.

TI  - Evaluation of the Initial Sea Surface Temperature From the HY-2B Scanning Microwave Radiometer
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) is the second marine dynamic environment satellite of China. Sea surface temperature (SST) products from the scanning microwave radiometer (SMR) onboard HY-2B satellite are evaluated against in situ measurements. Approximately, ten months of data are used for the initial evaluation, from January 15, 2019 to November 15, 2019. The temporal and spatial windows for collocation are 30 min and 25 km, respectively, which produce 450 416 matchup pairs between HY-2B/SMR and in situ SSTs. The statistical comparison of the entire data set shows that the mean bias is -0.13 degrees C (SMR minus buoy), and the corresponding root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 1.06 degrees C. Time series of collocations for the SST difference shows that a good agreement is found between HY-2B/SMR and in situ SSTs after June 15, revealing a mean bias and an RMSE of only 0.09 degrees C and 0.72 degrees C, respectively. A three-way error analysis is conducted between the SMR, Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI), and in situ SSTs. Individual standard deviations are found to be 0.41 degrees C for the GMI SST, 0.15 degrees C for the in situ SST, and 1.03 degrees C for the SMR SST. The results indicate that the HY2B/SMR SST products need to be improved during the period from January 15, 2019 to June 15, 2019.

TI  - A Novel Urban Composition Index Based on Water-Impervious Surface-Pervious Surface (W-I-P) Model for Urban Compositions Mapping Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring urban compositions spatially and temporally is a crucial issue for urban planning and management. Nowadays, remote sensing techniques have been widely applied for urban compositions extraction. Compared with other remote sensing techniques, spectral indices have significant advantages due to their parameter-free and easy implementation. However, existing indices cannot extract different urban compositions well, and some of them can only extract one composition with less attention to other urban compositions. In this study, based on the water- impervious surface-pervious surface (W-I-P) model, a novel urban composition index (UCI) was developed by analyzing the robust features from the global spectral samples. Additionally, a semi-empirical threshold of UCI was proposed to extract different urban compositions (water, impervious surface area and pervious surface area). Four cities of China were selected as study areas, Landsat-8 images and Google Earth images were used for quantitative analysis. Correlation analysis, separability analysis, and accuracy assessment were conducted among UCI and five other existed indices (single and multiple composition indices) at the urban and global scales. Results indicated that UCI had a stronger correlation with the ISA proportion and a higher separability between each urban composition. UCI also achieved the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in urban compositions extraction. The suggested semi-empirical threshold was also testified to be reliable and can be a reference for practical application. There is convincing evidence that UCI is a simple, efficient, and reliable index for urban compositions extraction.

TI  - A global assessment of PT-JPL soil evaporation in agroecosystems with optical, thermal, and microwave satellite data Metadata for this paper
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for water movements from land to air and plays a vital role in the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. Reliable estimates of ET for agricultural landscapes can facilitate water resources management and food security analysis. The widely used Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL)model has the most potential to operationally simulate ET over large areas, but its inability to fully track soil evaporation dynamics using atmospheric humidity limits its application in agroecosystems. In this study, we isolated the uncertainties resulting from soil evaporation and assessed three Earth observation-based alternatives- apparent thermal inertia (ATI), microwave soil moisture (SM), and optical spectral indices based on shortwave infrared (SWIR) to formulate soil evaporation. Our results illustrate that the incorporation of the SWIR-based soil moisture divergence index (SMDI) and microwave-based SM into monthly soil evaporation led to 6% and 5% increase in explained ET variances and reduced RMSE by 23.2% and 13.1% for cropland and grassland, respectively, as compared to PT-JPL using atmospheric reanalysis data only. Further analyses demonstrated that PT-SMDI explained more observed ET variances than PT-JPL using in-situ measurements of atmospheric humidity during the crop growing season, particularly for irrigated cropland (R2=0.65 for PT-SMDI; R2=0.62 for PT-JPL). On the other hand, the use of microwave SM outperformed other indices for ET assessment in grasslandsbut had lower performance in croplands. Our results suggest that a combination of optical SWIR and microwave SM has good potential to improve the PT-JPL model accuracy for agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Evaluation of Gaofen-3 C-Band SAR for Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Different Polarimetric Decomposition Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter affecting crop growth. Gaofen-3 satellite is the first C-band synthetic aperture radar produced by China, which provides full-polarization data sources for soil moisture estimation. This article evaluated the potential of estimating soil moisture via GF-3 SAR over agricultural area using different polarimetric decomposition models, namely, the modified Freeman-Durden model (MFDM), the An model and the FDM. Among them, the MFDM is the first attempt to be used for soil moisture retrieval. After removing the volume scattering, the surface and dihedral scattering component were used complementarily to estimate soil moisture. The results show the performance of each polarimetric decomposition models for soil moisture estimation depends on the crop type, crop growth stages and soil moisture conditions. Soil moisture retrievals exhibit an overall underestimation with a root mean square error of 8-11vol. %. This is mainly because of the random orientation assumption in the volume scattering model, which cannot accurately describe the variability of the crop structure. Due to the application of de-orientation process and power constraint, the MFDM shows the best performance both for corn and wheat, with inversion rates of 39%-45%.

TI  - Transfer Learning for Optical and SAR Data Correspondence Identification With Limited Training Labels
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advancements in sensor technology have reflected promise in collaborative utilization; specifically, multisource remote sensing data correspondence identification attracts increasing attention. In this article, a domain-transfer learning based generative correspondence analysis (DT-GCA) scheme is proposed, which enables identifying corresponding data in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with small-sized reference data. In the proposed architecture, an adversarial domain-translator is investigated as general-purpose domain transference solution to learn cross domain features. The optical-aided implicit representation, which is regarded as the clone of SAR, is adopted to estimate the correlation with SAR images. Particularly, the designed GCA integrates optical-generated features with SAR tightly instead of treating them separately and eliminates the discrepancy influence of different sensors. Experiments on cross-domain remote sensing data are validated, and extensive results demonstrate that the proposed DT-GCA yields substantial improvements over some state-of-the-art techniques when only limited training samples are available.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval during the Wheat Growth Cycle Using SAR and Optical Satellite Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to propose a combined approach for the high-precision mapping of soil moisture during the wheat growth cycle based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (Radarsat-2) and optical satellite data (Landsat-8). For this purpose, the influence of vegetation was removed from the total backscatter by using the modified water cloud model (MWCM), which takes the vegetation fraction (f(veg)) into account. The VV/VH polarization radar backscattering coefficients database was established by a numerical simulation based on the advanced integrated equation model (AIEM) and the cross-polarized ratio of the Oh model. Then the empirical relationship between the bare soil backscattering coefficient and both the soil moisture and the surface roughness was developed by regression analysis. The surface roughness in this paper was described by using the effective roughness parameter and the combined roughness form. The experimental results revealed that using effective roughness as the model input instead of in-situ measured roughness can obtain soil moisture with high accuracy and effectively avoid the uncertainty of roughness measurement. The accuracy of soil moisture inversion could be improved by introducing vegetation fraction on the basis of the water cloud model (WCM). There was a good correlation between the estimated soil moisture and the observed values, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 4.14% and the coefficient of determination (R-2) about 0.7390.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Edge Information and Polarization on SAR-to-Optical Translation Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately describe dynamic vegetation changes, high temporal and spectral resolution data are urgently required. Optical images contain rich spectral information but are limited by poor weather conditions and cloud contamination. Conversely, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is effective under all weather conditions but contains insufficient spectral information to recognize certain vegetation changes. Conditional adversarial networks (cGANs) can be adopted to transform SAR images (Sentinel-1) into optical images (Landsat8), which exploits the advantages of both optical and SAR images. As the features of SAR and optical remote sensing data play a decisive role in the translation process, this study explores the quantitative impact of edge information and polarization (VV, VH, VV&VH) on the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, correlation coefficient (r), and root mean squared error. The addition of edge information improves the structural similarity between generated and real images. Moreover, using the VH and VV&VH polarization modes as the input provides the cGANs with more effective information and results in better image quality. The optimal polarization mode with the addition of edge information is VV&VH, whereas that without edge information is VV. Near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands in the generated image exhibit higher accuracy (r > 0.8) than visible light bands. The conclusions of this study could serve as an important reference for selecting cGANs input features, and as a potential reference for the applications of cGANs to the SAR-to-optical translation of other multi-source remote sensing data.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), as the main ecological water consumer, is crucial to assess the ecological water budget and dry conditions in arid and semi-arid areas. The objective of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal variations of ET and determine the major parameters affecting ET by using remote sensing data and climate data at annual and seasonal scales in Xilingol steppe, China. The results of this study showed that the annual ET gradually reduced from northeast to southwest in the Xilingol steppe, with the values fluctuating around 200 mm per year during 2000-2014. The seasonal value of the spatially averaged ET was in reducing order from summer, fall, and winter to spring, accounting for approximately 35%, 23%, 22%, and 20% of the annual ET, respectively. The largest ET appeared in summer in meadow steppe, typical steppe, and sandy vegetation steppe, while in the desert steppe, it occurred in winter, accounting for 39% of the annual ET. Precipitation and NDVI are the major parameters positively affecting ET in spring, summer, and fall. However, in winter, ET was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with precipitation. The results indicated that the spatiotemporal characteristics and the affecting parameters of the actual ET vary seasonally and that the characteristics of the annual ET are mainly determined by the growing season (spring-fall). Moreover, vegetation growth is directly correlated with ET and sunshine hours rather than other parameters. Combining with the natural conditions, the conclusions can be deduced that the dry conditions in the meadow and typical steppes are probably caused by uneven precipitation distribution and high ET demands during the growing season, while the low annual precipitation combined with high winter evaporation is the main reason for water scarcity in the desert steppe.

TI  - A Comparison of Gaofen-2 and Sentinel-2 Imagery for Mapping Mangrove Forests Using Object-Oriented Analysis and Random Forest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest (MF) extents and distributions are fundamental for conservation and restoration efforts. According to previous studies, both the commercial Gaofen-2 (GF-2) imagery (0.8 m spatial resolution and 4 spectral bands) and freely accessed Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery (10 m spatial resolution and 13 spectral bands) have been successfully used to map MFs. However, the efficiency and accuracy of MF mapping based on these two data is not clear, especially for large-scale applications. To address this issue, first, we developed a robust classification approach by integrating object-based image analysis (OBIA) and random forest (RF) algorithm; and then, applied this approach to GF-2 and S2 images to map the extents of MF along the entire coasts of Guangxi, China, respectively; at last, compared the efficiency and accuracy of GF-2 and S2 imagery in MF mapping. Results showed that: first, based on OBIA and RF integrated classification approach both MF maps derived from GF-2 and S2 obtained high mapping accuracies (the overall accuracy was 96% and 94%, respectively); second, areal extent of MFs in Guangxi extracted from GF-2 and S2 images was 8182 and 8040 ha, respectively; third, GF-2 imagery has extraordinary abilities in detecting fragmented MF patches located along landward and seaward edges; and finally, S2 imagery performed better in detecting seaward submerged MFs and separating MF from terrestrial vegetation. Results and conclusions of this study can provide basic considerations for selecting appropriate data source in MF or wetland vegetation mapping tasks.

TI  - Remote Sensing Supported Sea Surface pCO<sub>2</sub> Estimation and Variable Analysis in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marginal seas are a dynamic and still to large extent uncertain component of the global carbon cycle. The large temporal and spatial variations of sea-surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in these areas are driven by multiple complex mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed the variable importance for the sea surface pCO(2) estimation in the Baltic Sea and derived monthly pCO(2) maps for the marginal sea during the period of July 2002-October 2011. We used variables obtained from remote sensing images and numerical models. The random forest algorithm was employed to construct regression models for pCO(2) estimation and produce the importance of different input variables. The study found that photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) was the most important variable for the pCO(2) estimation across the entire Baltic Sea, followed by sea surface temperature (SST), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)), and mixed layer depth (MLD). Interestingly, Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (Kd_490nm) showed relatively low importance for the pCO(2) estimation. This was mainly attributed to the high correlation of Chl-a and Kd_490nm to other pCO(2)-relevant variables (e.g., a(CDOM)), particularly in the summer months. In addition, the variables' importance for pCO(2) estimation varied between seasons and sub-basins. For example, the importance of a(CDOM) were large in the Gulf of Finland but marginal in other sub-basins. The model for pCO(2) estimate in the entire Baltic Sea explained 63% of the variation and had a root of mean squared error (RMSE) of 47.8 mu atm. The pCO(2) maps derived with this model displayed realistic seasonal variations and spatial features of sea surface pCO(2) in the Baltic Sea. The spatially and seasonally varying variables' importance for the pCO(2) estimation shed light on the heterogeneities in the biogeochemical and physical processes driving the carbon cycling in the Baltic Sea and can serve as an important basis for future pCO(2) estimation in marginal seas using remote sensing techniques. The pCO(2) maps derived in this study provided a robust benchmark for understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of CO2 air-sea exchange in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is the technique capable of monitoring active landslide in all-weather conditions and in a near real-time. In this study, ALOS-2 (L-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-Band) images were used to map potential areas prone to the occurrence of large-scale landslide disasters. Differential InSAR (D-InSAR) and multi-temporal techniques were applied to detect landslides in a part of Maoxian(a typical mountainous county in Southwest China), allowing the identification of 8 active landslides. The integration of local historical geological hazard data and local field exploration data allowed to conclude that the detected landslides found in Baibu village and other places were in the development stage. Deformation rate reached 200mm/yr along the line of sight direction. The results obtained by exploiting the two datasets correspond to each other in terms of spatial distribution and are consistent with the local field exploration results. L-band ALOS-2 SAR data proved to be very effective for detecting short-term and severe ground deformation, which is suitable for monitoring deformation in mountainous areas with a certain degree of vegetation coverage.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery for Urban Land Cover Classification by Optimized Random Forest Classifier
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is able to reflect the potential natural and social process in urban development, providing vital information to stakeholders. Recent solutions on land cover classification are generally addressed by remotely sensed imagery and supervised classification methods. However, a high-performance classifier is desirable but challenging due to the existence of model hyperparameters. Conventional approaches generally rely on manual tuning, which is time-consuming and far from satisfying. Therefore, this work aims to propose a systematic method to automatically tune the hyperparameters by Bayesian parameter optimization for the random forest classifier. The recently launched Sentinel-2A/B satellites are drawn to provide the remote sensing imageries for land cover classification case study in Beijing, China, which have the best spectral/spatial resolutions among the freely available satellites. The improved random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization is compared against the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) with default hyperparameters by discriminating five land cover classes including building, tree, road, water, and crop field. Comparative experimental results show that the optimized RF classifier outperforms the conventional SVM and the RF with default hyperparameters in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The effects of band/feature number and the band usefulness are also assessed. It is envisaged that the improved classifier for Sentinel-2 satellite image processing can find a wide range of applications where high-resolution satellite imagery classification is applicable.

TI  - Characteristics of the vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone in late autumn at Yangjiang station in Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. PartI: Observed event
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone has become the main factor affecting the air quality in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in recent years, and a clear understanding source of ozone pollution is a top priority of ozone pollution prevention. However, the vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone in the PRD is poorly understood. Based on daily ozone sounding data obtained in Yangjiang (111 degrees 58'00" E, 21 degrees 50'00" N), Guangdong Province, from 18 November tjo 3 December 2013, the detailed vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone and its influencing factors were determined and compared with weekly autumn ozone profile data obtained at the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and corresponding tropospheric column ozone (TCO) datasets from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard satellite AURA. Overall, the ozone profiles observed in Yangjiang are in accordance with those of the HKO in terms of the vertical structure. The TCO values are 34.2 +/- 4.0 and 34.3 +/- 4.6 DU, respectively, that are, 4 DU higher than those of satellite data, indicating that the OMI/MLS product underestimates the TCO level in the PRD region. The Yangjiang ozone profiles indicate significant variations in the ozone vertical structure and concentration during the observation period. A significant ozone peak perma-nently occurs in the lower troposphere at 1.1 +/- 0.4 km above the surface. The vertical structural difference is mainly reflected in the presence of low-ozone strata (below 30 ppbv) near the tropopause and ozone peaks and high-ozone stratification in the middle and upper troposphere. The average ozone peak concentrations in the lower, middle, and upper troposphere are 65.2 +/- 9.9, 57.8 +/- 7.7, 71.8 +/- 13.6 ppbv, respectively, which are higher than the average ground-level ozone concentration (48.9 +/- 9.4 ppbv). Based on the analysis of the profile characteristics, weather conditions, and backward trajectories, it can be concluded that the low-ozone strata near the tropopause are caused by the regional transport of the tropical air mass from the tropical cyclone storm area. Potential vorticity analysis shows that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) is the main reason for the for-mation of the ozone peaks and its varying concentrations in the middle and upper troposphere. Photochemical reactions represent the main factor affecting the ozone concentration in the lower troposphere. The STE is also an important factor affecting the ozone in the lower troposphere, leading to an increase in the surface ozone concentration by-10.9 ppbv.

CP  - 7th Symposium on Novel Photoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications

AB  - The spatial parallelism of the receiving and launching optical axis of the atmospheric detection lidar system directly affects the validity of the detection data. The high-precision optical path automatic adjustment system is one of the guarantee conditions for the reliable detection of the space-borne lidar. Common optical path automatic adjustment methods can be divided into echo signal intensity method and spot adjustment method. Based on the Space-borne lidar echo signal intensity adjustment method, fuzzy control is introduced, the tracking error and tracking error change rate is selected as the input of the fuzzy controller, and the output is the system adjustment step size. A variable step size segmentation adjustment algorithm is proposed, and the Turtle library in Python is used for adjustment route tracking simulation. The simulation results show that the stability of the fuzzy control system is higher than that of the traditional method. And randomly selected 1000 sample points, and selected the optimal path adjustment step length in the extremely small range to be 5 mu rad and 1 mu rad respectively for comparative analysis. It is found that the minimum range adjustment step size will also affect the stability of the system, and the step size is 5 mu rad adjustment effect is better.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations in the Leaf Area Index and Its Response to Topography in the Three-River Source Region, China from 2000 to 2017
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-River Source Region (TRSR) is an important area for the ecological security of China. Vegetation growth has been affected by the climate change, topography, and human activities in this area. However, few studies have focused on analyzing time series tendencies of vegetation change in various terrain conditions. To address this issue in the TRSR, this study explored vegetation stability, tendency, and sustainability with multiple methods (e.g., coefficient of variation, Theil-Sen median trend analysis, Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst index) based on the 2000-2017 Global LAnd Surface Satellite Leaf Area Index (GLASS LAI) product. The differentiation patterns of LAI variations and multiyear mean LAI value under different topographic factors were also investigated in combination with digital elevation model (DEM). The results showed that (1) the mean LAI value in the study area increased, with a linear tendency of 0.013 center dot 10 a(-1); (2) LAI values decreased from southeast to northwest in terms of spatial distribution and the CV indicated LAI variations were relatively stable; (3) the trend analysis revealed that the improved area of LAI accounted for 62.72% which was larger than the degraded area (37.28%), and hurst index revealed a weak anti-sustaining effect of the current tendencies; and (4) the increasing trend was found in multiyear mean LAI value as relief amplitude and slope increased, while LAI stability improved with increasing slope. They exhibited a clear regular pattern. Moreover, significant improvement in LAI generally occurred in low-altitude and flat areas. Finally, the overall improvement and sustainability of LAI improved when moving from sunny aspects to shady aspects, but the LAI stability decreased. Note that vegetation degradation was observed in some high slope areas and was further aggravated. This study is beneficial for revealing the spatial and temporal changes of LAI and their changing rules as a function of different topographic factors in the TRSR. Meanwhile, the results of this study provide theoretical support for sustainable development of this area.

TI  - Features of chinese students in the context of the regional-ethnic approach (national character, moral education, philosophy of China) in study of Russian language
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is devoted to the problem of speaking in Russian by Chinese students in non-linguistic universities in China in the context of a regional-ethnic approach. The concept of "regional-ethnic approach to foreign language education" was introduced into the terminological field of linguodidactics by G.M. Parnikova. In this work, we will rely on the concept of this researcher. The purpose of our study, aimed at finding ways to optimize the process of teaching the Russian language, in our case, speaking in Russian, for Chinese students in nonlinguistic universities in China. National character - these are stable features characteristic of members of a particular national (ethnic) community, features of the perception of the world, motives of actions (ideas, interests, religion). The main channel of transmission from generation to generation of a nationally specific mentality is moral education. The most common educational tools in China are proverbs and sayings. An important factor that determines the peculiarities of the worldview as the core of the national character and mentality of the people of China is Chinese philosophy. Analyzing the peculiarities of the national character, Chinese proverbs, sayings and philosophy, let us highlight the main methodological approaches to teaching Russian to Chinese students. Our conclusion: these approaches allow us to identify the defining principles of teaching Chinese students oral Russian speech in the context of the regional-ethnic approach.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, research has shown promises in building COVID-19 screening tools using cough recordings as a convenient and inexpensive alternative to current testing techniques. In this paper, we present a novel and fully automated algorithm framework for cough extraction and COVID-19 detection using a combination of signal processing and machine learning techniques. It involves extracting cough episodes from audios of a diverse real-world noisy conditions and then screening for the COVID-19 infection based on the cough characteristics. The proposed algorithm was developed and evaluated using self-recorded cough audios collected from COVID-19 patients monitored by Biovitals (R) Sentinel remote patient management platform and publicly available datasets of various sound recordings. The proposed algorithm achieves a duration Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 98.6% in the cough extraction task and a mean cross-validation AUROC of 98.1% in the COVID-19 classification task. These results demonstrate high accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm as a fast and easily accessible COVID-19 screening tool and its potential to be used for other cough analysis applications.

TI  - A Machine-Learning Model for Forecasting Internal Wave Propagation in the Andaman Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal waves (IWs) are broadly distributed globally and have significant impacts on offshore engineering and underwater navigation. The prediction of IW propagation is a challenging task because of the complex factors involved. In this study, a machine-learning model was developed to predict IW propagation in the Andaman Sea. The model is based on a back-propagation neural network trained by 1189 IW samples, including the crest length and the peak-to-peak distance of IWs, extracted from 123 Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and 33 Ocean Land Color Instrument (OLCI) images acquired from 2015 to 2019 and corresponding ocean environment parameters. Using the leading wave crest within an IW packet as input, we ran the model to forecast the IW locations and compare them with satellite observations. The average root-mean-square difference between the model-forecasted and satellite-observed IW leading crest after one tidal cycle was 3.21 km. The corresponding averaged correlation coefficient was 0.95 and the average Frechet Distance was 11.46 km. We reiterated the model run over two tidal periods and obtained similar statistical results, indicating the robustness of forecasting IW packets. We find that reducing the time step helped to improve forecasting accuracy. The influence of input errors and seasonal variations on model results are discussed and an analysis shows that the initial propagation direction introduced to the model is necessary for cross-propagating IW patterns. Comparisons with the Korteweg-de Vries equation results show that the developed model has better performance and is more robust.

TI  - Molecular alterations differentiate microinvasive carcinoma from ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast carcinoma: retrospective analysis of a large single-center series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microinvasive carcinoma (MIC) of the breast is a rare lesion. The clinicopathologic features and biologic behavior of MIC are unclear. Whether MIC is a distinct entity or an interim stage in the progression from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) remains to be determined. A retrospective review of clinicopathologic features and analysis of the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and Ki-67 in patients with MIC (90 cases), DCIS (268 cases) and IBC (1504 cases) was performed. Most MICs (93.3%) exhibited an intermediate to high nuclear grade, and this proportion was larger than that of DCIS (62.7%, P < 0.001) or IBC (85.4%, P = 0.036). The incidence of sentinel lymph node metastasis in MIC (12.5%) was higher than that of DCIS (1.6%, P < 0.001), but much lower than that of IBC (39.7%, P < 0.001). MICs had higher expression of HER-2 and lower expression of ER and PR compared to DCIS and IBC; and MIC was more likely to present with a HER-2+ subtype. Furthermore, DCIS exhibited greater HER-2 overexpression or gene amplification (P < 0.001) levels and lower proliferation index of Ki-67 (P < 0.001) compared to IBC. Our results suggest that the clinicopathologic and molecular phenotype of MIC are different from DCIS and IBC. Thus, MIC may be a distinct entity rather than an interim stage in the progression from DCIS to IBC. The prognosis of MIC and the biologic behavior of this uncommon subset need to be further explored.

TI  - A Time-Series Approach to Detect Urbanized Areas Using Biophysical Indicators and Landsat Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization is essential to study the patterns and processes of urban ecosystems. However, urban areas are difficult to classify, and migrating static classification algorithms to dynamic detection is also challenging. Here, we develop a time-series approach for the detection, in which urbanization processes are represented by the temporal trajectories of biophysical indicators. According to the spectral analysis of land-cover classes, the indicators of normalized difference vegetation index, automated water extraction index, biophysical composition index, and shortwave infrared index are selected to characterize urbanization. The temporal trajectories of these indicators are calculated using Landsat data on the google earth engine platform; and their long-term trends and abrupt changes are estimated by the Theil-Sen estimator and Mann-Kendall test, as well as the Pettitt test. The urbanized pixel classes are identified from the possible trend combinations of the indicators, in which the falsely alarmed pixels are excluded by the time-series analyses of the indicators. Three Chinese cities-Fuzhou, Nanchang, and Xining-in various physical environments are selected to demonstrate the proposed approach. The accuracy assessments using very high resolution images achieve the overall accuracies above 90% in the three areas, showing comparable performance to supervised techniques whereas no ancillary data are required. By the comparisons with two other urban products, the advantages of the proposed approach in detecting urbanization processes in the early stage and weak impervious situation are demonstrated. Due to little human intervention involved in the proposed approach, it could be readily adapted to other regions.

AB  - With the rapid development of space technology, the design of satellite-ground links in the field of satellite communication system research has become one of the hot spots in the field of satellite communication research. A good link design provides a low BER transmission channel for satellite-ground information interaction and gives full play to the observation and communication capabilities of satellites. By designing the RF transmitting and receiving systems in the satellite-ground transmission link, the performance of the satellite-ground link can be predicted after the satellite is in orbit by considering the losses in the transmission path. The article illustrates the compression coding algorithm, modulation mode coding selection, link design and implementation from the subsystem level, which is a strong practical guidance for satellite data transmission subsystem link design and working mode selection.

TI  - Investigating Ground Subsidence and the Causes over the Whole Jiangsu Province, China Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) mapping of localized ground surface deformation has become an important tool to manage subsidence-related geohazards. However, monitoring land surface deformation using InSAR at high spatial resolution over a large region is still a formidable task. In this paper, we report a research on investigating ground subsidence and the causes over the entire 107, 200 km(2) province of Jiangsu, China, using time-series InSAR. The Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide-swath (IW) images of 6 frames are used to map ground subsidence over the whole province for the period 2016-2018. We present processing methodology in detail, with emphasis on the three-level co-registration scheme of S-1 data, retrieval of mean subsidence velocity (MSV) and subsidence time series, and mosaicking of multiple frames of results. The MSV and subsidence time series are generated for 9,276,214 selected coherent pixels (CPs) over the Jiangsu territory. Using 688 leveling measurements in evaluation, the derived MSV map of Jiangsu province shows an accuracy of 3.9 mm/year. Moreover, subsidence causes of the province are analyzed based on InSAR-derived subsidence characteristics, historical optical images, and field-work findings. Main factors accounting for the observed subsidence include: underground mining, groundwater withdrawal, soil consolidations of marine reclamation, and land-use transition from agricultural (paddy) to industrial land. This research demonstrates not only the capability of S-1 data in mapping ground deformation over wide areas in coastal and heavily vegetated region of China, but also the potential of inferring valuable knowledge from InSAR-derived results.

AB  - In order to study the alteration extraction method and effect of GF-5 Visual and infrared spectral imager (VIMS), this image was used as the data source. On the basis of analyzing the spectral characteristics of typical altered minerals, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to extract iron-stained and hydroxyl alteration, and the results were compared with those from Landsat 5 TM image. The results show that: the alteration information extracted from VIMS image is consistent with the alteration extracted from TM image, and it is more accurate; the quality of VIMS image is worse than that of TM image, which affects the result of alteration extraction. Therefore, attention should be paid to the selection of VIMS image in practical application.

CL  - Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Since 2000, China has witnessed rapid social and economic development and rapid improvement of urbanization level. Analyzing the driving force of urban construction land expansion is an important basis for predicting the future expansion of urban construction land. This study uses EVI, DMSP/OLS and Luojia1-01 nighttime remote sensing data products to extract the urban construction land range of Jinan from 2000 to 2018. The evolution process of urbanization is characterized by three indicators: AGR, elastic coefficient and city compactness. The migration of urban center is analyzed by standard deviation ellipse. Combined with the statistical yearbook data over the years, the driving mechanism of urbanization is analyzed by using geographic detector model from the perspectives of economic construction, social development, infrastructure and environment. The results show that: since 2003, Jinan city has a trend of scattered expansion, and the overall expansion direction is obvious. From 2003 to 2008, the urban expansion speed is faster, followed by 2013 to 2018, and the expansion speed is slower from 2008 to 2013. The urban compactness decreases with the increase of construction land area, and the urban center move to the east by slightly north. The urban expansion is mainly driven by economy, mainly in GDP growth, industrial structure optimization, economic opening policy, followed by population and transportation facilities, and there is a two-factor enhanced relationship between the indicators.

M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of drought is a complex process and is caused by the interaction of multiple drought-causing factors. The construction of traditional drought models and indexes seldom considers multiple drought-causing factors. This study integrated the precipitation, soil water and heat balance, and crop growth during drought. From the beginning of the process of agricultural drought, the atmosphere, soil, and crops that characterize drought are considered, through the principal component analysis method to construct a comprehensive drought monitoring index (CDMI). This index was verified by using the areas covered by drought, areas affected by drought, relative soil moisture, and crop yield. The annual average CDMI had negative correlations with areas covered and affected by drought. The correlation coefficients were -0.68 and -0.73. Moreover, the CDMI value had positive correlations with relative soil moisture and crop yield. The maximum correlation coefficient between CDMI and relative soil moisture was 0.91, and the correlation coefficient with maize yield was 0.52. Subsequently, the CDMI was applied to long-term drought monitoring in agricultural areas during the summer maize growing season (June to September) in Henan Province. Results showed that the most severe years of agricultural drought in Henan Province were 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2014. The most severe agricultural drought occurred in July and August 2014. Statistics found that Henan Province had high frequencies of severe drought. This study proved that CDMI calculated by multisource remote sensing data is a reliable and effective indicator for monitoring and assessing agricultural drought.

TI  - Estimation of aerosol radiative effects on terrestrial gross primary productivity and water use efficiency using process-based model and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - China experienced heavy aerosol pollution in recent years. The aerosol pollution changes surface solar radiation and affects the land terrestrial carbon and water cycles in China. However, there are still some uncertainties in evaluating aerosol effects on ecosystem. Therefore, we combined the MODIS Atmosphere and Land products with process-based model to examine the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE) to AOD. We also evaluated the effects of aerosol loadings on GPP and WUE at China FLUX sites from 2002 to 2015. Our results indicated that the radiative effects of aerosols on GPP varied with the vegetation type, which is consistent with other studies. Aerosol enhances the GPP by 2% in forest and reduces the GPP by 7% in grass land during the study period. We also found that the radiative effects of aerosols on WUE varied with the vegetation type. The WUE was promoted by the aerosols for all surface types when AOD is lower than 2.3. This indicates that the aerosol could enhance the plants WUE in most cases. Cloud during the study period restrains aerosol effects on growth of plants and improves the aerosol effects on WUE. Aerosol loadings during the study period fertilized the growth in two forest growth and slightly impede the growth of grass. They also improve the WUE for all vegetation types. The WUE increases more that 4% in most of sites increases. The results in this paper could help to fully understand the influences of aerosol on land carbon and water cycle.

TI  - Map and Quantify the Ground Deformation Around Salt Lake in Hoh Xil, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using Time-Series InSAR From 2006 to 2018
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After the bursting of the Zhuonai Lake in Hoh Xil, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in 2011, the water area and level of the Salt Lake increased rapidly. The lake area expanding would accelerate the melting of permafrost and contribute to many severe environmental issues, including the surface deformation around the lake. In this article, we retrieve the deformation of the permafrost area around the Salt lake using the time-series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) method with ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A images from October 2006 to December 2018. In order to get more measurement points, the distributed scatterers were utilized. Moreover, a deformation model combining two components, long-term linear deformation related with temperature, was adopted in the InSAR processing. The experimental results show that before the outburst of the Zhuonai Lake, the ground deformation was not obvious with the mean deformation rate of -5 to 5 mm/year from the ENVISAT results. From 2014 to 2018, the ground deformation around the Salt Lake gradually increased with the maximum deformation rate over -25 mm/year. The water area and the water level of Salt Lake were extracted based on the SAR amplitude images and Cryosat-2 radar altimeter data, showing a rapid increasing trend after 2017. The time-series displacement in the south of lake shows a high correlation with the lake level history. This study clearly illustrate that time-series InSAR could provide valuable information for monitoring potential hazards in permafrost region.

AB  - Integrating non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expectedly an effective solution to enhance system's spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we investigate joint beamforming and power allocation for uplink NOMA transmission in an IRS-assisted cognitive satellite and terrestrial network operating at millimeter wave frequency band. Specifically, based only on imperfect channel state information in terms of the angular information of both primary users (PUs) and secondary users, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of the PUs in terrestrial network. To handle the resulting intractable optimization problem, we first transform the uncertainty channel vectors into a deterministic form with the aid of angular discretization. Then, by combining successive convex approximation with Taylor expansion and S-procedure methods, we propose an optimization scheme to jointly optimize the beamforming weight vector and power coefficients. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve outstanding sum rate performance compared to state-of-the-art schemes.

TI  - Multifault complex rupture and afterslip associated with the 2018 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.4 Hualien earthquake in northeastern Taiwan
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the coseismic and post-seismic deformation due to the 6 February 2018 M-w 6.4 Hualien earthquake to gain improved insights into the fault geometries and complex regional tectonics in this structural transition zone. We generate coseismic deformation fields using ascending and descending Sentinel-1A/B InSAR data and GPS data. Analysis of the aftershocks and InSAR measurements reveal complex multifault rupture during this event. We compare two fault model joint inversions of SAR, GPS and teleseismic body waves data to illuminate the involved seismogenic faults, coseismic slip distributions and rupture processes. Our preferred fault model suggests that both well-known active faults, the dominantly left-lateral Milun and Lingding faults, and previously unrecognized oblique-reverse west-dipping and north-dipping detachment faults, ruptured during this event. The maximum slip of similar to 1.6 m occurred on the Milun fault at a depth of similar to 2-5 km. We compute post-seismic displacement time series using the persistent scatterer method. The post-seismic range-change fields reveal large surface displacements mainly in the near-field of the Milun fault. Kinematic inversions constrained by cumulative InSAR displacements along two tracks indicate that the afterslip occurred on the Milun and Lingding faults and the west-dipping fault just to the east. The maximum cumulative afterslip of 0.4-0.6 m occurred along the Milun fault within similar to 7 months of the main shock. The main shock-induced static Coulomb stress changes may have played an important role in driving the afterslip adjacent to coseismic high-slip zones on the Milun, Lingding and west-dipping faults.

TI  - Surface Temperature Retrieval From Gaofen-5 Observation and its Validation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature (ST) plays a great role in urban heat island effect, environment monitoring, earth resources monitoring, and water balance at local and global scales. The Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF5) satellite can capture Earth's thermal infrared information for use in national high-resolution Earth observations. In this article, the nonlinear split-window algorithm and the refined generalized split-window method are used to retrieve sea surface temperature (SST) and land surface temperature (LST) from GF5 observations. For different atmospheric and surface conditions, the algorithm coefficients are calculated using a statistical regression method from the numerical values simulated with the atmospheric radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5.0. The simulation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) for SST and LST retrieval ranges from 0.09 K to 0.46 K and 0.19 K to 0.69 K, respectively, with increasing water vapor content (WVC). To validate the retrieved STs, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) STs extracted from the MYD11A1 product are used. Note that the RMSEs of both the LST and SST are less than 3.3 K. The RMSE for SST retrieval varies from 1.2 K to 1.45 K, with a mean value of 1.33 K; the RMSE for LST retrieval ranges from 1.57 K to 3.3 K, with a mean value of 2.41 K.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimization of regional land use structures and functions and the sustainable use of the ecological environment are very important in the process of urbanization. In this study, based on the Landsat 7+ETM images of Nanping City from 2015, the object-oriented land use classification method was used to calculate the value of ecosystem services in Nanping City and various counties (districts).The spatial distribution characteristics between the levels of population urbanization, spatial urbanization, economic urbanization, and living urbanization and the value of ecosystem services were quantitatively analyzed by utilizing spatial measurement methods. The impact of the levels of four types of urbanization on the spatial distribution of ecosystem services values was explored using the bivariate spatial autocorrelation method. The results showed that there was a significant negative spatial correlation between population urbanization and the total value of ecosystem services. Specifically, the negative correlation between population urbanization and food production services was the most significant. Additionally, there was a certain positive correlation between economic urbanization and waste disposal services. Further, the bivariate LISA figures between different urbanization levels and the values of ecosystem services showed that a high urbanization-low ecosystem services value (High-Low) appeared in Jian'ou and Shaowu, while the regions of Guangze and Shunchang reflected a low urbanization-high ecosystem services value (Low-High).The findings of this study can provide information for decision-making regarding the sensible use of regional land resources and the improvement of ecological and environmental quality.

TI  - Landscape Changes and Their Socio-Economic Driving Factors in Coastal Zone
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone is not only the most active natural area on the Earth's surface but also the area with the most superior resources and environmental conditions. The sustainable development of the coastal ecological environment is closely related to the survival and development of human beings. In recent centuries, the coastal landscape has undergone tremendous changes with a massive increase in human population in the coastal areas. Therefore, it is urgent to identify the specific driving factors that affect coastal landscape changes to achieve sustainable management of coastal landscapes. In this paper, the Ningde Coastal Zone in China is selected as a case study. The study focuses on the impact of socio-economic and policy factors on coastal landscape changes and identifies the differences in the impact of various socio-economic factors on coastal landscape changes based on remote sensing data and statistical data. The results show that population, economy, consumption, and technology are the main driving factors affecting coastal landscape changes. The ranking of the impact of these factors on the coastal zone follows the order population>economy>consumption>technology. The influence of these driving factors on coastal landscapes continues to increase. In addition to socio-economic driving factors, policies are also one of the driving factors affecting coastal landscape changes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 21st IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)

AB  - The satellite data transmission scheduling problem is, given a set of imaging satellites, ground stations, and observation targets in the scheduling scene, to study how to complete the satellite-constrained conflict adjustment and resource allocation and formulate reasonable satellite observation and receiving plans under the premise of limited satellite resource capacity and ground station resource capacity. The problem involves complex constraints, which are very difficult to solve, and it has been proven to be an NP-hard problem. The satellite data transmission scheduling optimization model was established based on studying the advantages and disadvantages of the existing satellite data transmission scheduling problem model. Combined with the characteristics of the satellite data transmission scheduling model, the method of assigning tasks to each satellite and the first-observe-then-transmit classification constraint processing model were adopted to reduce the mutual influence between the constraints and the difficulty of solving the problem. An improved local search algorithm with three pruning strategies was proposed. In order to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the model and algorithm, a data transmission scheduling scene and test example were constructed. The experimental results show that the improved local data search algorithm combined with the pruning strategy is better for soling the problem, and they provide guidance for practical engineering applications.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Due to far imaging distance and relatively harsh imaging conditions, the spatial resolution of remote sensing data are relatively low. Images/videos super-resolution is of great significance to effectively improve the spatial resolution and visual effect of remote sensing data. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based video super-resolution method for Jilin-1 remote sensing satellite. We use explicit motion compensation method by calculating the optical flow through the optical flow estimation network and compensating the motion of the image through warp operation. After obtaining the multi-frame images after motion compensation, it is necessary to use multi-frame image fusion for super-resolution reconstruction. We performed super-resolution experiments with scale factor 4 on Jilin-1 video dataset. In order to explore suitable fusion method, we compared two kinds of image fusion methods in the super-resolution network, i.e. concatenation by channel and 3D convolution, without motion compensation. Experimental results show that 3D convolution achieves better super-resolution performance, and video super-resolution result is better than the compared single image super-resolution method. We also performed experiments with motion compensation by optical flow estimation network. Experimental results show that the difference between the image after motion compensation and the reference frame becomes smaller. This indicates that the explicit motion compensation method can compensate the difference between the frames due to the target motion to a certain extent.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice with Satellite Remote Sensing: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Paddy rice is a staple food of three billion people in the world. Timely and accurate estimation of the paddy rice planting area and paddy rice yield can provide valuable information for the government, planners and decision makers to formulate policies. This article reviews the existing paddy rice mapping methods presented in the literature since 2010, classifies these methods, and analyzes and summarizes the basic principles, advantages and disadvantages of these methods. According to the data sources used, the methods are divided into three categories: (I) Optical mapping methods based on remote sensing; (II) Mapping methods based on microwave remote sensing; and (III) Mapping methods based on the integration of optical and microwave remote sensing. We found that the optical remote sensing data sources are mainly MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel-2, and the emergence of Sentinel-1 data has promoted research on radar mapping methods for paddy rice. Multisource data integration further enhances the accuracy of paddy rice mapping. The best methods are phenology algorithms, paddy rice mapping combined with machine learning, and multisource data integration. Innovative methods include the time series similarity method, threshold method combined with mathematical models, and object-oriented image classification. With the development of computer technology and the establishment of cloud computing platforms, opportunities are provided for obtaining large-scale high-resolution rice maps. Multisource data integration, paddy rice mapping under different planting systems and the connection with global changes are the focus of future development priorities.

TI  - Performance comparison among typical open global DEM datasets in the Fenhe River Basin of China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to compare the performance of typical open global DEM datasets by using the indexes of elevation error, relative error and hydrologic network. Taking Fenhe River Basin of China as the study area, this research made quantitative performance comparison among four typical open global DEM datasets including SRTM data with 1" (SRTM1) and 3" (SRTM3) resolutions, ASTER Global DEM data at the 2nd version (GDEM-v2) and ALOS World 3D-30 m (AW3D) data. Through process and selection, more than 80,000 ICESat/GLA14 points were used as the reference data, and the elevation error was computed and compared accordingly. Furthermore, relative error was analyzed using slope values, and false slope ratio index was computed and categorically compared. Finally, the hydrologic networks extracted from the four DEM datasets were compared to the reference hydrologic network acquired by visual interpretation from remote sensing images. The research results show that the AW3D has the best performance, which is approximate to but a little better than SRTM1. The performance of SRTM3 and GDEM-v2 is similar, which are much worse than that of AW3D and SRTM1, and the performance of GDEM-v2 is the worst of all.

TI  - Mapping Population Distribution Based on XGBoost Using Multisource Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping fine-scale distribution of the population is essential to the study of human activities, where more reliable open-access big data could be excavated with the help of machine learning models. However, the combination of multisource datasets and multidimensional features for population estimation was still unclear, and different models also needed comparison. Thus, in this study, related features from multisource data were first extracted, including building data, geographic big data, remote sensing data, and basic geographic data. Then, the effective indicators with higher contribution weight were selected from multisource data, which can reduce the noise and unstable model fitting. Finally, the population distribution map for 100-m grid was obtained in Shenzhen in 2019, and estimation results for five tree-based ensemble learning models were also compared at community scale, including random forest (RF), gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). Our results showed that: 1) building data and geographic big data could better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the population; 2) indicators selection could effectively improve the estimation accuracy of the population mapping; and 3) compared with other models, XGBoost had the largest R-2 (80%), the smallest RMSE, and MAE, the most percentage of accurate estimation communities (-0.3<RE<0.3, 65%), and a shorter train time. Therefore, XGBoost was chosen for mapping population distribution instead of GBDT, LightGBM, CatBoost, and RF. Our proposed method for population mapping can help to optimize the allocation of resources and guide a more scientific path for urban development.

AB  - Huge amounts of remote sensing data collected from hundreds of operational satellites in conjunction with on-demand UAV based imaging products are offering unprecedented capabilities towards monitoring dynamic earth resources. However, searching for the right combination of imagery products that satisfy an application requirement is a daunting task. Earlier efforts at streamlining remote sensing data discovery include NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS), USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis), and several other research systems like Minnesota MapServer. These systems were built on top of metadata harvesting, indexing, keyword searching modules which were not scalable and interoperable. To address these challenges, recently the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification was developed to provide a common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so that data products can be more easily indexed and discovered. In this paper we present an highly scalable STAC API based system with spatiotemporal indexing support. Experimental evaluation shows that our spatiotemporal indexing based queries are 1000x faster than standard STAC API server.

TI  - A Parallel Unmixing-Based Content Retrieval System for Distributed Hyperspectral Imagery Repository on Cloud Computing Platforms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the volume of remotely sensed data grows significantly, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) becomes increasingly important, especially for cloud computing platforms that facilitate processing and storing big data in a parallel and distributed way. This paper proposes a novel parallel CBIR system for hyperspectral image (HSI) repository on cloud computing platforms under the guide of unmixed spectral information, i.e., endmembers and their associated fractional abundances, to retrieve hyperspectral scenes. However, existing unmixing methods would suffer extremely high computational burden when extracting meta-data from large-scale HSI data. To address this limitation, we implement a distributed and parallel unmixing method that operates on cloud computing platforms in parallel for accelerating the unmixing processing flow. In addition, we implement a global standard distributed HSI repository equipped with a large spectral library in a software-as-a-service mode, providing users with HSI storage, management, and retrieval services through web interfaces. Furthermore, the parallel implementation of unmixing processing is incorporated into the CBIR system to establish the parallel unmixing-based content retrieval system. The performance of our proposed parallel CBIR system was verified in terms of both unmixing efficiency and accuracy.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS VI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments VI Part of SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In the context of global warming, the urban heat island (UHI) has become more and more serious, aggravating the severity of heat waves impacts, which not only cause pollution and increase energy consumption, but also pose a threat to human life and health.Many studies have shown that urban surfaces are warmer by absorbing more sun radiation than non-urban areas during the day and stay warm at night, which makes a larger UHI effect at night.Considering that urban surface characteristics are one of the main factors leading to UHI effect, it is necessary to study urban land surface temperature. Due to the lack of high-resolution nighttime remote sensing data, most of the studies on nighttime land surface temperature uses weather station data or Modis remote sensing images with a resolution of 1km, which cannot present more detailed urban climate behaviors, and there are certain limitations to urban climate research.Therefore, this paper aims to find a new approach to solve the problems existing in the traditional method and develop a new model to obtain a more accurate and higher resolution nighttime LST.In this paper, Landsat 8 daytime images (with spatial resolution of 30 square meters per pixel) will be used to build a night cooling model by means of multiple regression analysis in order to obtain the nighttime LST, and compare the day and night models to study the impact of UHI effects.The case study is Madrid Municipality (604.45 km(2), 3.3 million inhabitants).

TI  - Integrating Spectral Information and Meteorological Data to Monitor Wheat Yellow Rust at a Regional Scale: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat yellow rust has a severe impact on wheat production and threatens food security in China; as such, an effective monitoring method is necessary at the regional scale. We propose a model for yellow rust monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral images and a series of two-stage vegetation indices and meteorological data. Sensitive spectral vegetation indices (single- and two-stage indices) and meteorological features for wheat yellow rust discrimination were selected using the random forest method. Wheat yellow rust monitoring models were established using three different classification methods: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results show that models based on two-stage indices (i.e., those calculated using images from two different days) significantly outperform single-stage index models (i.e., those calculated using an image from a single day), the overall accuracy improved from 63.2% to 78.9%. The classification accuracies of models combining a vegetation index with meteorological feature are higher than those of pure vegetation index models. Among them, the model based on two-stage vegetation indices and meteorological features performs best, with a classification accuracy exceeding 73.7%. The SVM algorithm performed best for wheat yellow rust monitoring among the three algorithms; its classification accuracy (84.2%) was similar to 10.5% and 5.3% greater than those of LDA and ANN, respectively. Combined with crop growth and environmental information, our model has great potential for monitoring wheat yellow rust at a regional scale. Future work will focus on regional-scale monitoring and forecasting of crop disease.

TI  - Full Parameter Time Complexity (FPTC): A Method to Evaluate the Running Time of Machine Learning Classifiers for Land Use/Land Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In emergency responses to natural disasters, actionable information provided by remote sensing images is crucial to help emergencymanagers become aware of the situation and assess the magnitude of the damage. Without the accurate prediction of time consumption, choosing an algorithm for land use/land cover (LULC) classification under these emergency circumstances could be blind and subjective. Here, we proposed a full parameter time complexity (FPTC) analysis and the corresponding coefficient. to estimate the actual running time of the LULC classification without actually running the code. The FPTC of five general algorithms is derived in this article. After derivation, the FPTC of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is F(nv + nlog(2) u), the FPTC of logistic regression (LR) is F(Qm(2)vn), the FPTC of classification and regression tree (CART) is F((m+ 1)nvlog(2)n), the FPTC of random forest (RF) is F(s(m+ 1)nvlog(2)n), and the FPTC of support vector machine (SVM) is F(m(2)Qv (n + k)). The results show a strong linear relationship between the actual running time and FPTC [R-squared: kNN(0.991), LR(0.997), CART (0.999), RF (1.000), and SVM (0.999)], with different data size. The average root-mean-squared error between the real running time and the estimated running time is 3.34 s, which demonstrates the effectiveness of FPTC. Combining FPTCwith the corresponding coefficient., the running time of the classification can be precisely predicted, which will help emergency managers quickly choose algorithms in response to natural disasters with available remote sensing data and limited time.

TI  - A Dynamic-Data-Driven Method for Improving the Performance of Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the problem of receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is transformed into a modeling problem using dynamic data and an artificial neural network. A new RAIM method based on a probabilistic neural network (P-RAIM) is presented to improve integrity monitoring performance. Compared with existing RAIM methods, P-RAIM has a greater ability to meet the monitoring requirements for localizer performance with vertical guidance down to altitudes of 250 feet (LPV-250) in a single global navigation satellite system. First, by projecting the pseudorange error model from the measurement domain into the positioning domain through multiconvolution, patterns including a satellite fault pattern and a fault-free pattern are obtained based on variance inflation theory. Second, the P-RAIM model is proposed as a modified dynamic-data-driven probabilistic neural network with five layers; moreover, unique methods for training sample collection and integrity support are presented. Then, particle swarm optimization is applied to optimize a fitness function based on the false alarm probability and missed detection probability thereby improving the ability of P-RAIM to meet the LPV-250 requirements, including the false alarm probability, missed detection probability, vertical alarm limit and alarm time. Finally, utilizing real satellite data from a receiver located in Beijing to verify the effectiveness and universality of P-RAIM, evaluation experiments show that both the false alarm probability and missed detection probability can be effectively reduced to meet the LPV-250 requirements when the positioning bias is no less than 40 m. Compared with least-squares-residuals RAIM, P-RAIM can more easily detect potential faulty satellites in a single constellation.

CP  - 7th Symposium on Novel Photoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications
CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is a physical quantity that represents the change of surface reflection with the Sun and the direction of observation, which is of great significance to the study of surface anisotropic reflection characteristics. In this paper, based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) BRDF model parameters products (MCD43A1), we utilize the Ross-Li model to simulate the surface reflectance of the four land surface types in North China: vegetation, bare soil, cropland, and urban, and comparatively analyze the seasonal variation of their surface anisotropic reflection characteristics. Therefore, this study can provide reliable scientific basis for improving land surface process model, promoting surface-atmosphere interaction and global climate change research. The results show that: (1) The backscattering of the four land surface types is greater than the forward scattering, and the larger the scattering angle is, the larger the bidirectional reflectance will be. The distribution trend of bidirectional reflectance of different surface types is quite different in different bands and seasons. (2) The bidirectional reflectance of the four land surface types varies with the wavelength roughly the same in spring, summer, and autumn. In winter, due to snow covering the ground, the bidirectional reflectance of vegetation, cropland, and urban is higher in visible and near-infrared bands. Due to the fixed simulation angle, the distribution trend of the bidirectional reflectance of bare soil in four seasons is multi-peak in the multi-band range.

AB  - The article presents a view on the evolution of the protagonist's individuality in the first novel of the famous Irish writer interwoven with the creation of a unique personal world. The analysis conducted on the levels of narration, plot and composition, and ideas reveals the essential features of the artistic world. The main focus is on the specific structures and boundaries the central character destroys and his attempt to design an alternative Creation. As the hero growing up, the hostile environment of alien schools and cities is taking over the ideal macrocosm that appeared in his infantile consciousness, in the end swallowing his very home. Fighting the uncongenial world, the protagonist is trying vainly to expand the boundaries of his space and recapture the lost territory. He implements Art as a means of assembling, he strives to create a new beautiful Universe out of the surrounding hideous chaos, thus, foredoomed to wander lonely in the boundless vast of his imagination.

AB  - The comparative analysis of philosophical and mystical culture and the modem consumer society is realized in the article. The philosophical and mystical culture reveals the spiritual essence of man, develops awareness, willpower and the highest spiritual qualities of the personality. The society of consumption distorts the essence of man, develops over-consumption, consumerism, escapism, transmutes a person into a thing. Mankind is in a state of choice, at the point of bifurcation, which determines the future of civilization. The philosophical and mystical worldview underlies idealistic and ideational cultures, which should replace the modem sensual culture (the terms of P. Sorokin).

M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the study of traditional linguistic formulas in the folktales of Russkoye Ustye and the semantic-value space inherent in the Russian old residents' subdialects of Yakutia testifying to the figurative-speech stereotypes of linguistic culture. Presumably, since the beginning of the 17th century, Russian old residents have been compactly living in a foreign-language environment in the Arctic territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), the largest federal subject of the Russian Federation. The old residents are the oldest group of the Russian people in Siberia. The research is carried out based on folklore and dialectal linguistic material collected from representatives of the ethnos and reflected in the collection "Folklore of Russkoye Ustye". In the semantics of traditional linguistic formulas used in folk tales that have their original and individual form compared to other Siberian folktales, there is a close connection between the lexical meaning and the specific realities of the life of Russian old residents in Yakutia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of snow cover timing and duration over the Eurasian continent during 1966-2012
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing and duration of snow cover critically affect surface albedo, surface energy budgets, and hydrological processes. Previous studies using in-situ or satellite remote sensing data have mostly been site-specific (Siberia and the Tibetan Plateau), and remote sensing and/or modeling data include large uncertainties. Here, we used 1103 stations with long-term (1966-2012) ground-based snow measurements to investigate spatial and temporal variability in snow cover timing and duration and factors impacting those changes across the Eurasian continent. We found the earliest annual onset and latest disappearance of snow cover occurred along the Arctic coast, where the long-term (1971-2000) mean annual snow cover duration (SCD) was more than nine months which was the longest in this study. The shortest SCD, <= 10 days, was found in southern China. The first and last dates of snow cover (FD and LD, respectively), SCD, and the ratio of SCD to snow season length (RDL) were generally latitude dependent over the Eurasian Continent, while were elevation dependent on the Tibetan Plateau. During the period from 1966 through 2012, FD delayed and LD advanced by similar to 1 day/decade, and RDL increased by about 0.01/decade. The LD, SCD, and RDL anomalies (relative to the period 1971-2000) were also significantly correlated with latitude. Advances in LD and positive RDL were more significant in low-latitude regions, decreases in SCD were more significant in high-latitude regions. Changes in SCD were related to air temperature and snowfall in autumn and warming in spring. SCD specifically increased in the northern Xinjiang and northeastern China to increased snowfall. The significant reduction in SCD in southwestern Russia, the Tibetan Plateau and along the Yangtze River was mainly affected by climate warming. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Attention_FPNet: Two-Branch Remote Sensing Image Pansharpening Network Based on Attention Feature Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspired by the impressive achievements of convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks and the effective role of attention mechanisms, this article proposes a two-branch fusion network based on attention feature fusion (AFF) called Attention_FPNet to solve the pansharpening problem. We reconstruct the spatial information of the image in the high-pass filter domain and fully consider the spatial information in the multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images. At the same time, the input PAN image and the upsampled MS image are directly transmitted to the reconstructed image through a long skip connection. The spectral information of the PAN and MS images is considered to improve the spectral resolution of the fused image. It also supplements the loss of spatial information that may be caused by network deepening. Moreover, an AFF method is used to replace the existing simple channel concatenation method commonly used in pansharpening, which fully considers the relationship between different feature maps and improves the fusion quality. Through experiments on image datasets acquired by the Pleiades, SPOT-6 and Gaofen-2 satellites, the results show that this method can effectively fuse PAN and MS images and generate a fused image and outperforms existing methods.

TI  - Surface Skin Temperature and Its Trend Observations From IASI on Board MetOp Satellites
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global surface skin temperature has been retrieved from MetOp IASI ultraspectral infrared measurements over the past 13+ years. Monthly and spatially gridded surface skin temperature is produced to show some phenomena associated with its natural variability. This article has aimed to demonstrate that thermal infrared remote sensing data can be used for monitoring global surface environmental characteristics and associated change through the continuity observations of MetOp series. The time-series anomalies of surface skin temperature are used to estimate its associated trend. Error estimation and evaluation has been performed and discussed in order to understand the uncertainty and variability in the trends. The trends derived from IASI global surface skin temperatures are compared with those of the NASA GISS global surface air temperature. Despite the physical differences between surface skin and air temperatures, reasonable agreement is shown between these two datasets indicating consistency and global surface warming, achieving our core objective of investigating the surface skin temperature retrieved from MetOp satellites' measurements and associated trends. The inferred trend of IASI global surface skin temperature illustrates an approximate 0.037 +/- 0.002 K/yr. global average increase has occurred during the September 2007-present (November 2020) time period; this warming trend is more pronounced in the northern hemisphere.

TI  - Wildfire-Induced CO Plume Observations From NAST-I During the FIREX-AQ Field Campaign
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire influence on regional to global environments and air quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign was conducted during August 2019 to investigate the impact of wildfire and biomass smoke on air quality and weather in the continental United States. One of the campaign's scientific objectives was to estimate the composition of emissions from wildfires. Ultraspectrally resolved infrared radiance measurements from aircraft and/or satellite observations contain information on tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) as well as other trace species present in fire emissions. A methodology for retrieving tropospheric CO from such remotely sensed spectral data has been developed for the National Airborne Sounder Testbed-Interferometer (NAST-I) and is applied herein. Retrievals based on NAST-I measurements are used to demonstrate CO retrieval capability and characterize fire emissions. NAST-I remotely sensed CO from ER-2 flights are evaluated with concurrent in situ measurements from the differential absorption carbon monoxide measurements flown on the NASA DC-8 aircraft. Enhanced CO emissions along with plume evolution and transport from the fire ground site locations were captured by moderate vertical and high horizontal resolution observations obtained from the NAST-I IR spectrometer; these were intercompared and verified by the cloud physics lidar and the enhanced MODIS airborne simulator also hosted on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. This study will be beneficial to the science community for studying wildfire-related topics and understanding similar remotely sensed observations from satellites, along with helping to address the broader FIREX-AQ experiment objectives of investigating the impact of fires on air quality and climate.

TI  - A Large-Scale Mapping Scheme for Urban Building From Gaofen-2 Images Using Deep Learning and Hierarchical Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban buildings are essential components of cities and an indispensable source of urban geographic information. While there are many research efforts focused on urban buildings extraction, there are few studies on large-scale urban building mapping based on satellite images. In this research, a large-scale urban building mapping scheme based on Gaofen-2 satellite (GF-2) images is proposed based on a hierarchical approach. In this hierarchical approach, urban buildings are regarded as a mixture of dense low-rise buildings (DLBs) and sparse independent buildings (SIBs) stacked in space, which are extracted by a semantic segmentation model and an instance segmentationmodel, respectively. In this study, GF-2 images and OpenStreetMap data were used to extract DLB using U-2-Net with focal loss. GF-2 images were used to extract SIB using an improved CenterMask model with a deformable convolution network and a spatial coordinate attention module. The main urban area within the 5th ring road of Beijing was selected as the study area. With the trained model, the GF-2 image tiles of Beijing input into the models to first derive coarse maps of DLB and SIB. Postprocessing optimization was performed after combining the maps. The accuracy assessment shows that the overall accuracy of large-scale urban building mapping using the hierarchical approach proposed in this article reaches 91.5%, which is 4.8% higher than that with a traditional method. Overall, the hierarchical approach proposed in this article is effective in large-scale urban building mapping and provides new application opportunities.

TI  - Two Young Planetary Systems around Field Stars with Ages between 20 and 320 Myr from TESS
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Planets around young stars trace the early evolution of planetary systems. We report the discovery and validation of two planetary systems with ages less than or similar to 300Myr from observations by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The 40-320 Myr old G star TOI-251 hosts a -+2.74(-0.18)(+0.18) R-circle plus mini-Neptune with a 4.94 day period. The 20-160 Myr old K star TOI-942 hosts a system of inflated Neptune-sized planets, with TOI-942b orbiting in a period of 4.32 days with a radius of +4.81(-0.20)(+0.20) R-circle plus and TOI-942c orbiting in a period of 10.16 days with a radius of +5.79(-0.18)(+0.19) R-circle plus. Though we cannot place either host star into a known stellar association or cluster, we can estimate their ages via their photometric and spectroscopic properties. Both stars exhibit significant photometric variability due to spot modulation, with measured rotation periods of similar to 3.5 days. These stars also exhibit significant chromospheric activity, with age estimates from the chromospheric calcium emission lines and X-ray fluxes matching that estimated from gyrochronology. Both stars also exhibit significant lithium absorption, similar in equivalent width to well-characterized young cluster members. TESS has the potential to deliver a population of young planet-bearing field stars, contributing significantly to tracing the properties of planets as a function of their age.

TI  - Wetland Classification in Poyang Lake Using Dual-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar Data with Feature Combination
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dual-polarized Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which performs C-band SAR imaging day and night regardless of the weather, offers new opportunities for wetland cover monitoring in regions frequently covered by cloud. In this study, a decision tree (DT) classifier was applied to investigate the utility of Sentinel-1 for wetland classification in Poyang Lake, China. Six land cover classes were identified: water body, bare land, aquatic vegetation, cropland, forest, and urban area surrounding the lake. Two types of features were extracted from the dual-polarized SAR data, namely, the backscattering coefficients and the polarimetric decomposition components. Then, the DT classifier was trained and applied with backscattering features, polarimetric features, or a combination of the two features. The overall accuracy of all the classifiers was over 90% for the different feature combinations (98.02, 90.63, and 98.59%) for the classes in the lake area, compared with less than 78% (74.84, 63.01, and 77.29%) when the classes surrounding the lake were also considered, which demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data for wetland monitoring. The accuracy of different feature combinations increased in the following order: polarimetric features < backscattering features < combination of polarimetric and backscattering features. The artificial neural network, naive Bayes, random forest, and adaptive boost algorithms were compared for the case of using backscattering features, and the adaptive boost algorithm showed lower performance than the other three algorithms.

TI  - Multi-Modality Translation from SAR Image to Optical Image for Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - 2021 7TH ASIA-PACIFIC CONFERENCE ON SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (APSAR)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an indispensable remote sensing technology nowadays. However, compared to conventional optical imageries, SAR images have significant drawbacks in human interpretation, especially for those without expert knowledge. In this paper, we explore a new method to enhance the human interpretation for raw SAR imageries by turning SAR data into readable optical imageries through a multi-modality translation procedure based on a deep neural network that consists of a novel two-step architecture. To illustrate the concept, remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 is used for training and validation. The results show significant improvement in ease of interpretation from the original SAR images with clear views of different land covers such as fields, water, highways, and etc. The statistical performance of SSIM and PSNR has achieved 0.42 and 19.10 dB respectively, indicating a promising translation quality.

TI  - PGMAN: An Unsupervised Generative Multiadversarial Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening aims at fusing a low-resolution multispectral (MS) image and a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image acquired by a satellite to generate an HR MS image. Many deep learning based methods have been developed in the past few years. However, since there are no intended HR MS images as references for learning, almost all of the existing methods downsample the MS and PAN images and regard the original MS images as targets to form a supervised setting for training. These methods may perform well on the down-scaled images; however, they generalize poorly to the full-resolution images. To conquer this problem, we design an unsupervised framework that is able to learn directly from the full-resolution images without any preprocessing. The model is built based on a novel generative multiadversarial network. We use a two-stream generator to extract the modality-specific features from the PAN and MS images, respectively, and develop a dual discriminator to preserve the spectral and spatial information of the inputs when performing fusion. Furthermore, a novel loss function is introduced to facilitate training under the unsupervised setting. Experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 images demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain much better fusion results on the full-resolution images. Code is available. [Online]. Available: https://github.com/zhysora/PGMAN.

TI  - Characterizing vegetation response to rainfall at multiple temporal scales in the Sahel-Sudano-Guinean region using transfer function analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall is a key driver of terrestrial vegetation. Clarifying the response mechanism of vegetation to rainfall can advance the understanding of expected changes in ecosystems under projected rainfall scenarios. Besides the rainfall amount over a period of time, the frequency, duration and intensity are of importance in driving ecosystem processes. The pulsating nature of rainfall forcing and of vegetation response applies particularly to arid and semi - arid regions and led to conceptualize the "pulse-reserve" paradigm, which we used to explain the approach we propose in this study. We introduce the Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) method in the frequency domain to capture the response of vegetation to rainfall at multiple temporal scales. The TFA method determines coherence, gain, and phase to characterize the existence, strength, and time-lag, respectively, of the vegetation response to rainfall at different temporal scales. Specifically, the coherence measures the existence of the response and only with a significant response are the gain and phase values significant and valuable for further analysis. The gain measures the strength of the relationship between fluctuations in vegetation growth and fluctuations in rainfall, while the phase value (i.e. the time-lag) measures how fluctuations in vegetation growth lag (or lead) fluctuations in rainfall. The TFA method was applied to the 34-years (1982-2015) NDVI3g and CHIRPS precipitation dataset in the Sahel-Sudano-Guinean region (20 degrees W similar to 60 degrees E, 0-25 degrees E). The Sahelian zone was characterized by a significant vegetation response to rainfall across all interand intraannual time-scales, while the Sudano-Guinean zone was dominated by significant response at annual or 6-month scales. The negative phase lag indicated that rainfall variation normally led NDVI change for most areas and across timescales. However, a positive phase observed in part of the tropical rainforest area indicated that NDVI changes led rainfall variations, which may be caused by the strong vegetation-rainfall feedback through recycling of precipitation by evapotranspiration. In summary, these results suggested that the TFA method is a powerful tool to quantify the vegetation-rainfall response regime across a range of timescales, as conceptualized by the "pulse reserve" paradigm. Unraveling the response of fluctuations in vegetation growth to separate components of the forcing by precipitation might improve our understanding of environmental change in the past decades in the Sahel - Sudan - Guinean region.

AB  - During the past few decades, there has been an increase in the number of coastal land reclamation projects for residential, commercial and industrial purposes in more and more coastal cities of China, which led to the destruction of the wetlands and loss of the sensitive marine habitats. Meanwhile, the influences and nature of these projects attract widespread public and academic concern. For identifying the trend of landscape (esp. Coastal reclamation) and ecological environment changes, understanding of which interacted, and offering a general science for development of regional plans. In paper, a case study was carried out in Bohai Bay area, based on the analysis of remote sensing data. Landuse maps were created for 1954, 1970, 1981, 1990, 2000 and 2010. Landscape metrics were calculated and illustrated that the degree of reclamation changes were linked to the hydrodynamic environment and macrobenthos community. The results indicated that the worst of the loss of initial areas occurred during 1954-1970, with 65.6% lost mostly to salt field; to 2010, Coastal reclamation area increased more than 200km2 as artificial landscape. In Bohai Bay, for one thing, the numerical simulation of tidal current field in 2003 and 2010 respectively showed that the flow velocity in offshore became faster (from 2-5 cm/s to 10-20 cm/s), the flow direction seem to go astray and it was not conducive to the spread of pollutants and degradation, due to the significant changes of coastline; For another, the analysis of the dominant macobenthos from 1958 to 2012 showed that Musculus senhousei (Benson, 1842) as a disturbance tolerant species spread very fast and had been the predominant species in the recent years.

TI  - Sensitivity of six typical spatiotemporal fusion methods to different influential factors: A comparative study for a normalized difference vegetation index time series reconstruction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dozens of spatiotemporal fusion methods have been developed to reconstruct vegetation index time-series data with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage for monitoring land surface dynamics. Although several studies comparing the different fusion methods have been conducted, selecting the suitable fusion methods is still challenging, as inevitable influential factors tend to be neglected. To address this problem, this study compared six typical spatiotemporal fusion methods, including the Unmixing-Based Data Fusion (UBDF), Linear Mixing Growth Model (LMGM), Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation), One Pair Dictionary-Learning method (OPDL), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), based on simulation experiments and theoretical analysis considering three influential factors between sensors: geometric misregistration, radiometric inconsistency, and spatial resolution ratio. The results indicate that Fit-FC achieved the best performance with the strongest tolerance to geometric misregistration when radiometric inconsistency was negligible; thus, it is the first recommended algorithm for blending normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) imagery. Instead, the FSDAF could generate the best results if radiometric inconsistency was non-negligible. These findings could help users determine the method that is appropriate for different remote sensing datasets, and provide guidelines for developers in the future development of novel methods.

TI  - Preoperative Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) Combined with <SUP>125</SUP>I Seeds Localization in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) technology in predicting axillary lymph nodes status before surgery, and to explore the feasibility of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) localization guided by CEUS combined with I-125 implantation for breast cancer.Methods: From August 2017 to February 2019, 115 patients were included in this prospective study. Before surgery, a microbubble (SonoVue) was injected intradermally next to the areola. The enhancement patterns of SLNs were recorded and I-125 seeds were deployed into the enhanced nodes. Then, all patients underwent standard sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and all I-125 seeds were found out guided by a gamma detector in surgery. The localization was considered successful if I-125 seeds were implanted in/beside the nodes.Results: SLNs in 103 cases were successfully identified, the success rate was 89.6% (103/115), 118 SLNs were detected in total. I-125 seeds were deployed successfully in 99 cases, and all of the I-125-labeled SLNs were then successfully detected by combined method (radionuclides and blue dye). The accuracy of I-125 seeds localization was 96.1% (99/103). Based on the enhancement patterns recorded, 34 cases were predicted to have SLNs metastasis (metastasis in 27 cases and no metastasis in 7 cases confirmed by postoperative pathology) and 65 cases were predicted to have no SLNs metastasis (metastasis in 5 cases and no metastasis in 60 cases by pathology). The positive predictive value and negtive predictive value of CEUS in assessing axillary status were 79.4% (27/34) and 92.3% (60/65), respectively. The axillary metastasis rate in CEUS combined with I-125 seeds localization was 27.3% (27/99), while the metastasis rate in the combined method of SLNB was 32.3% (32/99). The sensitivity of I-125 seeds localization was 84.4% (27/32), the false-negative rate was 15.6% (5/32), and the consistency evaluation was excellent (Kappa value=0.880, P<0.001).Conclusion: CEUS combined with I-125 seeds implantation can locate SLNs accurately and has excellent consistency with the combined method. The enhancement patterns can provide helpful predicting information of axillary status preoperatively. However, more studies are needed to be carried out to verify our outcomes and explore the feasibility of applying CEUS technology in clinical work.

TI  - Seasonal Cropland Trends and Their Nexus with Agrometeorological Parameters in the Indus River Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine-scale insights of existing cropland trends and their nexus with agrometeorological parameters are of paramount importance in assessing future food security risks and analyzing adaptation options under climate change. This study has analyzed the seasonal cropland trends in the Indus River Plain (IRP), using multi-year remote sensing data. A combination of Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall test was used to quantify the existing cropland trends. A correlation analysis between enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and 9 agrometeorological parameters, derived from reanalysis and remote sensing data, was conducted to study the region's cropland-climate nexus. The seasonal trend analysis revealed that more than 50% of cropland in IRP improved significantly from the year 2003 to 2018. The lower reaches of the IRP had the highest fraction of cropland, showing a significant decreasing trend during the study period. The nexus analysis showed a strong correlation of EVI with the evaporative stress index (ESI) during the water-stressed crop season. Simultaneously, it exhibited substantial nexus of EVI with actual evapotranspiration (AET) during high soil moisture crop season. Temperature and solar radiation had a negative linkage with EVI response. In contrast, a positive correlation of rainfall with EVI trends was spatially limited to the IRP's upstream areas. The relative humidity had a spatially broad positive correlation with EVI compare to other direct climatic parameters. The study concluded that positive and sustainable growth in IRP croplands could be achieved through effective agriculture policies to address spatiotemporal AET anomalies.

AB  - The Feng Yun-4 satellite (FY-4) is a new generation of meteorological satellite developed independently by China, which will greatly improve the capability of meteorological monitoring and forecasting. Millimeter and Sub-millimeter Sounding/Imager (MMSI) is an important payload it carries. To carry out the lunar calibration of FY-4, the inversion of the main metallic substance content of the lunar surface based on the data from the U.S. Clementine satellite is used to obtain the dielectric constant distribution. Then the lunar surface brightness temperature (TB) radiation model is established by combining the basic lunar regolith parameters. The accuracy and reliability of the method are verified using Chang'e-2(CE-2) MRM data. Finally, the radiation TB distribution of FY-4 MMSI terahertz band in the lunar equatorial region is simulated, which can provide experience for future geostationary satellite satellite-based sounder lunar calibration work.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-4/IRS Based on MODIS Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-4 (GF-4) infrared spectrum (IRS) camera has a special spectral band located in the mid-wave infrared spectrum with the wavelength ranging from 3.50 to 4.10 mu m. It is very important for forest fire-detection and other quantitative remote sensing applications at a high spatial resolution of 400 m. Due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics, the thermal emissive band 20 (3.660-3.840 mu m) and 22 (3.929-3.989 mu m) of medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) are taken as the reference bands for the radiometric cross-calibration of the GF-4/IRS camera. The time difference between selected GF-4/IRS and MODIS images at the Qinghai Lake and Se lincuo Lake test sites is less than one hour. After spatial matching, single-band and dual-band spectral matching methods are proposed in this article. Then, the DN value of GF-4 image is linearly fitted to the radiance of the corresponding MODIS image to obtain the radiometric calibration coefficients of GF-4/IRS camera. The validation results show that the cross-calibration coefficients calculated by integrating the measurement of two MODIS bands with the mean value spectral matching approach has the highest radiometric calibration consistency with the official calibration coefficients.

TI  - Assessments of trophic state in lakes and reservoirs of Wuhan using Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of economy, many lakes in Wuhan have been polluted to different degrees and suffer from eutrophication. The main objective of this study was to conduct the monthly trophic state assessments of waters in Wuhan from March 2019 to June 2020 using 111 Sentinel-2 images. The Forel-Ule index (FUI) and empirical Gaussian process regression (GPR) were, respectively, applied to obtain monthly area percentage (AP) of waters with each trophic state. Both FUI-derived and empirical GPR-retrieved results showed that majority of water bodies (>90%) in Wuhan were in mesotrophic and eutrophic states. The GPR-retrieved results based on FUI-derived water types were more reliable than the retrieval without classification, which reduced RMSE of trophic-level index (TLI) from 9.2 to 5.8, and MAPE from 14% to 9% (N = 213). Severe eutrophication occurred in the summer and early autumn (June-October). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that temperature and wind speed were the two most important meteorological factors influencing eutrophication variability: the temperature accounted for 63% and 55% dynamic eutrophication from FUI-derived and GPR-retrieved results, respectively; the wind speed explained 44% and 52% variability of FUI-derived and GPR-retrieved results.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has all-weather, all-weather remote sensing data acquisition capabilities, and it has been widely used in map surveying, disaster management and other fields. Aiming at the high-speed mobile flight platform this paper derives the two-dimensional spectrum of the echo, and obtains the method of compensating the three-direction velocity and acceleration of the platform in the two-dimensional frequency domain. For large squint situations, we makes improvements on the basis of the traditional spotlight beam domain algorithm. In large squint situations, it solves many problems caused by three-dimensional acceleration and satisfies high resolution imaging requirements. Then, a simulation is carried out and the simulation results of several algorithms are compared. It is found that in an ideal environment, the several algorithms mentioned in this article can image clearly, but in a complex environment, the imaging results of traditional algorithms will be severely blurred, and in small In the case of oblique viewing angles, the two algorithms proposed in this article can focus imaging. In the case of large squint angles, the imaging quality parameters of the second algorithm proposed meet the standards of clear imaging. which proves that in the complex high-speed mobile environment. The algorithm has greater superiority compared with other algorithms.

TI  - A Parcel-Based Deep-Learning Classification to Map Local Climate Zones From Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climate zones (LCZ) describe urban surface structures, supporting studies of urban heat islands, sustainable urbanization, and energy balance. The existing studies mapped LCZs from satellite images using scene-based classification, which trained deep-learning classifiers by labeled image patches, segmented satellite images into patches by sliding windows to match the size of training data, and finally classified the segmented patches to obtain LCZ maps. However, sliding windows are different from the real footprints of LCZs, which leads to large errors in classification. To address this problem, this article proposes a parcel-based method for LCZ classification using Sentinel-2 images, road networks, and elevation data. First, the Sentinel-2 images are segmented by the road network to obtain the land parcels as classification units. Second, each image parcel is standardized to match the training dataset, So2Sat LCZ42. Third, the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify the standardized parcels into LCZs. Finally, the building height information derived from elevation data is used to refine the LCZs by a rule-based classifier. The results of the four test sites show that the overall accuracy of our method is 0.75, higher than the sliding-window-based method's accuracy of 0.47. Additional simulation experiments demonstrated that parcels derived from road networks can reduce the mixture effect in image patches, and parcel standardization can ensure the transferability of the CNN model trained by regular image patches. Considering that the road network and elevation data are widely available, the proposed method has the potential of mapping LCZs in large areas.

CP  - 16th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)
CL  - Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - New commercial satellites in orbit such as GeoEye-1, WorldView-3, and PlanetLabs can provide and update very high resolution (VHR) images of the Earth surface frequently. Such VHR satellite images contain a lot of fine spatial details and texture information, which pose challenges to existing cloud detection techniques. To avoid high demand for computing resource and over dependence on spectra, a bilateral texture filtering based cloud detection method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the proposed method builds a significance map to divide the input image into noncloud regions and candidate cloud regions. Secondly, an optimal thresholding is calculated and used on the significance map to get a coarse result of detection. Then, the multiscale BTF is employed to capture the accurate detail map of the input image to remove the noncloud regions in the coarse result of detection. The final binary result is obtained by erode, dilate and guided feathering processes. The experiment is carried out on two sets of VHR satellite images. Subjective analysis and objective evaluations show that the proposed method works well for RGB color and grayscale images. It can produce high accuracy cloud detection results and outperforms some existing traditional methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest freshwater Lake in China, Poyang Lake plays an important role in regulating the water level of Yangtze River and maintaining the ecological balance of surrounding areas. Therefore, this study utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) geospatial technology to acquire 124 remotely sensed images to explore the spatial and temporal changes of the four seasons of Poyang Lake from 1987 to 2019. The official statistics from relevant cities are used to quantitatively reveal the main driving factors of water body changes in Poyang Lake. Temporally, the water body area of Poyang Lake shows an obvious downward trend in general. Spatially, the water body area of Poyang Lake shows a gradual decrease from the center of the lake to the surroundings. In 1987-1998, the water body area of Poyang Lake showed an increasing trend, with an increase of about 727.90km(2). From 1998 to 2006, the water body area of Poyang Lake mainly showed a decreasing trend, with a decrease of 401.58km(2). The water body area of Poyang Lake increased slowly during 2006-2017. Anthropogenic factors and natural factors have influenced the changes in water body area of Poyang Lake to a certain extent. This study can provide valuable supporting data for the comprehensive environmental management and flood hazard monitoring of Poyang Lake.

TI  - Quantitative assessment to the impact of InSAR ionospheric and tropospheric corrections on source parameter modelling: application to the 4th nuclear test, North Korea
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many studies have revealed that the atmospheric effects of electromagnetic wave propagation (including ionospheric and tropospheric water vapour) have serious impacts on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurement results, atmospheric corrections have not been thoroughly and comprehensively investigated in many well-known cases of InSAR focal mechanism solutions, which means there is no consensus on whether atmospheric effects will affect the InSAR focal mechanism solution. Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative assessment on how much the atmospheric effect affects the InSAR focal mechanism solution. In this paper, we emphasized that it was particularly important to assess the impact of InSAR ionospheric and tropospheric corrections on the underground nuclear explosion modelling quantitatively. Therefore, we investigated the 4th North Korea (NKT-4) underground nuclear test using ALOS-2 liters-band SAR images. Because the process of the underground nuclear explosion was similar to the volcanic magma source activity, we modelled the ground displacement using the Mogi model. Both the ionospheric and tropospheric phase delays in the interferograms were investigated. Furthermore, we studied how the ionosphere and troposphere phase delays could bias the estimation of Mogi source parameters. The following conclusions were drawn from our case study: the ionospheric delay correction effectively mitigated the long-scale phase ramp in the full-frame interferogram, the standard deviation decreased from 1.83 to 0.85 cm compared to the uncorrected interferogram. The uncorrected estimations of yield and depth were 8.44 kt and 370.33 m, respectively. Compared to the uncorrected estimations, the ionospheric correction increased the estimation of yield and depth to 9.43 kt and 385.48 m, while the tropospheric correction slightly raised them to 8.78 kt and 377.24 m. There were no obvious differences in the location estimations among the four interferograms. When both corrections were applied, the overall standard deviation was 1.16 cm, which was even larger than the ionospheric corrected interferogram. We reported the source characteristics of NKT-4 based on the modelling results derived from the ionospheric corrected interferogram. The preferred estimation of NKT-4 was a Mogi source located at 129 degrees 04' 22.35`E, 41. 17'54.57'' N buried at 385.48 m depth. The cavity radius caused by the underground explosion was 22.66 m. We reported the yield estimation to be 9.43 kt. This study showed that for large-scale natural deformation sources such as volcanoes and earthquakes, atmospheric corrections would be more significant, but even if the atmospheric signal did not have much complexity, the corrections should not be ignored.

AB  - Recently, an automatic atmospheric radiation absorption parameterization scheme based on correlated k-distribution (CKD) has been proposed, namely, the finding point method (FPM). The FPM can avoid errors caused by manual operation and has higher accuracy when compared with other common CKD methods. In this paper, FPM is applied to the satellite brightness temperature simulation. In the simulation of the Fengyun 4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), the root mean square errors (RMSE) of FPM in the brightness temperature simulation of the six infrared channels when compared with the standard result from the line-by-line integration are 0.1103, 0.2128, and 0.0459, 0.0266, 0.0328, and 0.1742K, respectively, while the RMSE of Radiative Transfer for the Television Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV) are 1.0879, 0.1120, 0.2204, 0.1567, 0.1164, and 0.3256K, respectively. Therefore, FPM can achieve very good accuracy in satellite infrared remote sensing.

TI  - THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND THE LATE QING CHINESE COSMOPOLITANISM
T2  - COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines a specific set of literary texts, both in English and Chinese, produced by a few Chinatown leaders and some Chinese writers as they protested against the anti-Chinese sentiments and the Chinese Exclusion Act in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century. Those Chinese-authored texts resisted the homogenizing view of the Chinese people by the Westerners, advocating a cosmopolitan class above race, and used commercial amity to assert the Chinese people's cosmopolitan right. The moral compass of the Chinese merchants in those literary stories also puts forward an alternative model of global capitalism that evolved from the traditional Chinese idea of tianxia. Reading these texts can help us build a more historicized view of Chineseness and the Chinese worldview prior to the rise of state-centered nationalisms in modern China, on the one hand, and understand the epistemological framework and limit of modern nationalisms, on the other.

TI  - Coupled and continuous estimation of soil moisture and evaporative fraction within the remotely sensed surface temperature-vegetation index framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have focused on the retrieval of soil moisture (SM) and evaporative fraction (EF) based on the surface temperature-vegetation index (TVX) framework. However, few literatures have investigated whether these two variables can be retrieved simultaneously under the same TVX framework. Besides, most previous studies only demonstrated the application of the TVX framework under clear sky conditions. The estimation of SM and EF under partially cloudy conditions is still a challenging task. The main motivation for this study is to develop an observation-driven optimization framework combined with TVX method for coupled and continuous estimation of SM and EF. Specifically, the optimization scheme was designed to construct the constraints and objective functions of the TVX framework at seasonal scale. In-situ SM and EF measurements were utilized to calibrate the theoretical boundaries of the TVX framework, respectively. The applicability of this new scheme was demonstrated over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States of America in the year 2005 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The comparisons between present method and previous traditional TVX models indicate that the accuracy of the optimization scheme produced using only one site for calibration has reached a comparable level over the whole study domain. However, the new scheme holds unique advantages in simplicity and continuity. It has not only circumvented the complex parameterization scheme of theoretical TVX framework, but also achieved estimation of SM and EF under partially cloudy conditions. The validation results of SM estimates show that the absolute value of correlation coefficient (r) under clear and partially cloudy sky conditions was 0.51 and 0.43, respectively. The validation results of EF estimates indicate that the r and root mean square error (RMSE) under clear sky conditions was 0.70 and 0.163. In contrast, the r and RMSE under partially cloudy conditions was 0.66 and 0.158. In addition, the coupled estimation of SM and EF means that these two objective variables can be interconverted into each other within the optimization framework. Thus either SM or EF can be used to calibrate the theoretical dry edge that applies to the estimation of both variables.

TI  - Stochastic Delay Analysis for Satellite Data Relay Networks With Heterogeneous Traffic and Transmission Links
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite data relay networks (SDRNs) hold great promise in 6G communications for the timely offloading of the global traffic. Since the delay performance is regarded as one of the most important metrics reflecting the offloading efficiency, studying its relationship with network parameters becomes really essential to the development and application of the SDRN. However, the complex data offloading process and heterogeneity of traffic arrivals and transmission links pose many challenges to the stochastic delay analysis. To accurately model the data offloading process in SDRNs, we build a series-parallel queuing model with through and cross traffic while considering the propagation delay. On this basis, we respectively propose a propagation delay embedded min-plus convolution method based on stochastic network calculus and a Markov chain method based on Monte Carlo to depict the leftover services of the heterogeneous links received by the per-flow traffic in an aggregate. To eliminate the impacts of the heterogeneity, we uniformly characterize the arrivals and leftover services by their moment generating functions (MGFs) which contain the full moment information, and shield the heterogeneity by deriving the envelopes of the arrivals and leftover services with the help of MGFs, Chernoff bound and union bound. Then, in the light of the geometric relationship between the envelopes of the arrivals and leftover services, we analyze the upper bounds of the stochastic delay, which provides the guidance to the network configuration. Eventually, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and further reveal maximum four times the delay difference between the heterogeneous links influenced by traffic type, burstiness, and access number.

TI  - Multitemporal Relearning With Convolutional LSTM Models for Land Use Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present a novel hybrid framework, which integrates spatial-temporal semantic segmentation with postclassification relearning, for multitemporal land use and land cover (LULC) classification based on very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. To efficiently obtain optimal multitemporal LULC classification maps, the hybrid framework utilizes a spatial-temporal semantic segmentation model to harness temporal dependency for extracting high-level spatial-temporal features. In addition, the principle of postclassification relearning is adopted to efficiently optimize model output. Thereby, the initial outcome of a semantic segmentation model is provided to a subsequent model via an extended input space to guide the learning of discriminative feature representations in an end-to-end fashion. Last, object-based voting is coupled with postclassification relearning for coping with the high intraclass and low interclass variances. The framework was tested with two different postclassification relearning strategies (i.e., pixel-based relearning and object-based relearning) and three convolutional neural network models, i.e., UNet, a simple Convolutional LSTM, and a UNet Convolutional-LSTM. The experiments were conducted on two datasets with LULC labels that contain rich semantic information and variant building morphologic features (e.g., informal settlements). Each dataset contains four time steps from WorldView-2 and Quickbird imagery. The experimental results unambiguously underline that the proposed framework is efficient in terms of classifying complex LULC maps with multitemporal VHR images.

TI  - The Detecting of Irrigated Croplands Changes in 1987-2015 in Zhangjiakou
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of irrigated and rained croplands has a large impact on agricultural production and ecological systems. Zhangjiakou, which is the water conservation area of Jing-jin-ji agglomeration and the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, has large irrigated croplands and a fragile ecological environment. The methods of sample selection based on spectral analysis and partitioned extraction of irrigated croplands were proposed with medium-high-resolution images, then the spatiotemporal changes of irrigated and rainfed croplands were explored in Zhangjiakou. The growing season time series curves of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) based on Landsat images were employed to distinguish irrigated and rainfed croplands in 1987, 2000, and 2015. Through transfer matrix analysis of the three stages of classification results, it was found that the irrigated croplands of Bashang, a semi-arid region, increased sharply (66025 hectares, 7.55%), while the irrigated croplands of Baxia, a mountainous region with small basins and plains, decreased slightly (-8239 hectares, -0.60%). From the perspective of temporal changes, irrigated croplands grew rapidly in the early stage and slowly decline in the later stage, peaking at 377,117 hectares in 2000. According to the analysis, the decline of irrigated croplands was due to a project employed to quit irrigation and return to drought, and further analyses should be conducted in order to realize the rational utilization of water resources and guarantee ecological security. This paper is helpful in supporting extraction methods of irrigated croplands for semi-dry and arid areas, especially when historical samples are lacking. It is also helpful for policy adjustments of agricultural structure of Zhangjiakou and other similar areas.

TI  - Determining AHI Cloud-Top Phase and Intercomparisons With MODIS Products Over North Pacific
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developed here is an algorithm for determining the infrared (IR) cloud-top phase for advanced Himawari imager (AHI) measurements from the Japanese geostationary satellite Himawari-8. The tests and decision tree used in the AHI algorithm are different from those in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-2 cloud product algorithm. Verification of AHI cloud-top phase results with the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with orthogonal polarization product over a four-month period from March to June of 2017 over the North Pacific gives hit rates of 80.20 (66.33) and 86.51 (80.61) for liquid-water and randomly oriented-ice cloud tops, respectively, if clear-sky pixels are excluded (included) from the statistics. Also made are intercomparisons between AHI and MODIS IR cloud-top phase products over the North Pacific in June 2017. AHI liquid-water-phase determinations agree with MODIS liquid-water-phase determinations at an agreement rate of 83.68, showing a dependence on MODIS zenith angles. The agreement rate of ice phase classifications between AHI and MODIS is 93.54. The MODIS IR product contains some unreasonable ice-phase pixels over oceans, as well as uncertain-phase pixels over land, and has limitations for daytime liquid-water-phase identifications over the Indo-China Peninsula. Limitations of the AHI cloud-top phase algorithm are mainly caused by difficulties in identifying liquid-water-phase clouds over sun-glint regions and during twilight.

TI  - OXYMORON AS A TRANSLATION TOOL AND A FORM OF CULTURAL TRANSLATION (ON THE EXAMPLE OF SILVER AGE POETRY)
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article shows the role of the oxymoron as a tool for transmitting stylistic means using the example of silver age poetry translations. An analysis of the functions of the "oxymoron" is given to justify the the actual methods of transmitting the "oxymoron" into English based on the authors ' own translations. It is shown that the" oxymoron "in most cases can be transmitted by "calking", sometimes using the "adding" technique, which is also used when translating an entire line to preserve the rhythm, rhyme and melody of the context. Through the analysis of the translation material, its stylistic richness and features of the language transfer of meanings, it is proved that the oxymoron is a form of cultural translation, through which an effective literary and intercultural dialogue is possible.

M3  - Article
AB  - The results of statistical simulation of intensity of transmitted solar radiation in the presence of optically thin cirrus clouds for two sensing geometries: in solar almucantar and hybrid scan (AERONET photometric network) are considered. Numerical experiments were performed using ice crystal cloud models: OPAC (hexagonal particles with a smooth surface) and a model proposed by Baum et al. (a mixture of particles with different shapes, hexagonal columns and aggregates of hexagonal columns with a very rough surface). The effects of shape and size of ice crystals on the angular distributions of downward radiation in the wavelength channels of 440 and 870 nm are estimated for background atmospheric situations observed in Tomsk in the summer period.

TI  - Thin Cloud Removal for Multispectral Remote Sensing Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks Combined With an Imaging Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing images are often degraded by clouds, resulting in the reduced efficiency and accuracy of image interpretation. Thin cloud removal is one of the most important and significant tasks for optical multispectral images. In this article, we propose a novel thin cloud removal method for multispectral images, which is a combination of traditional methods and deep learning methods. First, we adopt U-Net to estimate the reference thin cloud thickness map of the cloudy image. Then, a convolutional neural network named Slope-Net is designed to estimate the thickness coefficient of each band relative to the reference thin cloud thickness map to obtain the thin cloud thickness maps of different bands. Finally, the recovered clear image can be obtained by subtracting the thin cloud thickness maps from the cloudy image according to the traditional thin cloud imaging model. To train U-Net and Slope-Net, a wavelength-dependent thin cloud simulation method is presented to generate a labeled dataset composed of synthetic cloudy images, corresponding clear images, reference thin cloud thickness maps, and thickness coefficients. Qualitative and quantitative comparison experiments are conducted on both synthetic cloudy images and real cloudy images from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively remove thin clouds in multispectral images with various land cover types and maintain good color fidelity.

AB  - This paper reveals the theoretical and conceptual foundations of the issues of global institutional transformations, transformative strategies of higher education, quality issues, personality-oriented strategies, multiculturalism, communication strategies of higher education. It presents the level and quality of internationalization of higher education in Ukraine, the formation of a worldview basis to stimulate and ways to ensure sustainable development of society, to increase the social responsibility of higher education and to strengthen its functional efficiency for society. In higher education now it is lack of basic systemic knowledge about sustainable development, its aims and ways. The environmental issues are quite often misevaluated as relevant only to natural sciences, social and humanitarian tasks of sustainable development are underestimated. In many countries, especially from former colonial or quasi-colonial status ones, the success of sustainable development policy is crucial dependent on recognition and acceptance of this policy by new generation of citizens. Students as an advanced and socially active part of new generation are the target audience for sustainable development enlightenment. In Ukraine these problems are additionally determined by low participation in international projects and some bureaucratization of such participation.

TI  - TanDEM-X: 10 Years of Formation Flying Bistatic SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On June 21, 2010, the TanDEM-X mission was launched and opened a new era in spaceborne radar remote sensing. The first formation flying radar system was built by extending the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission by a second, TerraSAR-X-like satellite TanDEM-X. The resulting large single-pass SAR interferometer features flexible baseline selection, enabling the acquisition of highly accurate cross-track interferograms not impacted by temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances. The primary objective of the mission was the generation of a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with unprecedented accuracy (12-m horizontal resolution and 2-m relative height accuracy). The main mission phase for DEM data acquisition has been finished in 2014; the processing of the global TanDEM-X DEM was concluded in September 2016. The final DEM product is well within specifications and features an extremely low percentage of void areas. It is of fundamental importance for a wide range of commercial and scientific applications. But the scientific exploitation of TanDEM-X is not limited to the DEM. TanDEM-X has unique capabilities, including along-track interferometry, and new bistatic and multistatic SAR techniques, that support numerous secondary mission objectives. Indeed, some of these experiments were directly performed during the DEM acquisition phase, when suitable satellite formation geometries were available. Moreover, regular acquisitions over selected super test sites enabled multitemporal analyses. A dedicated science phase after the DEM acquisitions included up to 4 km cross-track baselines, operation in the so-called Dual-Receive Antenna mode, as well as a period in pursuit monostatic flight formation. Comparisons of the TanDEM-X DEM with that of SRTM, or among multitemporal TanDEM-X data, revealed dramatic, ongoing, changes in Earth's topography, especially over ice and forests. In the last 3.5 years the mission has further acquired data for a global change layer showing the height changes relative to the first global DEM dataset. The so-called "Change DEM" is planned for release in 2021. Despite being well beyond their design lifetime, both satellites are still fully functional and have enough consumables for several additional years. Therefore, bistatic operations continue with a focus on changes in the cryosphere, biosphere, and densely populated urban areas.

TI  - Detecting and Mapping Gas Emission Craters on the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas, Western Siberia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid climate warming at northern high latitudes is driving geomorphic changes across the permafrost zone. In the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas in western Siberia, subterranean accumulation of methane beneath or within ice-rich permafrost can create mounds at the land surface. Once over-pressurized by methane, these mounds can explode and eject frozen ground, forming a gas emission crater (GEC). While GECs pose a hazard to human populations and infrastructure, only a small number have been identified in the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas, where the regional distribution and frequency of GECs and other types of land surface change are relatively unconstrained. To understand the distribution of landscape change within 327,000 km(2) of the Yamal-Gydan region, we developed a semi-automated multivariate change detection algorithm using satellite-derived surface reflectance, elevation, and water extent in the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. We found that 5% of the landscape changed from 1984 to 2017. The algorithm detected all seven GECs reported in the scientific literature and three new GEC-like features, and further revealed that retrogressive thaw slumps were more abundant than GECs. Our methodology can be refined to detect and better understand diverse types of land surface change and potentially mitigate risks across the northern permafrost zone.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-1 radar data for mapping ice disturbance in a forested area
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014 a catastrophic ice storm occurred in the forests of Borzsony Mts., Hungary. In this study we analyzed the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, complemented, and compared with optical imagery, in mapping this event. Great emphasis was put on reference data: three types of field-based reference datasets were used and the damaged patches were delineated manually based on the visual interpretation of pre- and post-event orthophotos. Four classifications with different set-ups were carried out by applying the eXtreme Gradient Boosting method. Combinations of radar backscatter coefficients, polarimetric descriptors, interferometric coherence, and optical data variables were tested. All classifications were suitable for identifying uprooted trees properly (1-11% underestimation), but none of them could detect crown loss accurately (55-58% overestimation), based on the validation of the most damaged area. Proper differentiation of healthy forests with various levels of canopy closure in the reference data seems crucial for accurate canopy loss estimation. In the case of methods using only Sentinel-1 imagery, interferometric coherence together with polarimetric descriptors provided the best results (OA: 65.7%). This setup can be useful for immediate uproot damage detection for planning salvage logging if a natural disturbance happens outside the vegetation period.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Siberian Crane Habitats and the Response to Water Level in Poyang Lake Wetland, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Poyang Lake wetland in China is the largest wintering destination for Siberian cranes worldwide. Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of crane habitats is of great importance for ecological environment governance and biodiversity protection. The shallow water, grassland, and soft mudflat regions of the Poyang Lake wetland are ideal habitats for wintering Siberian cranes. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing images, habitat areas were extracted and associated with various water levels taken on multiple dates. Landscape metrics were applied to describe the spatial structural characteristics of the crane habitats, and spatial statistics are used to explore the cold and hot spots of their distribution. Moreover, three indicators including sustainability, stability, and variety were applied to evaluate the vulnerability of the crane habitats under different hydrological conditions. Our findings indicate: (a) The main crane habitats exhibit a gradual decreasing degree of fragmentation in time, an obvious uncertainty of shape complexity and a relatively stable connectivity. (b) The crane habitats have a consistent spatial pattern of highly aggregated distributions associated with various water levels. (c) The hot spots of the habitats formed multiple "sheet" belts centered on the "Lake Enclosed in Autumn" regions, while the cold spots indicate a spatial pattern of axial distributions. (d) The majority of the hot spots of the habitats were distributed in sub-lakes found in the southeast part of the Poyang Lake watershed and the Nanjishan and Wucheng nature reserves, while the cold spots were mainly distributed in the main channels of the basins of Poyang Lake. (e) The sustainable habitats were mainly distributed in the "Lake Enclosed in Autumn" regions and intensively aggregated in two national nature reserves. (f) Under conditions of extremely low to average water levels (5.3-11.46 m), an increase of water level causes a decrease of the stability and variety of the crane habitats and weakens the aggregation structure.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This article aims to analyze agronomic drought in a highly anthropogenic semi-arid region. This is the western Mediterranean region. The study uses satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Scatterometer (AS CAT) describing the dynamics of vegetation cover and soil water content through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Water Index (SWT). An analysis of the vegetation anomaly index (VAT) highlights the difference between agricultural and natural areas. Thus, two land use classes are considered for the analysis of drought indices, agricultural areas and natural areas.The contribution of vegetation cover (VAT) was combined with the effect of soil water content using the moisture anomaly index (MAI) through a new drought index called the global drought index (GDT). This index considers the seasonal effect of the development of vegetation cover and soil water content with variable weightings over time for the two indices VAI and MAI.

TI  - A New Reflectivity Index for the Retrieval of Surface Soil Moisture From Radar Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach based on the change detection technique is proposed for the estimation of surface soil moisture (SSM) from a time series of radarmeasurements. A new index of reflectivity (IR) is defined that uses radar signals and Fresnel coefficients. This index is equal to 0 in the case of the smallest value of the Fresnel coefficient, corresponding to the driest conditions and the weakest radar signal, and is equal to 1 for the highest value of the Fresnel coefficient, corresponding to the wettest soil conditions and the strongest radar signal. The integrated equation model is used to simulate the behavior of radar signals as a function of soil moisture and roughness. This approach validates the greater usefulness of the IR compared with that of the commonly used index of SSM (ISSM), which assumes that the SSM varies linearly as a function of radar signal strength. The IR-based approach was tested using Sentinel-1 radar data recorded over three regions: Banizombou (Niger), Merguellil (Tunisia), and Occitania (France). The IR approach was found to perform better for the estimation of SSM than the ISSM approach based on comparisons with ground measurements over bare soils.

T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and global warming are caused principally by anthropogenic activities. For this reason, understanding the research lines that relate Land Surface Temperature and Vegetation Index time series is of great importance, given the amplitude of different open scientific areas on global warming. The result of this classification is presented to the academic community, which divides the studies into two main representative areas in the study of climate change: (1) Geodata Modeling and Analysis and (2) Remote Sensing. From the last one, two types are derived, some constructed with Linnear Regression Analysis (RL) and others with Nonlinear Regression Analysis (RNL). On the Geodata Modeling and Analysis, the Global Climate Models (GCM) are not the right tool for these analyzes due to their coarse spatial resolution. This implies the development of hybrid models with remote sensing, which are also limited by differences in resolution. On the other hand, remote sensing is the most widely disseminated tool for this type of studies. Finally, a promising window for development in the time series opens with non-linear regression analysis.

TI  - Mapping and Estimation of Above-ground Grass Biomass using Sentinel 2A Satellite Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-Ground Grass Biomass (AGGB) mapping and estimation is one of the important parameters for environmental ecosystem and grazing-lands management, particularly for livestock farming. However, previous models for estimation of AGGB with satellite imagery has some difficulty in choosing a particular satellite and vegetation index that can build a good estimation model at a higher accuracy. This study explores the potentiality of Sentinel 2A data to derive a satellite-based model for AGGB mapping and estimation. The study area was Skudai, Johor in Malaysia Peninsular. Grass parameters of forty grass sample units were measured in the field and their corresponding AGGB was later measured in the laboratory. The samples were used for modelling and assessment. Four indices were tested for their fitness in modelling AGGB from the satellite data. The result from the grass allometric analysis indicates that grass height and volume demonstrate good relationship with the measured AGGB (R-2 = 0.852 and 0.837 respectively). Vegetation Index Number (VIN) has the best fit for modeling AGGB (R-2 = 0.840) compared to other vegetation indices. The derived satellite AGGB estimate was validated with the assessment field and allometry derived AGGB at RMSE = 15.89g and 44.45g, respectively. This study demonstrate that VIN derived from Sentinel 2A MSI satellite data can be used to model AGGB estimation at a good accuracy. Therefore, it will contribute to providing reliable information on AGGB of grazing lands for sustainable livestock farming. (C) 2021 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved

TI  - Mapping urban temperature using crowd-sensing data and machine learning
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the patterns of urban temperature a high spatial and temporal resolution is of large importance for urban heat adaptation and mitigation. Machine learning offers promising tools for high-resolution modeling of urban heat, but it requires large amounts of data. Measurements from official weather stations are too sparse but could be complemented by crowd sensed measurements from citizen weather stations (CWS). Here we present an approach to model urban temperature using the quantile regression forest algorithm and CWS, open government and remote sensing data. The analysis is based on data from 691 sensors in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) during a heat wave using data from for 25-30th June 2019. We trained the model using hourly data from for 25-29th June (n = 71,837) and evaluate the model using data from June 30th (n = 14,105). Based on the model, spatiotemporal temperature maps of 10 x 10 m resolution were produced. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately map urban heat at high spatial and temporal resolution without additional measurement infrastructure. We furthermore critically discuss and spatially map estimated prediction and extrapolation uncertainty. Our approach is able to inform highly localized urban policy and decision-making.

AB  - Despite the fact that the Sentinel-1 satellites was designed for surface deformation monitoring, researchers have been able to produce digital elevation model (DEM) using repeat-pass Interferometry. It is, however, mostly conducted in the subtropical zone and the temperate zone. Only a couple of publications were found conducted in the tropical region. Highly dense vegetation in tropical region could cause temporal decorrelation when repeat-pass Interferometry is used. However, the vegetation cover, as well as landcover condition, is still varied within this region. Therefore, our main objective is to identify the suitable area for a successful DEM extraction using Sentinel-1 repeat-pass Interferometry in the tropical region. This paper presents our initial results on the repeat-pass Interferometry using Sentinel-1 data Indonesia. Thirty-two (32) interferometric pairs were chosen over two areas of interest (AOI). The pairs were chosen with different temporal and perpendicular baselines. Both AOI is located in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The AOI has different climate conditions. The produced DEMs were visually inspected, and the best results were compared to ICESat-2 and DEMNAS datasets. The Root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated on 5368 sample points. Our initial results show that only AOI_2, with its relatively arid environment, can produce meaningful DEM. Finally, a pair with six days difference and 136-meter perpendicular baseline came out with the best results. Compared to ICESat-2 ATL08 and DEMNAS data, the RMSE produced was 33.92 and 35.13 meters, respectively. Our next task is to maximize the accuracy by tweaking several parameters, as well as identifying the same climatic and/or landcover conditions found on this paper throughout Indonesia and the whole tropical region.

AB  - We collected 121 Malaise-trap samples of arthropods at 89 sampling sites in and around the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest and Long-Term Ecological Research site, Oregon, USA in July 2018. The samples were shotgun sequenced and subjected to in-silico PCR to detect arthropod species. The resulting sample by species table was paired with Landsat, LiDAR, and human-activity environmental covariates in a joint species distribution model to interpolate a continuous biodiversity map over 225 km2. We show that it is possible to efficiently fit a joint species distribution model with reasonable predictive performance on large numbers of data-poor species. This approach makes possible the mapping of biodiversity with sufficient spatial resolution to inform local management choices while also being efficient enough to scale up to several thousand square kilometers or more.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis of the Mesenteric Adipose and Liver Reveals Novel Mechanisms by Which Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Contributes to Worse Stroke Outcome
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is linked to elevated risk for systemic adult-onset diseases like hypertension, impaired glucose and immune regulation, and in animal models, to impaired recovery from acute onset diseases like cerebrovascular ischemic stroke. Recent evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal system rapidly becomes dysbiotic following cerebrovascular stroke, resulting in systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that a history of PAE would modify the systemic effects of stroke, and transduce exposure-dependent transcriptomic changes in downstream sentinel tissues of the enteric portal circulation that have previously been linked to biobehavioral outcomes in rodent PAE models. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to repeated episodes of vaporized ethanol or room air from gestational day 8 to 19. At 5 months, progeny from each treatment condition were subjected to unilateral endothelin-1 induced occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and outcomes evaluated after 2 days while other progeny stayed stroke-naive. Stroke induced disabilities were assessed by behavioral assays (adhesive removal, Vibrissae evoked fore-limb placement, circling) and infarct size. The mesenteric adipose tissue and liver transcriptomes were assessed by sequencing, from age-matched stroke-exposed and stroke-naive offspring. In stroke-naive animals, pathway analysis identified rRNA processing as downregulated and citric acid cycle as upregulated in mesenteric adipose. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified, in the liver of stoke-naive animals, a moderate but significant correlation between PAE status and necroptosis, a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death (Pearsons r=0.554, p<0.05). Two days after a stroke, PAE rats exhibited worse neurological scores compared to controls (p<0.05). WGCNA after stroke identified an adipose gene network associated with B cell differentiation and NF-kappa B signaling as moderately correlated with post-stroke neurological function (Pearson's r=0.52, p=0.05). Post-stroke WGCNA also identified a liver proinflammatory gene network strongly correlated with post-stroke neurological function (Pearson's r=-0.63, p<0.01). PAE persistently alters the transcriptome of afferent tissue targets of enteric circulation in adult rat offspring. Moreover, PAE-linked enteric inflammation is correlated to worse outcomes following cerebrovascular ischemic stroke in adulthood. Enteric disturbances may mediate adverse brain health outcomes due to PAE in adulthood. Overall design: There were a total of 60 samples; 4 Control Female stroke-naive, 3 Control Male stroke-naive, 4 PAE Female stroke-naive, 4 PAE Male stroke-naive, 4 Control Female stroke, 3 Control Male stroke, 4 PAE Female stroke, 4 PAE Male stroke. Done for mesenteric adipose and for liver.

TI  - Gli1 marks a sentinel muscle stem cell population for muscle regeneration
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Adult skeletal muscle regeneration is mainly driven by muscle stem cells (MuSCs), which are highly heterogeneous. Although recent studies have started to characterize the heterogeneity of MuSCs, whether a subset of cells with distinct exists within MuSCs remains unanswered. Here, we found that a population of MuSCs, marked by Gli1 expression, is required for muscle regeneration. The Gli1+ MuSC population displayed advantages in proliferation and differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of this population led to delayed muscle regeneration, while transplanted Gli1+ MuSCs supported muscle regeneration more effectively than Gli1- MuSCs. Further analysis revealed that even in the uninjured muscle, Gli1+ MuSCs had elevated mTOR signaling activity, increased cell size and mitochondrial numbers compared to Gli1- MuSCs, indicating Gli1+ MuSCs are displaying the features of primed MuSCs. Moreover, Gli1+ MuSCs greatly contributed to the formation of GAlert cells after muscle injury. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Gli1+ MuSCs represent a distinct MuSC population which is more active in the homeostatic muscle and enters the cell cycle shortly after injury. This cell population functions as the tissue-resident sentinel that rapidly responds to injury and initiates muscle regeneration. Overall design: we separately collected tdT+ (Gli1+) and tdT- (Gli1-) MuSCs for RNA-Seq analysis.

TI  - Periostin+ stromal cells guide lymphovascular invasion by cancer cells
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Cancer cell dissemination to sentinel lymph nodes associates with poor patient outcomes, particularly in breast cancer. The process by which cancer cells egress from the primary tumor upon interfacing with the lymphatic vasculature is complex and driven by dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The matricellular protein periostin can distinguish CAF subtypes in breast cancer and is associated with increased desmoplasia and disease recurrence in patients. However, since periostin is secreted, periostin-expressing CAFs are difficult to characterize in situ, limiting our understanding of their specific contribution to cancer progression. Here, we used in vivo genetic labeling and ablation to lineage trace periostin+ cells and characterize their functions during tumor growth and metastasis. Periostin-expressing CAFs were spatially found at periductal and perivascular margins, were enriched at lymphatic vessel peripheries, and were differentially activated by highly-metastatic cancer cells versus poorly-metastatic counterparts. Surprisingly, genetically depleting periostin+ CAFs slightly accelerated primary tumor growth but impaired intratumoral collagen organization and inhibited lymphatic, but not lung, metastases. Periostin ablation in CAFs impaired their ability to deposit aligned collagen matrices and inhibited cancer cell invasion through collagen and across lymphatic endothelial cell monolayers. Thus, highly-metastatic cancer cells mobilize periostin-expressing CAFs in the primary tumor site that promote collagen remodeling and collective cell invasion within lymphatic vessels and ultimately to sentinel lymph nodes. Overall design: Primary human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from culture were treated with si-Scr (si-Control) or si-POSTN with 4 replicates each.

TI  - RNA-seq analysis of sorted duodenum epithelial cells and duodenum lamia propria macrophages from mice where Tsc2 is deleted in Lyz2-expressing cells
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Iron is an essential cellular and important for many physiological functions including erythropoiesis and host defense. It is taken up from the diet in the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine by enterocytes and loaded onto transferrin, the main iron transport molecules in the circulation. Macrophages are ancient sentinel cells that are implicated in all steps of systemic iron metabolism except duodenal iron import. By assessing mice that harbor a macrophage-specific deletion of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2), a negative regulator of mTORC1, we found that these mice possessed various defects in iron metabolism including defective steady state erythropoiesis and a highly reduced saturation of transferrin with iron. This iron-deficiency phenotype was caused by a block of iron import from the duodenal epithelial cells into the circulation. Activation of mTORC1 in villous duodenal CD68+ macrophages induced expression of serine proteases and promoted local degradation of the major iron transport molecule transferrin, whereas depletion of macrophages in mice increased transferrin levels in the duodenal villi. Inhibition of serine protease activity restored transferrin levels in the Tsc2-deficient mice. Physiologically, transferrin levels were regulated in the villi during Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice. These data show that transferrin is controlled locally in the duodenum and establish macrophages as regulators of duodenal iron uptake. Overall design: Duodenum lamina propria macrophages (Cd45+, Ly6G-, SiglecF-, Cd24-, Cd11c+/-, Cd103-, Cd11b+, Ly6C-, Cd64+, MHCII+) and EpCAM+ epithelial cells (Cd45-, EpCAM+) from 3 Tsc2fl/fl and 4 Tsc2Lyz2-cre mice were isolated as per manufacturers instructions (MACS Miltenyi Biotec, 130-097-410) and FACS sorted at the FACS Core Unit of the Childrens Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) of Vienna. Freshly sorted cells were harvested in RLT-Buffer (RNeasy RNA isolation kits, QIAGEN) containing SS-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and stored at -80 °C. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Cat No.ID: 74004).

M3  - Data study
AB  - The aim of this study was to construct a prediction model for axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) using a DNA microarray assay for gene expression in breast tumor tissues. Luminal A breast cancers, diagnosed by PAM50 testing, were analyzed, and a prediction model (genomic nodal index (GNI)) consisting of 292 probe sets for ALNM was constructed in a training set of patients (n=388), and was validated in the first (n=59) and the second (n=103) validation sets. AUCs of ROC were 0.820, 0.717, and 0.749 in the training, first, and second validation sets, respectively. GNI was most significantly associated with ALNM, independently of the other conventional clinicopathological parameters in all cohorts. It is suggested that GNI can be used to identify the patients with a low risk for ALNM so that sentinel lymph node biopsy can be spared safely. This DATA set: J03 contains 120 (n+ 60, n- 60) samples of the above first and second validation sets from Japan (OUH_1,2). A long time passed, and now it is unclear how these 120 cases were distributed among the first and second validation sets. *Note: This old data has been updated multiple times by others. Then, there are some differences from the original 2014 paper and unclear points still remain. Therefore, do not use it for formal analysis aimed at public insurance coverage etc. This is for research purposes only. Please cite this paper when writing a new paper. PMID: 25016059 DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2014.07.003 Overall design: RNA was extracted from 120 fresh frozen tumor samples obtained from radical breast cancer surgery and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) is used to remediate aquifers polluted by organochlorines or heavy metals has been also considered for elimination of harmful algal blooms. Highly reactive nZVI then affects microorganisms in the application area. To date, various nZVI toxicity endpoints have been studied on different organisms. However, the underlying mechanistic related to iron defense pathways have not been explained sufficiently. Here we aim to describe the physiological and transcriptomic response of the microalga, Raphidocelis subcapitata ATCC 22662, to 100 mg/L of non-reactive nFe3O4, and reactive nZVI. The combined effect of shading by nanoparticles and release of Fe2+ from nZVI posed a stronger inhibition leading to deformed cells and cytosol leakage in 15% of cells. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the stronger physiological effect of nZVI (7,380 differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) than nFe3O4 (4,601 DEGs) after 1 h. nZVI (but not nFe3O4) caused increased DNA repair and replication, while deactivated carbohydrate-energy metabolisms, mitochondria signaling, and transmembrane ion transport. The defense response of algal cells was immediate to successfully face oxidative stress. Overall design: To evaluate the toxicity effect in R. subcapitata posed by 100 mg/L nZVI and nFe3O4 at transcriptomic level To identify and characterize the expression of different genes during the exposure of nZVI and nFe3O4 at different time points (1 h and 4 h). To identify metabolic pathways changed after the exposure of nZVI and nFe3O4

TI  - Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Large numbers of statistically significant associations between sentinel SNPs and case-control status have been replicated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Nevertheless, currently few underlying molecular mechanisms of complex disease are known. Our approach has been to investigate whether variation in binding of a transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) whose activating ligand vitamin D has often been proposed as a modifiable factor in multiple disorders, could explain any of these associations. VDR modifies gene expression by binding DNA as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). We identified 43,332 genetic variants significantly associated with altered VDR binding affinity (VDR-BVs) using a high-resolution (ChIP-exo) genome-wide analysis of 27 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The VDR-BVs are over-represented in well conserved consensus RXR:VDR binding motifs. However, most fell outside of recognisable RXR:VDR motifs, implying that genetic variation often affects RXR:VDR binding affinity only indirectly. Finally, we compared 341 VDR-BVs replicating by position in multiple individuals against background sets of variants lying within VDR-binding regions that had been matched in allele frequency and were independent with respect to linkage disequilibrium. In this stringent test, these replicated VDR-BVs were significantly (q < 0.1) and substantially (> 2-fold) enriched in GWAS intervals associated with autoimmune and other diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Replicated VDR-BVs associated with these disorders could represent causal disease risk alleles whose effect is modifiable by vitamin D levels. Overall design: Genome-wide analysis of the impact of genetic variation on vitamin D receptor binding using ChIP-exo on 27 Hapmap cell lines (3 additional samples failed analytical QC).

AB  - This experiment is part of a larger study examining the anti-tumour properties of interferon epsilon in ovarian cancer. The goal of this experiment was to test the direct effects of interferon epsilon and interferon beta on human ovarian tumours in vivo, using patient derived xenografts (PDX) in immunocompromised (NSG) mice. Overall design: NSG mice bearing two different PDX were treated with i.p. recombinant human interferon epsilon (300 IU), recombinant human interferon beta (300 IU), recombinant mouse interferon epsilon (3 IU, equivalent to 300 IU of human interferon epsilon), or PBS thrice weekly for 6 weeks after first detectable evidence of tumour growth in sentinel mice. Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested from mice at endpoint and snap frozen, and stored at 80°C until RNA extraction. n=6 mice were used for each treatment group for each of the two PDX tumours.

Surprisingly, genetically depleting periostin+ CAFs slightly accelerated primary tumor growth but impaired intratumoral collagen organization and inhibited lymphatic, but not lung, metastases. Periostin ablation in CAFs impaired their ability to deposit aligned collagen matrices and inhibited cancer cell invasion through collagen and across lymphatic endothelial cell monolayers. Thus, highly-metastatic cancer cells mobilize periostin-expressing CAFs in the primary tumor site that promote collagen remodeling and collective cell invasion within lymphatic vessels and ultimately to sentinel lymph nodes. Overall design: We used digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology to quantitate transcript in spatially distinct populations of periostin-expressing cells located proximal to lymphatic vessels and near blood vessels and ducts in the naive mammary gland of periostin lineage tracing mice. To quantitate gene expression, we used GeoMx mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) panel from NanoString with fluorescence labelled morphology markers; green fluorescent protein (ZSGreen) for periostin-expressing cells, PDPN for lymphatic vessel marker and SMA for ducts and blood vessels to visualize morphology of tissues on GeoMx DSP platform.

TI  - scRNA-seq analysis of duodenum CD68+ macrophages from mice where Tsc2 is deleted in Lyz2-expressing cells
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Iron is an essential cellular trace element and important for many physiological functions including erythropoiesis and host defense. It is taken up from the diet in the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine by enterocytes and loaded onto transferrin, the main iron transport molecules in the circulation. Macrophages are ancient sentinel cells that are implicated in all steps of systemic iron metabolism except duodenal iron import. By assessing mice that harbor a macrophage-specific deletion of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2), a negative regulator of mTORC1, we found that these mice possessed various defects in iron metabolism including defective steady state erythropoiesis and a highly reduced saturation of transferrin with iron. This iron-deficiency phenotype was caused by a block of iron import from the duodenal epithelial cells into the circulation. Activation of mTORC1 in villous duodenal CD68+ macrophages induced expression of serine proteases and promoted local degradation of the major iron transport molecule transferrin, whereas depletion of macrophages in mice increased transferrin levels in the duodenal villi. Inhibition of serine protease activity restored transferrin levels in the Tsc2-deficient mice. Physiologically, transferrin levels were regulated in the villi during Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice. These data show that transferrin is controlled locally in the duodenum and establish macrophages as regulators of duodenal iron uptake. Overall design: Duodenum lamina propria CD45+ immune cells with CD68-tag macrophages (Cd45+,Cd68+)

AB  - Six candidates (all ER/PR+, HER2, Ki-67 <20 %) with metastatic SLNs selected from 305 patients were equally categorized as NSLN negative and positive. We identified 103 specifically expressed genes in the NSLN negative group and 47 in the NSLN positive group. Among them, FABP1 (negative group) and CYP2A13 (positive group) were the only 2 protein-encoding genes with expression levels in the 8th to 10th deciles. Using a false discovery rate threshold of <0.05, 62 up-regulated genes and 98 down-regulated genes were discovered in the NSLN positive group. Furthermore, 10 gene fusions were identified in this group with the most frequently fused 23 gene being IGLL5.

AB  - COVID-19 is a systemic disease involving multiple organs. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived organoids/cells provide insight into cellular tropism and host response, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically examined changes in transcript profiles caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection at different MOIs for airway organoids (AWOs), alveolar organoids (ALOs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs), and identified several genes, including CIART, that are generally implicated in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. AWOs, ALOs, and CMs derived from isogenic CIART-/- hPSCs were significantly resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, independent of viral entry. Single-cell RNA-seq further validated the decreased levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multi-ciliated cells of AWOs. CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses found that CIART controls SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part through regulating NR4A1, a gene also identified from the multi-organoid analysis. Finally, transcriptional profiling and pharmacological inhibition revealed that the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) pathway regulates SARS-CoV-2 infection downstream of CIART/NR4A1. The multi-organoid platform provides potential therapeutic targets for protection against COVID-19 across organ systems. Overall design: WT and CIART-/- hPSC-AWOs were infected with mock or SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.1). Samples were collected at 24hpi.

AB  - The One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) assay is used to identify occult metastases in the axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLNs) of early stage breast cancer patients by quantification of the expression of cytokeratin19 (CK19) gene. The discarded samples of OSNA assay were explored as a source of information of SLN microenvironment response in patients with early stage Luminal A breast cancer using an RNAseq panel. Funding: project GenomePTNational Laboratory for Genome Sequencing and Analysis (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-022184), and project Central Region Training Project for Personalized/Precision Medicine, with a genomic basis, financed by the program CENTRO2020 [CENTRO-08-5864-FSE-000039 (PEP IN1194) 07-2021]. Overall design: Discarded samples of OSNA assay from 32 patients with Luminal A early stage breast cancer (cT1-T2 N0) (8th Ed Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual; 2019 World Health Organization classification of tumours of the breast) were analysed. OSNA assay was performed accoring to Sysmex Corporation protocol. Based on the calculated number of CK19 mRNA copies/ul, in accordance with the previous cut off level determined by Tsujimoto et al.: > 5000 copies/uL correspond to macrometastasis (pN1), 250 to 5000 copies/uL to micrometastasis (pN1mi), and values < 250 copies/uL are classified as negative (pN0) SLN. For RNA sequencing, a NGS panel of 395 genes involved in tumor-immune interactions and inflammatory signalling was used. No replicates were included.

TI  - Single-cell gene expression profiles of mouse macrophages stimulated with immune ligands
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Immune sentinel macrophages initiate responses to pathogens via hundreds of immune response genes. Each immune threat demands a tailored response, suggesting that the capacity for stimulus-specific gene expression is a key functional hallmark of healthy macrophages. To quantify this property, termed Response Specificity, we developed a single-cell experimental workflow and analytical approaches based on information theory and machine learning. We found that Response Specificity of macrophages is driven by combinations of specific immune genes that show low cell-to-cell heterogeneity and are targets of separate signaling pathways. The Response Specificity Profile, a systematic comparison of multiple stimulus response distributions, was distinctly altered by polarizing cytokines and enabled an assessment of the functional state of macrophages. Indeed, the Response Specificity Profile of peritoneal macrophages from old and obese mice showed characteristic differences, suggesting that Response Specificity may be a basis for measuring the functional state of innate immune cells. Overall design: Macrophages were collected from the mouse peritoneum or differentiated from myeloid progenitors, and stimulated with a panel of immune ligands for 3hrs. Cells were collected into suspension and scRNAseq was performed using the BD Rhapsody platform.

TI  - Transcriptional constraint of EWS/FLI by an ETS transcription factor promotes Ewing sarcoma growth [CUT&Tag]
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Pediatric cancers frequently harbor sentinel mutations involving transcription factors (TFs) that dysregulate normal development. A recurrent mechanism involves the ability of mutant TFs to co-opt cell lineage-specific, activating TFs to promote cancer growth. Ewing sarcoma, the second most common pediatric bone cancer, is defined by the presence of a 11;22 chromosomal translocation fusing the N-terminus of the EWS protein with the C-terminal DNA binding domain of an ETS (E26 Transformation Specific) TF family member, most commonly (85-90% of cases), FLI1. The EWS/FLI fusion exhibits the neomorphic ability to pioneer de novo enhancers at repeating 5-GGAA-3 motifs in the cell-of-origin, which has not been identified. To date, efforts to elucidate the key mechanisms by which EWS/FLI promotes oncogenesis have prioritized identifying the genes that are profoundly activated by EWS/FLI and highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma compared to other cancers, with particular focus on transcription factors capable of altering cell state. However, it is not known whether, globally, these genes constitute the most critical drivers of Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Here, we describe the results of an unbiased deletion screen revealing that the wild-type repressive ETS family TF, ETV6 (ETS Variant 6, or TEL), is a novel and most critical TF dependency specific to Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrate that the repressive activity of ETV6 constrains EWS/FLI gene activation at GGAA repeat enhancers to promote Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Overall design: CUT&Tag (Kaya-Okur, et al., Nature Communications, 2019) was used to evaluate ETV6 binding in Ewing sarcoma the A673 cell line using both the parental A673 cell line with two different anti-bodies and in A673 cells engineered to express FKBP12F36V-HA-ETV6 were treated with either DMSO control or dTAGV-1 for24 hours to induce ETV6 degradation. Duplicate paired-end experiments were used to evaluate ETV6 binding in all cases. All CUT&Tag samples have matching input DNA reference sample from the same batch and treatment condition.

M3  - Data study
AB  - A single-cell transcriptional analysis was performed on p16INK4a+ cells from the adult murine lung. Whole adult murine lung tissue was dissociated to single cells and subjected to fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to select all live p16INK4a + cells. The single cell RNA-sequencing library was then subsequently generated. Cells were sequenced at a depth of ~30,506 mean reads/cell. We captured approximately 8752 cells with a mean of 2457 genes detected per cell utilizing a droplet-based barcoding approach to capture single cells for RNA sequencing. The results demonstrate that the p16INK4a + population are predominantly in the immune CD45+ populations and PDGFRa+ mesenchyme. Overall design: The INKBRITE animals we constructed by inserting a tandem cassette of H2B-GFP expressed in frame with the p16INK4A gene product in the murine Cdkn2a locus into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The expression of multiple copies of a stable fluorescent protein is driven by p16INK4A promoter. Whole adult murine lung tissue was dissociated to single cells stained with DAPI for live cells selection and subjected to FACS to select live GFP+ (p16INK4a+) cells. Doublets and dead cells were excluded based on forward scatter, side scatter and DAPI fluorescence. Live Gp16INK4a+ cells were prepared using the 10X single cell instrument and v1 10X single cell kits according to standard protocol. Single cell sequencing of adult murine lung GLI2+ population was performed by using the HiSeq2500.

Overall design: CUT&Tag (Kaya-Okur, et al., Nature Communications, 2019) was used to evaluate ETV6 binding in Ewing sarcoma using the newly derived CCLF_PEDS_0009_T (PEDS0009) cell line (Guenther et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2019) in cells transduced with lentivirally-packaged CRISPR/Cas9 constructs. All sgRNA sequences used in the Broad Institute AVANA CRISPR/Cas9 screen are available for download at the DepMap Portal (https://depmap.org). sgRNA sequences used to target ETV6 were taken from this screen. The sgETV6-1 forward sequence was 5-GCAGCCAATTTACTGGAGCA-3. The sgETV6-2 forward sequence was 5-GCAGGGATGACGTAGCCCAG-3. The sgETV6-3 forward sequence was 5-GTGTGTGTATAGAGTTTCCA-3.

M3  - Data study
AB  - We collected freshly sorted mesenchyme (live CD45-Epcam-CD31-PDGFRa+GFP- or GFP+) from dissociated lung tissue of INKBRITE animals to characterize the transcriptome difference between p16INK4a+ vs p16INK4a- cells at homeostasis and during injury. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to exclude immune (CD45+), epithelial (Epcam+), and endothelial (CD31+) cells and positively select for PDGFRa+ mesenchyme. Cells were sequenced at a depth of average of 45 million reads/sample. The results revealed an increase of senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) signature in p16INK4+ cells that becomes refined after injury. We found the expression of an epithelial growth factor epiregulin (ereg) increased in p16INK4a+ cells after injury suggesting a possible role of p16INK4a+ senescence during regeneration of lung epithelium. Overall design: The INKBRITE animals we constructed by inserting a tandem cassette of H2B-GFP expressed in frame with the p16INK4A gene product in the murine Cdkn2a locus into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The expression of multiple copies of a stable fluorescent protein is driven by p16INK4A promoter. Whole adult murine lung tissue was dissociated to single cells stained with DAPI for live cells selection and subjected to FACS to select live CD45-Epcam-CD31-PDGFRa+GFP+ (p16INK4a+) and CD45-Epcam-CD31-PDGFRa+GFP- (p16INK4a-) cells. We collected p16INK4a+ and - cells from 3 INKBRITE naphthalene injured animals and 3 solvent controls. The RNA was extracted and shipped to GENEWIZ company for sequencing o the Illumina HiSeq instrument. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated from Illumina HiSeq was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina's bcl2fastq 2.17 software

TI  - Transcriptional constraint of EWS/FLI by an ETS transcription factor promotes Ewing sarcoma growth [ATAC-seq]
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Pediatric cancers frequently harbor sentinel mutations involving transcription factors (TFs) that dysregulate normal development. A recurrent mechanism involves the ability of mutant TFs to co-opt cell lineage-specific, activating TFs to promote cancer growth. Ewing sarcoma, the second most common pediatric bone cancer, is defined by the presence of a 11;22 chromosomal translocation fusing the N-terminus of the EWS protein with the C-terminal DNA binding domain of an ETS (E26 Transformation Specific) TF family member, most commonly (85-90% of cases), FLI1. The EWS/FLI fusion exhibits the neomorphic ability to pioneer de novo enhancers at repeating 5-GGAA-3 motifs in the cell-of-origin, which has not been identified. To date, efforts to elucidate the key mechanisms by which EWS/FLI promotes oncogenesis have prioritized identifying the genes that are profoundly activated by EWS/FLI and highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma compared to other cancers, with particular focus on transcription factors capable of altering cell state. However, it is not known whether, globally, these genes constitute the most critical drivers of Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Here, we describe the results of an unbiased deletion screen revealing that the wild-type repressive ETS family TF, ETV6 (ETS Variant 6, or TEL), is a novel and most critical TF dependency specific to Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrate that the repressive activity of ETV6 constrains EWS/FLI gene activation at GGAA repeat enhancers to promote Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Overall design: ATAC-seq was used to evaluate changes in chromatin accessibility with ETV6 loss. ATAC-seq was performed using triplicate samples of A673 ETV6-dTAG cells seeded and treated separately with DMSO or 1 M dTAGV-1 for 72 hours.

TI  - Transboundary dispersal: California moray eels exhibit local adaptation in the face of high gene flow
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - We examined population connectivity across nearly the entire adult range of a subtropical Eastern Pacific fish species, the California moray (Gymnothorax mordax). Our objectives were to determine if California morays are genetically homogenous or show distinct genetic structure across different parts of their range, identify signatures of sources/sinks, and examine which environmental or oceanographic processes may contribute to structuring populations. We used restriction site-associated sequencing (RADseq) to examine genetic diversity across 252 individuals from 11 locations. We used satellite data to examine whether environmental characteristics at the time of settlement were correlated with patterns of local adaptation. We found high gene flow across all locations, though a small subset of loci showed strong signs of local adaptation. Patterns of local adaptation were correlated with sea surface temperature, sea surface temperature anomaly, and sea surface height at the time of settlement, but not with geographic distance. Genes under selection have been implicated in teleost eye development, reproduction, and stress. Despite high gene flow, California morays exhibit local adaptation with phenotype-environment mismatches during the late larval/early juvenile stages ultimately constraining the species range. Our study supports a long-standing hypothesis that morays in southern California have limited local reproduction.

Overall design: Gene expression values to evaluate the effect of ETV6 loss in Ewing sarcoma were determined from paired-end sequencting of RNA-seq samles in A673 and EW8 cell lines. A673 and EW8 Ewing sarcoma cells engineered to express FKBP12F36V-HA-ETV6 were treated with either DMSO control or dTAGV-1 for 6, 24, or 72 hours to induce ETV6 degradation. Triplicates for all groups were used for paired-end RNA-sequencing. RNA-seq samples of CRISPR KO of ETV6 in A673 were also obtained to validate the dTAG results (4 control vs. 6 ETV6 KO samples).

M3  - Data study
AB  - The US EPA has identified a number of PFAS and other chemicals of high priority to States and Regional EPA offices that have no available in vivo toxicology data. Based on the list of data-poor chemicals and availability of the chemicals, four were selected for 5-day hepatic and renal transcriptomic assessments in male and female Hsd: Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. These data will be used for determining provisional pathway-based transcriptomic BMDs for use in human health risk estimations. Traditional toxicological endpoints (e.g. organ weights and clinical chemistry) have been added to the studies to provide additional contextualizaing information (i.e., phenotypic anchoring). Overall design: Male and female SD rats were placed on NTP-2000 diet and housed up to 5 animals per cage. After a 10-14 day quarantine, 8-10 week old animals were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Five additional animals were included for sentinel evaluation prior to quarantine release and resampled at study termination. Each of six chemicals was given at nine doses (5 mL/kg dosing volume) to the treatment groups. A vehicle control group was also included for each chemical. Male and female rats received the test formulations via gavage for five consecutive days. All animals were euthanized the day after the last dose was administered.

We demonstrate that the repressive activity of ETV6 constrains EWS/FLI gene activation at GGAA repeat enhancers to promote Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Overall design: CUT&RUN (Skene and Henikoff, eLife, 2017) was used to evaluate FLI1 and H3K4me3 binding in Ewing sarcoma using the newly derived CCLF_PEDS_0009_T (PEDS0009) cell line (Guenther et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2019) in cells transduced with lentivirally-packaged CRISPR/Cas9 constructs. All sgRNA sequences used in the Broad Institute AVANA CRISPR/Cas9 screen are available for download at the DepMap Portal (https://depmap.org). sgRNA sequences used to target ETV6 were taken from this screen. The sgETV6-1 forward sequence was 5-GCAGCCAATTTACTGGAGCA-3. The sgETV6-2 forward sequence was 5-GCAGGGATGACGTAGCCCAG-3. The sgETV6-3 forward sequence was 5-GTGTGTGTATAGAGTTTCCA-3. The sgETV6-4 forward sequence was 5-GTTATGGTGCACATTATCCA-3. For control sgRNA, sgChr2.2 was used as a cutting control and targets a gene desert on Chromosome 2, 5-GGTGTGCGTATGAAGCAGTG-3. For ligation into the LentiCRISPRv2 plasmid, additional bases were added. 5-CACCG-3 was added to the beginning of the forward sequence. 5-AAAC-3 and 5-C-3 were added at the beginning and end of the reverse sequence, respectively. Paired-end experiments were used to evaluate FLI1 and H3K4me3 binding. All CUT&RUN samples have matching IgG reference sample from the same batch and treatment condition. The samples were processed with a pipeline based upon the bulk-level method outlined in CUT&RUNTools 2.0 (Yu, F., Sankaran, V.G., and Yuan, G.

TI  - Climate adaptation and vulnerability of foundation species in a global change hotspot
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Climate change is altering species ranges, and abundances within ranges, as populations become differentially adapted and vulnerable to the climates they face. Hence, characterising current ranges, whether species harbour and exchange adaptive genetic variants, and how variants are distributed across landscapes undergoing rapid change, is crucial to predicting responses to future climates and informing conservation strategies. Such insights are nonetheless lacking for most species of conservation concern. We characterise genomic patterns of neutral variation, climate adaptation, and climate vulnerability (the amount of genomic change needed to track climate change by adaptation) in sister foundation species, the endemic marine tubeworms Galeolaria caespitosa and Galeolaria gemineoa, across a sentinel region for climate change impacts. First, species are shown to be partly sympatric despite previous support for non-overlapping ranges, and genetically isolated despite known capacity for hybrid crosses to yield viable early offspring. Second, species show signals of polygenic adaptation, but to differing components of temperature and involving mostly different loci. Last, species are predicted to be differentially vulnerable to climate change, with G. gemineoa (the less genetically diverse species) needing double the adaptation to track projected changes in temperature compared to its sister species. Together, our findings provide new insights into climate adaptation and its potential disruption by climate change for foundation species that enhance local biodiversity, with implications for evolutionarily enlightened management of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change greatly affects lake microorganisms in arid and semiarid zones, which alters ecosystem functions and the ecological security of lakes. However, the responses of lake microorganisms, especially microeukaryotes, to climate change are poorly understood. Here, using 18S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the distribution patterns of microeukaryotic communities and whether and how climate change directly or indirectly affected the microeukaryotic communities on the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau. Our results showed that climate change, as the main driving force of lake change, drives salinity to become a determinant of the microeukaryotic community among the lakes of the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau. Salinity shapes the diversity and trophic level of the microeukaryotic community and further affects lake carbon cycling. Co-occurrence network analysis further revealed that increasing salinity reduced the complexity but improved the stability of microeukaryotic communities and changed ecological relationships. Meanwhile, increasing salinity improved the importance of deterministic processes in microeukaryotic community assembly, and the dominance of stochastic processes in freshwater lakes transformed into deterministic processes in salt lakes. Furthermore, we established lake biomonitoring and climate sentinel models by integrating microeukaryotic information, which would provide substantial improvements to our predictive ability of lake responses to climate change.

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Although much research has been done on the diversity of the gut microbiome, little is known about how it influences intestinal homeostasis under normal and pathogenic conditions. Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been suggested to operate at the interface between the microbiota and the intestinal epithelium. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on conventionally raised and germ-free mice, and discovered that exposure to commensal microbiota induced localized DNA methylation changes at regulatory elements, which are TET2/3-dependent. This culminated in the activation of a set of early sentinel response genes to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exposure to the microbiota in dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute inflammation results in profound DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility changes at regulatory elements, leading to alterations in gene expression programs enriched in colitis- and colon-cancer-associated functions. Finally, by employing genetic interventions, we show that microbiota-induced epigenetic programming is necessary for proper intestinal homeostasis in vivo. Overall design: Overall 6 colon crypts samples from eleven-weeks old mice were analyzed. Three of them correspond to WT mice (Tet2/3 fl/fl) and three correspond to Tert2/3-depleted mice (Tet2/3 fl/fl VillinCre).

M3  - Data study
AB  - The early detection of exotic mosquito species (EMS) along high-risk introduction routes before populations become established is of paramount importance to prevent local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Following previous EMS surveillance projects in Belgium, a three-year national active EMS monitoring project (MEMO) started in July 2017 to detect possible foci of introduction and establishment of EMS at an early stage in Belgium. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, active monitoring was implemented in 20 to 23 different Points of Entry (PoE). The risk of introduction and establishment of the EMS at each PoE was re-evaluated annually to ensure that the monitoring focused on the highest risk sites. Different collection methods were used, including BG-Sentinel and Mosquito Magnet traps to collect host seeking female mosquitoes, oviposition traps to detect eggs, and larval sampling. The collected specimens were sorted and identified using morphological characteristics. The caught EMS and five percent of all collected mosquitoes (native and invasive) were molecularly identified to validate and confirm the morphological identification, and were subsequently deposited in a molecular reference collection. A specific molecular identification pipeline was developed to enable the proper identification of all mosquito species occurring in Belgium. Further, a morphological collection with a fair representation of the species and the most intact specimens sampled during the MEMO project was generated for future reference. Tissue and DNA are stored at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (Collection Identifier: IG34179).

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Quorum sensing (QS) in bacteria has been a well studied cellular communication phenomenon for decades. In recent years, such systems have been repurposed for the use of biosensors in both cellular and cell-free contexts as well as for inducible protein expression in non-traditional chassis organisms. Such biosensors are particularly intriguing when considering the association between the pathogenesis of some bacteria and the QS signaling intermediates. Considering this relationship, and considering the recent demonstration of the species L. plantarum WCFS1 as both a synthetic biology chassis and an organism capable of detecting a pathogen-associated QS molecule, we wanted to develop this organism as a QS sentinel. Using an approach combining techniques from both systems and synthetic biology, we identified a number of native QS response genes and altered associated promoter activity to tune the output of L. plantarum cultures exposed to N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone. The resulting engineered QS sentinel reinforces the potential of modified Lactic Acid Bacteria for use in human health promoting applications, and also demonstrates a simple rational workflow to engineer sentinel organisms to respond to any environmental or chemical stimuli. Overall design: L. plantarum was treated with 3OC12 at OD600 of 0.5 and RNA was extracted after one doubling for transcriptomic analysis.

This phenomenon was observed in plants where mutations in some RNA-related factors lead to the production of RNA-quality control small interfering RNAs and several mutants show enhanced silencing of reporter transgenes. To assess the potential of RNAi activation on endogenous transcripts, we sequenced small RNAs from a set of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in various RNA metabolism pathways. We observed a global production of siRNAs caused by inefficient pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation leading to read-through transcription into downstream antisense genes. In addition, in the lsm1a lsm1b double mutant, we identified NIA1, SMXL5, and several miRNA-targeted mRNAs as producing siRNAs, a group of transcripts suggested being especially sensitive to deficiencies in RNA metabolism. However, in most cases, RNA metabolism perturbations do not lead to the widespread production of siRNA derived from mRNA molecules. This observation is contrary to multiple studies based on reporter transgenes and suggests that only a very high accumulation of defective mRNA species caused by specific mutations or substantial RNA processing defects trigger RNAi pathways. Overall design: Small RNA profiles of ahg2-1, ccr4a, pab2 pab4, upf1-5, upf3-1, lsm1a lsm1b, ncb4, cstf64-2, fy-2 and rsr1-2 mutant plants with Col-0 wild type plants (three biological replicates) in three experimental sets. Set 1: Col0_1, lsm1a lsm1b, ncb4, upf1-5 and upf3-1. Set 2: Col0_2, ahg2-1, ccr4a, pab2 pab4, fy-2 and rsr1-2. Small RNA-seq data for Col-0 plants matching cstf64-2 mutant from set 3 are part of the earlier submission: GSE99600. Samples for small RNA-seq in GSE99600 submission and cstf64-2 small RNA-seq in this experiment were prepared in parallel from plants grown at the same time.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Algorithms for remote sensing of suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll concentration are quite mature and applications relating to coastal sediment transport and environmental monitoring are routinely using satellite data. The challenge for researchers is now to estimate more than just concentration. Sediment transport users want spatial and temporal information on particle size and composition. Marine biologists and water quality managers want information on phytoplankton and benthic community composition, which is particularly difficult to obtain from remote sensing in turbid waters. The advent of spaceborne hyperspectral instruments offers the potential to yield more information on aquatic particles, both algal and non-algal.</p><p>In the HYPERMAQ project, algorithms will be developed for hyperspectral sensors to retrieve information on particle size and type, and, where possible, species of micro-and macro-algae.</p><p>Fieldwork to calibrate and validate these algorithms will be made in Belgian coastal and inland waters with intensive measurements of micro-and macro-algae and non-algal particles. Continuous measurements will also be made for satellite product validation, supported by the design of azimuthally rotating hyperspectral spectroradiometer systems deployed on platforms and buoys.</p><p>International partners from Argentina and China and France will contribute expertise by participating in Belgian fieldwork and hosting fieldwork in their own regions and by supplying/testing algorithms from/to their own regions to assess generality and any need for regional calibration.

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Our ability to directly measure and monitor poor nutrition in individual animals and ecological communities is hampered by methodological limitations. These limitations prevent the accurate quantification of nutritional status in individuals with an unknown nutritional history. In this study, we use nutrigenomics to identify potential nutritional biomarkers in the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia pulex, a ubiquitous primary consumer and sentinel of environmental change. We grew animals in 6 ecological relevant nutritional treatments; low carbon (food), low phosphorus, low nitrogen, low calcium, high Cyanobacteria and nutrient replete. We extracted RNA for sequencing before using a bioinformatics pipeline to identify genes that were highly nutrient responsive and capable of predicting nutritional status with a high degree of accuracy. This is a key step in uncovering and explaining the causes and consequences of nutritional limitation in animal consumers and their responses to small- and large-scale changes in biogeochemical cycles

TI  - Fenlong-ridging promotes microbial activity in sugarcane: a soil and root metabarcoding survey
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Fenlong-ridging (FL) is a new conservation tillage technique that has been shown to increase crop yields without additional fertilization. Little is known about the role that microbes play in medi-ating the growth-promoting effects of FL, and this restricts further application and improvement of FL. Here, we characterized variation in the soil and root microbial diversity of sugarcane (GT44) under FL and traditional turn-over plough tillage (CK) by conducting 16S RNA and ITS metabarcoding surveys; we also measured several phenotypic traits to determine sugarcane yields and analyzed the physical and chemical properties of soil. We found that (i) the height of sugarcane plants was 9% greater under FL than under CK at six months of growth, suggesting that FL increased sugarcane yield; (ii) the content of organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium was lower in soil under FL than under CK, suggesting that the utilization of soil nutrients was greater in FL soil; (iii) FL promoted the activity of endophytic microbes in the roots, and these diverse microbial taxa might have an effect on sugarcane yield and soil chemical properties; and (iv) Sphingomonas, Rhizobium, and Paraburkholderia and Tala-romyces, Didymella, and Fusarium were top three most abundant genera of bacteria and fungi, re-spectively, in soil and root samples. Strains from Rhizobium and Talaromyces were isolated to veri-fy the results of the metabarcoding survey. Overall, our study provided new insights into the role of microbes in mediating the growth-promoting effects of FL, and these findings could be used to further improve applications of this novel conservation tillage technology.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon and rectum. And TP2 is a capsular polysaccharide exacted from Bacteroides fragilis ZY-132. This study focused on the pharmacokinetics of TP2. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of different doses of TP2 on the DNBS-induced enteritis model to find an appropriate dosage for pharmacokinetic studies. In pharmacokinetic studies, we found that TP2 was mainly distributed in the cecum and colorectum, and cannot be digested by gastrointestinal juice in vitro, but change the abundance of the intestinal flora.

TI  - Evaluation of intestinal response to zinc restriction and zinc sources in pigs
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - We evaluated the intestinal responses of pigs under zinc restriction and under different zinc sources through RNA-seq of ileal samples. We identified changes in genes related to zinc transport, immune response, cell proliferation, DNA damage and stress resposne. Our findings demonstrate that swine intestine is responsive to zinc restriction and can be a model sentinel tissue for human zinc deficiency. Further research is needed to define the intestinal responses to organic and inorganic zinc sources. Overall design: RNA seq of ileum of zinc restricted pigs and pigs supplemented with 100 ppm and 50 ppm of zinc by organic and inorganic zinc sources. n=7 for ZnR group, n=8 ZnCl100, ZnCl50, LQ100 groups, n=9 for LQ50 group Finisher pigs (77.5 2.5 kg) were randomly assigned to one of the five diets: a diet without added zinc (ZnR), ZnR with either 50 ppm or 100 ppm of zinc supplemented from organic (LQ100, LQ50) and inorganic sources (ZnCl100, ZnCl50).

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Backgrounds: The present study addressed whether V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), constitutively expressed in kidney macrophages, has a protective role in tubulointerstitial fibrotic transformation after acute antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis. Methods: Wild-type (WT) and VISTA-deficient (Vsir-/-, KO) mice were treated with nephrotoxic serum to induced acute antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis, and their cytokine and fibrosis profiles were compared. Results: VISTA was highly expressed in kidney macrophages (resident more than infiltrating subset). If VISTA was depleted, tubules suffered further damage after glomerular injury. In damaged Vsir-/- mice, the contact frequency of macrophages with infiltrated T cells increased, and then the immunometabolic characteristics of T cells changed to overproduction of interferon-gamma. The Vsir-/- parenchymal tissue cells responded to this altered milieu as more producing interleukin-9, which augmented tubulointerstitial fibrosis and irreversible kidney dysfunction. The blocking antibodies against interferon-gamma and interleukin-9 protected above pathological process by VISTA depletion. Conclusions: VISTA is a sentinel protein of kidney macrophages, which prevents tubulointerstitial fibrosis via interferon-gamma-interleukin-9 axis after acute antibody-mediated glomerular injury. Overall design: single-cell RNA sequencing data of 8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (Vsir-/-)

AB  - To sample pitfall animals, we filtered storage ethanol and employed metagenomic barcoding methodologies to amplify and sequence extracted DNA from the filtrate for two regions of a mitochondrial gene. We assigned taxonomic names to these sequences at 97% similarity to reference sequences and calculated local taxonomic richness at the levels of species, genus, family, and order. We calculated local species richness for 10 common arthropod taxa and the Annelida and Mollusca. Additionally, we estimated regional species richness using expert-identified samples of three NEON sentinel taxa: Carabidae, Culicidae, and Ixodida. We used generalized linear models to describe the relationships between taxonomic richness and spatial, climatic, and abundance predictor variables.

AB  - This dataset contains data for various studies undertaken by the Health Services Unit (HSU) of the KEMRI - Wellcome Trust Research Programme. The studies include: Clinical Information Network collaboration (CIN) The Clinical Information Network (CIN) is a collaboration initiated in 2013 to help support the use of information to improve hospital care for children and newborns admitted to county hospitals; and provide information to guide policy and practice in each county and in Kenya as a whole. CIN is a collaboration between KWTRP, Kenya Paediatric Association (KPA), Ministry of Health (MOH) Kenya, and County Hospitals. Supportive Care and Antibiotics for Severe Pneumonia among Hospitalised Children (SEARCH) A Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial. This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial that seeks to compare injectable antibiotic treatments and tube feeding versus fluid treatment for children with severe pneumonia. Specifically, the study aims to address two questions: (1) whether either intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or ceftriaxone is superior to benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin (standard care) for the treatment of children hospitalized with severe pneumonia and (2) therefore whether nasogastric feeding is superior to intravenous fluid therapy for supportive management of children with severe pneumonia. Malaria (RTS,S/AS01) Vaccine Sentinel Evaluation Kenyas Ministry of Health (MoH) working with WHO is conducting phased introduction of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine (Mosquirix) in the lake region of Kenya, which still has a high burden of malaria disease. During this phased introduction sub-counties within 8 counties. Six hospitals currently in CIN have been selected as sentinel hospitals. Roles of Nurses in Delivery of Quality Care This study aims at raising the profile of the nursing profession by developing and pre-testing tools, co-designed with the nursing community, to produce nurse specific indicators on quality of care which will translate into demonstrating the tasks nurses undertake on routine basis and therefore their vital role in improving quality of care. The System Strategy to Optimise Neonatal Inpatient Care in Kenyan Hospitals (SONIC) The research project aims to work with hospitals paediatricians, senior nurses and their administration to co-design better approaches to providing care on Newborn Units in hospitals. Additional projects Include: (1) Work in implementation science to understand why policies do not get implemented and (2) developing novel training approaches using mobile technology such as the development of a simulation training tools on smartphones (www.oxlifeproject.org).

AB  - (Background and Purpose) Recently, companies have begun developing communication strategies based on empirical marketing to increase brand preference and promote communication. Experiential marketing is interpreted as the new normal, that provides valuable experiences along with virtual participation through five senses and cognitive marketing. Therefore, this study examines the strategic and functional characteristics of the spatial design of an exhibition hall, focusing on the lifestyle according to the experiential marketing strategy. (Method) First, this study derives experience elements through preliminary research related to experiential marketing. Second, it derives the concept, type, and characteristics of a lifestyle brand's exhibition space. Third, visiting surveys and online research are possible online and offline among domestic and foreign lifestyle brands; five companies to be surveyed are selected to analyze cases in units of five points. Through this, sintering characteristics can be derived by linking the characteristics of the showroom’s spatial design with the brand experience, and meaningful directions of the lifestyle brand can be presented through data analysis. (Results) This study established the direction of the space design analysis of the showroom exhibition hall through the examination of the attributes of the commercial exhibition space paradigm. Five elements of experiential marketing were applied; based on the derivation through case analysis of five companies, it was revealed that they were applied differently according to the purpose of the space. Cultural enjoyment through emotional, cognitive, and behavioral experiences is recognized as the intangible value of the lifestyle brand exhibition space, countering consumer fatigue. In addition to the main showroom, this exercise has been branded as a single configuration to promote experience expansion. It is also actively used to promote communication with consumers through preoccupation of geographic locations aimed at direct experience. (Conclusions) The reason lifestyle brands are a future-oriented trend in the value era is that they expand their value and build a worldview with customers who adapt to their philosophy. In the era of experience-oriented mining, the showroom space plan, which offers experiences and lifestyles, will be thorough audio-oriented brand communication as an "innovation" rather than an alternative to offline space. If the showroom space design of a representative experiential marketing strategy is developed as a brand differentiator and applied as an experiential marketing strategy, it can be applied as a prospective methodology for brand management in the future.

AB  - The Global Human Settlement Layer: Population and Built-Up Estimates, and Degree of Urbanization Settlement Model Grid data set provides gridded data on human population (GHS-POP), built-up area (GHS-BUILT), and degree of urbanization (GHS-SMOD) across four time periods: 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2014 (BUILT) or 2015 (POP, SMOD). GHS-BUILT describes the percent built-up area for each 30 arc-second grid cell (approximately 1 km at the equator) based on Landsat imagery from each of the four time periods. GHS-POP consists of census data from the 2010 round of global census from Gridded Population of the World, Version 4, Revision 10 (GPWv4.10) spatially-allocated within census units based on the percent built-up areas from GHS-BUILT. GHS-SMOD uses GHS-BUILT and GHS-POP in order to develop a standardized classification of degree of urbanization grid. The original data from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC-EC) has been combined into a single data package in GeoTIFF format and reprojected from Mollweide Equal Area into WGS84 at 9 arc-second and 30 arc-second horizontal resolutions in order to support integration with a variety of global raster data sets.

AB  - This study compared the Gapocheoksa-rok on the official side, which is the record of the year of Gabo in 1894, and the Hakchojeon, which was recently expected by academia, to analyze whether the work of Hakcho(鶴樵, 朴鶴來, 1864~1942) has historical value. In recent years, as Donghak-related research in Gyeongsang Province has become more active, this awareness of the problem stems from the seriousness of expanding to research that there is an error in the character notation of Park Hakrae as well as the details and dates of his Donghak’s entry. At a time when Donghak research in Yecheon, Gyeongsang Province has been conducted based on data from the government, a thorough analysis of Hakchojeon is required as data representing Donghak military have been discovered. To this end, the research tried to establish an objective perspective by comparing Park Hakrae’s Hakchojeon, who participated in the Donghak Peasant Movement, and Gapocheoksa-rok, which recorded the suppression process at the headquarters to stop Donghak Peasant Army.The reason why academia has welcomed the Hakchojeon is because of its historical value. However, Hakchojeon is read as a literary work dealing with a character’s heroic narrative rather than records related to dynamics and peasant movements, and it differs from Gapocheoksa-rok, an official record of the Battle of Hwaji Dongsan. Given the historical fact that the Donghak Peasant Army in Yecheon was disbanded after the Battle of Hwaji Dongsan in Gyeongsang Province, the record of Hakchojeon is hard to trust. For any reason, it would be reasonable to approach historical facts or characters as literary values rather than historical values. Therefore, the conclusion of this study is that Hakchojeon is more important than approaching it as a historical record that deals with a character’s life.

TI  - Assessment of service quality at unsignalized intersections using traffic simulation and computational intelligence
T2  - TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this study is to examine the service quality of unsignalized intersections based on the perception of automobile drivers. This was achieved by developing Automobile Level of Service (ALOS) models using two computational intelligence methods - Functional Linked Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) and Differential Evolution (DE). The required data were collected at 47 unsignalized intersections in India with widely varying driving environments. Traffic simulation models were developed to estimate parameters that could not be directly measured in the field. DE model exhibited higher prediction ef?ciencies with coef?cient of determination (R-2 ) of 0.94 and 0.93 for training and testing datasets, respectively. Applying sensitivity analysis, significant parameters affecting ALOS were arranged in descending rank of their relative influence. Pavement condition is the most significant parameter influencing ALOS of unsignalized intersections. The proposed model will help the transportation administrators in prioritizing the key factors for investment in infrastructural development.

TI  - Age-related transcriptome changes in melanoma patients with tumor-positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - AGING-US
M3  - Article
AB  - Age is an important factor for determining the outcome of melanoma patients. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is also a strong predictor of survival for melanoma. Paradoxically, older melanoma patients have a lower incidence of SLN metastasis but a higher mortality rate when compared with their younger counterparts. The mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain unknown. This study uses three independent datasets of RNA samples from patients with melanoma metastatic to the SLN to identify age-related transcriptome changes in SLNs and their association with outcome. Microarray was applied to the first dataset of 97 melanoma patients. NanoString was performed in the second dataset to identify the specific immune genes and pathways that are associated with recurrence in younger versus older patients. qRT-PCR analysis was used in the third dataset of 36 samples to validate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from microarray and NanoString. These analyses show that FOS, NR4A, and ITGB1 genes were significantly higher in older melanoma patients with positive SLNs. IRAK3- and Wnt10b-related genes are the major pathways associated with recurrent melanoma in younger and older patients with tumor-positive SLNs, respectively. This study aims to elucidate age-related differences in SLNs in the presence of nodal metastasis.

TI  - EviSIP: using evidence to change practice through mentorship - an innovative experience for reproductive health in the Latin American and Caribbean regions
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Maternal mortality is unacceptably high in our region. In 2015, the Latin American Center for Perinatology and Women ' s Reproductive Health (CLAP) created a regional network of institutions including 16 countries, committed to improving epidemiological surveillance and healthcare of women in a situation of abortion or near miss event, using a common platform, the Perinatal Information System (SIP). The objective of the current pilot project was to test a new method of study called EviSIP (Evidence from SIP), a method of generating information on maternal near miss and abortion for the region. We describe the implementation of this initiative in reproductive healthcare facilities using SIP. Junior researchers/clinicians from these countries were included, along with expert researchers in reproductive health from across the world. Articles were produced with data on maternal near miss and abortion gathered from the SIP of each participating sentinel center; and recommendations from experts. EviSIP was the first joint workspace to discuss patient outcomes after treatment of abortion or near miss cases, with data analysis of each Sentinel Center; discuss and analyze data among centers, at a country and regional level; discuss the main outcomes and their impact on changing procedures and policies; strengthen the operational research capacity of the centers; develop and encourage the publication of scientific articles. The EviSIP initiative also promoted training of healthcare professionals in research. EviSIP provided a unique opportunity to train for research and mentorship and was pivotal to the production of scientific knowledge of reproductive health in the region.

TI  - Destriping and evaluating FY-3D MERSI-2 data with the moment matching method based on synchronous reference image
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-2) is a payload of the China meteorological satellite FY-3D. The sensor bands 24 (10.3 to 11.3 mu m) and 25 (11.5 to 12.5 mu m) images, which are most suitable for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, have higher spatial resolution than that of similar sensors. However, bands 24/25 images with spatial resolution of 250 m (hereafter bands 24/25 250-m images) have considerable horizontal stripe noise caused by the limitation of the sensor imaging system's multi-detector parallel scanning and the multiple interferences from space. Thus, the application value of LST retrieval using bands 24/25 250-m images is severely affected. At present, existing methods used to remove stripe noise often cannot retain the spectral information of the original image. Our research considers that MERSI-2 bands 24/25 images with spatial resolution of 1000 m (hereafter bands 24/25 1000-m images) and no stripe noise can provide reasonable reference statistics for bands 24/25 250-m images. Thus, the moment matching method considering synchronous reference image is applied to remove the stripe noise of bands 24/25 250-m images in the land area. Results shows that the moment matching method considering the synchronous reference image can effectively remove the stripe noise in the land area. In addition, quantitative evaluation criteria, such as information entropy H, mean-absolute-error (MAE), and peak signal-to-noise ratio, are better than those of the traditional moment matching method. After destriping, the LST values using MERSI-2 data are retrieved with better effect and decrease by 0.339 and 0.504 K using MAE and root-mean-square error, respectively, in contrast to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST product.

TI  - Reanalysis datasets outperform other gridded climate products in vegetation change analysis in peripheral conservation areas of Central Asia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental research requires long-term climate data. Yet, meteorological infrastructure is missing in the vast majority of the world's protected areas. Therefore, gridded products are frequently used as the only available climate data source in peripheral regions. However, associated evaluations are commonly biased towards well observed areas and consequently, station-based datasets. As evaluations on vegetation monitoring abilities are lacking for regions with poor data availability, we analyzed the potential of several state-of-the-art climate datasets (CHIRPS, CRU, ERA5-Land, GPCC-Monitoring-Product, IMERG-GPM, MERRA-2, MODIS-MOD10A1) for assessing NDVI anomalies (MODIS-MOD13Q1) in two particularly suitable remote conservation areas. We calculated anomalies of 156 climate variables and seasonal periods during 2001-2018, correlated these with vegetation anomalies while taking the multiple comparison problem into consideration, and computed their spatial performance to derive suitable parameters. Our results showed that four datasets (MERRA-2, ERA5-Land, MOD10A1, CRU) were suitable for vegetation analysis in both regions, by showing significant correlations controlled at a false discovery rate<5% and in more than half of the analyzed areas. Cross-validated variable selection and importance assessment based on the Boruta algorithm indicated high importance of the reanalysis datasets ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 in both areas but higher differences and variability between the regions with all other products. CHIRPS, GPCC and the bias-corrected version of MERRA-2 were unsuitable and not important in both regions. We provide evidence that reanalysis datasets are most suitable for spatiotemporally consistent environmental analysis whereas gauge- or satellite-based products and their combinations are highly variable and may not be applicable in peripheral areas.

TI  - The first sixty days of COVID-19 in a humanitarian response setting: a descriptive epidemiological analysis of the outbreak in South Sudan
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. South Sudan, a low-income and humanitarian response setting, reported its first case of COVID-19 on April 5, 2020. We describe the socio-demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in this setting. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of data for 1,330 confirmed COVID-19 cases from the first 60 days of the outbreak. Results: among the 1,330 confirmed cases, the mean age was 37.1 years, 77% were male, 17% were symptomatic with 95% categorized as mild, and the case fatality rate was 1.1%. Only 24.7% of cases were detected through alerts and sentinel site surveillance, with 95% of the cases reported from the capital, Juba. Epidemic doubling time averaged 9.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7 - 13.4), with an attack rate of 11.5 per 100,000 population. Test positivity rate was 18.2%, with test rate per 100,000 population of 53 and mean test turn-around time of 9 days. The case to contact ratio was 1: 2.2. Conclusion: this 2-month initial period of COVID-19 in South Sudan demonstrated mostly young adults and men affected, with most cases reported as asymptomatic. Systems' limitations highlighted included a small proportion of cases detected through surveillance, low testing rates, low contact elicitation, and long collection to test turn-around times limiting the country's ability to effectively respond to the outbreak. A multi-pronged response including greater access to testing, scale-up of surveillance, contact tracing and community engagement, among other interventions are needed to improve the COVID-19 response in this setting.

TI  - Validation of Landsat land surface temperature product in the conterminous United States using in situ measurements from SURFRAD, ARM, and NDBC sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1982, Landsat series of satellite sensors continuously acquired thermal infrared images of the Earth's land surface. In this study, Landsat 5, 7, and 8 land surface temperature (LST) products in the conterminous United States from 2009 to 2019 were validated using in situ measurements collected at 6 SURFRAD (Surface Radiation Budget Network) sites, 6 ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) sites, and 9 NDBC (National Data Buoy Center) sites. The results indicate that a relatively consistent performance among Landsat 5, 7, and 8 LST products is obtained for most sites due to the consistent LST retrieval algorithm in conjunction with the same atmospheric compensation and land surface emissivity (LSE) correction methods for Landsat 5, 7, and 8 sensors. Large bias and root mean square error (RMSE) of Landsat LST product are obtained at some vegetated sites due to incorrect LSE estimation where LSE is invariant with the increasing of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Except for the sites with incorrect LSE estimation, a mean bias (RMSE) of the differences between Landsat LST and in situ LST is 1.0 K (2.1 K) over snow-free land surfaces, -1.1 K (1.6 K) over snow surfaces, and -0.3 K (1.1 K) over water surfaces.

TI  - Pediatric Nonaccidental Trauma: Experience at a Level 1 Trauma Center
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Pediatric nonaccidental trauma (NAT) is difficult to diagnose. Several isolated injuries in NAT could happen in the setting of accidental trauma (AT), and having a high index of suspicion is important to correctly identify abuse. NAT has a significant mortality rate if the sentinel event is not adequately diagnosed, and the infant is not separated from the perpetrator. Level 1 pediatric trauma centers (PTC) see a significant number of NAT. We evaluated the injury patterns of NAT admissions at our level 1 PTC. Methods. Retrospective analysis of all cases of NAT for children under the age of two admitted at an ACS level 1 pediatric trauma center between the years of 2016 and 2018. Charts were queried for demographic data, injury patterns, mortality, and disposition. Correlation between disposition status and injury patterns was performed. The Fisher Exact test and student t-test were used to study the significance of differences in categorical and continuous data, respectively. Results. 32/91 (35%) trauma patients under the age of two years were diagnosed as NAT in the three-year study period. 21/32 (39%) male and 11/26 (42%) female admissions were confirmed NAT (p=NS). 20 were under 1 year of age, and 12 were aged between 1 and 2 years (p=NS). 13 (41%) were Caucasian, 6 (19%) were Hispanic/Latino, 11 (34%) were Black, and 2(6%) were of unknown ethnicity (p=NS). Facial, torso, lower extremity, retinal, and internal organ injury were significantly more common with NAT. Medicaid coverage was noted in 31/32 (97%) NAT patients. 20/32 (62.5%) patients were legally displaced as a result of the NAT. Conclusion. 1/3(rd) of all admissions at a pediatric level 1 trauma center were identified as NAT. A high index of suspicion is necessary to not miss NAT, as injury patterns are variable. Nearly 1/3(rd) of all victims go back to the same environment where they sustained NAT increasing their susceptibility to future NAT.

TI  - Predicting long-term dynamics of soil salinity and sodicity on a global scale
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of spatiotemporal distribution and likelihood of (re)occurrence of salt-affected soils is crucial to our understanding of land degradation and for planning effective remediation strategies in face of future climatic uncertainties. However, conventional methods used for tracking the variability of soil salinity/sodicity are extensively localized, making predictions on a global scale difficult. Here, we employ machine-learning techniques and a comprehensive set of climatic, topographic, soil, and remote sensing data to develop models capable of making predictions of soil salinity (expressed as electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract) and sodicity (measured as soil exchangeable sodium percentage) at different longitudes, latitudes, soil depths, and time periods. Using these predictive models, we provide a global-scale quantitative and gridded dataset characterizing different spatiotemporal facets of soil salinity and sodicity variability over the past four decades at a similar to 1-km resolution. Analysis of this dataset reveals that a soil area of 11.73 Mkm(2) located in nonfrigid zones has been salt-affected with a frequency of reoccurrence in at least three-fourths of the years between 1980 and 2018, with 0.16 Mkm(2) of this area being croplands. Although the net changes in soil salinity/sodicity and the total area of salt-affected soils have been geographically highly variable, the continents with the highest salt-affected areas are Asia (particularly China, Kazakhstan, and Iran), Africa, and Australia. The proposed method can also be applied for quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of other dynamic soil properties, such as soil nutrients, organic carbon content, and pH.

TI  - Identification of Risk Factors Associated with Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis for Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. This study aimed to identify clinicopathological factors related to the extent of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in early-stage BC patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Methods. This was a retrospective analysis of 566 patients in cT1-2N0M0 with 1-2 positive SLNs that underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital. The clinical and pathologic data from these patients were analyzed. Results. Of these 566 patients, 235 (41.5%) exhibited NSLN metastases. Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of positive SLNs (odds ratio (OR) = 1.511; P=0.038), the ratio of metastatic/dissected SLNs (SLN metastasis rate) (OR = 2.124; P<0.001), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR = 1.503; P=0.022) were all independent predictors of NSLN metastasis. Patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 of these risk factors exhibited NSLN metastases in 29.3%, 35.7%, 50.8%, and 68.3% of cases, respectively. We additionally found that the number of positive SLNs (OR = 3.582; P<0.001), SLN metastasis rate (OR = 2.505; P=0.001), LVI (OR = 2.010; P=0.004), and HER2 overexpression (OR = 1.774; P=0.034) were all independent predictors of N2 disease. When individuals had 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of these risk factors, they had four or more involved ALNs in 5.2%, 10.8%, 21.1%, 37.5%, and 70.6% of cases, respectively. Conclusion. These results suggest that the number of positive SLNs, the SLN metastasis rate, and LVI are all significant predictors of ALN status in BC patients that have 1-2 positive SLNs and that have undergone ALND. In addition, HER2 overexpression was a significant predictor of N2 disease.

TI  - Ice thickness distribution and volume estimation of Burqin Glacier No. 18 in the Chinese Altay Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the thickness distribution and volume of glacier ice is highly important for glaciological applications; however, detailed measurements of the ice thickness of many glaciers in the Chinese Altay Mountains remain lacking. Burqin Glacier No. 18 is a northeast-orientated cirque glacier located on the southern side of the Altay Mountains. This study used PulseEKKO (R) PRO 100A enhancement ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to survey the ice thickness and volume of Burqin Glacier No. 18 in summer 2018. Together with GPR surveying, spatial distributed profiles of the GPR measurements were concurrently surveyed using the real-time kinematic (RTK) global navigation satellite system (GNSS, Unistrong E650). Besides, we used QuickBird, WorldView-2, and Landsat TM to delineate accurate boundary of the glacier for undertaking estimation of glacier ice volume. GPR measurements revealed that the basal topography of profile B1-B2 was flat, the basal topography of profile C1-C2 presented a V-type form, and the basal topography of profile D1-D2 had a typical U-type topographic feature because the bedrock near the central elevation of the glacier was relatively flat. The longitudinal profile A1-A2 showed a ladder-like distribution. Glacier ice was thin at the terminus and its thickness increased gradually from the elevation of approximately 2620 m a.s.l. along the main axis of the glacier tongue with an average value of 80 (+/- 1) m. The average ice thickness of the glacier was determined as 27 (+/- 2) m and its total ice volume was estimated at 0.031 (+/- 0.002) km(3). Interpretation of remote sensing images indicated that during 1989-2016, the glacier area reduced from 1.30 to 1.17 km(2) (reduction of 0.37%/a) and the glacier terminus retreated at the rate of 8.48 m/a. The mean ice thickness of Burqin Glacier No. 18 was less than that of the majority of other observed glaciers in China, especially those in the Qilian Mountains and Central Chinese Tianshan Mountains; this is probably attributable to differences in glacier type and climatic setting.

TI  - Modelling rabi crop health in flood plain region of India using time-series Landsat data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work intended to model the vegetation health index (VHI) of rabi crop and explored its time series change (1990-2019) at pixel scale using Landsat satellite imageries. Identification of consistency level of rabi crop was another objective. VHI was estimated by integrating crop condition index (CCI) and temperature condition index (TCI). The CCI and TCI were derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST). 80% of the study area covered by rabi crop with 8.73% of variability. Remarkable change in crop health (VHI) was detected in the last 30 years. 5% of rabi cropped area was under good health category in the present decade (2010-2019), while it was around 10% during 1990-2009. During last decade, the poor health category of rabi crop was only 7.40% area, while it reached to 66.74% in the present decade. Good VHI area was getting fragmented and vice versa.

TI  - Head and neck cutaneous melanoma: 5-year survival analysis in a Serbian university center
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Head and neck melanoma (HNM) is specific from the anatomical and etiopathogenetic aspects. In addition to morphopathological parameters, rich vascularization and lymphatic drainage of the head and neck affect the occurrence of lymphogenic and hematogenous metastases, as well as the metastases on both sides of the neck. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study included cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent surgery at a clinical center over a 10-year period. The clinical follow-up was at least 60 months. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the survival analysis. The predictor effect of certain independent variables on a given dichotomous dependent variable (survival) was measured by the Cox regression analysis. Results The analysis of demographic and clinical characteristics of 116 patients with HNM revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in age and gender in the total sample. Thirty-three (28.45%) patients were already in stage III or IV of the disease at the first examination, which affected the overall survival rate. The overall 5-year survival was 30.2%. No statistically significant difference in 5-year survival was found in relation to age and location. The period without melanoma progression decreased progressively in the advanced stage. Forty-nine patients (42%) underwent surgery for lymphogenic metastases in the parotid region and/or neck during the follow-up. Conclusions Patients with HNM included in this study frequently presented an advanced stage of the disease at the first examination, which is reflected in a low rate of 5-year survival. Early diagnosis and adequate primary treatment can ensure longer survival.

TI  - Record-Breaking Increases in Arctic Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Caused by Exceptionally Large Ozone Depletion in 2020
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) performed between January and June 2020 at 10 Arctic and subarctic locations are compared with historical observations. Differences between 2020 and prior years are also assessed with total ozone column and UVR data from satellites. Erythemal (sunburning) UVR is quantified with the UV Index (UVI) derived from these measurements. UVI data show unprecedently large anomalies, occurring mostly between early March and mid-April 2020. For several days, UVIs observed in 2020 exceeded measurements of previous years by up to 140%. Historical means were surpassed by more than six standard deviations at several locations in the Arctic. In northern Canada, the average UVI for March was about 75% larger than usual. UVIs in April 2020 were elevated on average by about 25% at all sites. However, absolute anomalies remained below 3.0 UVI units because the enhancements occurred during times when the solar elevation was still low.Plain Language Summary The ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the Sun depends on the amount of ozone in the atmosphere. During March and April 2020, ozone concentrations in the Arctic atmosphere were exceptionally low and this led to large increases in UV radiation at the surface. These increases were quantified by analyzing data from ground-based instruments at 10 Arctic and subarctic locations, as well as satellite data. UV levels were quantified with the UV Index (UVI), which measures the amount of "sunburning" UVR. The greatest UVI increases were observed between early March and mid-April 2020. For several days, UVIs observed in 2020 exceeded measurements of previous years by up to 140%. In northern Canada, the average UVI for March was about 75% larger than usual. UVIs in April 2020 were elevated on average by about 25%. However, these large relative anomalies occurred early in the year when the Sun is still low in the sky. UVI increases remained therefore small in absolute terms and did not exceed typical summertime UVI values under clear skies.

TI  - What is the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of oral cancer in 2020?
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Approximately 70-80% of patients with cT1-2N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ultimately prove to have no cancer in the cervical lymphatics on final pathology after selective neck dissection. As a result, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been adopted during the last decade as a diagnostic staging method to intelligently identify patients who would benefit from formal selective lymphadenectomy or neck irradiation. While not yet universally accepted, SLNB is now incorporated in many national guidelines. SLNB offers a less invasive alternative to elective neck dissection (END), and has some advantages and disadvantages. SLNB can assess the individual drainage pattern and, with step serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry (IHC), can enable the accurate detection of micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITCs). Staging of the neck is improved relative to END with routine histopathological examination. The improvements in staging are particularly notable for the contralateral neck and the pretreated neck. However, for floor of mouth (FOM) tumors, occult metastases are frequently missed by SLNB due to the proximity of activity from the primary site to the lymphatics (the shine through phenomenon). For FOM cancers, it is advised to perform either elective neck dissection or superselective neck dissection of the preglandular triangle of level I. New tracers and techniques under development may improve the diagnostic accuracy of SLNB for early-stage OSCC, particularly for FOM tumors. Treatment of the neck (either neck dissection or radiotherapy), although limited to levels I-IV, remains mandatory for any positive category of metastasis (macrometastasis, micrometastasis, or ITCs). Recently, the updated EANM practical guidelines for SLN localization in OSCC and the surgical consensus guidelines on SLNB in patients with OSCC were published. In this review, the current evidence and results of SLNB in early OSCC are presented.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to estimate the trends in daytime land surface temperature (LST) and its relationship with other parameters such as elevation and land use/land cover (LULC) over the Ganga River Basin (GRB) during 2001-2019. The study examined monthly daytime clear-sky LST, elevation, LULC, snow cover area (SCA), clear-sky days, and aerosols data of the GRB. Annual mean clear-sky daytime LST has been declining at the rate -0.017 degrees C year(-1) over the basin during the study period. At seasonal scale, LST has been rising during monsoon (average rate of 0.026 degrees C year(-1)), whereas other seasons show a decline with the highest magnitude during winter season (-0.078, C-o year(-1)). The study observed pronounced warming trends (0.003 to 0.07 degrees C year(-1)) in post-monsoon above the elevation of 3000 m amsl indicating elevation-dependent warming (EDW) in the basin. The vagary in LST over the basin may be attributed to the changes in LULC, increasing aerosols loading, and rising hazy days.

TI  - Restoring steppe landscapes: patterns, drivers and implications in Russia's steppes
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Agricultural land abandonment across the steppe belt of Eurasia has provided an opportunity for the restoration of steppe landscapes in recent decades. However, global food demands are about to revert this trajectory and put restored steppe landscapes at risk. Objectives We analysed steppe development in southern Russia in the last 40 years, assessed its spatial patterns and drivers of change for several periods. Methods Using Landsat imagery, we mapped the permanent steppe and steppe restoration from 1990 to 2018. Based on regression tree models, we evaluate and explain its dynamics. Results were compared with district-level trends in land-use intensities of cropland. Results We found 70% of the steppe in 2018 represented permanent steppe and 30% of former cropland dominantly abandoned in the postsocialism (1990-2000). The permanent steppe and steppe restored in the postsocialism (1990-2000) were located far from settlements, on rough terrain and in districts of the Virgin Land Campaign (1954-1963). In recent decades, the patterns of steppe restoration (2000-2018) were mostly determined by unfavourable agroclimatic conditions and distance from grain storage facilities. The restoration pattern reflects regional differences in land-use intensities, e.g., isolated steppe patches mostly appeared in areas of intensive agricultural land-use. Conclusions Steppe restoration has appeared in areas marginal for agricultural production, with poor natural conditions and little human footprint. Consequently, the permanent steppe became less fragmented and a more continuous steppe landscape resulted. The remaining isolated steppe patches require attention in restoration programs as they are mostly located in areas of intensive agricultural land-use.

TI  - Aquatic habitat changes within the channelized and impounded Arkansas River, Arkansas, USA
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - River-wide changes in morphologic character following channelization and impoundment alter the occurrence and distribution of surface water and available habitats for aquatic organisms. Quantifying patterns of creation, redistribution or disappearance of habitats at river-wide and decadal spatiotemporal scales can promote understanding regarding trajectories of different habitat types following alteration and prospects of direct habitat enhancement projects within altered alluvial rivers. Newly available remote-sensing tools and databases may improve detection of river-wide changes in habitat through time. We used a combination of remote-sensing data and generalized linear models to assess changes in surface water coverage from 1984 to 2015 among aquatic habitats of 496 km of the Arkansas River within Arkansas, USA. Changes through time in surface area of permanent and episodically inundated areas - and thus the availability of aquatic habitat - were variable along the river. Overall, the river lost a total 2.1% of permanent and 12.1% of episodic water surface area. The general trend of loss of off-main-channel habitat and increased coverage of permanent water along main-channel habitats may indicate a long-term transition (i.e. ramp-type disturbance) within areas of the Arkansas River where backwaters are transitioning to terrestrial environments, and habitat heterogeneity in the main channel is decreasing. As such, a decadal-scale change of channel form and backwater habitats may be the dominant pattern with limited regeneration of diverse habitat types. Understanding changes to permanent and episodic water availability may aid predictions regarding ecological effects of channelization and impoundments, including both increases and decreases in riverine productivity, biotic diversity and population abundances through space and time. Water resource managers and biologists can use information regarding river-wide changes in habitat availability obtained through remote sensing data to direct river management practices, including dredging and side-channel construction, and to assess ecological responses to such changes.

TI  - Two-stage ship detection in synthetic aperture radar images based on attention mechanism and extended pooling
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images remains a challenging problem due to the particular imaging mechanism of SAR systems. The sizes of targets are relatively small and the scenes are large, indicating that the intersection over union value between the targets and anchors is probably small. In addition, SAR images are severely polluted by speckles under normal conditions. The edges of objects in SAR images are blurred. In this study, we proposed an improved object-detection framework based on a two-stage faster region-based convolutional neural network. A feature-enhancement module based on self-attention mechanism is designed to learn a target-oriented feature map, where the spatial attention and channel attention work simultaneously, such that targets can be highlighted and the speckles can be suppressed to a certain extent. Two separate feature maps serve as the input of the region proposal network to isolate the classification and regression tasks. Because only one category exists in the ship-detection task, correctly distinguishing targets from the background results in the correct detection of ships. In the final classification stage, an extended region-of-interest pooling operation is performed on the potential proposals and contexture information. The usage of extra information can improve target fine-tuning in the final network. To avoid ignoring small targets, we carefully set the anchors' parameters based on the analysis of ground truth and select the appropriate shapes of feature maps. With the help of these modifications, the proposed method can detect small, weak, and dense targets in SAR images. Ablation experiments over networks with different configurations prove that the proposed modules are working. Experiments on real SAR Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 images demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed object-detection framework. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Regional Variation in Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer in the US
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Question Is there an association between region and active surveillance for disease progression among US men with low-risk prostate cancer? Findings In this cohort study of 79 825 men from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Prostate with Watchful Waiting database, variations across SEER regions appeared to explain 17% of the observed differences in use of active surveillance after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and county health resources. Other factors, such as Black race, county-level socioeconomic factors, and specialist densities did not show an association, although Hispanic ethnicity showed a negative association with surveillance use. Meaning In this study, risk of overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer may be associated with where men live and should be considered to inform future initiatives and rational prostate cancer screening policy to improve the use of active surveillance.This cohort study examines variations in the use of active surveillance and watchful waiting in men with low-risk prostate cancer throughout the US.Importance Active surveillance (AS) is now recognized as the preferred management option for most low-risk prostate cancers to minimize risks of overtreatment. Despite increasing use of AS in the US, wide regional variability has been observed, and these regional variations in contemporary practice have not been well described. Objective To explore variations between county and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) regions in AS in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants A cohort study using the SEER Prostate with Watchful Waiting (WW) database linked to the County Area Health Resource File for detailed county-level demographics and physician distribution data was conducted from January 2010 to December 2015. Analysis was performed in October 2020. A total of 79 825 men with clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer eligible for AS or WW were included. Exposures Multiple patient-, county-, and SEER region-level factors, including age, year of diagnosis, county-level densities of urologists, radiation oncologists, primary care physicians, and SEER registry region. Main Outcomes and Measures Use of AS or WW as the initial reported treatment strategy were noted. Hierarchical mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to evaluate clustered random regional variation on use of AS or WW. Temporal trends by year in proportions of initial treatment type, as well as county-level local variation, were also estimated. Results Of 79 825 men (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [7.6] years, 11 292 [14.1%] non-Hispanic Black, 7506 [9.4%] Hispanic) with low-risk prostate cancer, the mean annualized percent increase in AS rates from 2010 to 2015 ranged from 6.3% in New Mexico to 81.0% in New Jersey. Differences across SEER regions accounted for 17% of the total variation in AS. Increasing age (51-60 years: odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% CI, 1.21-1.46; 61-70 years: OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.70-2.04; 71-80 years: OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.05-2.50) was associated with greater odds of AS. Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85), T category (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84), and Medicaid enrollment (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.81) were associated with lower odds of AS. Black race, county-level socioeconomic factors (household income, educational level, and city type), and specialist densities were not associated with AS use. Conclusions and Relevance In this US cohort study based on the SEER-WW database, although the use of AS increased, considerable practice variation appeared to be associated with geographic location, but use of AS was not associated with Black race, specialty professional density, or socioeconomic factors. This small area variation underlies the broader national trends in AS practice and may inform policies aimed at continuing to affect risk-appropriate care for men throughout the US.

TI  - Extreme Outliers in Lower Stratospheric Water Vapor Over North America Observed by MLS: Relation to Overshooting Convection Diagnosed From Colocated Aqua-MODIS Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convectively injected water vapor (H2O) in the North American (NA) summer lowermost stratosphere results in significant outliers in the 100-hPa H2O measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). MLS statistics from 15 years confirm that the NA region contains over 60% of global 100-hPa H2O > 12 ppmv, despite having only similar to 1.8% of all MLS observations. A profile sampled in August 2019 stands out, with H2O = 26.3 ppmv, far exceeding the prior record and the median similar to 4.5-ppmv abundance in NA. This particular outlier is associated with a large overshooting convective event (OCE) that spanned multiple U.S. states and persisted for several hours. Colocation of the MLS data over NA with cloud observations from Aqua's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reveals the unique character of this case, as only 2.3% of MLS profiles are as close to an OCE and only 0.024% of OCEs cover as large an area within a 500-km perimeter of a profile.Plain Language Summary Large-scale convection over the North American continent during the summer can significantly moisten the lowermost stratosphere. This study provides statistical analysis of 15 years of humidity outliers observed from space, including a recent event that yielded an outlier that far exceeded typically observed background values and summer enhancements. It is shown that this sampled air mass was in close proximity to an exceptionally large and long-lived convective event. Further analysis reveals that these two factors help explain the largest humidity outliers.

TI  - Regional crop water use assessment using Landsat-derived evapotranspiration
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information on water use and availability at basin and field scales are important to ensure the optimized constructive uses of available water resources. This study was conducted with the specific objective to estimate Landsat-based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model across the state of South Dakota (SD), USA for the 1986-2018 (33-year) period. Validated ETa estimations (r(2) = 0.91, PBIAS = -4%, and %RMSE = 11.8%) were further used to understand the crop water-use characteristics and existing historic mono-directional (increasing/decreasing) trends over the eastern (ESD) and western (WSD) regions of SD. The crop water-use characteristics indicated that the annual cropland water uses across the ESD and WSD were more or less met by the precipitation amounts in the area. The ample water supply and distribution have led to high rainfed and low percentage of irrigated cropland (similar to 2.5%) in the state. The WSD faced greater crop-water use reductions than the ESD during drought periods. The landscape ETa responses across the state were found to be more sensitive than precipitation for the drought impact assessments. The Mann Kendall trend analysis revealed the absence of a significant trend (p > 0.05) in annual ETa at a regional scale due to the varying weather conditions in the state. However, about 12% and 9% cropland areas in the ESD and WSD, respectively, revealed a significant mono-directional trend at pixel scale ETa. Most of the pixels under significant trend showed an increasing trend that can be explained by the shift in agricultural practices, increased irrigated cropland area, higher productions, moisture regime shifts, and decreased risk of farming in the dry areas. The decreasing trend pixels were clustered in mid-eastern SD and could be the result of dynamic conversion of wetlands to croplands and decreased irrigation practices in the region. This study also demonstrates the tremendous potential and robustness of the SSEBop model, Landsat imagery, and remote sensing-based ETa modelling approaches in estimating consistent spatially distributed evapotranspiration.

TI  - Major Changes in Extreme Dust Events Dynamics Over the Arabian Peninsula During 2003-2017 Driven by Atmospheric Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust emitted from the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula (AP), in particular Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an important contributor to the northern hemispheric aerosol loading. Dust events over AP are frequent and persistent throughout the year, with a peak in occurrence and intensity between March and August. This study examines the variability of dust events that occurred over AP during 2003-2017 using long-term dust optical depth retrieved from MODIS satellite measurements. Dust profiles were derived from CALIOP satellite measurements to assess the vertical distributions of the dust events. Our analysis suggests that the formation of extreme dust events is primarily associated with strong high-pressure systems that occur over AP. Northerly Shamal winds transport dust aerosols from surrounding arid regions to the AP, amplifying the dust aerosol loading across the country. CALIOP dust profiles show that the dust aerosols reach up to 4 km height above sea level, with peak concentrations at an altitude around 1.5 km. Dry deposition of dust is the dominant removal process over the Arabian Gulf, and wet deposition of dust is the dominant removal process over the Red Sea. A total of 49 extreme dust events occurred during the period between 2003 and 2017, over a combined total of 207 days. We observe a significant increase in the frequency of dust events between 2007 and 2012, peaking in 2012, followed by a marked decrease in the following years. We attribute this sudden decline in dust activity after 2012 to enhanced winter rainfall, after noticing increased soil moisture and vegetation coverage during the dust seasons that followed wetter winters. A strengthened Red Sea trough in the middle and the upper altitudes produced favorable conditions for strong moisture convergence and increased rainfall over AP, which may have dampened dust activity during 2013-2017.

TI  - Assessment of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions and San Joaquin Valley PM<sub>2.5</sub> Impacts From Soils in California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils are a source of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), especially in regions with significant cropland where nitrogen (N) fertilizers are used to enhance crop yields. The magnitude of soil NOx emissions, however, varies substantially by region, depending on the local land use pattern and management activities. We estimated soil NOx emissions in California based on the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) biogeochemical model, linked to a detailed spatial-temporal differentiated California-specific database. The DNDC-generated surface fluxes were used in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to evaluate impacts of soil NOx emissions on formation of ambient particulate (PM2.5) nitrate in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) where cropland is the dominant land use. The DNDC-generated soil NOx emissions contribute approximately 1.1% of total anthropogenic NOx emissions in California, at an emission rate of roughly 24 t day(-1) (as NO2) statewide and 9 t day(-1) in the SJV. Cropland is the dominant source of soil NOx emissions in California, contributing nearly 60% of statewide soil NOx emissions, driven principally by fertilizer use. The PM2.5 nitrate concentrations simulated by CMAQ using the DNDC-generated soil NOx emissions are compatible with those observed in the SJV, suggesting that soil NOx emissions have limited impacts on PM2.5 nitrate formation in the atmosphere. Our emission and air quality modeling results are further supported by long-term ambient NOx-to-carbon monoxide (CO) and satellite NO2 data analyses in the SJV, which showed diurnal, monthly, and annual trends consistent with characteristics of NOx sources dominated by traffic combustion in both urban and agricultural regions.

TI  - Detecting the invasive fall armyworm pest incidence in farm fields of southern India using Sentinel-2A satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Damage of fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) on sorghum from the farmers' fields of southern India was assessed using space-borne data. Comparison of the Sentinel-2A satellite data of pre and post infestation periods revealed reduction in Leaf Area Index (LAI) in the infested fields. Groundtruth data confirmed that FAW infestation reduced LAI by 49.7%, biomass by 32.5% and grain yield by 51.8%. Infestation at Panicle Initiation (PI) stage caused maximum yield loss compared to flag leaf visible and boot stages. The interaction results showed FAW infestation at different crop stages had significant effect on biomass and yield, but not on LAI. Regression analysis with spectral vegetation indices revealed LAI (R-2: 0.82) and NDVI (R-2: 0.80) were significantly superior in identifying FAW infestation from the satellite data. This study demonstrates feasibility of site specific pest management and prevents further spread of the invasive FAW.

TI  - Simulating and Evaluating Global Aerosol Distributions With the Online Aerosol-Coupled CAS-FGOALS Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We implement an existing aerosol module named Spectral Radiation Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (CAS-FGOALS) model and simulate the global aerosol properties over 2002-2014. The simulated surface mass concentrations of individual aerosols generally reproduce the observed ones. The simulated spatial-temporal distributions of the aerosol optical depths (AODs) are evaluated with multisource satellite retrievals, and the simulated AOD, angstrom ngstrom Exponent (AE), and single scattering albedo (SSA) are further evaluated with the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. The spatial distribution of the modeled AOD is found to be generally comparable to the satellite retrievals. The interannual and seasonal variations of the modeled AOD over various aerosol regimes are also overall consistent with the AERONET observations. With respect to the AE, our model can reproduce the interannual variations fairly well over the dust dominant regions, and generally capture the seasonal variations over the industrial domain regions. Over the industrial domain regions, however, the systematic underestimation of the simulated AE is found, which is in part due to the biases of wind fields and overestimation of the relative humidity (RH) by the host model. With respect to the SSA, our model can also generally reproduce the observed seasonal variations, while the modeled values are typically lower than the observations, especially over North Africa.

TI  - Plant Hydraulic Stress Strategy Improves Model Predictions of the Response of Gross Primary Productivity to Drought Across China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to droughts, which have recently increased in incidence and severity, is a hot topic in research, but the role played by vegetation water use strategies remains unclear. Both the soil moisture stress (SMS) and plant hydraulic stress (PHS) strategies are used in land surface models, but their performance in simulating the terrestrial carbon cycle and its response to droughts in various climatic zones remains uncertain. In this study, we used Community Land Model Version 5 to simulate gross primary productivity (GPP) across four different climatic subregions of China during 2000-2015 to investigate the roles played by PHS and SMS in the response of GPP to dry events and dry or rainy years in various climate zones. Simulated GPP with the two strategies were overestimated by 2.0-2.3% for the entire China compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. GPP simulated using PHS configuration fit eddy covariance and MODIS data better than that obtained using SMS across China, except for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. PHS increased simulated GPP by 0.10-0.63 g C m(-2) day(-1) during dry events across different climatic regions because of root hydraulic lift but decreased GPP by 0.37-0.45 g C m(-2) day(-1) during growing season in the humid southeastern region because of high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and root hydraulic descent. Simulations forced by data collected locally in China performed better than those forced by CRUNCEP7 global data at the site but worse at the regional scale, in particular for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Characterizing ecosystem functional type patterns based on subtractive fuzzy cluster means using Sentinel-2 time-series data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of ecosystem functions are of great significance for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Ecosystem functional types (EFTs) are land surface areas similar in carbon dynamics that are not defined by the structure and composition of vegetation and represent the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem functions. However, identification of EFTs based on low-resolution remote sensing data cannot satisfy the needs of fine-scale characterization of regional ecosystem functionality patterns, and a more accurate and optimized method of identifying EFTs also deserves attention. Here, we characterize EFTs at a county scale based on subtractive fuzzy cluster means (SUBFCM) and Sentinel-2 time-series data. The normalized difference vegetation index, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and canopy water content and their derived variables in the growing season were selected as ecosystem functional indicators to characterize regional EFT diversity patterns. The correspondence analysis method was used to reveal relationships between the EFTs and land cover structure information, and further analysis of EFTs was performed with soil type data. Our results showed that the selected variables indicating carbon and water flux of the regional ecosystems could be adopted in ecosystem functional classification. The SUBFCM algorithm can automatically divide EFTs with faster convergence speed and reduced subjectivity. The obtained EFTs based on Sentinel-2 images reflected the internal structure of carbon balance well and the distribution pattern of ecosystem functional diversity at a fine scale. A reference for further optimization of the EFT identification algorithm and development of the understanding of spatial heterogeneity of temperate terrestrial ecosystem functions was provided.

TI  - Machine learning and geostatistical approaches for estimating aboveground biomass in Chinese subtropical forests
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a fundamental indicator of forest ecosystem productivity and health and hence plays an essential role in evaluating forest carbon reserves and supporting the development of targeted forest management plans. Methods Here, we proposed a random forest/co-kriging framework that integrates the strengths of machine learning and geostatistical approaches to improve the mapping accuracies of AGB in northern Guangdong Province of China. We used Landsat time-series observations, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data, and National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot measurements, to generate the forest AGB maps at three time points (1992, 2002 and 2010) showing the spatio-temporal dynamics of AGB in the subtropical forests in Guangdong, China. Results The proposed model was capable of mapping forest AGB using spectral, textural, topographical variables and the radar backscatter coefficients in an effective and reliable manner. The root mean square error of the plot-level AGB validation was between 15.62 and 53.78 t center dot ha(- 1), the mean absolute error ranged from 6.54 to 32.32 t center dot ha(- 1), the bias ranged from - 2.14 to 1.07 t center dot ha(- 1), and the relative improvement over the random forest algorithm was between 3.8% and 17.7%. The largest coefficient of determination (0.81) and the smallest mean absolute error (6.54 t center dot ha(- 1)) were observed in the 1992 AGB map. The spectral saturation effect was minimized by adding the PALSAR data to the modeling variable set in 2010. By adding elevation as a covariable, the co-kriging outperformed the ordinary kriging method for the prediction of the AGB residuals, because co-kriging resulted in better interpolation results in the valleys and plains of the study area. Conclusions Validation of the three AGB maps with an independent dataset indicated that the random forest/co-kriging performed best for AGB prediction, followed by random forest coupled with ordinary kriging (random forest/ordinary kriging), and the random forest model. The proposed random forest/co-kriging framework provides an accurate and reliable method for AGB mapping in subtropical forest regions with complex topography. The resulting AGB maps are suitable for the targeted development of forest management actions to promote carbon sequestration and sustainable forest management in the context of climate change.

TI  - Radiotherapy plays an important role in improving the survival outcome in patients with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer - a joint analysis of 4262 real world cases from two institutions
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo compare the survival outcomes between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and modified radical mastectomy (MRM), and to investigate the role of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with pT1-2N1M0 breast cancer.MethodsA total of 4262 women with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer treated at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 3858 patients underwent MRM, and 832 (21.6%) of them received postoperative RT (MRM+RT). A total of 404 patients received BCS plus postoperative RT (BCS+RT). All patients received axillary lymph node dissection, while 3.8% of them had upfront sentinel node biopsy. The association of survival outcomes with different surgical modalities (BCS vs. MRM) and the role of RT were evaluated using multivariable proportional hazards regression and confirmed by the propensity score-matching (PSM) method.ResultsAt a median follow-up of 71months (range of 6-230months), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the BCS and MRM groups were 96.5 and 92.7%, respectively (P=.001), and the corresponding 5-year disease-free-survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence (LRR) rates were 92.9 and 84.0%, and 2.0 and 7.0% (P=.001), respectively (P<.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that RT was an independent prognostic factor for improved OS (P=.001) and DFS (P=.009), and decreased LRR (P<.001). However, surgery procedure was not independently associated with either OS (P=.495), DFS (P=.204), or LRR (P=.996), which was confirmed by PSM analysis.ConclusionPostoperative radiotherapy rather than the surgery procedures was associated with superior survival outcomes in patients with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer.

This study investigates vegetation covers changes across the Qin Mountains region over the past three decades based on the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which were extracted from the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Our results show that the NDVI across the Qin Mountains have increased from 0.624 to 0.776 with annual change rates of 0.0053/a over the past 32 years. Besides, its abrupt point occurred in 2006 and the change rates after this point increased by 0.0094/a (R-2=0.8159, p<0.01) (2006-2018), which is higher than that in 1987-1999 and 1999-2006. The mean NDVI have changed in different elevation ranges. The NDVI in the areas below 3300 m increased, such increased is especially most obviously in the cropland. Most of the forest and grassland locate above 3300 m with higher increased rate. Before 2006, the temperature and reference evapotranspiration (PET) were the important driven factors of NDVI change below 3300 m. After afforestation, human activities become important factors that influenced NDVI changes in the low elevation area, but hydro-climatic factors still play an important role in NDVI increase in the higher elevations area.

TI  - EBLUP estimate of crop yield at sub-district level in Hisar district, Haryana, India using MODIS/Terra data
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was carried out to develop improved crop yield estimates for rice and wheat crops through the Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (EBLUP) procedure via the Fay-Herriot area level model at sub-district level in Hisar district. Villagewise crop cutting data and auxiliary remote sensing data (satellite imaginaries) derived from the MODIS Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) version 6 were used for model construction. It is noteworthy that the coefficient of variation of the developed EBLUP estimates was below 10% for almost all sub-districts. The study revealed a significant enhancement in the efficiency of the yield estimator in comparison to the direct estimator, which recommended that with the use of remote sensing data together with crop cutting experiment data, crop yield estimates can be obtained on a smaller scale than the district using existing crop cutting experiments in the district.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-1 data in mapping land-use and land cover in a complex seasonal landscape: a case study in coastal area of Vietnamese Mekong Delta
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of Sentinel-1 SAR data with high temporal and medium spatial resolutions along with its being unaffected by presence of cloud provided opportunities for using remote sensing in mapping LULCs with high temporal detail. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of applying Sentinel-1 data together with OBIA and machine learning in classifying LULC in a complex agricultural landscape in the coastal area of Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Three approaches including Sentinel-1 alone, integrative Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 and lastly, only Sentinel-2 were deployed to examine chance of improvement of classification accuracy metrics on using Sentinel-1 data. The result showed that SAR data could capture seasonal patterns of different LULC classes. Also, supplementing Sentinel-1 can improve classification overall accuracy especially on integrating with optical data. However, Sentinel-1-alone approach performed poorly in most of LULC cases and bias of optical data can compromise classification accuracy of integrative approach.

TI  - A case of recurrent malignant phyllodes tumor undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although the primary treatment for malignant phyllodes tumor (PT) is complete surgical excision with either breast-conserving surgery or total mastectomy, recent technical advances have led to the adoption of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR).Case presentation: A 28-year-old woman noticed a mass in her left breast that was rapidly increasing in size. She underwent tumor excision and a histological diagnosis of marked degenerative and necrotic induration suggested benign PT. One year later, however, she was found to have recurrent masses in the left breast on follow-up mammography and sonography. Needle biopsy was performed and the tumor was diagnosed as borderline or malignant PT. She underwent NSM and sentinel lymph-node biopsy with IBR using a tissue expander. Histological examination of the mastectomy specimen showed multiple fibroepithelial tumors with marked stromal overgrowth, focal necrosis, and hemorrhage. Stromal cells showed pleomorphism and a maximal mitotic rate of approximately 25 per 10 high-power fields. The tumor was diagnosed as malignant PT. She did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation treatment. At 3-year follow-up, the patient remains free of disease and highly satisfied with the cosmetic results.Conclusions: NSM with IBR is not a contraindication for malignant PT. It is both curative and can offer an appealing cosmetic option for localized malignant PT.

TI  - Mass balance of glaciers in Bhaga basin, Western Himalaya: a geospatial and temperature-weighted AAR based model approach
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several recent studies carried out in the Himalayan region suggest enhanced receding rate of glaciers during the last two decades. Glacier health can be assessed by monitoring various glacier dynamics that includes mass balance, accumulation area ratio (AAR), equilibrium line altitude (ELA), etc. Here AAR, ELA and regressed mass balance for nine glaciers of the Bhaga basin, Western Himalaya during 2008-18 are presented using high resolution Sentinel 2 (10 m) and Landsat 7/8 (30 m) data with improved AAR and degree day/temperature index (DD/TI) model. Transient snow line (TSL) and AAR derived from the model were used in different regression equations to estimate the mass balance in both glacier and basin scale. In situ precipitation and temperature data obtained from the automatic weather station located at Keylong, Himachal Pradesh were used in this model based approach. Overall, the data reveal that most of the glaciers have experienced critical thinning and lost huge ice mass in the range -6.07 m.w.e. to -9.06 m.w.e.

TI  - Improvement of Mangrove Soil Carbon Stocks Estimation in North Vietnam Using Sentinel-2 Data and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying total carbon (TC) stocks in soil across various mangrove ecosystems is key to understanding the global carbon cycle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Estimating mangrove TC at a large scale remains challenging due to the difficulty and high cost of soil carbon measurements when the number of samples is high. In the present study, we investigated the capability of Sentinel-2 multispectral data together with a state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technique, which is a combination of CatBoost regression (CBR) and a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection and optimization (the CBR-GA model) to estimate the mangrove soil C stocks across the mangrove ecosystems in North Vietnam. We used the field survey data collected from 177 soil cores. We compared the performance of the proposed model with those of the four ML algorithms, i.e., the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), the light gradient boosting machine regression (LGBMR), the support vector regression (SVR), and the random forest regression (RFR) models. Our proposed model estimated the TC level in the soil as 35.06-166.83 Mg ha(-1) (average = 92.27 Mg ha(-1)) with satisfactory accuracy (R (2) = 0.665, RMSE = 18.41 Mg ha(-1)) and yielded the best prediction performance among all the ML techniques. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 data combined with the CBR-GA model can improve estimates of the mangrove TC at 10 m spatial resolution in tropical areas. The effectiveness of the proposed approach should be further evaluated for different mangrove soils of the other mangrove ecosystems in tropical and semi-tropical regions.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The extremely severe cyclone 'Amphan' made landfall on 20 May 2020 in the state of West Bengal, India causing widespread damages. The present study describes the potential use of multi-mission satellite datasets in delineating the cyclone disaster footprints and assessing the impact in near real-time. Flooding due to the cyclone was monitored and mapped continuously from 21 to 27 May 2020 using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of multiple satellites. It was observed that about 2.09 lakh hectares in ten districts of the state was affected by cyclone-induced inundation. East Medinipur district was the worst affected with 83,402 ha inundated during the cyclone. The inundation maps were disseminated to the disaster management authorities in near real-time for effective disaster management to aid in relief and rescue operations.

TI  - Antarctic-wide annual ice flow maps from Landsat 8 imagery between 2013 and 2019
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice velocity constitutes a key parameter for quantifying ice-sheet discharge rates and is thus crucial for improving the coupled models of the Antarctic ice sheet towards accurately predict its contribution to future global sea-level rise. However, in Antarctica, high-resolution and continuous ice velocity estimates remain elusive, which is key to unravel Antarctica's present-day ice mass balance processes. Here, we present a suite of newly estimated Antarctic-wide, annually-sampled ice velocity products at 105-m grid-spacing observed by Landsat 8 optical images data. We first describe a procedure that can automatically calibrate and integrate ice displacement maps to generate Antarctic-wide seamless ice velocity products. The annual ice velocity mosaics are assembled using a total of 250,000 displacement maps inferred from more than 80,000 Landsat 8 images acquired between December 2013 and April 2019. The new annual Antarctic ice velocity data product exhibits an improved quantification of near-decadal Antarctic-wide ice flow, and an opportunity to investigate ice dynamics at a higher spatial resolution and annual sampling, as compared to existing data products. Validation studies confirmed improved accuracy and consistency of this new data product, when compared with independently estimated optical and radar ice velocity data products, as well as in situ data.

TI  - Characterizing the Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands with InSAR Observations from X-, C-, and L-Band Sensors
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the potential of using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from three different frequencies: X-, C-, and L-band, to characterize coastal wetlands in the Great Lakes. Three sets of SAR data acquired over the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada between 2016 and 2018 from Radarsat-2, 2016 from TerraSAR-X, and 2018 from ALOS-2 satellites were processed using small baseline subset (SBAS) Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques to provide maps of surface changes in marshes and swamps. Results showed that SAR backscatter and coherence were sensitive to sensor characteristics (frequency, polarization, incidence angle, acquisition interval), changes in water level, and phenology. InSAR time series observations were evaluated using measurements from water level loggers based on correlation and root mean square error (RMSE) from a linear regression model. Correlation between InSAR measurements and water level changes in the field varied from -1 to 1 depending on the site, type of wetland vegetation, and incidence angle. Although results from some sensor modes provided good correlation (0.77-1) at a few locations, the low fringe rate and large RMSE between 4 and 64 cm indicated that InSAR observations of water level changes in the dynamic wetland environment were generally underestimated.

TI  - End-of-Life Cost Trajectories in Cancer Patients Treated by Medicare versus the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES To evaluate differences in end-of-life cost trajectories for cancer patients treated through Medicare versus by the Veterans Health Administration (VA).DESIGN A retrospective analysis of VA and Medicare administrative data from FY 2010 to 2014. We employed three-level generalized estimating equation to evaluate monthly cost trajectories experienced by patients in their last year of live, with patients nested within hospital referral region.SETTING Care received at VA facilities or by Medicare-reimbursed providers nationwide.PARTICIPANTS A total of 36,401 patients dying from cancer and dually enrolled in VA and Medicare.MEASUREMENTS We evaluated trajectories for total, inpatient, outpatient, and drug costs, using the last 12 months of life. Cost trajectories were prioritized as costs are not directly comparable across Medicare and VA. Patients were assigned to be VA-reliant, Medicare-reliant or Mixed-reliant based on their healthcare utilization in the last year of life.RESULTS All three groups experienced significantly different cost trajectories for total costs in the last year of life. Inpatient cost trajectories were significantly different between Medicare-reliant and VA-reliant patients, but did not differ between VA-reliant and Mixed-reliant patients. Outpatient and drug cost trajectories exhibited the inverse pattern: they were significantly different between VA-reliant and Mixed-reliant patients, but not between VA-reliant and Medicare-reliant patients. However, visual examination of cost trajectories revealed similar cost patterns in the last year of life among all three groups; there was a sharp rise in costs as patients approach death, largely due to inpatient care.CONCLUSION Despite substantially different financial incentives and organization, VA- and Medicare-treated patients exhibit similar patterns of increasing end-of-life costs, largely driven by inpatient costs. Both systems require improvement to ensure quality of end-of-life care is aligned with recommended practice.

TI  - Improved framework of many-objective evolutionary algorithm to handle cloud detection problem in satellite imagery
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic cloud detection algorithm based on supervised learning approach has emerged due to its effectiveness in extracting weather information in satellite images. However, algorithm requires field-expert intervention with huge database of training samples to evaluate its clustering performance. Moreover, lacking in availability of labelled data makes difficult to train the input samples. Therefore, this article puts forward unsupervised many-objective evolutionary clustering technique to discriminate cloudy regions on varying characteristic of underlying surfaces. The study begins with the modification in search capability of theta-NSGA-III optimisation algorithm by incorporating penalised vector angle concept in associate operator. The analysis of proposed approach has been carried out on benchmark many-objective DTLZ test problems, compared against original theta-NSGA-III and NSGA-III algorithms. The proposed modified theta-NSGA-III has been further utilised as clustering technique to solve unsupervised cloud detection problem. Optimal centroid vector for clustering using proposed approach is obtained through modified crossover operator, mutation operator and environmental selection method. Experimental results reveal that proposed approach outperforms comparative many-objective algorithms, MOEA/D and NSGA-III for Landsat 8, MODIS and NOAA satellite images with lower classification average error of 2.44% in cloud detection for most of the evaluated test cases.

TI  - Application of Improved Remotely Sensed Drought Severity Index Based on Soil Moisture Product in Inner Mongolia
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the drought severity index (DSI), which is derived from the ratio of evapotranspiration (ET) to potential evapotranspiration (PET) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as measured by remote sensing, we replaced the ET/PET ratio with soil moisture (0-10 cm) to establish an improved index (IDSI) and evaluated the drought situation in Inner Mongolia. The two components in IDSI are independently derived; however, the effects of evapotranspiration are contained in the soil moisture, and even precipitation changes could be reflected. We used monthly IDSI data for Inner Mongolia to evaluate drought throughout the growing season (May-September) during 2001-2010. The IDSI showed that 2001, 2007, and 2009 were years with significant drought. Areas that experienced extreme drought were less extensive than those found by the DSI because we removed the ET/PET component, which already contains the effects of the NDVI. IDSI results not only contained the degree of precipitation change for a given month through soil moisture, but also reflected the influence of water and heat in the previous month through the NDVI. Moreover, IDSI results were generally consistent with agricultural drought disaster records.

TI  - Diurnal Variation of Seasonal Precipitation over the CONUS: A Comparison of Gauge Observations with TRMM Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diurnal variation of precipitation is a fundamental periodic signal of local climate. Comprehensive study of diurnal variation of precipitation is helpful in studying the formation of local climate and validating satellite precipitation products. In this study, a comparison is drawn between precipitation gauge observations and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 data on diurnal variation of precipitation. First, using the K-means clustering algorithm, stations with gauge observations and pixels with TRMM data are divided into different groups according to the diurnal variation of precipitation, respectively. In each group, the stations have similar diurnal variation of precipitation. Then maps of diurnal variation of precipitation for gauge observations and TRMM data are obtained. According to these maps, the diurnal variation of precipitation over the contiguous United States (CONUS) presents seasonal variability in both gauge observations and TRMM data. In addition, the diurnal variation of precipitation shows clustered features in space. However, the spatial patterns of the obtained maps do not match, and the TRMM satellite data perform poorly in capturing the hourly precipitation event. Finally, the possible mechanism behind the prevailing nocturnal precipitation over the middle of the CONUS is discussed, with the prevailing nocturnal precipitation judged likely to be strongly related to the mountain-plains solenoid (MPS) circulation.

TI  - Classification of polarimetric SAR images using compact convolutional neural networks
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is an active research area with a major role in environmental applications. The traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods proposed in this domain generally focus on utilizing highly discriminative features to improve the classification performance, but this task is complicated by the well-known "curse of dimensionality" phenomena. Other approaches based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have certain limitations and drawbacks, such as high computational complexity, an unfeasibly large training set with ground-truth labels, and special hardware requirements. In this work, to address the limitations of traditional ML and deep CNN-based methods, a novel and systematic classification framework is proposed for the classification of PolSAR images, based on a compact and adaptive implementation of CNNs using a sliding-window classification approach. The proposed approach has three advantages. First, there is no requirement for an extensive feature extraction process. Second, it is computationally efficient due to utilized compact configurations. In particular, the proposed compact and adaptive CNN model is designed to achieve the maximum classification accuracy with minimum training and computational complexity. This is of considerable importance considering the high costs involved in labeling in PolSAR classification. Finally, the proposed approach can perform classification using smaller window sizes than deep CNNs. Experimental evaluations have been performed over the most commonly used four benchmark PolSAR images: AIRSAR L-Band and RADARSAT-2 C-Band data of San Francisco Bay and Flevoland areas. Accordingly, the best obtained overall accuracies range between 92.33-99.39% for these benchmark study sites.

AB  - Secondary angiosarcoma of the breast following catheter-based brachytherapy after lumpectomy is rare. We describe a case of a patient with breast cancer treated with partial mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy followed by accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), who developed skin changes 6 years after completion of therapy. Punch biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of secondary angiosarcoma. This case is even more unique in that the location of the skin changes was remote to the lumpectomy site.

TI  - Distinct microbial assemblages associated with genetic selection for high- and low- muscle yield in rainbow trout
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFish gut microbial assemblages play a crucial role in the growth rate, metabolism, and immunity of the host. We hypothesized that the gut microbiota of rainbow trout was correlated with breeding program based genetic selection for muscle yield. To test this hypothesis, fecal samples from 19 fish representing an F2 high-muscle genetic line (ARS-FY-H) and 20 fish representing an F1 low-muscle yield genetic line (ARS-FY-L) were chosen for microbiota profiling using the 16S rRNA gene. Significant differences in microbial assemblages between these two genetic lines might represent the effect of host genetic selection in structuring the gut microbiota of the host.ResultsTukey's transformed inverse Simpson indices indicated that high muscle yield genetic line (ARS-FY-H) samples have higher microbial diversity compared to those of the low muscle yield genetic line (ARS-FY-L) (LMM, chi 2(1) =14.11, p<0.05). The fecal samples showed statistically distinct structure in microbial assemblages between the genetic lines (F-1,F-36=4.7, p<0.05, R-2=11.9%). Functional profiling of bacterial operational taxonomic units predicted characteristic functional capabilities of the microbial communities in the high (ARS-FY-H) and low (ARS-FY-L) muscle yield genetic line samples.ConclusionThe significant differences of the microbial assemblages between high (ARS-FY-H) and low (ARS-FY-L) muscle yield genetic lines indicate a possible effect of genetic selection on the microbial diversity of the host. The functional composition of taxa demonstrates a correlation between bacteria and improving the muscle accretion in the host, probably, by producing various metabolites and enzymes that might aid in digestion. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved in shaping the microbial community through host genetic selection.

TI  - Influence of lateral advection on phytoplankton size-structure and composition in a Mediterranean coastal area
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton size is a significant functional trait affecting many ecological processes and influencing the carbon fate and the trophic regimes of the ecosystems. In this study, we examined the effect of the lateral advection of nutrient-rich Messina Mixed Waters on the phytoplankton size structure and community composition in the euphotic layer of the Gulf of Augusta (Western Ionian Sea) in early autumn. The chlorophyll a concentration ranged from 0.08 to 0.8 mg m(-3) and the phytoplankton abundances ranged from 21 x 10(3) to 245 x 10(3) cells L-1. The size structure of phytoplankton biomass, obtained by sequential filtration of water samples, suggested the dominance of micro-planktonic diatoms in an active Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) whereas smaller forms were mainly represented by phytoflagellates. A short-term tidal-induced variability of the assemblage structure was observed at a "sentinel" station located at the Gulf shelf-break where lateral advection due to meso-scale dynamics sustained most of the phytoplankton biomass.Our research shows that, in stratified conditions, nutrient enrichment by lateral advection at DCM modifies the size-structure of phytoplankton with respect to that expected from the reference baseline oceanic model validated in open ocean waters. In particular, while smaller fraction incidences reveal a surface oligotrophic system, an increase of the micro-sized fraction is triggered at DCM: this indicates the prevalence of "new production" processes which is a quite unusual condition for the Mediterranean DCM in early autumn, when trophic web is typically sustained by "regenerate production". Our observations suggest that both "microbial" and "herbivore" pathways could coexist and regulate the carbon flow in the Gulf in this season.

TI  - Long-Term Land Use Land Cover Change in Urban Centers of Southwest Ethiopia From a Climate Change Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term urban land use land cover change (LULCC) dynamics and climate change trends in Southwest Ethiopia's four urban centers were examined for 60 years. Remote sensing, aerial photos, and Landsat, temperature, and rainfall data were analyzed from a climate change perspective over the Jimma, Bedelle, Bonga, and Sokorru urban centers of southwest Ethiopia from 1953 to 2018. Based on geospatial analysis and maximum likelihood supervised image classification techniques to classify LULCC categories, the Mann-Kendall test was applied to perform trend analyses on temperature and rainfall. The LULCC analysis revealed that built-up areas over the urban centers had shown an increasing trend, with the highest increment by 2,360 hectares over Jimma, while vegetation, wetland, and cropland declined due to conversion of plain lands to built-up areas and other similar zones. The pronounced decline of vegetation coverage was 1,427, 185,116, and 32 hectares in Jimma, Bedelle, Bonga, and Sokorru, respectively. Mann-Kendall test results showed a significant sign of intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability of rainfall while the summer and annual rainfall patterns remained less variable compared to other seasons. This study's findings revealed that when the mean between the two climatic normals of 1953-86 is compared with 1987-2018, the temperature has significantly increased in the latter three decades. The rapid expansion of built-up areas coupled with a sharp decline of green space or vegetation and agricultural/croplands could lead to gradual changes in LULCC classes, which have contributed to the changing of the local climate, especially the surface temperature and rainfall over the urban centers of southwest Ethiopia. Therefore, we recommend that the local urban administrations emphasize sustainable urban development by integrating urban planning policies with land use to protect the environment by adopting local municipal adaptation and national climate change strategies. Restoration of the local environment and creation of climate-smart cities could be critical to the resilience of urban dwellers and ecosystems to the changing climate by enhancing grass-root climate services. To that end, we recommend further advanced research to understand how urban LULC-related changes and other factors contribute to local and regional climates, as urban areas of Southwest Ethiopia are undergoing a rapid transformation of their rural surroundings.

TI  - Using very-high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning to detect and count African elephants in heterogeneous landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites allow large-scale surveys to be conducted in short time periods with repeat surveys possible at intervals of <24 h. Very-high-resolution satellite imagery has been successfully used to detect and count a number of wildlife species in open, homogeneous landscapes and seascapes where target animals have a strong contrast with their environment. However, no research to date has detected animals in complex heterogeneous environments or detected elephants from space using very-high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning. In this study, we apply a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically detect and count African elephants in a woodland savanna ecosystem in South Africa. We use WorldView-3 and 4 satellite data -the highest resolution satellite imagery commercially available. We train and test the model on 11 images from 2014 to 2019. We compare the performance accuracy of the CNN against human accuracy. Additionally, we apply the model on a coarser resolution satellite image (GeoEye-1) captured in Kenya, without any additional training data, to test if the algorithm can generalize to an elephant population outside of the training area. Our results show that the CNN performs with high accuracy, comparable to human detection capabilities. The detection accuracy (i.e., F2 score) of the CNN models was 0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in homogenous areas. This compares with the detection accuracy of the human labels with an averaged F2 score 0.77 in heterogeneous areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. The CNN model can generalize to detect elephants in a different geographical location and from a lower resolution satellite. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing and deep learning technologies for detecting and counting African elephants in heterogeneous landscapes. The study showcases the feasibility of using high resolution satellite imagery as a promising new wildlife surveying technique. Through creation of a customized training dataset and application of a Convolutional Neural Network, we have automated the detection of elephants in satellite imagery with accuracy as high as human detection capabilities. The success of the model to detect elephants outside of the training data site demonstrates the generalizability of the technique.

TI  - Interannual variability of surface satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration in the bay of La Paz, Mexico, during 2003-2018 period: The ENSO signature
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bay of La Paz (BLPZ), located in the southwestern Gulf of California, is a region of significant biological productivity and strong environmental variability that remains to be understood. In particular, the spatial signature of different El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and their impact on the ecology of the bay remains puzzling because of contrasting field observations. In this context, the available satellite-derived data on surface chlorophyll (ChlSAT), sea surface temperature (SST) derived from the MODIS-Aqua sensor, together with surface wind intensity (WI) derived from reanalysis datasets from the period 2003-2018 were analyzed to identify the influence of local and remote forcing over the interannual variability of chlorophyll pigment concentration in BLPZ using WI, SST, and the Oceanic El Nino Index (ONI) as environmental factors. Significant relationships between environmental factors and ChlSAT were found using exponential models, with the higher slopes and correlations during La Nina events. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to extract the principal mode of the ChlSAT and SST interannual variability. The first mode (EOF1) accounted for 64% and 89% of the ChlSAT and the SST interannual variance, respectively, showing a strong gradient along the coast of the bay. The corresponding amplitude of the ChlSAT mode was significantly correlated with the independent variables PC1SST, ONI, and WI anomalies (R-SST = - 0.60, R-ONI = - 0.57, and R-WI = 0.44, P < 0.001). Monthly time series of ChlSAT anomalies along the coast where examined as a function of each independent variable using a multiple linear regression analysis (LRA), which revealed that during the 2005 to 2013 period, high peaks of positive ChlSAT anomalies in the central and southern coast were related to cold ENSO events and favorable wind forcing, which smoothed the effect of weak and moderate El Nino episodes. This period of high biological productivity was only interrupted by the strong and long 2015-2016 El Nino event. Since late 2013, the ChlSAT and the WI anomalies showed a sharp drop to negative anomaly values, which may be the result of complex interactions of physical and biological processes observed during strong warm ENSO events, showing one peak of persistent warm SST anomalies via a weakening of the wind intensity (i.e., from atmospheric teleconnection) and a second one due to the oceanic connection. It is confirmed that BLPZ maintains high pigment concentration levels, comparable to those reported on the mainland coast of GC, where only strong warm ENSO episodes cause changes in chlorophyll concentration.

TI  - India Hypertension Control Initiative-Hypertension treatment and blood pressure control in a cohort in 24 sentinel site clinics, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPERTENSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) is a multi-partner initiative, implementing and scaling up a public health hypertension control program across India. A cohort of 21,895 adult hypertension patients in 24 IHCI sentinel site facilities in four Indian states (Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Telangana), registered from January 2018 until June 2019 were assessed at baseline and then followed up for blood pressure (BP) control and antihypertensive medication use. Among all registrations, 11 274 (51%) of the patients returned for a follow-up visit between July 2019 and September 2019. Among patients returning for follow-up, 26.3% had BP controlled at registration, and 59.8% had BP controlled at follow-up (p < .001). The absolute improvement in BP control was more than two times greater in primary care (48.1 percentage point increase) than secondary care facilities (22.9 percentage point increase). Most IHCI patients received prescriptions according to state-specific treatment protocols. This study demonstrates that a scalable public health hypertension control program can yield substantial BP control improvements, especially in primary care settings. However, high loss to follow-up limits population health impact; future efforts should focus on improving systems to increase the likelihood that patients will return to the clinic for routine hypertension care.

TI  - Evaluation of Floods and Landslides Triggered by a Meteorological Catastrophe (Ordu, Turkey, August 2018) Using Optical and Radar Data
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the potential of photogrammetric datasets and remote sensing methods for the assessment of a meteorological catastrophe that occurred in Ordu, Turkey in August 2018. During the event, flash floods and several landslides caused losses of lives, evacuation of people from their homes, collapses of infrastructure and large constructions, destruction of agricultural fields, and many other economic losses. The meteorological conditions before and during the flood were analyzed here and compared with long-term records. The flood extent and the landslide susceptibility were investigated by using multisensor and multitemporal data. Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2 optical data, and aerial photogrammetric datasets were employed for the investigations using machine learning techniques. The changes were assessed both at a local and regional level and evaluated together with available damage reports. The analysis of the rainfall data recorded during the two weeks before the floods and landslides in heavily affected regions shows that the rainfall continued for consecutive hours with an amount of up to 68 mm/hour. The regional level classification results obtained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data by using the random forest (RF) method exhibit 97% accuracy for the flood class. The landslide susceptibility prediction performance from aerial photogrammetric datasets was 92% represented by the Area Under Curve (AUC) value provided by the RF method. The results presented here show that considering the occurrence frequency and immense damages after such events, the use of novel remote sensing technologies and spatial analysis methods is unavoidable for disaster mitigation efforts and for the monitoring of environmental effects. Although the increasing number of earth observation satellites complemented with airborne imaging sensors is capable of ensuring data collection requirement with diverse spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions, further studies are required to automate the data processing, efficient information extraction, and data fusion and also to increase the accuracy of the results.

TI  - Props as visual arguments in the political speeches of Binyamin Netanyahu
T2  - SOCIAL SEMIOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with objects that serve as props in political speeches, and examines their role as carriers of symbolic meaning that is constructed during a performance enacted in a political space. It focuses on the use of such objects as rhetorical arguments in three speeches by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu: "the bomb speech," "the drone-wreckage speech" and the "binder speech." In each of these political speeches, the initial introduction of the object serves as a declarative act of coronation. This declaration imbues the object with symbolic meaning that relates to reality on several levels: it can serve as a visual metaphor, as a metonym, as a concrete illustration of an abstract concept, or an exhibit or evidence that a certain event took place. The relations between the prop and the spoken text and its rhetoric are discussed in order to trace the unique properties of the multimodal array of arguments that the "crowned" object constructs. The unique characteristics of the objects serve to echo and accentuate the identity and worldview of the speaker, but may also give rise to meanings that undermine the speaker's intention.

T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we explore the relationship between changes in chlorophyll a (Chl a) content, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) characteristics from 1989 to 2018 in Poyang Lake, China, by applying Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM) image data in combination with in situ monitoring data. Results showed that the average Chl a content in water over this 30-year period was 5.77 mu g/L. Although the water quality status of the lake was generally healthy, proportional Chl a content >10 mu g/L (E10) has gradually increased, and the water quality in some areas of the lake has subsequently deteriorated over the past 30 years. Additionally, E10 was significantly positively correlated to the TN/TP. Changes in Chl a content were significantly positively correlated to the ratio of TN flux to TP flux from tributaries into the lake, but negatively correlated to TP flux. Results indicated that Lake can be categorized as phosphorus-sufficient and nitrogen limited.

TI  - Grazing gradient detection and assessment in arid rangelands of central Iran using remote sensing and soil-vegetation characteristics
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One key tool to manage fragile ecosystems in arid lands is knowledge of land degradation. For this purpose, field-based soil and vegetation characteristics were related to remote sensing information extracted from Landsat OLI moving standard deviation index (MSDI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) in degraded (watering points and livestock camps) and reference sites of arid rangelands of Iran. Values of spectral indices along grazing gradients at a distance of 50-1500 m from the centre of degradation were also extracted and analysed. Statistical analysis (t-test and ordination analysis) shows that MSDI is a sensitive index of landscape heterogeneity and, unlike other indices, exhibits a significant difference between degraded and reference sites. MSDI was sensitive to grazing gradients around watering points and livestock camps, and declined with increasing distance from these areas, although this varied between different sites due to grazing intensity and characteristics of soil and vegetation cover. Soil analysis showed that the amount of organic carbon, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and soil stability indicator (SSI) at reference sites were significantly higher than those at degraded areas. Ordination analysis confirmed the results of t-test regarding the high potential capability of MSDI in separating degraded areas. This simple and practical index can be used to determine ecological thresholds and investigating rangeland condition in arid ecosystems.

We performed a meta-analysis comparing SLND/Radiotherapy (RT) with ALND. All data were analyzed using Review Manager Software 5.3. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Overall survival, death, and disease-free survival were estimated higher in the SLND group compared to the ALND group. Statistically significant differences in axillary recurrence were observed in favor of ALND. Omission of ALND in patients with <3 positive SLNs is indicated.

TI  - Implication of long-term watershed development on land use/land cover change and sediment loss in Maybar Sub-Watershed, South Wello Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term-watershed management in Ethiopia has been assessed in different locations since the 1980s, but there are no adequate studies of its effect on the aspects of natural resources. A boundary map of geographical coordination and Google Earth imagery was created from the ground base survey. This study was conducted to investigate the implications of long-term watershed management on the land use/land cover change and trend of runoff-sediment loss. Data for this study were obtained from- Time-series satellite Landsat images of the years 1986, 1997, 2008, and 2019, and runoff, and sediment load and discharge data from the Maybar watershed station dataset. Analyses of these data show, from 1986 to 2019, forest and settlement land area coverage had been increased from 20.9% to 39.2% and from 9.2% to 22.6%, respectively. In contrast, cultivation land, open woodland, and grassland coverage was reduced from 26.7% to 18.4%, from 32.7% to18.9%, and from 10.6% to 1.1%, respectively. The discharge-runoff and runoff-sediment load processes were affected by the watershed development activity which the trend of annual sediment loss and runoff generation slightly reduced through time. Therefore, the long-term growth of watersheds has a beneficial effect on changes in on-site natural resources, such as improving vegetation coverage and reducing the generation of runoff.

TI  - Sequential CD19 and BCMA-specific CAR T-cell treatment elicits sustained remission of relapsed and/or refractory myeloma
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The low rate of durable response against relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in recent studies indicates that chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) treatment is yet to be optimized. This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of sequential infusion of CD19-CART and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CARTs for RRMM with a similar 3 + 3 dose escalation combined with a toxicity sentinel design. We enrolled 10 patients, among whom 7 received autologous infusion and 3 received allogeneic infusion. The median follow-up time was 20 months. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent toxicities were hematological toxicities. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) adverse reactions were grade 1/2 in 9 out of 10 subjects. No dose-limited toxicity (DLT) was observed for BCMA-CAR-positive T cells <= 5 x 10(7)/kg), while two patients with dose-levels of 5-6.5 x 10(7)/kg experienced DLTs. The overall response rate was 90% (five partial responses and four stringent complete responses). Three out of four patients with stringent complete responses to autologous CART had progression-free survival for over 2 years. The three patients with allogeneic CART experienced disease progression within 2 months. These results evidence the sequential infusion's preliminarily tolerability and efficacy in RRMM, and present a simple and safe design applicable for the establishment of multiple CART therapy.

TI  - Multilevel Extraction of Vegetation Type Based on Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise determination of vegetation type is important in remote sensing of the ecological environment. Many studies have explored ecosystem structure on explicit spatial scales using specific remote sensing data, but few studies have considered vegetation information extraction at various landscape levels using LiDAR-derived raster layers. This study determined vegetation information based on LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM) and LiDAR-derived forest canopy coverage (FCC) from the typical natural secondary forest of Maoershan Experimental Forest Farm (Northeast China). Geographic object-based image analysis was adopted for all experiments. Optimal classification characteristics and thresholds were determined and classification rule sets established for vegetation type extraction at four levels: vegetation-not-vegetation, vegetation type, forest type, and canopy-canopy gap. We compared and analyzed the capability of LiDAR-derived raster layers extraction to describe vegetation features at these four levels. An area-based assessment method was used for accuracy verification. The research showed that physical information such as vegetation height and canopy density provided by LiDAR point cloud is effective for extracting vegetation characteristics and categories. Moreover, results showed that high-resolution LiDAR-derived raster layers could provide more detailed vegetation information. This study represents a reference for data selection and mapping strategies for hierarchical and multiscale vegetation type extraction.

TI  - Validation of GRASP algorithm product from POLDER/PARASOL data and assessment of multi-angular polarimetry potential for aerosol monitoring
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Proven by multiple theoretical and practical studies, multi-angular spectral polarimetry is ideal for comprehensive retrieval of properties of aerosols. Furthermore, a large number of advanced space polarimeters have been launched recently or planned to be deployed in the coming few years (Dubovik et al., 2019). Nevertheless, at present, practical utilization of aerosol products from polarimetry is rather limited, due to the relatively small number of polarimetric compared to photometric observations, as well as challenges in making full use of the extensive information content available in these complex observations. Indeed, while in recent years several new algorithms have been developed to provide enhanced aerosol retrievals from satellite polarimetry, the practical value of available aerosol products from polarimeters yet remains to be proven. In this regard, this paper presents the analysis of aerosol products obtained by the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm from POLDER/PARASOL observations. After about a decade of development, GRASP has been adapted for operational processing of polarimetric satellite observations and several aerosol products from POLDER/PARASOL observations have been released. These updated PARASOL/GRASP products are publicly available (e.g., http://www.icare.univ-lille.fr, last access: 16 October 2018, http://www.grasp-open.com/products/, last access: 28 March 2020); the dataset used in the current study is registered under https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3887265 (Chen et al., 2020).The objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the GRASP aerosol products obtained from POLDER/PARASOL observations. First, the validation of the entire 2005-2013 archive was conducted by comparing to ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. The subjects of the validation are spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) at six wavelengths, as well as Angstrom exponent (AE), fine-mode AOD (AODF) and coarse-mode AOD (AODC) interpolated to the reference wavelength 550 nm. Second, an inter-comparison of PARASOL/GRASP products with the PARASOL/Operational, MODIS Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB) and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol products for the year 2008 was performed. Over land both satellite data validations and inter-comparisons were conducted separately for different surface types, discriminated by bins of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI): < 0.2, 0.2 <= and < 0.4, 0.4 <= and < 0.6, and >= 0.6. Three PARASOL/GRASP products were analyzed: GRASP/HP ("High Precision"), Optimized and Models. These different products are consistent but were obtained using different assumptions in aerosol modeling with different accuracies of atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Specifically, when using GRASP/HP or Optimized there is direct retrieval of the aerosol size distribution and spectral complex index of refraction. When using GRASP/Models, the aerosol is approximated by a mixture of several prescribed aerosol components, each with their own fixed size distribution and optical properties, and only the concentrations of those components are retrieved. GRASP/HP employs the most accurate RT calculations, while GRASP/Optimized and GRASP/Models are optimized to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and speed. In all these three options, the underlying surface reflectance is retrieved simultaneously with the aerosol properties, and the radiative transfer calculations are performed "online" during the retrieval.All validation results obtained for the full archive of PARASOL/GRASP products show solid quality of retrieved aerosol characteristics. The GRASP/Models retrievals, however, provided the most solid AOD products, e.g., AOD (550 nm) is unbiased and has the highest correlation (R similar to 0.92) and the highest fraction of retrievals (similar to 55.3 %) satisfying the accuracy requirements of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) when compared to AERONET observations. GRASP/HP and GRASP/Optimized AOD products show a non-negligible positive bias (similar to 0.07) when AOD is low (< 0.2). On the other hand, the detailed aerosol microphysical characteristics (AE, AODF, AODC, SSA, etc.) provided by GRASP/HP and GRASP/Optimized correlate generally better with AERONET than do the results of GRASP/Models. Overall, GRASP/HP processing demonstrates the high quality of microphysical characteristics retrieval versus AERONET. Evidently, the GRASP/Models approach is more adapted for retrieval of total AOD, while the detailed aerosol microphysical properties are limited when a mixture of aerosol models with fixed optical properties are used.The results of a comparative analysis of PARASOL/GRASP and MODIS products showed that, based on validation against AERONET, the PARASOL/GRASP AOD (550 nm) product is of similar and sometimes of higher quality compared to the MODIS products. All AOD retrievals are more accurate and in good agreement over ocean. Over land, especially over bright surfaces, the retrieval quality degrades and the differences in total AOD products increase. The detailed aerosol characteristics, such as AE, AODF and AODC from PARASOL/GRASP, are generally more reliable, especially over land. The global inter-comparisons of PARASOL/GRASP versus MODIS showed rather robust agreement, though some patterns and tendencies were observed. Over ocean, PARASOL/Models and MODIS/DT AOD agree well with the correlation coefficient of 0.92. Over land, the correlation between PARASOL/Models and the different MODIS products is lower, ranging from 0.76 to 0.85. There is no significant global offset; though over bright surfaces MODIS products tend to show higher values compared to PARASOL/Models when AOD is low and smaller values for moderate and high AODs. Seasonal AOD means suggest that PARASOL/GRASP products show more biomass burning aerosol loading in central Africa and dust over the Taklamakan Desert, but less AOD in the northern Sahara. It is noticeable also that the correlation for the data over AERONET sites are somewhat higher, suggesting that the retrieval assumptions generally work better over AERONET sites than over the rest of the globe. One of the potential reasons may be that MODIS retrievals, in general, rely more on AERONET climatology than GRASP retrievals.Overall, the analysis shows that the quality of AOD retrieval from multi-angular polarimetric observations like POLDER is at least comparable to that of single-viewing MODIS-like imagers. At the same time, the multi-angular polarimetric observations provide more information on other aerosol properties (e.g., spectral AODF, AODC, AE), as well as additional parameters such as AAOD and SSA.

TI  - Measurement report: Long-term variations in carbon monoxide at a background station in China's Yangtze River Delta region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the long-term variations in carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios from January 2006 to December 2017 at the Lin'an regional atmospheric background station (LAN; 30.3 degrees N, 119.73 degrees E, 138 m a.s.l.) in China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. The CO mixing ratios were at their highest (0.69 +/- 0.08 ppm) and lowest (0.54 +/- 0.06 ppm) in winter and summer, respectively. The average daily variation in CO exhibited a double-peaked pattern, with peaks in the morning and evening and a valley in the afternoon. A significant downward trend of -11.3 ppb yr(-1) of CO was observed from 2006 to 2017 at the LAN station, which was in accordance with the negative trends of the average CO mixing ratios and total column retrieved from the satellite data (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere, MOPITT) over the YRD region during the same period. The average annual CO mixing ratio at the LAN station in 2017 was 0.51 +/- 0.04 ppm, which was significantly lower than that (0.71 +/- 0.12 ppm) in 2006. The decrease in CO levels was largest in autumn (-15.7 ppb yr(-1)), followed by summer (-11.1 ppb yr(-1)), spring (-10.8 ppb yr(-1)), and winter (-9.7 ppb yr(-1)). Moreover, the CO levels under relatively polluted conditions (the annual 95th percentiles) declined even more rapidly (-22.4 ppb yr(-1), r = -0.68, p < 0.05) from 2006 (0.91 ppm) to 2017 (0.58 ppm), and the CO levels under clean conditions (the annual 5th percentiles) showed decreasing evidence but not statistically significant (r = -0.41, p = 0.19) throughout the years. The long-term decline and short-term variations in the CO mixing ratios at the LAN station were mainly attributed to the implementation of the anthropogenic pollution control measures in the YRD region and to events like the Shanghai Expo in 2010 and Hangzhou G20 in 2016. The decreased CO level may influence atmospheric chemistry over the region. The average OH reactivity of CO at the LAN station is estimated to significantly drop from 4.1 +/- 0.7 s(-1) in 2006 to 3.0 +/- 0.3 s(-1) in 2017.

TI  - Linking 19th century European settlement to the disruption of a seabird's natural population dynamics
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent estimates indicate that similar to 70% of the world's seabird populations have declined since the 1950s due to human activities. However, for almost all bird populations, there is insufficient long-term monitoring to understand baseline (i.e., preindustrial) conditions, which are required to distinguish natural versus anthropogenically driven changes. Here, we address this lack of long-term monitoring data with multiproxy paleolimnological approaches to examine the long-term population dynamics of a major colony of Leach's Storm-petrel (Hydrobates leucorhous) on Grand Colombier Island in the St. Pierre and Miquelon archipelagoan overseas French territory in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. By reconstructing the last similar to 5,800 y of storm-petrel dynamics, we demonstrate that this colony underwent substantial natural fluctuations until the start of the 19th century, when population cycles were disrupted, coinciding with the establishment and expansion of a European settlement. Our paleoenvironmental data, coupled with on-the-ground population surveys, indicate that the current colony is only similar to 16% of the potential carrying capacity, reinforcing concerning trends of globally declining seabird populations. As seabirds are sentinel species of marine ecosystem health, such declines provide a call to action for global conservation. In response, we emphasize the need for enlarged protected areas and the rehabilitation of disturbed islands to protect ecologically critical seabird populations. Furthermore, long-term data, such as those provided by paleoecological approaches, are required to better understand shifting baselines in conservation to truly recognize current rates of ecological loss.

TI  - Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometric phase map despeckling in discrete Riesz wavelets domain
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase extraction in differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) is an important tool used for detecting subcentimeter-level change in ground deformation. The evaluated phase map processing is conducted via two important and successive steps: phase denoising and phase unwrapping. We attack the first step and propose the performance of discrete Riesz wavelets transform to reduce the residual speckle noise from the generated DinSAR phase map. The performance of the proposed method is appraised using three important criteria such as peak-to-signal-noise ratio (PSNR), the quality index Q, and the edge preservation index. The obtained metric values reveal that this technique can improve the PSNR and Q in comparison with other famous techniques. Finally, we apply the algorithm to denoise a real DinSAR phase map generated with sentinel application platform software using three SAR data of the Napa city in California.

TI  - The Helicopter Pilot-Swedish Hot-Area Policing From Above
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hot spot policing is an established concept that is proven to reduce crime. It is mostly done through foot patrol or car patrols. In the present study it is tested whether helicopters can produce a deterrent policing effect to reduce the amount of vehicle arsons in Sweden on larger hot areas. Sweden tends to have elevated levels of vehicle arsons in August, with about 20% of police districts responsible for 50% of the cases. The risk narrative revolves around youth congregating in public places in deprived neighborhoods to generate disturbances, and the disruption of the risk narrative tested here is based on providing deterrence through helicopter police presence. During 6 weeks in August and September of 2019 police helicopters patrolled four police districts in Sweden to attempt to prevent vehicle arsons. Our data comprise police reports of vehicle arson, and time stamped satellite data over the location for police helicopters. The evaluation considers whether there is an intention to treat effect from this project, in addition to whether there is an effect of actual helicopter presence. The study finds no significant effect of intention to treat, nor of actual dosage.

TI  - Climate-driven conifer mortality in Siberia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim An increase in conifer mortality has been observed widely across the boreal forest biome. We investigate the causes of this mortality, in addition to the geospatial and temporal dynamics of mortality, in Siberian pine and fir stands.Location Central Siberia.Time period 1950-2018.Major taxa studied Pinus sibirica Du Tour and Abies sibirica Ledeb.Methods We used geospatial analysis of satellite-derived (MODIS, Landsat) data, topography (elevation, slope steepness and exposure) and climatic variables [precipitation, thermal degree days (TDD = n-ary sumation (t > 0 degrees C), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and root zone moisture content (RZM)], together with in situ data. Dendrochronology was applied for analysis of the radial growth increment (GI).Results Siberian pine and fir mortality has increased greatly in recent decades. The mortality of forest stands and trees was dependent on the TDD, RZM and SPEI. Mortality occurred mainly within the southern part of the species ranges and decreased northward, correlated with latitudinal gradients of TDD and SPEI. Mortality was observed mostly at elevations < 1,000 m and decreased with increasing elevation, whereas the area of forests and GI of trees increased with elevation. Forest mortality was preceded by the changes in tree GI. Since the onset of climate warming, GI increased until a breakpoint in the mid-1980s. Further temperature increase caused a reduction in GI owing to moisture stress and division of the tree population into "decliners" and "survivors". Mortality was caused by the combined impact of moisture stress and bark beetle attacks.Main conclusion Siberian pine and fir mortality was preceded by a reduction in the GI of trees caused by elevated air temperatures, acute droughts and subsequent insect attacks. Forest mortality was observed mostly at low elevations, whereas within the areas with sufficient moisture availability (at elevations c. < 1,000 m) the tree GI and forest area increased. With the projected increase in drought, Siberian pine and fir trees are predicted to retreat from their southern low-elevation ranges.

TI  - Water Vapor Retrievals from Near-infrared Channels of the Advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager Instrument onboard the Fengyun-3D Satellite
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor plays a key role in weather, climate and environmental research on local and global scales. Knowledge about atmospheric water vapor and its spatiotemporal variability is essential for climate and weather research. Because of the advantage of a unique temporal and spatial resolution, satellite observations provide global or regional water vapor distributions. The advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) instrument-that is, MERSI-II-onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) meteorological satellite, has been one of the major satellite sensors routinely providing precipitable water vapor (PWV) products to the community using near-infrared (NIR) measurements since June 2018. In this paper, the major updates related to the production of the NIR PWV products of MERSI-II are discussed for the first time. In addition, the water vapor retrieval algorithm based on the MERSI-II NIR channels is introduced and derivations are made over clear land areas, clouds, and sun-glint areas over the ocean. Finally, the status and samples of the MERSI-II PWV products are presented. The accuracy of MERSI-II PWV products is validated using ground-based GPS measurements. The results show that the accuracies of the water vapor products based on the updated MERSI-II instrument are significantly improved compared with those of MERSI, because MERSI-II provides a better channel setting and new calibration method. The root-mean-square error and relative bias of MERSI-II PWV products are typically 1.8-5.5 mm and -3.0% to -14.3%, respectively, and thus comparable with those of other global remote sensing products of the same type.

TI  - Estimating salt content of vegetated soil at different depths with Sentinel-2 data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely monitoring of the soil salt content (SSC) at different depths is the prerequisite for the solution to salinization in the arid and semiarid areas. Sentinel-2 has demonstrated significant superiority in SSC inversion for its higher temporal, spatial and spectral resolution, but previous research on SSC inversion with Sentinel-2 mainly focused on the unvegetated surface soil. Based on Sentinel-2 data, this study aimed to build four machine learning models at five depths (0 similar to 20 cm, 20 similar to 40 cm, 40 similar to 60 cm, 0 similar to 40 cm, and 0 similar to 60 cm) in the vegetated area, and evaluate the sensitivity of Sentinel-2 to SSC at different depths and the inversion capability of the models. Firstly, 117 soil samples were collected from Jiefangzha Irrigation Area (JIA) in Hetao Irrigation District (HID), Inner Mongolia, China during August, 2019. Then a set of independent variables (IVs, including 12 bands and 32 spectral indices) were obtained based on the Sentinel-2 data (released by the European Space Agency), and the full subset selection was used to select the optimal combination of Ws at five depths. Finally, four machine learning algorithms, back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF), were used to build inversion models at each depth. The model performance was assessed using adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The results indicated that 20 similar to 40 cm was the optimal depth for SSC inversion. All the models at this depth demonstrated a good fitting (R-adj(2 )approximate to 0.6) and a good control of the inversion errors (RMSE < 0.16%, MAE < 0.12%). At the depths of 40 similar to 60 cm and 0 similar to 20 cm the inversion performance showed a slight and a great decrease respectively. The sensitivity of Sentinel-2 to SSC at different depths was as follows: 20 similar to 40 cm > 40 similar to 60 cm > 0 similar to 40 cm > 0 similar to 60 cm > 0 similar to 20 cm. All four machine learning models demonstrated good inversion performance (R-adj(2) > 0.46). RF was the best model with high fitting and inversion accuracy. Its R-adj(2) at five depths were between 0.5 to 0.68. The SSC inversion capabilities of all the four models were as follows: RF model > ELM model > SVM model > BPNN model. This study can provide a reference for soil salinization monitoring in large vegetated area.

TI  - A Molecular Approach for Detecting Stage-Specific Predation on <i>Lygus hesperus</i> (Hemiptera: Miridae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A molecular gut analysis technique is described to identify predators of Lygus hesperus (Knight), a significant pest of many crops. The technique is unique because it can pinpoint which life stage of the pest was consumed. Sentinel egg masses designed to mimic the endophytic egg-laying behavior of L. hesperus were marked with rabbit serum, while third instar and adult L. hesperus were marked with chicken and rat sera, respectively. Then, the variously labeled L. hesperus life stages were introduced into field cages that enclosed the native arthropod population inhabiting an individual cotton plant. After a 6-h exposure period, the predator assemblage, including the introduced and native L. hesperus population, in each cage were counted and had their gut contents examined for the presence of the variously marked L hesperus life stages by a suite of serum-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The whole-plant sampling scheme revealed that Geocoris punticpes (Say) and Geocoris pallens Stal (Hemiptera: Geocoridae) and members of the spider complex were the numerically dominant predator taxa in the cotton field.The gut content analyses also showed that these two taxa appeared to be the most prolific predators of the L. hesperus nymph stage. Other key findings include that Collops vittatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Melyridae) and Solenopsis xyloni McCook (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) appear to be adept at finding and feeding on the cryptic L. hesperus egg stage, and that L. hesperus, albeit at low frequencies, engaged in cannibalism. The methods described here could be adapted for studying life stage-specific feeding preferences for a wide variety of arthropod taxa.

TI  - On doing what is just, right and fair: Essay on a Dutch example
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1848 Constitution of the Netherlands guaranteed civic freedoms within the frame of liberalism. In practice, this meant that the public sphere was not open to orthodox Protestants or Catholics. Abraham Kuyper changed this situation by accepting wholeheartedly the liberal maxim of the separation of church and state, but he rejected the exclusion of religion from the public sphere. He succeeded in changing the political climate and opened up a public sphere that was plural in nature, not open just for liberals, but for every citizen, whatever religion or worldview he had. This public regime was implemented in the late 19th century, and lasted until the 1970s. Then a new regime was implemented gradually. Religion and religious minorities were downplayed in a public sphere that was dominated by moral permissiveness and individual self-expression. This regime was challenged by Islam, and at present the debate is on the issue if a religious culture that denies individual freedom can be tolerated in a liberal democracy. This is a deja vu of the debate Kuyper generated 150 years ago.

AB  - Primary vaginal carcinoma is rare. There are two pathogenetic pathways, one associated with HPV high-risk infection and another one with inactivation of p53. Vaginal Paget's disease is rare and mostly associated with vulvar disease or represents intravaginal spread of associated locoregional cancer. Diagnostic vaginal biopsies should be examined by step sections on H&E. Sentinel lymph nodes should be processed completely using ultrastaging. Morphology-based prognostic factors with good clinical evidence are tumour stage and lymph node status. Molecular markers are not currently relevant for treatment decision and prognosis.

TI  - Spring melt pond fraction in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago predicted from RADARSAT-2
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea ice during spring, influencing how much solar radiation is absorbed into the sea ice-ocean system, which in turn impacts the ablation of sea ice during the melt season. Accordingly, melt pond fraction (f(p)) has been shown to be a useful predictor of sea ice area during the summer months. Sea ice dynamic and thermodynamic processes operating within the narrow channels and inlets of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) during the summer months are difficult for model simulations to accurately resolve. Additional information on f(p) variability in advance of the melt season within the CAA could help constrain model simulations and/or provide useful information in advance of the shipping season. Here, we use RADARSAT-2 imagery to predict and analyze peak melt pond fraction (f(pk)) and evaluate its utility to provide predictive information with respect to sea ice area during the melt season within the CAA from 2009-2018. The temporal variability of RADARSAT-2 f(pk) over the 10-year record was found to be strongly linked to the variability of mean April multi-year ice area with a statistically significant detrended correlation (R) of R = -0.89. The spatial distribution of RADARS AT-2 f(pk) was found to be in excellent agreement with the sea ice stage of development prior to the melt season. RADARS AT-2 f(pk) values were in good agreement with f(pk) observed from in situ observations but were found to be - 0.05 larger compared to MODIS f(pk) observations. Dynamically stable sea ice regions within the CAA exhibited higher detrended correlations between RADARSAT-2 f(pk) and summer sea ice area. Our results show that RADARSAT-2 f(pk) can be used to provide predictive information about summer sea ice area for a key shipping region of the Northwest Passage.

TI  - Polarization measurement accuracy analysis and improvement methods for the directional polarimetric camera
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The directional polarimetric camera (DPC) is a remote-sensing instrument for the characterization of atmospheric aerosols and clouds by simultaneously conducting spectral, angular, and polarimetric measurements. Polarization measurement accuracy is an important index to evaluate the performance of the DPC and mainly related to the calibration accuracy of instrumental parameters. In this paper, firstly, the relationship between the polarization measurement accuracy of DPC and the parameter calibration errors caused by the nonideality of the components of DPC are analyzed, and the maximum polarization measurement error of DPC in the central field of view and edge field of view after initial calibration is evaluated respectively. Secondly, on the basis of the radiometric calibration of the DPC onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite in an early companion paper [Opt. Express 28 13187 (2020)], a series of simple and practical methods are proposed to improve the calibration accuracy of the parameters-the diattenuation of the optics, absolute azimuth angle, and relative transmission corresponding to each pixel, thereby improving the polarization measurement accuracy of DPC. The calibration results show that, compared with the original methods, the accuracy of the diattenuation of the optics, relative azimuth angle, and relative transmission of three polarized channels obtained with the improved methods are improved from +/- 1%, 0.1 degree and +/- 2% to +/- 0.4%, 0.05 degree and +/- 0.2%, respectively. Finally, two verification experiments based on a non-polarized radiation source and a polarizing system were carried out in the laboratory respectively to verify the improvement of the parameters modified by the proposed methods on the polarization measurement accuracy of the DPC to be boarding the GaoFen-5 (02) satellite. The experimental results show that when the corrected parameters were employed, the average error in measuring the degree of linear polarization of non-polarized light source for all pixels in the three polarized bands and the maximum deviation of the degree of linear polarization between the values set by the polarizing system and the values measured by the DPC at several different field of view angles for each polarized spectral band are obviously reduced. Both the mean absolute errors and the root mean square errors of the degree of linear polarization obtained with the corrected parameters are much lower than those obtained with the original parameters. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Validation of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) surface UV radiation product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite was launched on 13 October 2017 to provide the atmospheric composition for atmosphere and climate research. The S5P is a Sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellite providing global daily coverage. The TROPOMI swath is 2600 km wide, and the ground resolution for most data products is 7.2 x 3.5 km(2) (5.6 x 3.5 km(2) since 6 August 2019) at nadir. The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) is responsible for the development of the TROPOMI UV algorithm and the processing of the TROPOMI surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation product which includes 36 UV parameters in total. Ground-based data from 25 sites located in arctic, subarctic, temperate, equatorial and Antarctic areas were used for validation of the TROPOMI overpass irradiance at 305, 310, 324 and 380 nm, overpass erythemally weighted dose rate/UV index, and erythemally weighted daily dose for the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 August 2019. The validation results showed that for most sites 60 %-80 % of TROPOMI data was within +/- 20 % of ground-based data for snow-free surface conditions. The median relative differences to ground-based measurements of TROPOMI snow-free surface daily doses were within +/- 10 % and +/- 5 % at two-thirds and at half of the sites, respectively. At several sites more than 90 % of cloud-free TROPOMI data was within +/- 20 % of ground-based measurements. Generally median relative differences between TROPOMI data and ground-based measurements were a little biased towards negative values (i.e. satellite data < ground-based measurement), but at high latitudes where non-homogeneous topography and albedo or snow conditions occurred, the negative bias was exceptionally high: from -30 % to -65 %. Positive biases of 10 %-15 % were also found for mountainous sites due to challenging topography. The TROPOMI surface UV radiation product includes quality flags to detect increased uncertainties in the data due to heterogeneous surface albedo and rough terrain, which can be used to filter the data retrieved under challenging conditions.

TI  - John Amos Comenius as the prophet of modern ideas in science education: in the light of Pansophia
T2  - HISTORY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Comenius (1592-1670) has been widely studied in educational research, although limited work has addressed his thinking about science education comprehensively. His Pansophist philosophy led him to believe that science was a necessary subject for all (Omnes). Comenius emphasised useful scientific knowledge and core principles (Omnia). He espoused the idea of sequence, from the importance of sensory experience to the way scientific content is organised (Omnino). For modern science education, those ideas still urge the mission of spreading science education, support the trends in science curriculum discourses, and emphasise hands-on experiences and sequential teaching and learning. Although Comenius's ideas were perhaps minor compared with those of Descartes, they suggest an alternative worldview connecting students to the world and encouraging them to engage with contemporary problems such as the environmental crisis. In particular, a case of Korean science education reform reasserts the universal implications of Comenius's systematic viewpoint on science education.

T2  - BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives We investigated the relationships between cultural worldviews, gambling risk perception, and gambling behavior with a sample of tourists in Macao.Methods Participants were enrolled at famous landmarks and casinos in Macao, China. Data were collected using several instruments to assess an individual's cultural worldviews, gambling risk perceptions, and gambling intentions.Results We found that the three-dimensional solution was valid for the Chinese version of the gambling expectancy scale. Correlational and mediational analyses revealed that the relationship between an individualistic worldview and gambling intention was fully mediated by gambling risk perception. Respondents with an egalitarian worldview perceived greater risk associated with gambling than those with other worldviews.Conclusion These findings demonstrated the important influence of cultural variables on perceived risk and behavior in gambling. Moreover, understanding gamblers' worldviews could be beneficial for problem gambling interventions. Future research directions and the limitations of the findings were discussed.

TI  - Pan-Arctic surface ozone: modelling vs. measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of the International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA), we report a modelling-based study on surface ozone across the Arctic. We use surface ozone from six sites - Summit (Greenland), Pallas (Finland), Barrow (USA), Alert (Canada), Tiksi (Russia), and Villum Research Station (VRS) at Station Nord (North Greenland, Danish realm) - and ozone-sonde data from three Canadian sites: Resolute, Eureka, and Alert. Two global chemistry models - a global chemistry transport model (parallelised-Tropospheric Offline Model of Chemistry and Transport, p-TOMCAT) and a global chemistry climate model (United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol, UKCA) - are used for model data comparisons. Remotely sensed data of BrO from the GOME-2 satellite instrument and ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) at Eureka, Canada, are used for model validation.The observed climatology data show that spring surface ozone at coastal sites is heavily depleted, making ozone seasonality at Arctic coastal sites distinctly different from that at inland sites. Model simulations show that surface ozone can be greatly reduced by bromine chemistry. In April, bromine chemistry can cause a net ozone loss (monthly mean) of 10-20 ppbv, with almost half attributable to open-oceansourced bromine and the rest to sea-ice-sourced bromine. However, the open-ocean-sourced bromine, via sea spray bromide depletion, cannot by itself produce ozone depletion events (ODEs; defined as ozone volume mixing ratios, VMRs, < 10 ppbv). In contrast, sea-ice-sourced bromine, via sea salt aerosol (SSA) production from blowing snow, can produce ODEs even without bromine from sea spray, highlighting the importance of sea ice surface in polar boundary layer chemistry.Modelled total inorganic bromine (Bry) over the Arctic sea ice is sensitive to model configuration; e.g. under the same bromine loading, Bry in the Arctic spring boundary layer in the p-TOMCAT control run (i.e. with all bromine emissions) can be 2 times that in the UKCA control run. Despite the model differences, both model control runs can successfully reproduce large bromine explosion events (BEEs) and ODEs in polar spring. Model-integrated tropospheric-column BrO generally matches GOME-2 tropospheric columns within - 50 % in UKCA and a factor of 2 in p-TOMCAT. The success of the models in reproducing both ODEs and BEEs in the Arctic indicates that the relevant parameterizations implemented in the models work reasonably well, which supports the proposed mechanism of SSA production and bromide release on sea ice. Given that sea ice is a large source of SSA and halogens, changes in sea ice type and extent in a warming climate will influence Arctic boundary layer chemistry, including the oxidation of atmospheric elemental mercury. Note that this work dose not necessary rule out other possibilities that may act as a source of reactive bromine from the sea ice zone.

TI  - Applying deep learning to NASA MODIS data to create a community record of marine low-cloud mesoscale morphology
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine low clouds display rich mesoscale morphological types and distinct spatial patterns of cloud fields. Being able to differentiate low-cloud morphology offers a tool for the research community to go one step beyond bulk cloud statistics such as cloud fraction and advance the understanding of low clouds. Here we report the progress of our project that aims to create an observational record of low-cloud mesoscale morphology at a near-global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) scale. First, a training set is created by our team members manually labeling thousands of mesoscale (128 x 128) MODIS scenes into six different categories: stratus, closed cellular convection, disorganized convection, open cellular convection, clustered cumulus convection, and suppressed cumulus convection. Then we train a deep convolutional neural network model using this training set to classify individual MODIS scenes at 128 x 128 resolution and test it on a test set. The trained model achieves a cross-type average precision of about 93 %. We apply the trained model to 16 years of data over the southeastern Pacific. The resulting climatological distribution of low-cloud morphology types shows both expected and unexpected features and suggests promising potential for low-cloud studies as a data product.

TI  - Household presentation of influenza and acute respiratory illnesses to a primary care sentinel network: retrospective database studies (2013-2018)
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Direct observation of the household spread of influenza and respiratory infections is limited; much of our understanding comes from mathematical models. The study aims to determine household incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI), lower (LRTI) and upper (URTI) respiratory infections within a primary care routine data and identify factors associated with the diseases' incidence.Methods: We conducted two five-year retrospective analyses of influenza-like illness (ILI), lower (LRTI) and upper (URTI) respiratory infections using the England Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network database; a cross-sectional study reporting incident rate ratio (IRR) from a negative binomial model and a retrospective cohort study, using a shared gamma frailty survival model, reporting hazard ratios (HR). We reported the following household characteristics: children < 5 years old, each extra household member, gender, ethnicity (reference white), chronic disease, pregnancy, and rurality.Results: The IRR where there was a child < 5 years were 1.62 (1.38-1.89, p < 0.0001), 2.40 (2.04-2.83, p < 0.0001) and 4.46 (3.79-5.255, p < 0.0001) for ILI, LRTI and URTI respectively. IRR also increased with household size, rurality and presentations and by female gender, compared to male. Household incidence of URTI and LRTI changed little between years whereas influenza did and were greater in years with lower vaccine effectiveness.The HR where there was a child < 5 years were 2.34 (95%CI 1.88-2.90, p < 0.0001), 2.97 (95%CI 2.76-3.2, p < 0.0001) and 10.32 (95%CI 10.04-10.62, p < 0.0001) for ILI, LRTI and URTI respectively. HR were increased with female gender, rurality, and increasing household size.Conclusions Patterns of household incidence can be measured from routine data and may provide insights for the modelling of disease transmission and public health policy.

TI  - First study on PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, and trace elements in the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) from southern Italy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPS), such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and non dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (ndl-PCBs), or also other toxic and potentially toxic elements tend to accumulate in the trophic web, and are associated with a wide range of deleterious effects in animals and humans. Although these contaminants have been banned since more than 30 years, their occurrence remains widespread in most of natural ecosystems. The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), being a top predator may cumulate large amounts of these contaminants, and could represent a keystone species serving as sentinel of ecosystem health in freshwater environments. The aim of this paper was to investigate the concentration of OCPs, ndl-PCBs, and essential and not essential elements in tissue samples of Eurasian otter in southern Italy. Six PCBs, seven OCPs, and thirteen trace elements were detected with high concentrations in few cases, however in general, the amounts of toxic compounds seem unlikely to hazard short-term conservation of this endangered mammal. The present paper is the first to provide baseline information concerning the presence of these substances in the Eurasian otter samples and from its fragile ecosystem in Italy.

TI  - Air quality variations in Northern South America during the COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lockdown measures led to air pollution decrease in several countries around the world such as China and India, whereas other regions experimented an increase in pollutant concentrations. Northern South America (NSA) was one of those areas where pollution changed during lockdown due to high fire activity. This study aims to analyze, for the first time in NSA, the behavior of selected criteria air pollutants during the implementation of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in two high populated cities of the region: Bogota and Medellin in Colombia. A set of tools including surface measurements, as well as satellite and modeled data were used. 24-hour average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 were collected from air quality stations for the lockdown period ranging from February 21 to June 30, 2020. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) was used to analyze the fire flux OC as a biomass burning (BB) indicator, and tropospheric NO2 concentrations were retrieved from TROPOML The HYSPLIT model was used to analyze back trajectories and fire data were obtained from MODIS sensor measurements. Our analysis shows short-term background NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 concentration reductions of 60%, 44%, and 40%, respectively, for the strict lockdown; and 62%, 58%, and 69% for the relaxed lockdown. Corresponding long-term reductions were of 50%, 32%, and 9% for the strict lockdown; and 37%, 29%, and 19% for the relaxed lockdown. Regional BB increased PM2.5 concentrations by 20 mu g/m(3) during the strict lockdown, and the Saharan dust event increased PM10 concentrations up to 168 mu g/m(3) in Bogota, and 104 mu g/m(3) in Medellin, bringing an additional risk of morbidity and mortality for population. Regional BB has several causes that need to be properly managed to benefit local air quality improvement plans. Future cleaner transport policies equivalent to reduced lockdown mobility could bring pollution close to WHO guidelines. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Testing the value of freely available Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and OLI pan- sharpened imagery in discriminating commercial forest species
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of remotely sensed data in forest applications has grown significantly. Whereas high spatial resolution sensors have been successful in mapping and monitoring commercial forests, their cost, accessibility, and spatial coverage remain a critical challenge. Hence, it is was necessary to investigate the value of new and improved freely available sensors in forest species mapping using the Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). This study evaluated the performance of new freely available and improved raw and pan-sharpened Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery in discriminating seven key plantation forest species in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Accuracies achieved using the Landsat (OLI) imagery were benchmarked against the WorldView-2 imagery. Results show that raw and pan-sharpened bands successfully delineated commercial forest species, with overall classification accuracies of 79% and 77.8%, respectively. Although these accuracies were lower than the 86.5% achieved from the higher resolution Worldview-2 image data, our findings demonstrate that the Landsat 8 OLI's lower spatial resolution (30 m) generated a plausible performance in discriminating forest species. Hence, Landsat 8 OLI could be useful in providing existing and historical preliminary forestry assessment due to its free availability, wide spatial coverage as well as its rich archive dating back to the 1970s.

TI  - Occurrence and tissue distribution of organochlorinated compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Magellanic penguins (<i>Spheniscus magellanicus</i>) from the southeastern coast of Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seabirds are suitable biomonitors for several persistent organic pollutants (POP), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), although scarce studies of PAHs in seabirds are available, especially in South American populations.Therefore, this study aimed to assess OCPs, PCBs and PAHs, through gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, in liver (n = 9) and muscle tissue (n = 13) from juvenile Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) found stranded on the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil. DDT-related compounds were the most frequently detected OCP, and 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the main DDT metabolite found in penguin tissues. OCP concentrations in liver were two-fold higher than in muscle tissues. Compound specific ratios identified recent exposure of penguins to some OCPs as well as evidence of legacy pollution associated with industrial sources. The predominant PCB congeners were PCB 8/5, PCB 138/160 and PCB 153/132, with c'onc'entrations ranging from <LOQ and 1500 ng g(-1) dry weight.This study comprises one of the few PAHs reports in penguin tissues, and, although most compounds were detected at very low levels or below the limit of quantitation (LOQ), the concentrations reported herein were up to 100 -fold higher than in previous studies in penguins. Therefore, considering penguin vulnerability to marine oil spills during migration routes, further assessments are required in different tissues in order to assess potential environmental health risks to these sentinel species.

TI  - Multi-axial large-scale testing of a 34 m wind turbine blade section to evaluate out-of-plane deformations of double-curved trailing edge sandwich panels within the transition zone
T2  - WIND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transverse cracks in the double curved trailing edge panels within the transition zone are among one of the increasingly encountered in-field damages found on wind turbine blades today. Believed to be root cause of these transverse cracks, are the out-of-plane deformation of the double curved trailing edge pressure side panels. These deformations are evaluated on the inner 15 m section of a 34 m wind turbine blade - referred to here as the root section. Through a parametrical study the free end of the root section is loaded in the quasi-static regime comprising edgewise loading (Fy) and torsional moment (Mz) around the longitudinal axis of the blade. The root section is through a multi-scale numerical analysis found to exhibit representative structural behavior in terms of out-of-plane deformations within the area of interest. A combination between Fy and Mz are found to generate the highest peak-to-peak out-of-plane deformation of 15.9 mm.

TI  - Satellite-based mapping of the Universal Thermal Climate Index over the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) is an important and frequently used indicator for evaluating thermal comfort. However, there is a lack of city-scale UTCI mapping over urban agglomerations during heat waves, and of studies of the variation of UTCI-based urban heat island intensities across cities. In addition, there is a need to evaluate the relationships among UHI intensities calculated by different types of temperature. In this study of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), we conducted city-scale UTCI mapping during periods of heat waves, based largely on satellite data. We then compared the UHI intensities in three megacities (Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou) in terms of the UTCI, and distinguished the differences between UHI intensities based on different types of temperature. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) The UTCI varies considerably with land cover type, with values generally higher in urban areas. Although the spatial pattern of UTCI and air temperature appears similar, over urban surfaces the former indicator is significantly higher than the latter. (2) The areas affected by (very) strong thermal stress (quantified by the UTCI) expanded by 18% and 36.2%, respectively, during daytime and nighttime over the YRUDA from 2002 to 2018. The increase occurred mainly in city peripheries where rapid urbanization has occurred. (3) The UTCI-based UHI intensity (UHII) is lower than those based on land surface temperature (LST) and mean radiant temperature, but greater than those based on surface air and dew-point temperature. The difference among these UHIIs (i.e., UTCI- and other temperature-based measures) over the three selected megacities are relatively small in the day, but they are relatively large at night. Our results are potentially valuable for facilitating city-scale UTCI mapping and for evaluating thermal comfort at the regional scale. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pre- and post-failure spatial-temporal deformation pattern of the Baige landslide retrieved from multiple radar and optical satellite images
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baige landslide in southwest China has been active for at least 50 years, and experienced two failure events on Oct. 10 and Nov. 3, 2018. The rock mass and debris of the slope failure formed a landslide dam. The discharge of the dammed lake plus the failure events caused significant socio-economic losses. Many slow-moving areas appeared after the two failure events and potential landslide risk still exists. Retrieving the long-term spatial-temporal pattern of landslide activity can help us to understand and mitigate landslide disasters. However, it is difficult to monitor all movement episodes of some landslides using single satellite dataset and method, due to the different deformation characteristics. Employing multiple radar and optical images may solve this problem. In this study, the Landsat 8, the ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images are used to obtain the surface displacements before the first failure event by using the cross-correlation technique (for Landsat 8 images) and the pixel offset tracking technique. The displacement velocity map after the second failure is derived by the Multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) method from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and the Sentinel-1 images. The maximum radar line of sight (LOS) average velocity is 3 m/yr between Jan. 2007 and Feb. 2011, and 12 m/yr between Jul. 2015 and Jul. 2018. From Oct. 2013 to Feb. 2018, the maximum horizontal average velocity is 5.8 m/yr. The movement accelerated from Jul. 2017. A large deformation area appeared on the south of the failed slope after the second failure. The unstable area observed by the MT-InSAR is much larger than that obtained through the field measurements. In the first month after the second failure, the maximum LOS displacements are more than 20 cm. The depletion area and the neighboring zones of the landslide are unstable even one year after the second failure. This study shows how to use multiple satellite images and hybrid remote sensing techniques to investigate the landslide deformation history, and illustrates the benefits of landslide monitoring based on images from multiple satellite sensors.

TI  - Evaluation of immunomodulatory effects of <i>Boswellia sacra</i> essential oil on T-cells and dendritic cells
T2  - BMC COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE AND THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Boswellia sacra resin has been commonly used as analgesic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, which reflect its immunomodulatory activity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and sentinel cells that regulate the immune response. This study aims at investigating whether crude essential oil extracted from Boswellia sacra resin (BSEO), has a potential effect on the phenotype and functions of human monocyte-derived DCs. Methods Oil extract from the resin of Boswellia sacra was prepared by hydrodistillation using a custom made hydrodistiller. BSEO-mediated cell viability has been initially studied on human skin dermis cells (HSD) and DC precursors using quantitative and qualitative assays before applying on DCs. Human DCs were generated from differentiated peripheral blood monocytes cultured in media containing both GM-CSF and IL-4. DCs were exposed to 5 mu g/mL or 10 mu g/mL of BSEO in vitro. Morphological, phonotypical, and functional properties studied with microscopy, flow cytometry, and ELISA. Results Crude BSEO was found to interfere with the maturation and differentiation of DCs from precursor cells in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BSEO-treated DCs, cultured in the presence of LPS, reduced the ability of allogeneic T cells to proliferate compared to that co-cultured with LPS-stimulated DCs only. In addition, the endocytic capacity and secretion of IL-10 by DCs treated with BSEO was enhanced in comparison to LPS treated cells. Analysis of the chemical composition of BESO using GC-MS (Clarus 500 GC/MS, PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT) revealed the presence of compounds with several biological activities including antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Conclusion Results indicated that BSEO deviates the differentiation of monocytes into immature DCs. Furthermore, stimulation of immature DCs with BSEO was unable to generate full DC maturation. However, these findings may potentially be employed to generate DCs with tolerogenic properties that are able to induce tolerance in diseases with hypersensitivity, autoimmunity as well as transplantation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to find out what kind of worldviews Finnish principals identify in their schools and the kind of lived realities of worldviews that are affecting schools from the perspective of school leadership. The issues were considered using a wide worldview framework, which includes religious and non-religious worldviews and focused on the lived realities of worldviews. Seven principals in basic education were interviewed, and the resulting data were analysed using both inductive and deductive content analysis methods. According to the results, diversity and a plurality of worldviews was emphasised in the schools, principals identifying a total of 30 different worldviews including both religious and non-religious worldviews. The lived realities of worldviews were separated into four categories; worldviews in school practices, the neutrality of schools, visibility of individuals' worldviews, and worldviews education. The principals' role and responsibility in accepting actualisations were emphasised and there were differences in how principals considered and accepted the visibility of worldviews in schools.

TI  - Forest height estimation and change monitoring based on artificial neural network using Geoscience Laser Altimeter System and Landsat data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous forest inventory is critical to forestry monitoring, Earth science applications, and global carbon cycle researching. Traditional field measurements of forest inventory are time-consuming. Targeting the problem, our study proposes an approach for monitoring the forest tree heights by combining geoscience laser altimeter system data with land surface reflectance data from Landsat TM based on artificial neural network (ANN) model in the Nanning research region. The land surface reflectance data are used as inputs of ANN model. The GLAS data are used to derive tree heights for training ANN model. Then the forest height spatial distribution and corresponding height change during 2003 to 2006 are investigated. The validation shows the high precision of modeling tree heights by, respectively, calculating determination coefficient (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of evaluations from 2003 to 2006 (R-2 = 0.667, mean RMSE = 3.219 m). Finally, the change trends of forest tree heights in Nanning region are obtained by calculating the difference of tree heights from 2003 to 2006.

TI  - Monitoring CO emissions of the metropolis Mexico City using TROPOMI CO observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5 satellite (S5-P) measures carbon monoxide (CO) total column concentrations as one of its primary targets. In this study, we analyze TROPOMI observations over Mexico City in the period 14 November 2017 to 25 August 2019 by means of collocated CO simulations using the regional Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. We draw conclusions on the emissions from different urban districts in the region. Our WRF-Chem simulation distinguishes CO emissions from the districts Tula, Pachuca, Tulancingo, Toluca, Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Mexico City, and Mexico City Arena by 10 separate tracers. For the data interpretation, we apply a source inversion approach determining per district the mean emissions and the temporal variability, the latter regularized to reduce the propagation of the instrument noise and forward-model errors in the inversion. In this way, the TROPOMI observations are used to evaluate the Inventario Nacional de Emisiones de Contaminantes Criterio (INEM) inventory that was adapted to the period 2017-2019 using in situ ground-based observations. For the Tula and Pachuca urban areas in the north of Mexico City, we obtain 0.10 +/- 0.004 and 0.09 +/- 0.005 Tg y(-1) CO emissions, which exceeds significantly the INEM emissions of < 0:008 Tgyr 1 for both areas. On the other hand for Mexico City, TROPOMI estimates emissions of 0:14 +/- 0:006 Tgyr 1 CO, which is about half of the INEM emissions of 0.25 Tg yr(-1), and for the adjacent district Mexico City Arena the emissions are 0:28 +/- 0:01 Tg yr(-1) according to TROPOMI observations versus 0.14 Tg yr(-1) as stated by the INEM inventory. Interestingly, the total emissions of both districts are similar (0.42 +/- 0.016 Tg yr(-1) TROPOMI versus 0.39 Tgyr 1 adapted INEM emissions). Moreover, for both areas we found that the TROPOMI emission estimates follow a clear weekly cycle with a minimum during the weekend. This agrees well with ground-based in situ measurements from the Secretaria del Medio Ambiente (SEDEMA) and Fourier transform spectrometer column measurements in Mexico City that are operated by the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change Infrared Working Group (NDACC-IRWG). Overall, our study demonstrates an approach to deploying the large number of TROPOMI CO data to draw conclusions on urban emissions on sub-city scales for metropolises like Mexico City. Moreover, for the exploitation of TROPOMI CO observations our analysis indicates the clear need for further improvements of regional models like WRF-Chem, in particular with respect to the prediction of the local wind fields.

AB  - Forest fires are a common feature in the Mediterranean forests through the years, as a wide tract of forest fortune is lost because of the incendiary fires in the forests. The enormous damages caused by forest fires enhanced the efforts of scientists towards the attenuation of the negative effects of forest fire and consequently the minimization of biodiversity losses by searching more for the adequate distribution of attempts on forest fire prevention and, suppression. The multi-temporal Principal Components Analysis is applied to a pair of images of consecutive years obtained from Landsat-8 satellite to unconventional map and assess the spatial extent of the burned areas on the island of Thasos, Greece. First, the PCA was applied on the before fire image, and then a multi-temporal image is created from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th band of before and after images including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to enhance the results. The results from the different steps of this analysis robustly mapped the burned areas by 82.28 ha confirmed by almost 85%. Are compared with data provided by the local forest service in order to assess their accuracy. The multi-temporal PCA outputs including NDVI (PC 4, PC %, and PC 6) give better accuracy due to its ability to distinguish the burned areas of older years and to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index that gives better variance to the image.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Approach for Producing High-Resolution NDVI Time-Series Datasets
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of concurrently high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing data is highly desirable as they represent a key element for effective monitoring in various environmental applications. However, due to the tradeoff between the spatial resolution and acquisition frequency of current satellites, such data are still lacking. Many studies have been undertaken trying to overcome these problems; however, a couple of long-standing limitations remain, including accommodating abrupt temporal changes, dealing with complex and heterogeneous landscapes, and integrating other satellite datasets as well. Accordingly, this paper proposes a deep learning spatiotemporal data fusion approach based on Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) to fuse the NDVI retrievals from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images. The performances of VDSR are analyzed in comparison with those of two other classical methods, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method. The results obtained indicate that VDSR outperforms other data fusion algorithms as it generated the least blurred images and the most accurate predictions of synthetic NDVI values, particularly in areas with heterogeneous landscapes and abrupt land-cover changes. The proposed algorithm has broad prospects to improve near-real-time agricultural monitoring purposes and derivation of crop status conditions in the field-scale.

TI  - Activation of T helper cells in sentinel node predicts poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrence in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) significantly reduces overall survival. Improved understanding of the host's immune status in head and neck cancer may facilitate identification of patients at higher risk of recurrence and improve patients' selection for ongoing clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). We aimed to investigate Sentinel Node-derived T-cells and their impact on survival. We enrolled prospectively 28 OSCC patients treated at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden with primary tumour excision and elective neck dissection. On top of the standard treatment, the enrolled patients underwent sentinel node procedure. T cells derived from Sentinel nodes, non-sentinel nodes, primary tumour and PBMC were analyzed in flow cytometry. Patients who developed recurrence proved to have significantly lower level of CD4+CD69+in their sentinel node (31.38 +/- 6.019% vs. 43.44 +/- 15.33%, p=0.0103) and significantly higher level of CD8+CD HLA-DR+(38.95 +/- 9.479% vs. 24.58 +/- 11.36%, p=0.0116) compared to disease-free individuals. Survival analysis of studied population revealed that patients with low proportion of CD4+CD69+had significantly decreased disease-free survival (DFS) of 19.7 months (95% CI 12.6-26.9) compared with 42.6 months (95% CI 40.1-45.1) in those with high CD4+CD69+proportion in their Sentinel Nodes (log-rank test, p=0.033). Our findings demonstrate that characterization of T-cell activation in Sentinel Node serves as a complementary prognostic marker. Flow cytometry of Sentinel Node may be useful in both patients' surveillance and selection for ongoing CPI clinical trials in head and neck cancer.

TI  - Quantifying the influence of plot-level uncertainty in above ground biomass up scaling using remote sensing data in central Indian dry deciduous forest
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is much needed for net carbon assessments. The aim of the study is to determine the uncertainty in biomass estimation in terms of field plot size, shape and location error using field plot and remote sensing data in tropical dry deciduous forests of India. Detailed tree measurements and location mapping are performed in 13 (1 ha) plots and 1 a very large permanent plot of 32 ha and AGB is estimated using local volume equations. Remote sensing-based AGB estimated using a multiple linear regression model between the reflectance (Sentinel-2) and backscatter (Sentinel-1) with field AGB. The result shows relative root mean square error of the model decreased by approximately 50% with a plot size increase from 0.01 ha (64%) to 0.64 ha (14%). Furthermore, we also observed that the effect of global positioning system location errors in AGB modelling would be negated by increasing plot size.

TI  - The short life of the volcanic island New Late'iki (Tonga) analyzed by multi-sensor remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based Earth observation plays a key role for monitoring volcanoes, especially those which are located in remote areas and which very often are not observed by a terrestrial monitoring network. In our study we jointly analyzed data from thermal (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite VIIRS), optical (Operational Land Imager and Multispectral Instrument) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X) satellite sensors to investigate the mid-October 2019 surtseyan eruption at Late'iki Volcano, located on the Tonga Volcanic Arc. During the eruption, the remains of an older volcanic island formed in 1995 collapsed and a new volcanic island, called New Late'iki was formed. After the 12 days long lasting eruption, we observed a rapid change of the island's shape and size, and an erosion of this newly formed volcanic island, which was reclaimed by the ocean two months after the eruption ceased. This fast erosion of New Late'iki Island is in strong contrast to the over 25 years long survival of the volcanic island formed in 1995.

TI  - Appraisal of Spatial Distribution of Degraded Lands Using Geo-spatial Techniques
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space borne satellite data and GIS tool were effectively used in modeling, mapping, and monitoring of degraded lands. The hybrid techniques based-visual interpretation of LISS III on 1:50,000 scale followed by real time ground truth approach were identified sheet erosion (80028.21 ha), gullied (25193.62 ha), ravine nous lands severe (26710.84 ha), ravine nous lands deep to deep moderate (27483.00 ha), salt affected soils (4498.63 ha) and barren rocky land (124.94 ha). The highest area occupied in Sabalgarh 42.0% followed by Joura 38.62%, Porasa 34.25%, Kailaras 28.53%, Morena 25.21% and 21.30% in Ambah tehsil. Overall, 164070.67 ha areas were found under-degraded lands by showing 32.93% of total study area (498917 ha). From the results, it was also indicated that the sheet and gullied severely degraded areas primarily distribute in Ambah, Joura, Kailaras, Morena, Porsa, and Sabalgarh, respectively. The sheet and gullied degraded land occupied 16.06 and 5.06% areas occupied of whole districts. Similarly, the ravines-moderate deep to very deep extremely degradation area accounts for 3.75, 5.21, 4.46, 15.95 and 5.26%, in Ambaha, Joura, Morena, Porsa and Sabalgarh tehsil, respectively, while 5.52% areas in whole districts. Saline Sodic-slightly and moderately degraded area was distributed 0.28, 4.02, 1.78 and 0.35% in Joura, Kailaras, Morena and Sabalgarh tehsils which covered 0.90% area of the in whole district. The extent and geographical distribution of degraded lands were identified in a cost effective manner using remotely sensed data and information on degraded lands used as an input for future planning, reclamation, and conservation programs.

TI  - Small Molecules for Multi-Wavelength Near-Infrared Fluorescent Mapping of Regional and Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Colorectal Cancer Staging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing lymph node (LN) status during tumor resection is fundamental for the staging of colorectal cancer. Current guidelines require a minimum of 12 LNs to be harvested during resection and ultra-staging regional lymph nodes by sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment is being extensively investigated. The current study presents novel near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes for simultaneous pan lymph node (PanLN; regional) and SLN mapping. PanLN-Forte was intravenously injected in mice and assessed for accumulation in regional LNs. SLN800 was injected intradermally in mice, after which the collection and retention of fluorescence in SLNs were measured using indocyanine green (ICG) and its precursor, SLN700, as references. LNs in the cervical, inguinal, jejunal, iliac, and thoracic basins could clearly be distinguished after a low dose intravenous injection of PanLN-Forte. Background fluorescence was significantly lower compared to the parent compound ZW800-3A (p < 0.001). SLN700 and SLN800 specifically targeted SLNs with fluorescence being retained over 40-fold longer than the current clinically used agent ICG. Using SLN700 and SLN800, absolute fluorescence in SLN was at least 10 times higher than ICG in second-tier nodes, even at 1 hour post-injection. Histologically, the fluorescent signal localized in the LN medulla (PanLN-Forte) or sinus entry (SLN700/SLN800). PanLN-Forte and SLN800 appear to be optimal for real-time NIR fluorescence imaging of regional and SLNs, respectively.

TI  - Anatomy and physiology of the sentinel lymph nodes of the upper extremity: Implications for axillary reverse mapping in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study characterizes the physiological drainage of the normal upper extremity using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) lymphoscintigraphy axillary reverse lymphatic mapping (ARM).Methods A consecutive series of patients assessed with SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy ARM of the upper extremity were included. Anatomical localization of the axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) was completed in normal axillae in relation to consistent anatomic landmarks. Retrospective case note analysis was performed to collect patient demographic data.Results A total of 169 patients underwent SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy, and imaging of 182 normal axillae was obtained. All patients (100%) had an axillary SLN identified: 19% had a single contrast-enhanced SLN in the axilla and the remainder had multiple. The SLN(s) of the upper extremity was located in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of the axilla in 97% of cases (177 axillae). When the SLN(s) was found in the UOQ of the axilla, second-tier lymph nodes were found predominantly in the upper inner quadrant (50% of cases).Conclusions The upper extremity SLN(s) is located in a constant region of the axilla. This study provides the most complete investigation to date and results can be directly applied clinically to ARM techniques and adjuvant radiation planning.

TI  - DPIM-Based InSAR Phase Unwrapping Model and a 3D Mining-Induced Surface Deformation Extracting Method: A Case of Huainan Mining Area
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mining subsidence in mining area could cause large-gradient deformation in a short period of time. When the deformation gradient exceeds the threshold value of the Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technology monitoring gradient, D-InSAR technology is likely to cause the failure of InSAR phase unwrapping algorithm. At this time, the InSAR technology is unable to monitor the 3D surface deformation. Aiming at these problems, an dynamic probability integral method (DPIM)-based InSAR phase unwrapping model and a method of extracting 3D surface deformation were proposed. The phase unwrapping model firstly used the empirical parameters of the probability integral of the mining face to predict the line of sight (LOS) direction deformation phase of the mining subsidence surface. Secondly, the phase of differential interferogram was unwrapped with the assist of the predicted LOS deformation phase under the constraint of DPIM, and the true LOS deformation phase was obtained, then the true LOS deformation phase transformed into LOS deformation. Finally, according to the geometric projection relationship between the LOS deformation and 3D deformation of mining subsidence surface, the probability integral prior model was brought into the equation of the geometric projection relationship. On the basis of relevant boundary conditions, the 3D surface deformation was extracted from the LOS direction deformation field of mining subsidence. The feasibility of the method was verified by the simulation experiment results. The differential interferogram of the subsidence basin was obtained by the differential interference processing of image data of Sentinel-1A on Nov. 16, 2017 and Dec. 10, 2017 of 1613 working face of Guqiao South Mine. By using the DPIM-based phase unwrapping model, the phase of differential interferogram was unwrapped and the 3D surface deformation during this period as well as the deformation extraction method were developed. The results showed that the maximum fitting error value of subsidence was 79 mm, about 8.33% of the maximum value of subsidence, and the fitting error of mean square of subsidence was +/- 33.5 mm. The results showed that the DPIM-based phase unwrapping model and the method of extracting 3D surface deformation proposed in this paper have certain engineering application values.

TI  - Delay in surgery is associated with axillary upstaging of clinically node negative breast cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Most breast cancer (BC) patients present with early disease and clinically negative lymph nodes (cN0). Timing of surgery has not been standardized. We hypothesized that surgical delay results in an increased likelihood of nodal metastasis.Methods Patients diagnosed with cN0 BC undergoing surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy as initial therapy between 2006 and 2014 were identified in the NCDB and divided into four groups based on time intervals between diagnosis and surgery (<4 weeks, 4-8 weeks, 8-12 weeks, and >12 weeks). Regression analysis evaluated the independent impact of surgical timing on axillary upstaging and survival.Results Of 355,443 patients with cN0 BC, 39.6% had surgery within 4 weeks and 5.4% more than 12 weeks from diagnosis. After controlling for relevant factors, a month delay in surgery was associated with an increased likelihood of nodal positivity (odds ratio: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.05; p < .001) and decreased overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.04; p < .001). When compared to patients who underwent surgery less than 4 weeks from diagnosis, the absolute increase in nodal positivity and relative risks were 5.3% (95% CI: 0.047-0.059) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.30-1.38), respectively, in the more than 12 weeks group.Conclusions Delay in BC surgery in cN0 patients was associated with an increased likelihood of axillary upstaging and decreased survival.

TI  - Increased case-finding and uptake of direct-acting antiviral treatment essential for micro-elimination of hepatitis C among people living with HIV: a national record linkage study
T2  - HIV MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Micro-elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and co-infected with HCV has been proposed as a key contribution to the overall goal of HCV elimination. While other studies have examined micro-elimination in HIV-treated cohorts, few have considered HCV micro-elimination among those not treated for HIV or at a national level.Methods Through data linkage of national and sentinel surveillance data, we examined the extent of HCV testing, diagnosis and treatment among a cohort of PLHIV in Scotland identified through the national database of HIV-diagnosed individuals, up to the end of 2017.Results Of 5018 PLHIV, an estimated 797 (15%) had never been tested for HCV and 70 (9%) of these had undiagnosed chronic HCV. The odds of never having been tested for HCV were the highest in those not on HIV treatment [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.15-10.10). Overall HCV antibody positivity was 11%, and it was at its highest among people who inject drugs (49%). Most of those with chronic HCV (91%) had attended an HCV treatment clinic but only half had been successfully treated (54% for those on HIV treatment, 12% for those not) by the end of 2017. The odds of never having been treated for HCV were the highest in those not on HIV treatment (aOR = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.59-8.15).Conclusions Our data demonstrate that micro-elimination of HCV in PLHIV is achievable but progress will require increased effort to engage and treat those co-infected, including those not being treated for their HIV.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with indocyanine green compared to blue dye tracer in gynecologic malignancies-A single center experience of 218 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives To compare the detection rates of sentinel lymph nodes after converting the tracer technique from blue dye to indocyanine green (ICG).Methods Patients with uterine or cervical cancer were enrolled for sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection. A total of 109 consecutive patients were analyzed and compared to a historical cohort of 109 consecutive patients with the sentinel blue dye technique. SLNs were analyzed by ultrastaging.Results The bilateral mapping rate of sentinel nodes was significantly higher with the ICG (78%; n = 85) compared to the blue dye tracer (61%; n = 67; p = .006). Neither the mean number of SLN nor the rate of low volume metastases showed significant differences between both cohorts. In the subgroup of endometrial cancer patients, the number of systematic lymph node dissection (LND) was significantly lower in the ICG cohort compared to the blue dye cohort (9% vs. 28%, p = .001).Conclusions ICG improved the detection rate of pelvic SLN compared to blue dye and may be considered as the superior technique. In clinical practice, the rate of systematic LND further decreased after incorporating SLN mapping with ICG. Reliable safety data are still pending.

TI  - Rapid identification of the invasive Small hive beetle (<i>Aethina tumida</i>) using LAMP
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Small hive beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida is an invasive pest of managed honey bees and has invaded Europe from Africa. The main risk point identified for incursions of this pest into the UK is imports of package bees and queens. Surveillance of this pest, carried out by the National Bee Unit, involves monitoring imports of live bees and routine screening of sentinel apiaries around the UK through collection of hive debris for visual inspection of pests. Currently, no molecular methods are used for screening hive debris for this pest in the UK. A new invasion of this pest would likely occur at low levels and might present with partial specimens broken up in the hive or eggs from the beetle, difficult to identify by visual inspection. Therefore, we sought to develop a fast and sensitive method for detecting SHB in hive debris by developing a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay.RESULT The LAMP assay was able to detect the SHB in 19 to 25.37 min and did not cross-react with any non-target species tested. The assay was sensitive and could detect 12pg of DNA and it was able to detect less than 1 mg of tissue in a 30 g complex matrix of honey bee hive debris. The assay could successfully amplify from crude extracts of partial tissue specimens.CONCLUSION This tool will allow rapid field screening of suspect beetle specimens and laboratory screening of hive debris for a notifiable exotic pest of honey bees.

TI  - A satellite-derived database for stand-replacing windthrow events in boreal forests of European Russia in 1986-2017
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Severe winds are among the main causes of disturbances in boreal and temperate forests. Here, we present a new geographic information system (GIS) database of stand-replacing windthrow events in the forest zone of European Russia (ER) for the 1986-2017 period. The delineation of windthrow areas was based on the full Landsat archive and two Landsat-derived products on forest cover change, namely the Global Forest Change and the Eastern Europe's forest cover change datasets. Subsequent verification and analysis of each windthrow was carried out manually to determine the type of related storm event, its date or date range, and geometrical characteristics. The database contains 102 747 elementary areas of damaged forest that were combined into 700 windthrow events caused by 486 convective or non-convective storms. The database includes stand-replacing windthrows only with an area > 0.05 and > 0.25 km(2) for the events caused by tornadoes and other storms, respectively. Additional information such as weather station reports and event descriptions from media sources is also provided. The total area of stand-replacing windthrows amounts to 2966 km(2), which is 0.19% of the forested area of the study region. Convective windstorms contribute 82.5% to the total wind-damaged area, while tornadoes and non-convective windstorms are responsible for 12.9% and 4.6% of this area, respectively. Most of the windthrow events in ER happened in summer, which is in contrast to Western and Central Europe, where they mainly occur in autumn and winter. Due to several data and method limitations, the compiled database is spatially and temporally inhomogeneous and hence incomplete. Despite this incompleteness, the presented database provides a valuable source of spatial and temporal information on windthrow in ER and can be used by both science and management. The database is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12073278.v6 (Shikhov et al., 2020).

TI  - GERALDINE (Google Earth Engine supRaglAciaL Debris INput dEtector): a new tool for identifying and monitoring supraglacial landslide inputs
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides in glacial environments are high-magnitude, long-runout events, believed to be increasing in frequency as a paraglacial response to ice retreat and thinning and, arguably, due to warming temperatures and degrading permafrost above current glaciers. However, our ability to test these assumptions by quantifying the temporal sequencing of debris inputs over large spatial and temporal extents is limited in areas with glacier ice. Discrete landslide debris inputs, particularly in accumulation areas, are rapidly "lost", being reworked by motion and icefalls and/or covered by snowfall. Although large landslides can be detected and located using their seismic signature, smaller (M <= 5.0) landslides frequently go undetected because their seismic signature is less than the noise floor, particularly supraglacially deposited landslides, which feature a "quiet" runout over snow. Here, we present GERALDINE (Google Earth Engine supRaglAciaL Debris INput dEtector): a new free-to-use tool leveraging Landsat 4-8 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine. GERALDINE outputs maps of new supraglacial debris additions within user-defined areas and time ranges, providing a user with a reference map, from which large debris inputs such as supraglacial landslides (>0.05 km(2)) can be rapidly identified. We validate the effectiveness of GERALDINE outputs using published supraglacial rock avalanche inventories, and then demonstrate its potential by identifying two previously unknown, large (>2 km(2)) landslide-derived supraglacial debris inputs onto glaciers in the Hayes Range, Alaska, one of which was not detected seismically. GERALDINE is a first step towards a complete global magnitude-frequency of landslide inputs onto glaciers over the 38 years of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery.

TI  - oung Adults' Assertiveness in Relation to Parental Acceptance-Rejection in Greece and in Bosnia and Herzegovina
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - This study explored the relation between assertiveness and parental behavior as perceived by young adults through parental acceptance-rejection and behavioral and psychological control. Alpha ssertiveness is a mode of personal behavior and communication characterized by willingness to stand up for one's own needs and interests in an open and direct way. Inappropriate parenting may be associated with assertiveness difficulties and as evidence-based findings from many surveys have shown that assertive skills can be improved, it seems to be of great importance to examine the relation between assertiveness and parental rejection along with lack of support, and vice versa. In this study, assertiveness was investigated using the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule and parental behavior was studied using the Adult Parental Acceptance-Rejection/Control Questionnaire. Psychosocial personality traits and psychological control were assessed through the Adult Personality Assessment Questionnaire and the Psychological Control Scale, respectively. The sample consisted of 1,117 university students from Greek universities in Athens, Greece, and in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). For all measures and their psychometric structure, factor equivalence for the two countries was verified through congruence coefficients and through confirmatory factor analyses. Findings showed that in respect to the Greek sample (but not the B&H sample), assertive-behavior skills are more common among men than women. Assertiveness for all participants is correlated with maternal psychological control and paternal acceptance and also with self-evaluation and worldview. Apparently, maternal psychological control and paternal acceptance-rejection seemed to be associated with young adults' levels of assertiveness to a greater degree than with the other parental behavior parameters assessed in the present research.

TI  - Effect of Photobiomodulation in Lipopolysaccharide-Treated Myoblasts
T2  - PHOTOBIOMODULATION PHOTOMEDICINE AND LASER SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on cell viability, synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin (IL)-6 inflammatory cytokine production in myoblasts cultured in the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs).Methods: C2C12 myoblasts were treated with LPS and PBM using different parameters (wavelength: 780 nm; beam spot: 0.04 cm(2); power output: 10 or 40 mW; energy density: 5 or 20 J/cm(2); and 20-sec exposure time). Nonirradiated cells were used to the control group.Results: An increase in cell viability was found in both LPS groups in comparison with the control. PBM with the higher power output (40 mW) induced a reduction in cell viability. PBM also modulated the synthesis of NO in the myoblasts, but did not alter the expression of IL-6.Conclusions: Based on these findings, PBM is capable of modulating the cell viability and the production of NO in LPS-treated myoblasts and it is, therefore, a possible tool for the treatment of muscle injury caused by infection.

TI  - Subglacial topography and ice flux along the English Coast of Palmer Land, Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent satellite data have revealed widespread grounding line retreat, glacier thinning, and associated mass loss along the Bellingshausen Sea sector, leading to increased concern for the stability of this region of Antarctica. While satellites have greatly improved our understanding of surface conditions, a lack of radio-echo sounding (RES) data in this region has restricted our analysis of subglacial topography, ice thickness, and ice flux. In this paper we analyse 3000 km of 150 MHz airborne RES data collected using the PASIN2 radar system (flown at 3-5 km line spacing) to investigate the subglacial controls on ice flow near the grounding lines of Ers, Envisat, Cryosat, Grace, Sentinel, Lidke, and Landsat ice streams as well as Hall and Nikitin glaciers. We find that each outlet is topographically controlled, and when ice thickness is combined with surface velocity data from MEaSUREs (Mouginot et al., 2019a), these outlets are found to discharge over 39.25 +/- 0.79 Gt a(-1) of ice to floating ice shelves and the Southern Ocean. Our RES measurements reveal that outlet flows are grounded more than 300 m below sea level and that there is limited topographic support for inland grounding line restabilization in a future retreating scenario, with several ice stream beds dipping inland at similar to 5 degrees km(-1). These data reinforce the importance of accurate bed topography to model and understand the controls on inland ice flow and grounding line position as well as overall mass balance and sea level change estimates. RES data described in this paper are available through the UK Polar Data Centre: https://doi.org/10.5285/E07D62BF-D58C-4187A019-59BE998939CC (Corr and Robinson, 2020).

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Trend and Its Drivers in East Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is affected by surface-atmosphere interaction. Yet, the degree to which surface and atmospheric factors impact the magnitude of LST trend is not well established. Here, we used surface energy balance, boosted regression tree model, and satellite observation and reanalysis data to unravel the effects of surface factors (albedo, sensible heat, latent heat, and ground heat) as well as incoming radiation (shortwave and longwave) on LST trends in East Africa (EA). Our result showed that 11% of EA was affected by significant (p < 0.05) daytime annual LST trends, which exhibited both cooling of -0.19 K year(-1) (mainly in South Sudan and Sudan) and warming of 0.22 K year(-1) (mainly in Somalia and Kenya). The nighttime LST trends affected a large part of EA (31%) and were dominated by significant warming trend (0.06 K year(-1)). Influenced by contrasting daytime and nighttime LST trends, the diurnal LST range reduced in 15% of EA. The modeling result showed that latent heat flux (32%), incoming longwave radiation (30%), and shortwave radiation (23%) were stronger in explaining daytime LST trend. The effects of surface factors were stronger in both cooling and warming trends, whereas atmospheric factors had stronger control only on surface cooling trends. These results indicate the differential control of surface and atmospheric factors on warming and cooling trends, highlighting the importance of considering both factors for accurate evaluation of the LST trends in the future.

TI  - Change detection analysis in coverage area of coal fire from 2009 to 2019 in Jharia Coalfield using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many coal-producing nations across the world face significant risks due to subsurface and surface coal fires. Thus, monitoring of coal fire propagation is the need to minimize the risk and extreme loss of energy resources. The present study aims to analyse the changes that occurred in coal fire area coverage from 2009 to 2019 in Jharia coalfield (JCF) using Land remote sensing satellite (Landsat) data. The land surface temperature (LST) was estimated separately for 2 years (2019 and 2009) using Landsat data of three bands (thermal infrared (TIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red band). The threshold LST (gamma(LST)) values were estimated for both the years for detection and delineation of fire-affected pixels. gamma(LST) were determined using the statistical method and observed to be 38.04 degrees C and 42.97 degrees C, respectively, for the year 2019 and 2009. The study results also indicated that satellite-based LST for 2019 was saturated at nearly 49.89 degrees C. Thus, the LST for high-temperature zones or surface fire zones cannot be determined using the specified band data. The LST estimated using Landsat data for 2019 was validated with field temperature measurement at 22 different locations using a thermal camera. The locations of each station were tracked using a global positioning system (GPS) device. It was found that the predicted LSTs from satellite data are highly correlated with the field data with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95.

TI  - Recessional pattern and surface elevation change of the Parvati Glacier, North-Western Himalaya (1965-2018) using remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a long-term assessment (1965-2018) of recessional and area change patterns as well as the recent decade surface velocity ((u) over bar, 2000-2001 and 2017-2018) and elevation change (dh/dt, 2003-2016) of the Parvati Glacier, north-western Himalaya. Multi-temporal high (Corona, Hexagon, and PlanetScope) to medium (Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel 2A- Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)) resolution images from 1965 to 2018 were analysed to evaluate multi-parameters of glacier dynamics. We estimated an average annual recessional rate of 37.5 +/- 0.5 m and total area loss of 2.2 +/- 0.01 km(2) for the Parvati Glacier over the past half-century (i.e. 1965-2018). During 1973-1989, the Parvati Glacier experienced a significant recession (70.9 +/- 3.1 m a(-1)) that resultant into disintegrated of the glacier in two separate glaciers between 1981 and 1989. We observed a higher average recession rate (28.4 +/- 1.6 m a(-1)) of the detached glacier after its disintegrated from the Parvati Glacier (18.7 +/- 1.6 m a(-1)) between 1989 and 2018. However, the debris-covered ice area of the Parvati Glacier (about 12%) increased twice that of the detached glacier (about 6.1%) during 1994-2018. The estimated. reveals a substantial slowdown by about 27.7% and about 20% for the Parvati and detached glacier, respectively, during 2000-2001 and 2017-2018. Overall the annual average surface lowering rate (-0.7 +/- 0.5 m a(-1)) for both the glacier has been almost similar during 2003-2016 but varied significantly at altitudinal. Our study shows inconsistency in previously reported recessional rate and observed advance phases in 1976-1989 and 2009-2013 for the Parvati Glacier during almost the same duration of the study. It is mainly ascribed to the misinterpretation of glacier boundaries using the Survey of India (SoI) topographic map of 1962 where glacier boundaries more generalized and by using coarser resolution of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images (1970s), particularly for the debris-covered area. Overall, the Parvati Glacier shows a significant recession and frontal area change; and in the recent decades, extensive surface lowering, along with an observable slowdown in glacier. and appearance of ice-cliffs in the ablation area collectively point towards substantial glacier degeneration over the period of our analysis.

TI  - Estimation of snow water equivalent from L-band radar interferometry: simulation and experiment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is the main feature of a snowpack that determines its impact on the natural environment. Because microwaves penetrate through the snowpack, microwave remote sensing enables the measurement of depth and snow water equivalent. A promising tool for determining SWE is synthetic-aperture radar, which provides a high spatial resolution (from metres to tens of metres). This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of snowpack sensing using radar interferometry. An approximate model of interferometric sensing based on the small perturbation method is proposed. As opposed to the well-known interferometric model, the proposed one takes into account microwave backscattering from the snow surface. We estimated the contribution of scattering from the snow surface to amplitude and interferometric phase values. Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite - 2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar - 2 (PALSAR-2), SWE was first determined by means of a radar interferometry method at a test site near Lake Baikal, Russia. The experiment consisted of comparing the phases of radar signals received when there was no snowpack (in September) and those in its presence (in February). We used a reference scatterer in the form of a trihedral corner reflector to calibrate the phase measurements. The SWE values were restored from the linear dependence between SWE and the interferometric phase. A comparison between the calculated and experimental data shows their good agreement.

TI  - Day and night synergy to improve subpixel urban impervious surface mapping in desert environments at 30-m Landsat resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies provide effective guidance for detecting subpixel urban impervious surface in desert environments. Such an environmental setting is substantially different from the study areas of most existing studies, especially with complicated desert landforms. To improve the accuracy of subpixel mapping of urban impervious surface in desert environments, an integrative approach is proposed to estimate fractional urban impervious surface at the 30-m resolution. This is done by the synergistic use of open-source datasets taken from day and night that characterize different aspects of human activities at a different time of a day. We carefully analyse the performance of three methods with model input combinations from different sources, i.e. the day and night image synergy, daytime images only, and georectified night-time International Space Station (ISS) photographs only. Three major findings are concluded from the analyses. First, the collective usage of remote sensing images derived from day and night yields reasonable results in all desert cities and outperforms any single-source data for subpixel urban impervious surface mapping. Second, among all the input features from multiple data sources, night light variables have a higher contribution than other variables of daytime images for subpixel urban impervious surface mapping in desert cities, regardless of lighting types. Third, since desert cities remain understudied in previous studies, the proposed synergy method fills this gap in the literature. This data fusion of multi-source remotely sensed data is promising, which can be employed for better subpixel urban mapping in support of various environmental and socioeconomic applications in the future.

TI  - C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for the classification of diverse cropping systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloudy conditions reduce the utility of optical imagery for crop monitoring. New constellations of satellites - including the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) and Sentinel-1A/B, both available under free and open data policies - can be used to create stacks of dense seasonal C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Yet to date, the contribution of SAR imagery to operational crop mapping is often limited to that of a gap-filler, compensating for optical data obscured by clouds. The Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) SAR Inter-Comparison Experiment is a multi-year, multi-partner project focused on evaluating methods for SAR-based crop classification. Stacks of dense time-series SAR imagery, from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, were acquired for 10 sites located in six countries. Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) classification methodologies were applied to these SAR data-stacks, as well as to data-stacks of optical only, and optimized SAR/optical data combinations. For the dense time-series SAR stacks, overall classification accuracies above 85% and 80% were obtained for 6 of 10 and 8 of 10 sites, respectively. For maize, the SAR-only data delivered user's and producer's accuracies greater than 90% for half the sites. For soya bean, accuracies greater than 80% were reported for 5 of 9 sites and classification accuracies were greater than 80% for wheat on half the sites. Classification results were influenced by the mix and number of agriculture classes present at each site, the available SAR imagery, as well as the training and validation data sets for individual crop types. These results have important operational implications for regions of the world dominated by cloudy conditions and the lack of adequate amounts of optical imagery to support satellite-based crop monitoring.

TI  - Surrender to Another Person: The Case of a Spiritual Master
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The experience and posture of surrender has been espoused by religious traditions as key to spiritual life and development for millennia. Within psychology, on the other hand, surrender's position has been likened to an "unwanted bastard child," and its research has been neglected. Moreover, when occurring in the context of a relationship with another person, the terms "submission" and "obedience," laden with negative connotations, have been commonly used. We propose that psychologically and spiritually developmental surrender is a common experience both when it occurs in relationship to "reality," the Self or God, and in the context of relationship with another person, as in love, sex, patientship, followership, and discipleship. We focus on surrender to a spiritual master, which is in some respects the most extreme form of surrender to another person and the most challenging for the modern secular worldview to accept and suggest that, with all its complexity and potential pitfalls, it can be a powerful enabler and facilitator of the search for the sacred, self-transcendence, and spiritual integration.

TI  - Evaluation of internal mammary lymph node biopsy during microsurgical breast reconstruction: An analysis of 230 consecutive patients
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Clinical significance of internal mammary (IM) lymph node biopsy during microvascular free flap breast reconstruction remains controversial. Some microsurgeons may choose to biopsy an IM lymph node during routine IM vessel dissection. The authors reviewed the results of IM lymph node biopsy during autologous breast reconstruction.Methods A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent autologous breast reconstruction during a seven-year period (January 2010 to January 2017) was performed. Patient demographic data, disease staging, flap details, pathology reports, and adjuvant treatment were evaluated.Results A total of 230 patients with a mean age of 52.1 (SD 9.3) underwent IM lymph node biopsy (n = 297). Single IM lymph node was removed in 169 patients, 2 nodes were removed in 56 patients, 3 nodes in 4 patients, and 4 nodes in a single patient. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated presence of IM lymph node metastasis in 16 patients (7.0%). Thirteen patients were found to have metastatic IM lymph nodes in the setting of immediate reconstruction. Three patients were found to have metastatic IM lymph nodes in the setting of delayed. Five out of 16 patients (31.3%) had negative axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and IM lymph nodes were the only site of nodal metastases. All five of these patients were upstaged accordingly and received adjuvant therapy based on the discussion at the multidisciplinary breast tumor conference.Conclusions Opportunistic internal mammary lymph node sampling during autologous breast reconstruction can be performed with minimal morbidity and has significant impact on the disease staging and adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy May Prevent Unnecessary Axillary Dissection in Patients with Inflammatory Breast Cancer Who Respond to Systemic Treatment
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive breast cancer treated up-front with systemic treatment. Both breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are controversial issues in the management of IBC. In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of SLNB in pathologically proven node-positive IBC patients. Methods: All patients with a histopathological diagnosis of IBC and biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes underwent systemic treatment. Patients with a complete clinical response in the axilla who underwent SLNB followed by standard axillary dissection were analyzed. Results: The study consisted of 25 female patients. The identification rate (IR) and the false negativity rate (FNR) were 17/25 and 2/10, respectively. Overall, 9/25 and 7/25 of patients had a complete pathological response (pCR) in the breast and axilla after systemic treatment, respectively. Although the pCR in the axilla was 2/4 in nonluminal HER2-positive patients, the highest IR 4/4 and the lowest FNR 0/2 were determined in these patients. In triple-negative patients, however, the IR was 2/4 and the FNR was found to be 0/2. Conclusions: SLNB may be considered in selected axilla-downstaged IBC patients including patients with a pCR with HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors. Axillary dissection may be, therefore, omitted in those with negative SLNs.

T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE INVESTIGATIVE OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance While regression is a commonly reported microscopic feature of melanoma, its prognostic significance is unclear.Objective To examine the impact of regression on sentinel node status and the likelihood of recurrence in primary cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck.Design Retrospective analysis of 191 adults who underwent surgical management for primary cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck between May 2002 and March 2019.Setting Tertiary academic center.Participants Patients appropriate for the study were identified by the Academic Health Center Information Exchange using a list of current procedural terminology codes. One hundred and ninety-one cases of invasive melanoma of the head and neck were included from 830 patients identified. Clinical features assessed for each patient included age, sex, location of primary lesion, date of diagnosis, and current disease status (alive with or without disease). Histologic features assessed were histological melanoma subtype (nodular vs non-nodular), Breslow thickness, Clark level, presence/absence of ulceration, mitotic rate per square millimeter, and regression. If applicable, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) status, date of recurrence, interval treatments, and date of death related to melanoma were recorded. Exclusion criteria included melanoma outside the anatomic parameters of head and neck, ocular or choroidal melanoma, mucosal melanoma, metastatic melanoma to the head or neck with no known primary tumor, melanoma of the head or neck with no surgical intervention, and non-melanoma skin cancers of the head and neck.Intervention/Exposure Surgery for cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) The association between presence of regression and Breslow thickness, sentinel node status, and recurrence.Results Of the 191 patients identified, 30.9% were female and 69.1% were male with a mean age at diagnosis of 62.6 (range 20-97) years. Mean Breslow thickness was 1.2 mm in those with regression and 2.0 mm in those without regression. In patients with regression, 17.6% had a positive sentinel node, and 13.0% experienced a recurrence. In patients without regression, 26.5% had a positive sentinel node, and 31.4% experienced a recurrence. When adjusted for other factors above, regression was not associated with positive sentinel node (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-2.00) or recurrence (OR = 0.33, CI = 0.07-1.01). Mitotic rate >2 was associated with recurrence (OR = 2.71, CI = 1.11-6.75, P = .03).Conclusions and Relevance Patients with presence of regression had thinner melanomas and trended toward decreased rates of sentinel node positivity and recurrence, suggesting regression may not be a negative prognostic indicator in patients with cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck.

TI  - Vegetation mapping of No Name Key, Florida using lidar and multispectral remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - LIght Detection And Ranging (lidar) data have been widely used in the areas of ecological studies due to lidar's ability to provide information on the vertical structure of vegetation in wildlife habitats. The overall objective of this project was to map the vegetation on No Name Key, Florida where endangered wildlife species reside using publicly available remote sensing data such as lidar data and high resolution aerial images (including National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images). The methods involved the use of 4 different classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Maximum Likelihood, and Mahalanobis Distance), different classification settings (default and custom settings), and normalization (original and normalized input bands) on 2 different input stacked images, NAIP image alone and NAIP combined with lidar data. A majority filter was applied to each classification output before performing the accuracy assessment. The result of performing the image classifications showed the following: across all inputs and classification algorithms, the highest overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (k) were achieved by the Random Forest classification on the NAIP-lidar stacked image with an applied majority filter and original input bands. The result also showed the airborne data combined with the lidar data resulted in a higher classification accuracy than the airborne data alone; and when normalization was applied to all the input bands or layers, the classification accuracies were not increased in most cases compared to when original bands were used in the classification. In most cases, the application of the majority filter increased the accuracy of the classification results as opposed to when no majority filter was applied. Instead of using default values, when the new parameter values (i.e., custom settings) for the penalty parameter (C) and the gamma (r) were used, the accuracies of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classified images were slightly increased compared to using the default values for the 2 parameters. With increased availability of public lidar data, combining the aerial image with lidar data would enhance the accuracy of vegetation mapping, which would lead to more effective and accurate wildlife management.

TI  - Biases in the albedo sensitivity to deforestation in CMIP5 models and their impacts on the associated historical radiative forcing
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate model biases in the representation of albedo variations between land cover classes contribute to uncertainties on the climate impact of land cover changes since pre-industrial times, especially on the associated radiative forcing. Recent publications of new observation-based datasets offer opportunities to investigate these biases and their impact on historical surface albedo changes in simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Conducting such an assessment is, however, complicated by the non-availability of albedo values for specific land cover classes in CMIP and the limited number of simulations isolating the land use forcing. In this study, we demonstrate the suitability of a new methodology to extract the albedo of trees and crops-grasses in standard climate model simulations. We then apply it to historical runs from 17 CMIP5 models and compare the obtained results to satellite-derived reference data. This allows us to identify substantial biases in the representation of the albedo of trees and crops-grasses as well as the surface albedo change due to the transition between these two land cover classes in the analysed models. Additionally, we reconstruct the local surface albedo changes induced by historical conversions between trees and crops-grasses for 15 CMIP5 models. This allows us to derive estimates of the albedo-induced radiative forcing from land cover changes since pre-industrial times. We find a multi-model range from 0 to -0.17 W m(-2), with a mean value of -0.07 W m(-2). Constraining the surface albedo response to transitions between trees and crops-grasses from the models with satellite-derived data leads to a revised multi-model mean estimate of -0.09 W m(-2) but an increase in the multi-model range. However, after excluding one model with unrealistic conversion rates from trees to crops-grasses the remaining individual model results vary between -0.03 and -0.11 W m(-2). These numbers are at the lower end of the range provided by the IPCC AR5 (-0.15 +/- 0.10 W m(-2)). The approach described in this study can be applied to other model simulations, such as those from CMIP6, especially as the evaluation diagnostic described here has been included in the ESMValTool v2.0.

TI  - Performance of MODIS aerosol products at various timescales and in different pollution conditions over eastern Asia
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality aerosol optical depth (AOD) data derived from MODIS is widely used in studying spatiotemporal trends of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in eastern Asia. However, the differences of MODIS-AOD (3/10 km DT; 10 km DB) under four pollution situations (No-Po; Sl-Po; Mo-Po; Se-Po) are rarely considered. In this study, the MODIS-AOD and AOD-Difference spatial distributions from 2008 to 2017 are analyzed through annual/seasonal mean AOD maps generated at 0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees resolution. The MODIS-AOD performances are validated using AERONET AOD data for various pollution situations and aerosol types. Annual validations indicate that the 10-km DB algorithm provides the best performance, followed by 3-km DT and 10 km DT. The DB algorithm can provide spatially continuous AOD data for all seasons, whereas the DT algorithm often fails to yield valid data during winter. The validations under different pollution conditions illustrate that severe pollution significantly affects the validity of data obtained by the DB algorithm. However, the accuracy of DT-derived AOD data is robust against interference. Under the same pollution conditions, the correlation coefficient of the DB algorithm is smaller than that of the DT algorithm. The quantity of valid data in the DB product is higher than those in DT products for all pollution conditions, especially under Se-Po.

TI  - Assessment of coastal geomorphological changes using multi-temporal Satellite-Derived Bathymetry
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study demonstrates the usability of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) to understand the geomorphological changes that have occurred in a coastal region located along Puducherry, India, where a beach restoration project was taken up in 2017 to arrest the shoreline erosion that is prevalent due to installation of hard structures. In the study, multi-temporal bathymetry data is generated by applying a non-linear machine learning technique of Support Vector Regression (SVR) on Landsat 8 OLI satellite datasets of 30 m resolution. The empirically driven SVR is calibrated and validated using eco-sounder data collected during field measurement campaigns and fairly accurate SDBs with Root Mean Square Errors and Mean Absolute Errors ranging between 0.40-1.07 m and 0.31-0.85 m, respectively are obtained. Subsequently, the derived temporal depth maps are studied to understand the morphological changes that have occurred in this coastal stretch and the results clearly show the development of a beach, north of the pier, followed by the stabilization of the coastline. The outcomes are further validated through an independent ArcGIS- DSAS based shoreline change analysis which suggests similar trends of accretion and erosion as observed through the bathymetry change analysis. The study thus substantiates that the beach restoration step has yielded positive results between 2017 and 2018 and throws light on the significance of SDBs in coastal monitoring, modelling and assessment.

TI  - Land subsidence and its effects on coastal erosion in the Nam Dinh Coast (Vietnam)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nam Dinh Coast is a constituent part of the dynamic coastline, belonging to the Red River Delta. It is bounded to the north and south by the Red and Day Rivers, with Ninh Co and So Rivers located in the middle. This coast has been undergoing severe erosion during the last hundred years. Over this period, vital agricultural area along the coastline has vanished into the sea and families have been forced to abandon their houses due to the erosive action of waves. Numerous studies were conducted to identify the major causes governing the erosion problems, and several hypotheses have been proposed. In the present work, remote sensing data analysis techniques with both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) were employed to examine the hypothesis that land subsidence is contributing to the erosion along the Nam Dinh Coast. The results revealed that the high lateral erosion rates observed at sandy beaches between estuaries are approximately -6 m/yr in the south and -10 m/yr in the north of the So River. Meanwhile, sediments transported from the rivers accumulate mainly around the estuaries, leading to rapid accretions of approximately +93, +4, and +46 m/yr for Day, Ha Lan (So River), and Ba Lat (Red River), respectively. Simultaneously, land is sinking and uplifting at highly uneven rates, with a few sections subsiding 10 times faster than the overall spatial average. Uplifting observed in southern areas ranges from +1.2 to +1.9 mm/yr. In contrast, subsidence was identified in the northern parts, with mean rates varying from -0.1 to -12.3 mm/yr. Based on the Bruun Rule, the combined effects of land subsidence and relative sea level rise (SLR) could explain approximately 66% of the observed rate of erosion in the northern part of Ha Lan. Findings from surface deformation data contribute to a deeper insight into coastal erosion in Nam Dinh.

M3  - Article
AB  - . The coronavirus pandemic has stirred interest in viruses. This has been accompanied by a proliferation of popular works trying to explain how viruses fit into the Christian worldview. In an anthropocentric perspective, viruses are easily regarded as malicious entities. This article, however, shows that a proper understanding of the biology of viruses actually adds another level of complexity to our perception of good and evil. Interestingly, this additional layer of complexity might help us solve some of the most urgent difficulties in the discussion about good and evil, if we recognize the subjective nature of what we call natural evil. We need to be more nuanced not merely in our theological discussion about good and evil, but also in the way we talk about viruses.

TI  - Ecological environment quality assessment of Xishuangbanna rubber plantations expansion (1995-2018) based on multi-temporal Landsat imagery and RSEI
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The specific impact of ecological environment quality at a regional scale due to the rubber plantations expansion is still unclear in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province, China. First, we used a pixel and phenology-based multiple normalization approach to map rubber plantations over six time periods during 1995-2018 with the available high-quality Landsat imagery. Second, a pixel-based optimized algorithm was developed to reduce the commission and omission errors of the rubber plantations maps and we mapped the rubber plantations expansion area. Third, a remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) was employed to assess the rubber plantations expansion area ecological environment quality. RSEI value decreased with the lowest value in 2007 (0.511) and increased with the highest value in 2016 (0.727). This study demonstrated that the ecological environment quality degraded from 1995 to 2007 with an increase of rubber plantations expansion, but improved gradually from 2007 to 2018 with the slow growth of rubber.

TI  - Space and ground-based remote sensing comparison of seasonal interaction of aerosol-cloud-precipitable water
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The exact aerosols interaction with cloud and precipitable water remains a good area of scientific interest, but remained poorly represented. In using aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as a satellite-based and Aeronet Robotic Network (AERONET) as ground-based station to estimate this interaction is very essential. However, the seasonal variation of aerosols and its interhemispheric approach has presented more clearly this idea. In this study, an adequate data extraction and management has been placed to determine AODs data gaps and have examined MODIS and AERONET AODs with cloud fraction and precipitable water over Karlsruhe (49.093N, 8.428E) located in Germany (Northern hemisphere) and Skukuza (24.992S, 31.587E) located in South Africa (Southern hemisphere) from the period between 2005 and 2019. An estimated relative bias error values of both AODs data was validated by correlating the results and performing the mean and standard deviation (S.D) analyses. In order to conclude error in AOD values, mot mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were performed. Furthermore, to provide knowledge of major aerosols contributor over both hemispheres, estimation of jet winds to see the zonal and meridional impacts through 7 day kinematic back trajectories at various initial pressures was performed. Additionally, estimated dust surface mass concentrations over both hemispheres using Dust Surface Mass Concentration layer from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The result showed 93.76% and 90.89% AOD data falls within expected values over Karlsruhe and Skukuza with corresponding RMSE and MAE of 0.06 +/- 0.81 and 0.04 +/- 0.58. Also, the monsoon season showed more agreement at southern hemisphere, with mean and S.D of 0.42 +/- 0.41. It is therefore concluded that MODIS AOD performance with cloud and precipitable is deeply dependent on geographic terrain. Hence, AERONET AOD gives precise measurement and should be used to validate satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth.

TI  - Spatial prediction of permafrost occurrence in Sikkim Himalayas using logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have generated permafrost probability distribution maps (10 m resolution) for the north-eastern Himalayan region in Sikkim using remote sensing measurements and machine learning algorithms. Four machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks, and two different sets of input data set, were used to generate a total of 8 machine learning models and hence 8 permafrost probability distribution maps. The first set of input data set included surface reflectance from atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2A spectral bands, elevation and slope parameters while the second set of input data set included mean annul air temperature (MAAT) and potential incoming solar radiation (PISR). Permafrost probability distribution maps obtained from the 8 models show reasonable agreement in the total spatial extent of permafrost occurrence but dissimilarities in the pattern of probability distribution. Accuracy assessment results are more optimistic towards models developed using spectral reflectance, elevation and slope parameters as input data set. Nevertheless, 5 out of 8 models agree that around 60% of total area under observation is highly likely to contain permafrost.

TI  - Changes of glacier facies on Hornsund glaciers (Svalbard) during the decade 2007-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in glacier facies (glacier zones), such as firn or superimposed ice (SI), are good indicators of glacier response to climate change. They are especially important for fast-warming Svalbard, where only a few glaciers are under glaciological mass balance monitoring. This paper presents a first study of changes of glacier facies extent for three tidewater glaciers located in southern Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and it is based on both satellite remote sensing and terrestrial data analysis, covering two time spans: 2007-2017 for Hansbreen and 2012-2017 for Storbreen and Hornbreen. Satellite remote sensing analysis include unsupervised classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from both decommissioned (ENVISAT ASAR) and modern satellite missions (RAD-ARSAT-2, Sentinel-1). The results of the SAR classification are compared to the information on glacier zones retrieved from terrestrial data, i.e. shallow cores and visual interpretation of 800 MHz Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) profiles. In addition, a novel application of the Internal Reflection Power (IRP) coefficient as an objective method of distinguishing glacier zones based on GPR data is discussed. Changes in glacier facies areas over time are analysed, as well as their correlation to Hansbreen's mass balance. The main finding of the study is that firn and SI of Hansbreen, Storbreen and Hornbreen significantly decreased over the study period. For example, due to continuous negative mass balance between 2010 and 2017, the contribution of firn area to Hansbreen's total area decreased ca. 14% (cumulative firn area loss during that time: similar to 45%) whereas since 2012 SI has not been distinguished as a vast area on this glacier. In addition, an east-west gradient of firn area loss was observed as a result of differences in local climate conditions. Therefore, for the common time span (i.e. 2012-2017) Hansbreen recorded a ca. 12% loss of firn contribution to glacier area whereas Hornbreen recorded ca. 9%. Finally, application of the IRP coefficient as an objective method of glacier zones discrimination by GPR data gave very good results, so the method is recommended for future analysis of glacier zones instead, or as a support, to popular visual interpretation of the GPR profiles.

TI  - Dissecting effects of orbital drift of polar-orbiting satellites on accuracy and trends of climate data records of cloud fractional cover
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometers such as the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) mounted aboard a series of NOAA and MetOp (Meteorological Operational) polarorbiting satellites provide 4-decade-long global climate data records (CDRs) of cloud fractional cover. Generation of such long datasets requires combining data from consecutive satellite platforms. A varying number of satellites operating simultaneously in the morning and afternoon orbits, together with satellite orbital drift, cause the uneven sampling of the cloudiness diurnal cycle along a course of a CDR. This in turn leads to significant biases, spurious trends, and inhomogeneities in the data records of climate variables featuring the distinct diurnal cycle (such as clouds). To quantify the uncertainty and magnitude of spurious trends in the AVHRR-based cloudiness CDRs, we sampled the 30 min reference CM SAF (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites - EUMETSAT - Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) Cloud Fractional Cover dataset derived from Meteosat First and Second Generation (COMET) at times of the NOAA and MetOp satellite overpasses. The sampled cloud fractional cover (CFC) time series were aggregated to monthly means and compared with the reference COMET dataset covering the Meteosat disc (up to 60 degrees N, S, W, and E). For individual NOAA and MetOp satellites the errors in mean monthly CFC reach +/- 10% (bias) and +/- 7% per decade (spurious trends). For the combined data record consisting of several NOAA and MetOp satellites, the CFC bias is 3%, and the spurious trends are 1% per decade. This study proves that before 2002 the AVHRR-derived CFC CDRs do not comply with the GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) temporal stability requirement of 1% CFC per decade just due to the satellite orbital-drift effect. After this date the requirement is fulfilled due to the numerous NOAA and MetOp satellites operating simultaneously. Yet, the time series starting in 2003 is shorter than 30 years, which makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about longterm changes in CFC. We expect that the error estimates provided in this study will allow for a correct interpretation of the AVHRR-based CFC CDRs and ultimately will contribute to the development of a novel satellite orbital-drift correction methodology widely accepted by the AVHRR-based CDR providers.

TI  - Mapping horizontal and vertical urban densification in Denmark with Landsat time-series from 1985 to 2018: A semantic segmentation solution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat imagery is an unparalleled freely available data source that allows reconstructing land-cover and landuse change, including urban form. This paper addresses the challenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30 m spatial resolution, for monitoring three-dimensional urban densification. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene recognition resulting in resolution loss, the proposed semantic segmentation framework provides a pixel-wise classification and improves the accuracy of urban form mapping. We compare temporal and spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open, sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on the 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whether we could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map ten other European cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks and the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the classification and the model's ability to generalize across space and time. Between the two semantic segmentation models, DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCN when sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score can be increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growth compared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the ten other European cities with training data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentage points over RF for both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The resulting maps across the years 1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen and Aarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities have used various planning policies in addressing population growth and housing supply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approach for automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images that is effective in areas experiencing a slow pace of urban growth or with small-scale changes.

TI  - Fire regime in Southern Brazil driven by atmospheric variation and vegetation cover
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of uncontrolled fire by human beings associated with climate conditions favorable to burning has caused social, economic and environmental damage in different parts of the world. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the variations in the occurrence of fire in Southern Region of Brazil caused by the seasonal characteristics of the years. We also sought to highlight the vegetation coverings most affected by fires within each year assessed and among the different ENSO events. Fire products from the MODIS were associated with meteorological elements and vegetation cover data, in addition to evaluating Carbon emission data made available by GFED. The correlation between the meteorological elements and fire was obtained by Spearman's non-parametric approach. Additionally, Mann Kendall's statistical test was performed with the harvested area extensions of three temporary agricultural crops (Maize, Soybean and Sugarcane) over 28 years. Fire in Southern Brazil correlates mainly with reduced rainfall and relative air humidity together with increased atmospheric pressure and increased wind speed. The periods under the effect of the cold phase of the phenomenon (La Nina) presented 26% to 114% more fire foci than those under the hot phase (El Nino). La Ninas also showed 7% to 77% more burned area than El Ninos. La Nina events emitted more carbon into the atmosphere than El Nino, and the greatest difference was observed between La Nina 2007/2008 (1.51 Tg) and El Nino 2015 (0.65 Tg). The vegetation covers most affected by the fire were those related to agricultural activity. Mann Kendall's statistics indicated that Sugarcane, an agricultural crop with flammable straw, showed a tendency to expand in the state of Parana'. between 1990 and 2018. Infra and inter-annual atmospheric variations and the mosaic of different vegetation covers determined the fire pattern in the study area over the period studied.

TI  - Quantifying vegetation biophysical variables from the Sentinel-3/FLEX tandem mission: Evaluation of the synergy of OLCI and FLORIS data sources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ESA's forthcoming FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission is dedicated to the global monitoring of the vegetation's chlorophyll fluorescence by means of an imaging spectrometer, FLORIS. In order to properly interpret the fluorescence signal in relation to photosynthetic activity, essential vegetation variables need to be retrieved concomitantly. FLEX will fly in tandem with Sentinel-3 (S3), which conveys the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that is designed to characterize the atmosphere and the terrestrial vegetation at a spatial resolution of 300 m. In this work we present the retrieval models of four essential biophysical variables: (1) Leaf Area Index (LAI), (2) leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), (3) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and (4) fractional vegetation cover (FCover). These variables can be operationally inferred by hybrid retrieval approaches, which combine the generalization capabilities offered by radiative transfer models (RTMs) with the flexibility and computational efficiency of machine learning methods. The RTM SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) was used to generate a database of reflectance spectra corresponding to a large variety of canopy realizations, which served subsequently as input to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm for each targeted variable. Three sets of GPR models were developed, based on different spectral band settings: (1) OLCI (21 bands between 400 and 1040 nm), (2) FLORIS (281 bands between 500 and 780 nm), and (3) their synergy. Their respective performances were assessed based on simulated reflectance scenes. Regarding the retrieval of Cab, the OLCI model gave good model performances (R-2: 0.91; RMSE: 7.6 mu g. cm(-2)), yet superior accuracies were achieved as a result of FLORIS' higher spectral resolution (R-2: 0.96; RMSE: 4.8 mu g. cm(-2)). The synergy of both datasets did not further enhance the variable retrieval. Regarding LAI, the improvement of the model performances by using only FLORIS spectra (R-2: 0.87; RMSE: 1.05 m(2).m(-2)) rather than only OLCI spectra (R-2: 0.86; RMSE: 1.12 m(2).m(-2)) was less evident but merging both data sets was more beneficial (R-2: 0.88; RMSE: 1.01 m(2).m(-2)). Finally, the three data sources gave good model performances for the retrieval of fAPAR and Fcover, with the best performing model being the Synergy model (fAPAR: R-2: 0.99; RMSE: 0.02 and FCover: R-2: 0.98; RMSE: 0.04). The ability of the models to process real data was subsequently demonstrated by applying the OLCI models to S3 surface reflectance products acquired over Western Europe and Argentina. Obtained maps showed consistent patterns and variable ranges, and comparison against corresponding Sentinel-2 products (coarsened to a 300 m spatial resolution) led to reasonable matches (R-2: 0.5-0.7). Altogether, given the availability of the multiple data sources, the FLEX tandem mission will foster unique opportunities to quantify essential vegetation properties, and hence facilitate the interpretation of the measured fluorescence levels.

TI  - Evaluating cultivated land stability during the growing season based on precipitation in the Horqin Sandy Land, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a fundamental resource for human beings, cultivated land contributes significantly to the sustainable development of society. Investigating cultivated land stability in semiarid areas with a fragile ecology is essential for stabilizing agricultural production and preserving environmental security. The objective of this study was to evaluate cultivated land stability by combining the growth root normalized difference vegetation index (GRNDVI) and precipitation during the crop growing season from 2015 to 2019 in the Horqin Zuoyihou Banner. The productivity of cultivated land was categorized into five levels by the relative criterion, and the minimum productivity level was chosen to represent the stability level. The results showed that a variation in precipitation was evident across both years and crop growing seasons; approximately 66.78% of the cultivated land was classified as moderately stable, 6.55% was classified as highly stable, 22.14% was classified as marginally stable, 0.91% was classified as extremely stable, and 3.62% was classified as unstable. Extremely and highly stable cultivated lands were dominant at the eastern and southern ends of the region, and marginal and unstable cultivated lands were principally present in the west and north while moderately stable land was distributed extensively. Cultivated land stability was affected substantially by water availability and topography, indicating that cultivated land with high levels of stability was distributed more in areas with abundant water and flat terrain. Marginally stable and unstable cultivated lands should be returned to their previous vegetation covers, with priority given to planting appropriate sandy plants to restore ecological integrity. Such evaluation outcomes are meaningful for optimizing the distribution of cultivated land and facilitating the sustainable utilization of land resources.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of floodplain topography from space: A case study in the Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrain elevation is essential for land management, navigation, and earth science applications. Remote sensing advancements have led to an increase in the availability of a range of digital elevation models with global to quasi-global land coverage. However, the generation of these models in water bodies requires specialized approaches, such as the delimitation of the shorelines (isobaths) of lakes over time. Therefore, the processing costs are high in complex areas with many lakes. Currently, there is no systematic topographic mapping of lakes and channels in large and complex floodplains using remote sensing data. We present here the first high-resolution topographic mapping (30 m) of the non-forested portion of the middle-lower Amazon floodplain using a new method based on in-situ Amazon river water levels and a flood-frequency map derived from the Landsat Global Surface Water Dataset. Validation using locally derived bathymetry showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.89 m for floodplain elevation and a good representation of spatial patterns with Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.77. Our approach for improving topographic representation in open water areas is an alternative to SRTM3 DEM or MERIT DEM, which represents these areas as a flat surface. We also generated the Amazon River bathymetry using nautical charts from the Brazilian Navy (average RMSE of 7.5 m and bias of 5 m), and floodplain depths maps corresponding to the highand low-water periods of the river flood wave. The results show that the storage volume in the open-water floodplain varies 104.3 km3 on average each year (from 11.9 km3 in low-water to 116.2 km3 in high-water). The method can be applied to any temporarily flooded area to provide the often missing underwater digital topographic data required for hydrological, ecological, and geomorphological studies. The data set developed in this study can be found at https://doi.org/10.17632/ vn599y9szb.1.

TI  - On the impact of C-band in place of L-band radar for SMAP downscaling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on 31st January 2015, with the aim of providing global soil moisture maps at 9 km spatial resolution by combining L-band radar and radiometer observations. However, after the SMAP radar became inoperable, NASA decided to utilize the Sentinel 1A/1B C-band SAR data in its place. The new version of baseline brightness temperature (Tb) downscaling algorithm for SMAP is tested using L-band airborne data to evaluate the cap-abilities of the C-band Sentinel-1A SAR relative to L-band radar data in downscaling the SMAP Tb for achieving high resolution brightness temperature. In this study, the downscaling algorithm used L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma) collected from the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx5) in south-eastern Australia to downscale 36 km L-band SMAP radiometer Tb pixels to 3 km and 9 km. The downscaling results were then compared with the published results using Sentinel-1A C-band backscatter, and evaluated against airborne 1 km resolution L-band passive microwave brightness temperature collected from SMAPEx-5. The results show that for vertical polarization the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of downscaled Tb when compared with reference airborne Tb across 4 days at 9 km resolution were 4.9 K for L band and 6.0 K for C-band, and increased to 9.3 K for L-band and 9.6 K for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Moreover, the correlation coefficient (R) of downscaled and reference Tb across the 4 days was 0.92 for L-band and 0.88 for C-band at 9 km, decreasing to 0.75 for L-band and 0.72 for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Accordingly, the RMSE increased and the correlation coefficient decreased when using C-band radar data in place of that at L-band. However, overall there is expected to be only a slight decrease in performance of the downscaling algorithm by using the Sentinel 1A data in place of the SMAP radar.

AB  - This study is dedicated to the wind waves parameters distribution on the Black Sea with a focus on coastal areas. Wind waves were simulated using the SWAN model forced by the NCEP CFSR and NCEP CFSv2 reanalyses for the period 1979-2016. An unstructured computational grid with resolution varying between 15 km and 200 m was applied. Modelling results were validated against in situ and remote sensing data. For the entire sea, distributions of total and seasonal maxima of wave parameters are analyzed. Maximal significant wave heights exceed 8.5 m and are found in the southwestern areas of the sea. Maximal wave lengths (over 160 m) and periods (over 10.5 s) are located in the eastern part of the sea. Total and seasonal time series extracted for 12 locations along the coasts of the Black Sea were studied. Maximal values of significant wave heights (over 6 m) correspond to areas along the northeastern and southwestern coasts of the Black Sea and the southern coast of the Crimean Peninsula. Maximal values of wave lengths and wave periods (over 140 m and 10 s) are located along the northeastern and southern coasts of the Black sea.

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for forest stand species mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery and environmental data in the Polish Carpathians
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about forest stand species distribution is essential for biodiversity modelling, forest disturbances, fire hazard and drought monitoring, biomass and carbon estimation, detection of non-native and invasive species, as well as for planning forest management strategies. High temporal and spectral resolution remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 mission enables the derivation of accurate and timely maps of tree species in forests in a cost-efficient way. However, there is still a lack of studies regarding forest stand species mapping for large areas like the Polish Carpathian Mountains (approx. 20,000 km(2)). In this study, we aimed to develop a workflow to obtain forest stand species maps with machine learning algorithms applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data at regional scale. Using variable importance techniques Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) we assessed three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM; mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies), i.e. 114 variables in total. Following a variable importance assessment, we produced maps of eleven tree species with the use of three Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) on nine different variable subsets, i.e. in total 27 classifications. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers the highest overall accuracy exceeded 85% for SVM classification of all variables (86.9%), and 64 variables (85.6%). Including elevation information improved the accuracies. From the best five classifications we created a final ensemble map (overall accuracy of 86.6%) and a precision map based on the Simpson Index, which indicates where the five models agree. This ensemble approach allowed us to determine that the lowest precision occurred in foothills and basins with lower forest cover, in the areas with lack of good quality imagery, and at the borders of stands with homogenous species composition. On the other hand, the highest precision occurred in regions with homogenous stands with high forest and canopy cover. The study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data in mapping forest stand species in large mountainous areas with high accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of the ensemble approach, which enables to assess the classification precision.

AB  - Background. Prevention and control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections remain challenging. In-depth surveillance integrating patient and isolate data can provide evidence to better inform infection control and public health practice.Methods. We analyzed MRSA cases diagnosed in 2010 (n = 212) and 2016 (n = 214) by hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Caselevel clinical and demographic data were integrated with isolate characteristics, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR), classic genotyping, and whole-genome sequencing results.Results. Community-associated MRSA (epidemiologically defined) increased significantly from 23.6% in 2010 to 43.0% in 2016 (P <.001). The MRSA population structure changed over time, with a 1.5x increase in clonal complex (CC)8 strains and a concomitant decrease in CC5. The clonal shift was reflected in AMR patterns, with a decrease in erythromycin (86.7% to 78.4%, P =.036) and clindamycin resistance (84.3% to 47.9%, P <.001) and a >2-fold increase in fusidic acid resistance (9.0% to 22.5%, P <.001). Isolates within both CC5 and CC8 were relatively genetically diverse. We identified 6 small genomic clusters-3 potentially related to transmission in healthcare settings.Conclusions. Community-associated MRSA is increasing among hospitalized individuals in Ontario. Clonal shifting from CC5 to CC8 has impacted AMR. We identified a relatively high genetic diversity and limited genomic clustering within these dominant CCs.

TI  - Description of non-polio enteroviruses identified in two national surveillance programmes in South Africa
T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Human enteroviruses (EV) consist of 106 serotypes and four species: EV-A, EV-B, EV-C and EV-D. Entemviruses cause clinical symptoms varying from severe to mild. Knowledge of EV burden in South Africa is limited, and as non-polio EV are important causes of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and meningitis, information on the circulating serotypes is vital.Methods: Between 2010 and 2012, a total of 832 stool and viral isolate specimens were obtained from two national surveillance programmes at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases: the Rotavirus Sentinel Surveillance Programme (RSSP) and the AFI' surveillance programme. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were performed to detect and serotype EV.Results: Non-polio EV were detected in 446 specimens, of which 308 were sequenced. Stool specimens yielded a greater variety of serotypes than viral cultures. EV-B viruses were predominant (58.44%), whilst EV-C viruses were detected in 31% of the specimens tested. South African prevalence for these viruses was higher than other countries, such as France with less than 2%, and Spain and the United States with less than 10%. The most common serotype detected was Enterovirus 99 (EV-C, 8.63%), which has not been reported in other regions.Conclusion: Direct sequencing from stool specimens yields a broader, more comprehensive description of EV infections compared to sequencing from viral cultures. Disease-associated serotypes were detected, but only in small numbers. This study provides a baseline for EV strain circulation; however, surveillance needs to be expanded to improve EV knowledge in South Africa.

TI  - Quantifying the impact of aerosol scattering on the retrieval of methane from airborne remote sensing measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a greenhouse gas with strong global warming potential, atmospheric methane (CH4) emissions have attracted a great deal of attention. Although remote sensing measurements can provide information about CH4 sources and emissions, accurate retrieval is challenging due to the influence of atmospheric aerosol scattering. In this study, imaging spectroscopic measurements from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) in the shortwave infrared are used to compare two retrieval techniques - the traditional matched filter (MF) method and the optimal estimation (OE) method, which is a popular approach for trace gas retrievals. Using a numerically efficient radiative transfer model with an exact single-scattering component and a two-stream multiple-scattering component, we also simulate AVIRIS-NG measurements for different scenarios and quantify the impact of aerosol scattering in the two retrieval schemes by including aerosols in the simulations but not in the retrievals. The presence of aerosols causes an underestimation of CH4 in both the MF and OE retrievals; the biases increase with increasing surface albedo and aerosol optical depth (AOD). Aerosol types with high single-scattering albedo and low asymmetry parameter (such as water-soluble aerosols) induce large biases in the retrieval. When scattering effects are neglected, the MF method exhibits lower fractional retrieval bias compared to the OE method at high CH4 concentrations (2-5 times typical background values) and is suitable for detecting strong CH4 emissions. For an AOD value of 0.3, the fractional biases of the MF retrievals are between 1.3% and 4.5%, while the cor-responding values for OE retrievals are in the 2.8%-5.6% range. On the other hand, the OE method is an optimal technique for diffuse sources (< 1.5 times typical background values), showing up to 5 times smaller fractional retrieval bias (8.6 %) than the MF method (42.6 %) for the same AOD scenario. However, when aerosol scattering is significant, the OE method is superior since it provides a means to reduce biases by simultaneously retrieving AOD, surface albedo, and CH4. The results indicate that, while the MF method is good for plume detection, the OE method should be employed to quantify CH4 concentrations, especially in the presence of aerosol scattering.

TI  - High latitude sea surface temperatures derived from MODIS infrared measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region (north of 60 degrees N) relative to elsewhere. By analyzing climate model simulations, it has been found that the largest factor in Arctic Amplification comes from enhanced temperature feedbacks, caused by the different vertical atmospheric warming profiles and a larger temperature change for longwave emission per unit of warming at highcompared to low-latitudes. Radiometers on polar-orbiting satellites offer the best mechanism to derive sea surface temperature (SST) in the Arctic, but given that the retrieval algorithms in the infrared (IR) are designed to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere, mainly water vapor (WV), IR satellite-derived SSTs have larger inaccuracies at high latitudes because the atmosphere can be very dry and cold. So, the motivation of this study is to improve the algorithms to obtain more accurate SSTs which can be used to research the feedback mechanisms. To undertake the study, the 5-year matchup database (MUDB) for MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on Aqua has been analyzed to characterize the differences between collocated and simultaneous satellite retrieved skin SSTs (SSTskin) using the R2014 dataset and in situ buoy temperatures, and to identify the main causes of the discrepancies. According to the radiative transfer simulations, the sea surface emissivity is proven to be significant in satellite SSTskin retrievals at high latitudes due to the low atmospheric WV content, especially during winter. An Emissivity-introduced Brightness Temperature Difference (EBT) is developed to correct this emissivity effect in the algorithm. Furthermore, the reference temperature as a weighting factor for differences in brightness temperature (BT) measured in MODIS bands 31 and 32 has also been adjusted. The satellite SSTskin mean bias and standard deviation are reduced by 0.35 K and 0.085 K after the corrections. The approaches presented in this paper are capable to make more appropriate atmospheric corrections for MODIS SSTskin retrieval algorithm, leading to regional optimization of the SST retrievals. We report on the progress towards improving the satellite-derived SSTskin with the expectation that the near two-decadal time series of MODIS SSTskin fields will contribute to studying climate change in the Arctic.

TI  - Mapping crops within the growing season across the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate knowledge about the geospatial distribution of crops at regional to continental scales is crucial for forecasting crop production and estimating crop water use. The United States (US) is one of the leading food-producing countries, but lacks a nationwide high resolution crop-specific land cover map available publicly during the current growing season. The goal of this study was to map crops across the Continental US (CONUS) before the harvest, and to estimate the earliest date of classification by which crops can be mapped with sufficient accuracy (90% of full-season accuracy). The study employed a scalable cluster-then-label model that was trained on multiple years of MODIS NDVI using ground truth data in the form of US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) products. The first step in the crop classification was to perform Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MSTC) of annual MODIS-derived NDVI trajectories to create phenologically similar regions, or phenoregions. The second step was to assign crop labels to phenoregions based on spatial concordance between phenoregions and crop classes from CDL using Mapcurves. Assigning crop labels to phenoregions was performed within ecoregions to reduce classification errors due to spatial variability in phenology caused by variations in climate, agricultural practices, and growing conditions. The crop classifier was trained and validated on the years 2008-2014, then tested independently on 2015-2018. Ecoregion-level crop classification performed better than state-level and CONUS-level classification. Pixel-wise accuracy of classification for eight major crops by area was around 70% across the major corn-, soybeansand winter wheatproducing areas, whereas regions characterized by high crop diversity had slightly lower accuracy. Classification accuracy for dominant crops like corn, soybeans, winter wheat, fallow/idle cropland and other hay/non alfalfa improved with time as they grew, reaching 90% of year-end accuracy by the end of August over each of the four unseen years in the test period. For corn and soybeans, the earliest dates of classification were found to be much earlier in the central regions of the Corn Belt (parts of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana) than in peripheral areas. The ability to map growing crops may permit near real-time monitoring of the health status and vigor of agricultural crops nationally.

TI  - Aerosol pattern changes over the dead sea from west to east - Using high-resolution satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The area of the Dead Sea, a terminal lake on the border between Israel and Jordan, has gone through extensive environmental changes in recent decades, stemming from several processes including extreme evaporation and land degradation. Our study explored the distribution and the long-term high-resolution climatology of the Dead Sea aerosols, using satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements. We used the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm that provides AOD measurements at a 1 km resolution. MAIAC retrievals for the entire study period (2000-2016) have shown a very good agreement (r = 0.8) with the nearby AERONET station. For the first time, the AOD temporal distribution and its variability, on both Dead Sea coasts, were calculated on a monthly/seasonal basis. Three main aerosol pollution patterns (i.e. high-levels of AOD) emerged as follows: western focalized (75 and 59% of the months examined for Aqua and Terra, respectively), eastern focalized (14 and 24%), and similar levels of pollution on both coasts (11 and 17%, respectively). Using the Normalized AOD Difference (NAODD) metric, we studied how the AOD spatial patterns changed and when. Following the negative trends in most of the months, our analysis has demonstrated a shift towards unexplained increasing pollution levels over the Jordanian eastern side. For March-April, this shift had already occurred, and the potential reasons including changes in synoptic regimes are discussed. Local and global implications are of much regional interest because of the Dead Sea deterioration and the need for urgent environmental policy changes.

TI  - Encapsulation of Highly Volatile Fragrances in Y Zeolites for Sustained Release: Experimental and Theoretical Studies
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Volatility is an inherent fragrance attribute and typically implies a reduced perception over time. One possibility to elongate odor perception is utilizing controlled fragrance-delivery systems. Herein, the Y type of faujasite with different extra-framework cations (abbreviated as ZY, where Z represents Na+, Ca2+, or La3+) was examined as potential carriers for fragrance entrapment and delivery. D-Limonene (Lim) and linalool (Lol) as model fragrances were loaded in the pore space of Y zeolites, yielding composites FG@ZY (FG = Lim, Lol). It was found that the fragrance release profiles correlate highly with the cationic species located in the nonframework. The retention of fragrances in matrices increases in the order NaY < CaY < LaY for either limonene or linalool. Interestingly, the release rate of limonene was significantly slower than that of linalool when encapsulated in the same zeolite, although neat limonene has a much higher saturated vapor pressure than linalool. For instance, the total fraction of aroma released from Lim@LaY over 30 days was about 10%, while the value was similar to 20% for Lol@LaY. Based on the density functional theory calculations, the above results could be well rationalized by the electrostatic attraction and shape selectivity of microporous matrices to the dopant molecules.

TI  - Regional-scale hydrological monitoring of wetlands with Sentinel-1 InSAR observations: Case study of the South Florida Everglades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland is a very fragile ecosystem that provides important services to a large variety of flora and fauna species, as well as for humans. As wetland depends on water availability, protecting this important ecosystem requires careful hydrological monitoring. The Sentinel-1 mission, featuring a wide swath coverage, high temporal observations and open data policy, provides unprecedented opportunity for high spatiotemporal resolution water level change mapping over regional-wide wetland areas. In this study, we assess Sentinel-1 InSAR observations for routine water level change measurements over the entire south Florida Everglades wetlands. The study utilizes 91 Sentinel-1 images acquired over a three-year period (Sep 2016 to Nov 2019) and generates routine 12-days Interferograms and correspondingly 30 m spatial resolution water level change maps over the entire Everglades. The high spatial resolution interferograms detect hydrological signals induced by both naturaland human-induced flow, including tides, gate operations, and canal overflow; all these cannot be detected by terrestrial measurements. The large number of both InSAR and ground-based gauge observations allow us to quantify the overall accuracy of the Sentinel-1 InSAR measurements, which is 3.9 cm for the entire wetland area, but better for smaller hydrological units within the Everglades. Our study reveals that the tropospheric delay for individual interferograms can be very large, as much as 30 cm (similar to 10 fringes). When applying tropospheric corrections to all three years of Sentinel-1 InSAR observations, the overall accuracy level improved by 13% to 3.4 cm. Although our study is focused on the Everglades, its implications in term of the suitability of Sentinel-1 observations for space-based hydrological monitoring of wetlands and the derived accuracy level are applicable to other wetlands with similar vegetation types, located all over the world.

TI  - Hairpin-Structured Magnetic SERS Sensor for Tetracycline Resistance Gene <i>tetA</i> Detection
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become emerging environmental contaminants, and the effective on-site detection of ARGs is urgently needed. Herein, we constructed a hairpin-structured magnetic sensor for the analysis of a widespread ARG, tetA, using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The SERS sensor was assembled by immobilizing core-satellite structured Fe3O4@SiO2-Au with single-stranded DNA in a folded hairpin structure. The SERS sensor exhibited good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of laboratory-synthesized tetA ssDNA fragments. In addition, this SERS strategy is the first of its kind to be employed for monitoring environmental samples in the field, with a limit of detection reaching as low as 25 copies mu L-1. Univariate and multivariate linear regression equations verify the practicability of the SERS sensor for quantitative tetA determination, showing the prospect for an amplification-free alternative platform for sensitive and reliable on-site detection of ARGs in the environment.

TI  - Seasonal evolution of L-band SAR backscatter over landfast Arctic sea ice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We construct and present the first baseline, time series evolution of L-band SAR microwave backscatter (sigma 0HH) for landfast Arctic first-year (FYI) and multi-year (MYI) sea ice from ALOS PALSAR. We compare the winter to freeze-up seasonal L-band sigma 0HH signatures with C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR imagery and Ku-band QuikSCAT scatterometer data. We also explored the utility of L-band sigma 0HH to detect FYI and MYI melt onset dates. For both ice types, L-band exhibited a similar sigma 0HH evolution to Cand Ku-bands. A rise in L-band sigma 0HH was observed from winter to melt onset, however, with a lower magnitude attributed to the larger penetration of L-band microwaves through the snow-covered sea ice medium. Over FYI, L-band sigma(0)(HH) exhibited the most robust response and greater diversity in melt onset signature, compared to Cand Ku-bands. Over MYI, L-band sigma(0)(HH) declined during the winter to melt onset transition contrasting the Cand Ku-band evolution of sigma(0)(HH) during melt onset. Although, a distinct L-band sigma(0)(HH) response was not found during pond onset, a very strong sigma(0)(HH) response was found during sea ice break-up, which could operationally be utilized to identify sea ice break-up timing. During freeze-up, L-band sigma(0)(HH) showed greater diversity compared to Cand Ku-bands. Our study also found that, L-band detected melt onset dates were up to 6 days later than Cand Ku-band detected dates, for both ice types. The melt response was the strongest at L-band for FYI, where C-band detected a robust melt onset date for MYI. Therefore, for operational sea ice monitoring, L-band suits better for FYI, whereas C-band is still a better choice for MYI. In the warming Arctic, where FYI has become the dominant ice type, L-band demonstrates promise to be the optimal choice for sea ice operational monitoring with high spatiotemporal data acquisition from existing, upcoming and proposed L-band SAR missions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The research assessed land use/cover changes and their socio-economic impacts on local resident farmers in ward 32 of Mazowe District. A mixed method research design that combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches was adopted. Questionnaires, interviews and observations were employed to gather data from the field. GIS and Remote sensing techniques were used for land use/cover change detection and calculations. Data collected from the field was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 and Microsoft excel. Arc map 10.5 was used to analyze Remote sensing data. Four major land use/covers namely forest, grassland, water and cultivated were identified as baseline land covers of Mazowe ward 32 in 2000. The research revealed that there has been significant loss in forest, grassland and wetland/water cover and gain in cultivated and bare land cover between 2000 and 2018 in ward 32 of Mazowe District. Scarcity of high energy tree species, fruit trees, construction poles and extinction of wild animals are some of the observed impacts of forest cover loss. The study recommends that Mazowe EMA, RDC and Forestry Commission should cooperate in monitoring natural resources in Mazowe District to ensure sustainable utilization.

TI  - Estimating wildfire fuel consumption with multitemporal airborne laser scanning data and demonstrating linkage with MODIS-derived fire radiative energy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing preand post-fire fuels remains a key challenge for estimating biomass consumption and carbon emissions from wildfires. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have demonstrated effectiveness for estimating canopy, and to a lesser degree, surface fuel components at fine-scale (i.e., 30 m) across landscapes. Using pre -and post-fire ALS data and corresponding field data, this study estimated consumption of canopy fuel (Delta CF), understory fuel (Delta UF), total fuel (Delta TF), and canopy bulk density (Delta CBD) for the 2012 Pole Creek fire in Oregon, USA (10,760 ha), and portions of the 2011 Las Conchas fire in New Mexico, USA (4,934 ha). Additionally, the feasibility of predicting fuel consumption was tested using separate preand post-fire models (PrePost), models combining all preand post-fire data (Pooled), and models using all data from both fires (Global). Estimates of Delta TF were then compared to fire radiative energy (FRE, units: MJ) derived from Fire Radiative Power (FRP, units: MW) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard NASA Terra and Aqua satellites to mechanistically derive a biomass combustion coefficient (BCC, units: kg MJ(-1)). The PrePost and Pooled approaches yielded similar results at Las Conchas, but at Pole Creek insufficient pre-fire field data resulted in erroneous fuel consumption estimates outside the fire perimeter using the PrePost models. These results demonstrated that pre-fire field data were less important for these models than having field data which represent the full range of fuel conditions likely to exist across the landscape. Estimated total biomass consumed for the PrePost, Pooled, and Global models were 226 Gg, 224 Gg, and 224 Gg at Las Conchas, and 581 Gg, 713 Gg, and 552 Gg at Pole Creek. Comparisons between estimated Delta TF and FRE yielded an average BCC for both fires of 0.367 (s.d. +/- 0.049) kg MJ(-1) based on pixels with at least five MODIS observations. Both higher MODIS observations per pixel and accounting for canopy occlusion of FRE improved the relationship between Delta TF and MODIS-FRE. This study suggested a practical modelling approach for future efforts using only post-fire field observations and quantified a landscape-scale relationship between MODIS-derived FRE and fine-scale fuel consumption consistent with prior experiments.

TI  - Rapid drought-induced land subsidence and its impact on the California aqueduct
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Valley in California is characterized by a semi-arid climate prone to droughts, a variable surface water supply, and immense agricultural areas dependent on groundwater irrigation. The groundwater is stored in a complex aquifer system composed of alternating layers of coarse sediments and fine-grained sediments acting as confining materials. Groundwater fluctuations are coupled with both the elastic and inelastic land surface deformation historically observed in the Central Valley. Surface deformation poses a hazard to the California Aqueduct, which supports Central Valley agriculture and large urban populations in Southern California. The risk of reduced aqueduct efficacy and expensive repairs compels water resource managers to carefully monitor land deformation in the Valley.A persistent drought in the region began in 2012, intensified in 2014, and was abruptly alleviated by a wet period from Dec-2016 to Feb-2018. NASA's UAVSAR L-band synthetic aperture radar acquired 31 high resolution radar images between May-2013 and Nov-2018. The interferometric phase difference between acquisitions is used to develop a time series of vertical displacement and identify and track a rapidly forming subsidence feature adjacent to the California Aqueduct. The surface area of the feature that subsided 10 cm or more by the end of the time series reaches 4452 ha and a 10.5+ km segment of the aqueduct. This study also incorporates ex-tensometer measurements, precise leveling surveys, Sentinel-1A displacement, concurrent water elevation data, well construction reports, nearby extensometer measurements, aquifer material characterization, and environmental conditions. Spatiotemporal data availability limits the appropriateness of calculations and models able to be performed for different sites along the aqueduct. We aim to offer insight into heterogeneous subsurface properties and mechanics, estimate the permanent loss of aquifer storage volume, and identify additional data that would aid water management.

TI  - Water level monitoring using classification techniques on Landsat-8 data at Sangam region, Prayagraj, India
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, Landsat-8 data have been used for water identification at the Sangam region, the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. Since the water of both the rivers varies in characteristics, it is necessary to explore the most appropriate band of Landsat-8 imagery for the identification of water bodies. Accordingly, a two folded study has been performed, viz., the selection of a suitable band to identify water bodies and to monitor the water level at the Sangam region from 2013 to 2018. It is observed in the study that band-7 is the most suitable band for water identification, which is used for the classification and monitoring of water. The classification results are highly significant as the overall accuracy ranges between 95.49 and 100%. The monitoring of water level is done based on classification results for mapping the area of water in real units which can be useful for the prediction of flood situations. The achievement of the present study is the mapping of water area in real units with the help of image pixels which is one of the prominent applications of image processing in earth sciences.

TI  - SMART-SDB: Sample-specific multiple band ratio technique for satellite- derived bathymetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectrally-based retrieval of bathymetry is challenging in inland/coastal waters due to variations in factors other than water depth across a water body, including bottom type, optically significant constituents, water surface roughness, and others. Optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) is the most widely used method to deal with these confounding effects to retrieve water depth. OBRA identifies the pair of bands that provides the highest accuracy among all possible pairs when using a log-transformed band ratio model. However, this approach fits a single ratio model to all training samples without fully accounting for the heterogeneity of the aforementioned complicating factors. To deal with this problem, we introduce a novel method called Sample-specific Multiple bAnd Ratio Technique for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SMART-SDB). The proposed SMART-SDB technique partitions the feature space of the spectral data and creates for every subspace a different band ratio model that performs better than the other models within that subspace. Bathymetry is then predicted based on the closest model/s in the feature space by performing a sample-specific k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) analysis. The depth estimates provided by the neighboring models are averaged with weights proportional to their inverse distance in the feature space. The proposed method can be used in both inland and coastal waters. Here, we thoroughly examine its effectiveness in the challenging and heterogenous environments of fluvial systems using a wide range of spectral data including radiative transfer simulations, an airborne hyperspectral image of the Snake River (USA), and a WorldView-3 satellite image of the Sarca River (Italy). The results of this study indicate a significant improvement in depth retrieval for estimations based on the SMART-SDB method relative to standard OBRA, either when a single model or multiple models are employed.

TI  - Monitoring of wheat crops using the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence derived from Sentinel-1 in semi-arid areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar data at C-band has shown great potential for the monitoring of soil and canopy hydric conditions of wheat crops. In this study, the C-band Sentinel-1 time series including the backscattering coefficients u(0) at VV and VH polarization, the polarization ratio (PR) and the interferometric coherence p are first analyzed with the support of experimental data gathered on three plots of irrigated winter wheat located in the Haouz plain in the center of Morocco covering five growing seasons. The results showed that p and PR are tightly related to the canopy development. p is also sensitive to soil preparation. By contrast, u(0) was found to be widely linked to changes in surface soil moisture (SSM) during the first growth stages when Leaf Area Index remains moderate (< 1.5 m(2)/m(2)). In addition, drastic changes in the crop geometry associated to heading had a strong impact on the C-band u(0), in particular for VH polarization. The coupled water cloud and Oh models (WCM) were then calibrated and validated on the study sites. The comparison between the predicted and observed u0 yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 1.50 dB to 2.02 dB for VV and between 1.74 dB to 2.52 dB for VH with significant differences occurring in the second part of the season after heading. Finally, new approaches based on the inversion of the WCM for SSM retrieval over wheat fields were proposed using Sentinel-1 radar data only. To this objective, the dry above-ground biomass (AGB) and the vegetation water content (VWC) were retrieved from the interferometric coherence and the PR. The relationships were then used as the vegetation descriptor in the WCM. The best retrieval results were obtained using the relationship between pVV and the AGB (R and RMSE of 0.82, 0.05 m3/m3 respectively and no bias). The new retrieval approaches were then applied to a large database covering a rainfed field in Morocco and 18 plots of rainfed and irrigated wheat of the Kairouan plain (Tunisia) and compared to other classical techniques of SSM retrieval including simple linear relationships between SSM and u0. The method based on the WCM and the pVV-AGB relationships also provided with slightly better results than the others on the validation database (r = 0.75, RMSE = 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and bias = 0.01 m(3)/m(3) over the 18 plots of Tunisia) but the simple linear relationships performed also reasonably well (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.07, bias = -0.01 in Tunisia for instance). This study opens perspectives for high resolution soil moisture mapping from Sentinel-1 data over south Mediterranean wheat crops and in fine, for irrigation scheduling and retrieval through the assimilation of these new products in an evapotranspiration model.

TI  - GNSS assessment of sentinel-3A ECMWF tropospheric delays over inland waters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over land and inland waters satellite radar altimetry is being used in numerous applications including polar mass change, ice topography, river and lake heights and soil moisture. To achieve high accuracy altimetric range measurements, geophysical corrections are applied including the Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) which varies spatially, temporally and with altitude. Over oceans, the wet tropospheric component of the ZTD is usually derived from onboard radiometers. However, over land, the radiometer return is saturated and the zenith wet and dry tropospheric delays are derived separately as output of a meteorological model such as that processed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations located near Sentinel-3A ground tracks and correcting for any height difference the ECMWF model is compared to the ZTD estimated from GNSS data, quantifying the likely error for inland water and land applications. We found that, globally, there is a median bias of -3 mm between the ECMWF model and GNSS values with median absolute deviation (MAD) of 7.3 mm but with clear spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, ZTD differences are greatest within the tropics with MAD values exceeding 11 mm, over double that of points within the Arctic Circle (<5 mm). Temporally, the ECMWF model differs from GNSS values more during summer months. Northern Hemisphere summer (June-August) has an approximately 60% larger MAD than December-February with the summer MAD approximately 20% smaller in the Southern Hemisphere. Assessment of the tropospheric error is quantified for the largest river catchments for application to inland water heights. The close proximity of altimetric data, GNSS receiver and inland water gauges on the Amazon and Orange rivers and Lake Ontario confirms the preference for GNSS derived ZTD. Overall, the altimetric community can be reassured that the tropospheric contribution to the error budget for inland water applications is less generally than 20 mm at 1 sigma in all major catchments.

TI  - Improving precision of high-rate altimeter sea level anomalies by removing the sea state bias and intra-1-Hz covariant error
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assessed the precision of 20-Hz sea level anomaly (SLA) estimates with different sea state bias (SSB) corrections from reprocessed Jason-1/2/3 and Sentinel-3A data over the period of 2002-2019 within 100 km from the entire Australian coast. The altimeter waveforms were retracked by the modified Brown-peaky (MBP) retracker for Jason missions and by the SAMOSA+ retracker for Sentinel-3A. We recalculated the 20-Hz and composite SSB corrections using a regional parametric model from 20-Hz retracked estimates of the SLA, significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed. The composite SSB correction, which was recomputed after removing the retracker-dependant correlated error in 20-Hz SLA, is found to achieve better performance than other SSB corrections in the study area. Applying the 20-Hz and composite SSB corrections has reduced similar to 10% and similar to 13% of noise, respectively, in the MBP-retracked 20-Hz Jason SLA estimates, while only similar to 2% of noise reduction is shown by applying the 1-Hz standard SSB correction. It is also found that the improvement of retracked Sentinel-3A SLA estimates by SSB corrections is very low (similar to 3%), indicating a dedicated SSB correction model should be developed for the SAR mode altimeter.As a result, the precision of composite SSB-corrected SLA estimates for all Jason missions can be retained at the level of 5.1 +/- 1.1 cm until 3 km from the Australian coast, which is slightly lower than that of Sentinel-3A (4.2 +/- 0.9 cm). The degradation within 3 km from the coast mainly corresponds to the along-track direction for MBP-retracked Jason SLA estimates, and the across-track direction for SAMOSA+ retracked Sentinel-3A SLA estimates, respectively.

TI  - A novel approach to quantify soil salinity by simulating the dielectric loss of SAR in three-dimensional density space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the crucial factors which undermines agricultural production in the semi-arid region. The study was attempted for the Vellore district, one of the worst-hit semi-regions of Tamil Nadu by salinization. The Sentinel-1 data product of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) was instrumental in the development of the model. In the present research, a semi-empirical dielectric model was proposed, and its potential in demonstrating the rate of soil salinity was validated with in-situ measurements under semi-saturated conditions (soil moisture < 50%). The dielectric behavior of saline and non-saline soil was simulated by investigating the paradigm of the parameters, namely the backscattering coefficient of VV polarization, soil texture, and in-situ dielectric constant in the three-dimensional density space. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant was retrieved by simulating the dielectric loss from the partition observed between the dielectric constant of saline and non-saline soils in the third dimension. The resultant product of the proposed model has achieved the best fit (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 1.14, Bias = -0.65) with the in-situ EC measures of sandy soil compared to other categories of soil due to the presence of soluble salts in the free water. The proposed simulation demonstrated that the dielectric behavior of saline affected soil is dependent on soil textural characteristics under the semi-saturated condition. The simulation has shown the highest prediction performance (R-2 > 0.7) in quantifying the soil EC covered with short crops with a mean height of 0.5 m. This statistical significance reveals the feasibility of the C-band SAR data to quantify the rate of salinity over bare and vegetated soil.

TI  - Copula-based probabilistic spectral algorithms for high-frequent streamflow estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent increase in population growth and urbanisation demands for real-time riverine water management to fulfil the daily-scale domestic and ecological water needs, necessitating for high-frequent streamflow estimation at any river section. Although there are several conventional methods available in the literature, using these methods to obtain streamflow information at finer spatiotemporal resolutions is not feasible. Moreover, streamflow estimation using single or multi-satellite remote sensing approaches is still in the experimental stage. As advancement in the existing approaches, this study advocates two novel models, namely CMOD and CFUS, which use the Frank copula-based single MODIS satellite data and copula-based multi-satellite MODIS-Landsat fusion data, respectively. These developed models fit a box-centre matrix to the pixel ratios of water (within the river at the gauging station) and land (in the riparian zone) in the near-infrared spectrum. Two other approaches using the stand-alone MODIS data (MOD model) and enhanced spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS-Landsat datasets (FUS model) are also developed to inter-compare with the CMOD and CFUS models for reproducing the daily time series of streamflow at three gauging stations on the Brahmani River in eastern India. The calibration and validation results reveal that the 30 m resolution CFUS model is the best approach for daily-scale streamflow estimation with sufficient accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC) of 0.92 followed by the CMOD (NSC = 0.80), FUS (NSC = 0.78), and MOD (NSC = 0.66) models. Hence, the CFUS model can be used as a potential tool for the next-generation hydrometry in semi-gauged river basins for riverine water resources assessment and inter-state water-sharing conflict resolution.

TI  - Dynamic partitioning of tropical Indian Ocean surface waters using ocean colour data - management and modelling applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, partitioning of the surface ocean into ecologically-meaningful spatial domains has been approached using a range of data types, with the aim of improving our understanding of open ocean processes, supporting marine management decisions and constraining coupled ocean-biogeochemical models. The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, alpha = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north-south gradient (PERMANOVA, alpha = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO(2) with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources - from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025%a(-1) for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, alpha = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification. The optical partitioning scheme described here can be applied in Google Earth Engine to support management decisions at daily or monthly scales, and potential applications are discussed.

TI  - Socioeconomic restrictions slowdown COVID-19 far more effectively than favorable weather-evidence from the satellite
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We model the impact of restricting socioeconomic activities (SA) on the transmission of COVID-19 globally. Countries initiate public health measures to slow virus transmission, ranging from stringent quarantines including city lockdown to simpler social distancing recommendations. We use satellite readings of NO2, a pollutant emitted from socioeconomic activities, as a proxy for the level of social-economic restrictions, and discuss the implications under the influences of weather. We found that restricting SA has a leading contribution to lowering the reproductive number of COVID-19 by 18.3% +/- 3.5%, while air temperature, the highest contributor among all weather-related variables only contributes 8.0% +/- 2.6%. The reduction effects by restricting SA becomes more pronounced (23% +/- 3.0%) when we limited the data to China and developed countries where the indoor climate is mostly controlled. We computed the spared infectees by restricting SA until mid-April. Among all polities, China spared 40,964 (95% CI 31,463-51,470) infectees with 37,727 (95% CI, 28,925-47,488) in the Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Europe spared 174,494 (95% CI 139,202-210,841) infectees, and the United States (US) spared 180,336 (95% CI 142,860219,445) with 79,813 (95% CI 62,887-97,653) in New York State. In the same period, many regions except for China, Australia, and South Korea see a steep upward trend of spared infectees due to restricting SA with the US and Europe far steeper, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon. Latin America and Africa show less reduction of transmissivity through the region-by-time fixed effects than other regions, indicating a higher chance of becoming an epicenter soon.

TI  - A novel simplified method for surface albedo together with a look-up table to get an 18-year assessment of surface aerosol direct radiative effect in Central and East China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculating the aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) is significance for estimating the influence of aerosols. However, calculating ADRE through the radiative transfer model at large scales and for long periods is time-consuming. In this paper, a linear relationship between surface albedo and surface shortwave ADRE (ADRE(SW)) was proposed together with a look-up table to simplify the calculation. The linear relationship is tested and remains reliable as atmospheric properties vary. Validation that compared the results calculated with and without simplifications shows high coefficient of determination (0.97). The time required for calculation with the simplification is only 1/2630th of the unsimplified calculation, which reveals that our method greatly simplified the calculation and maintains high accuracy. Based on the simplification, daily surface ADRE(SW) under clear-sky conditions over Central and East China from 2001 to 2018 is calculated and analyzed. Central and East China has a regional average aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 0.66 and surface ADRE(SW) of -34.33 W/m(2) . The North China Plain (0.83, -41.42 W/m(2)), The Jianghan Plain (0.79, -40.33 W/m(2)) and the Yangtze River Delta City Agglomeration (0.90, -46.50 W/m(2)) feature heavy aerosol loading and a strong cooling effect. The inter-annual AOD and cooling effect decreased by 37.60% and 33.21%, respectively, after the 2011 accord to decrease anthropogenic emissions, proving the success of efforts by the Chinese government to protect environment. A study of daily shortwave aerosol radiative effect efficiency found that sunshine duration is the primary controlling factor.

TI  - Climatological trends in satellite-derived aerosol optical depth over North India and its relationship with crop residue burning: Rural-urban contrast
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Columnar Aerosol Optical Depths (AOD) over an urban area (Chandigarh) and a rural area (Khera, Fatehgarh Sahib district) situated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India were analysed to study their temporal heterogeneity in terms of interannual, seasonal and monthly variations. Over the last few decades,1GP has become one of the global hotspots of air pollution due to the increased anthropogenic activities such as traffic, industries, agricultural waste burning etc. Level-2 AODs (550 nm) were retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, for a period of 14 years (2005-2018). The climatological mean Terra-MODIS (Aqua-MODIS) AOD over the urban location was similar to 0.497 +/- 0238 (0.474 +/- 0.228), whereas over the rural location it was 0.542 +/- 0.269 (0.534 +/- 0282). Linear trend analysis estimated an increase in annual mean Terra-MODIS (Aqua-MODIS) AOD at a rate of similar to 0.009 (0.013) per year over the urban site: whereas over the rural location the rate of increase was similar to 0.003 (0.004) per year. Results show that the observed increase is similar to 1.49% (2.41%) of climatological mean AOD over the urban location for Terra-MODIS (Aqua-MODIS), whereas, over the rural location, it was similar to 0.50% (0.67%). Using the HYSPLIT trajectory model, it was concluded that during post-monsoon, the observed high AODs can be related to massive crop residue burning in the IGP region. These AOD trends can also be used to track the regional anthropogenic air-pollution changes. An empirical relation between AOD and PM10 was established, which can be used to estimate PM10 over the urban and rural areas of IGP (using MODIS AODs), complementing the sparse ground-based monitoring. Further, satellite-based air pollution data can be used for baseline assessment and understanding the impact of control policies such as National Clean Air Programme and to support formulate evidence-based pollution control strategies.

TI  - Intrapartum Basal Ganglia-Thalamic Pattern Injury and Radiologically Termed "Acute Profound Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury" Are Not Synonymous
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Human cases of acute profound hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury (HII), in which the insult duration timed with precision had been identified, remains rare, and there is often uncertainty of the prior state of fetal health.Study Design A retrospective analysis of 10 medicolegal cases of neonatal encephalopathy-cerebral palsy survivors who sustained intrapartum HI basal ganglia-thalamic (BGT) pattern injury in the absence of an obstetric sentinel event.Results Cardiotocography (CTG) admission status was reassuring in six and suspicious in four of the cases. The median time from assessment by admission CTG or auscultation to birth was 687.5 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 373.5-817.5 minutes), while the median time interval between first pathological CTG and delivery of the infant was 179 minutes (IQR: 137-199.25 minutes). The mode of delivery in the majority of infants (60%) was by unassisted vaginal birth; four were delivered by delayed caesarean section. The median (IQR) interval between the decision to perform a caesarean section and delivery was 169 minutes (range: 124-192.5 minutes).Conclusion The study shows that if a nonreassuring fetal status develops during labor and is prolonged, a BGT pattern HI injury may result, in the absence of a perinatal sentinel event. Intrapartum BGT pattern injury and radiologically termed "acute profound HI brain injury" are not necessarily synonymous. A visualized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern should preferably solely reflect the patterns description and severity, rather than a causative mechanism of injury.

TI  - Refining aerosol optical depth retrievals over land by constructing the relationship of spectral surface reflectances through deep learning: Application to Himawari-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For the past two decades, quantitative retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, and the results have been widely used in numerous studies. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) de-monstrates improved performance over the study region (95-125 degrees E, 18-30 degrees N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach.

TI  - Adaptive path following control for Wave gliders in time-varying environment
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Path following control plays an essential role in improving accuracy of navigation and achieving a smooth motion control. However, the performance will exhibit large lateral errors caused by weak maneuverability, large time-lag, and large ocean current disturbance when the wave glider is gliding with a low and time-varying speed. An adaptive path following control integrated an adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) algorithm and an improved artificial potential field (IAPF) algorithm was put forward in this paper, which could extremely guarantee path following accuracy. The adaptive control based a LOS was introduced to dynamically adjust a parameter of the LOS so that the output desired heading of the wave glider was on-time updated based on the velocity of the wave glider and path following error. The IAPF was applied to analyze and modify the output of the ALOS guiding the vehicle always convergent to the desired path, which could make a real time selfdiagnosing, monitoring and correction in path following control. Following this, a closed-loop control was put forward with a dynamic model of the "Black Pearl" wave glider and the given path following control. The proposed control was verified by simulations and sea trials compared with conventional LOS, which demonstrated its effectiveness and long-term reliability.y

TI  - Cy3-tilmanocept labeling of macrophages in joints of mice with antibody-induced arthritis and synovium of human patients with rheumatoid arthritis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - gamma-Tilmanocept (Tc-99m-tilmanocept) is a receptor-directed, radiolabeled tracer that is FDA-approved for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy. Tilmanocept binds the C-type lectin mannose receptor (MR, CD206) on macrophages. In this study, nonradioactive, fluorescently-labeled Cy3-tilmanocept was used to detect CD206(+) mononuclear cells in the cartilage of mice with antibody-induced arthritis and in the synovial fluid and tissue of human subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for comparison with osteoarthritis (OA), and healthy volunteer (HV) controls. Murine arthritis was induced by injection of monoclonal anti-cartilage antibody followed by injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Post-arthritis development (7-11 days), the mice were injected intravenously with Cy3-tilmanocept followed by in vivo and ex vivo epifluorescence imaging. Two-photon imaging, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify articular and synovial macrophages (CD206, F4/80, and Cy3-tilmanocept binding) in murine tissues. Cy3-tilmanocept epifluorescence was present in arthritic knees and elbows of murine tissues; no radiographic changes were noted in the skeletons. However, inflammatory arthritic changes were apparent by histopathology and immunohistochemistry (F4/80), immunofluorescence (CD206) and Cy3-tilmanocept binding. In human RA synovial fluid, Cy3-tilmanocept staining correlated with CD206(+)/CD16(+) cells; negligible labeling was observed in OA samples. Cy3-tilmanocept colocalized with CD206 and staining was significantly higher in RA synovial tissue compared to OA or HV. Our results demonstrate that imaging with Cy3-tilmanocept can detect in vivo inflammatory, CD206(+) macrophages in an early arthritis animal model and in human RA patients. These data establish a novel tool for preclinical research of early arthritis and have implications for early RA detection and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy in humans.

TI  - Clinical errors: Implementing root cause analysis in an area health service
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Medical errors are considered as threatening the patients' health and well-being in healthcare and treatment systems. There are various methods offered for managing the clinical risks and ensuring the healthcare quality and patient safety. Root cause analysis (RCA) is one of these methods. So, the current research paper aims at radically analyzing seven sentinel events reported to one of the large vice-chancellorships in Medical Sciences Universities in Iran.Method: The present study is a descriptive research which has been carried out based on a qualitative-retrospective method according to the eight stages elaborated in root cause analysis of healthcare events determined by National Authority for Health. To classify the identified problems, there was made use of 'classifying nursing errors in clinical management (NECM)' model, error cause classification, approved by the UK National Health System and then an innovative problem-solving method was applied to determine the improvement solutions. The information about the items in RCA forms was collected after obtaining a consensus of experts' panel views via interviews and focus group discussion sessions.Findings: For the 7 sentinel events, 30 problems related to the service or healthcare was identified. Out of the 30 identified problems, the most problem related to care problems (45.4%) and the least frequent problem related to knowledge and skill problems (14.5%). Inter alia the 406 influential causes mentioned, the most frequent cause error modes pertained to organizational factors (20.1%) and the least frequent cause error modes referred to patient-related and patient-companion related factors (6.1%). Moreover, the highest rate of interventions was taken in such areas as human resources management and implementing and monitoring suitable changes in clinical processes.Conclusion: According to the usefulness of error root cause analysis in regard to such issues as patients' safety, the systematic evaluation of sentinel events and incidents in sectors offering healthcare and treatment services is recommended. It is evident that the success of the corrective interventions in healthcare and treatment centers depends on policy-making and corroboration of the executive and supervisory levers and it is not possible without full-scale coordination and support by the various sectors connected to the social health.

TI  - Soil moisture retrievals using ALOS2-ScanSAR and MODIS synergy over Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the soil moisture retrievals over Tibetan Plateau using multi-temporal ALOS2-PALSAR2 data acquired in ScanSAR mode, in contrary to the commonly used StripMap SAR imaging mode. Considering the dual-polarimetry with limited observables, the surface roughness parameters such as the RMS height and auto-correlation length are first estimated by optimizing the semi-empirical Oh2004 model applied to the ALOS2 data acquired under bare soil condition. The vegetation water content corresponding to each ALOS2 acquisition time is derived from an empirical model applied to the temporally interpolated MODIS NDVI data. Then, the obtained roughness and vegetation optical depth are substituted into the Water Cloud Model which we modified by adding a double-bounce component according to the L-band scattering processes to retrieve the effective scattering albedo and soil moisture. The results show that the optimized surface RMS height and the associated slope are negatively related to a dual-angular radar index Delta HH, indicating the feasibility to optimize the relatively stable surface roughness parameters before retrieving the soil moisture dynamics. The obtained vegetation optical depth which is cross-validated against a normalized cross-polarized radar descriptor indicates a significant increase from May to August, in response to the vegetation phenological growth. Furthermore, the time variable scattering albedo is less than 0.08, and slightly increases with the vegetation development. By accounting for the double-bounce component, the retrieved soil moisture better agrees with the ground measurements with R = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.058 m(3)/m(3), but exhibits an overestimation issue for the soil moisture higher than 0.35 m(3)/m(3) due to the saturation of SAR signal and the relatively strong vegetation cover. A positive correspondence (R = 0.81) between the retrieved soil moisture and the interpolated NDVI was found, verifying their close coupling in the soil-vegetation system. This study deepens the insights in the potential integration between the optical and L-band microwave observations to retrieve soil moisture over vegetated area.

TI  - Sharpening ECOSTRESS and VIIRS land surface temperature using harmonized Landsat-Sentinel surface reflectances
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key diagnostic indicator of agricultural water use and crop stress. LST data retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) band imagery, however, tend to have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100 m for Landsat 8) than surface reflectance (SR) data collected from shortwave bands on the same instrument (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). Spatial sharpening of LST data using the higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach has shown great potential in the sharpening of Landsat LST using Landsat SR data co -collected over various landscapes. This work evaluates DMS performance for sharpening ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST (similar to 70 m native resolution) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST (375 m) data using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) SR data, providing the basis for generating 30-m LST data at a higher temporal frequency than afforded by Landsat alone. To account for the misalignment between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS and Landsat/HLS caused by errors in registration and orthorectification, we propose a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase, an optimal EC box size of 180-270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780 m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this work will facilitate the development of a prototype system that generates high spatiotemporal resolution LST products for improved agricultural water use monitoring by synthesizing multi-source remote sensing data.

TI  - Coral-spawn slicks: Reflectance spectra and detection using optical satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides the first report of reflectance spectra of coral-spawn slicks and their detection using optical satellite data. The reflectance spectra show that coral-spawn slicks can be discriminated from other sea-surface features such as wave foam and floating Sargassum. Analysis of Planet Dove and Sentinel-2B imagery allowed successful detection of coral-spawn slicks at Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan (24 degrees 31'40 '' N, 124 degrees 17'31 '' E), by using reflectance values in the green and red wavelength regions. This detection was attributable to both their high spatial resolution (3.7 m and 10 m, respectively) and high temporal resolution (1 day and 5 days, respectively), given that coral spawning occurs within a short period (up to several days), typically once a year, and that the coral-spawn slicks have narrow widths of similar to 10 m. The number of the detected coral-spawn slicks was small, possibly because of coral decline around Ishigaki Island caused by the 2016 worldwide mass coral bleaching event. High-frequency satellite observations, including those from satellite constellations, should provide a powerful tool for understanding coral-reef processes and features whose detection requires high spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - Characterisation, evolution and expression analysis of <i>heat shock protein</i> <i>20</i> genes from Japanese flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>) in response to <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> infection
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is an economically important flatfish endemic to Asia that faces natural challenges, such as heat shock and bacterial infection. Here, we investigated whether heat shock protein 20 (hsp20) in Japanese flounder played a role in immune reactions against Edwardsiella tarda. Hsp20 is ubiquitously produced by cells in the stress response; it not only functions as a chaperone and housekeeping protein but also participates in the immune response during infection. In this study, we identified and annotated 13 hsp20 genes using bioinformatic methods in Japanese flounder. Phylogenetic and selection pressure analysis showed that the hsp20 genes were evolutionarily-constrained and their function was conserved. Hsp20 genes are also involved in the embryogenesis and act as the sentinel role in an unchallenged organism. Moreover, the regulated expression patterns of hsp20 genes after E. tarda infection were examined for the first time in Japanese flounder. Eleven out of 13 genes were differentially expressed after bacterial challenge, which indicated that they may be involved in disease response genes or as disease defence against pathogens. These results provide valuable information for clarifying the evolutionary relationship of the hsp20 genes, and early insights into the immune functions of hsp20 genes in Japanese flounder.

TI  - Sea ice conditions and navigability through the Northeast Passage in the past 40 years based on remote-sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice conditions and navigability along four typical routes of the Northeast Passage (NEP) are analysed using remote-sensing data from 1979 to 2019. The influence of air temperature (T (air)) and surface wind on the sea ice concentration (SIC) and the navigability of routes is determined. It is found that the annually averaged SICs of the different routes have decreased over the past 41 years. The fastest rate of decrease occurred in the Kara Sea (similar to-1% per year), while the slowest rates of decrease occurred in the Laptev/East Siberian Sea (similar to-0.42% per year). The number of navigable days for the Kara Sea has become similar to 1-2 months longer than the Laptev/East Siberian Sea route as a result. The effect of T (air) on SIC, quantified by Delta SIC/Delta T (air) in the routes through the eastern Kara Sea and Laptev/East Siberian Sea in 2010s was similar to-0.04/degrees C, two to three times that seen during the 1980s. Air temperature is becoming a significant driving force of melting ice in these routes. Surface winds are also a crucial factor for the navigability of the Vilkitsky Strait and Long Strait, as they drive ice drift, and affect the navigability of the Kara Strait by introducing warm air.

TI  - Estimating lake temperature profile and evaporation losses by leveraging MODIS LST data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global lake evaporation is a critical component of the terrestrial water cycle. Accurate quantification of lake evaporation dynamics is of high importance for understanding lake energy budgets, land-atmosphere interactions, as well as regional water availability. However, the accurate quantification of lake evaporation has been hindered by the complexity involved with addressing the heat storage of water bodies. In this study, a new model-the Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model (LTEM)-was developed to simulate lake water temperature profiles, which were then used to calculate heat storage changes and evaporation rates. Inputs for the LTEM include the meteorological and bathymetric data, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water surface temperature (WST)-which is the land surface te`mperature (LST) over water. The MODIS WST was leveraged to constrain the hydrodynamic simulations. Model results over 11 lakes around the world show robust performance of LTEM. The long term average temperature biases range from-0.5 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C, and the evaporation rate biases range from-0.19 mm/day to 0.28 mm/day. In particular, it is found that LTEM significantly improves the simulation of the seasonality of lake evaporation rates. The validation results suggest that the averaged coefficient of determination (R2) for the evaporation rate is 0.84, which is 0.28 higher than that obtained when the conventional Penman equation (without heat storage) is used. The volumetric evaporation time series was then calculated as a product of the monthly evaporation rate and lake surface area (derived from MODIS near-infrared image classifications). This study provides an end-to-end framework for quantifying volumetric evaporation for the world's lakes and reservoirs. It also provides the capability to investigate the thermal dynamics of lake systems, and thus can benefit the various water resources applications across scales.

TI  - Stochastic ensemble methods for multi-SAR-mission soil moisture retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent and projected investments across the world on radar satellite missions (e.g., Sentinel-1, SAOCOM, BIOMASS and NISAR) provide a great opportunity for operational radar soil moisture mapping with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, there is no retrieval algorithm that can make complementary use of the multi-frequency data from those missions, due to the large uncertainties in observations collected by the different sensors, different validity regions of the forward models, and the fact that inversion algorithms have been designed for specific data sources. In this study, the principle of ensemble learning was introduced to provide two general soil moisture retrieval frameworks accounting for these issues. Instead of trying to find an optimal global solution, multiple soil moisture retrievals (termed sub-retrievals) with moderate performance were first obtained using different channels and/or time instances randomly selected from the available data, with the retrieved ensemble of results being the final output. The ensemble retrievals, taking one existing snapshot method and two multi-temporal methods as the base retrieval algorithms, were evaluated using a synthetic data set with the effectiveness confirmed under various uncertainty sources. An evaluation using the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) data set showed that the ensemble retrieval outperformed the non-ensemble retrieval in most cases, with a decrease of 0.004 to 0.014 m(3)/m(3) in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and an increase of 0.01 to 0.16 in correlation coefficient (R). Weakly biased and correlated sub-retrievals were confirmed to be the basic requirement of an effective ensemble retrieval, being consistent with use of ensemble learning in other applications.

TI  - Sentinel-2 remote sensing of <i>Zostera noltei</i>-dominated intertidal seagrass meadows
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The po-tential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC >= 50% and SPC >= 80% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (<= 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.

TI  - Authority, autonomy and selfhood in Islamic education - Theorising Shakhsiyah Islamiyah as a dialogical Muslim-self
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the philosophical tensions between secular-liberalism and Islam, and reviews Islamic conceptualisations of knowledge, personhood and education, in order to conceptualise shakhsiyah Islamiyah as an authentic and credible form of personal agency within an Islamic worldview. It begins by examining the liberal critique of Islamic education and explores notions of authority and autonomy in Islamic educational theory. It proposes that these tensions exist to varying degrees in all educational practice. Some theoretical work to develop an Islamic understanding of personal autonomy as selfhood is presented and translated into a concept of shakhsiyah Islamiyah. Finally, the possibility of understanding shakhsiyah Islamiyah as a dialogical Muslim-self is explored.

TI  - Biophysical and Socioeconomic Factors Associated to Deforestation and Forest Recovery in Brazilian Tropical Dry Forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of land cover changes (LCCs) and their association to biophysical and socioeconomic factors is vital to support government policies toward the sustainable use of natural resources. The present study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294 counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piaui). We obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope, elevation, and % change in human population and in cattle density. From 2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km(2) (+5.6%). This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of 19,018 km2 (24.8%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2; 19.2%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors, but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation, the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact.

TI  - New global characterisation of landslide exposure
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides triggered by intense rainfall are hazards that impact people and infrastructure across the world, but comprehensively quantifying exposure to these hazards remains challenging. Unlike earthquakes or flooding, which cover large areas, landslides occur only in highly susceptible parts of a landscape affected by intense rainfall, which may not intersect human settlement or infrastructure. Existing datasets of landslides around the world generally include only those reported to have caused impacts, leading to significant biases toward areas with higher reporting capacity, limiting our understanding of exposure to landslides in developing countries. In this study, we use an alternative approach to estimate exposure to landslides in a homogenous fashion. We have combined a global landslide hazard proxy derived from satellite data with open-source datasets on population, roads and infrastructure to consistently estimate exposure to rapid landslide hazards around the globe. These exposure models compare favourably with existing datasets of rainfall-triggered landslide fatalities, while filling in major gaps in inventory-based estimates in parts of the world with lower reporting capacity. Our findings provide a global estimate of exposure to landslides from 2001 to 2019 that we suggest may be useful to disaster mitigation professionals.

TI  - Tailings-flow runout analysis: examining the applicability of a semi-physical area-volume relationship using a novel database
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tailings flows result from the breach of tailings dams. Large-scale tailings flows can travel over substantial distances with high velocities and cause significant loss of life, environmental damage, and economic costs. Runout modelling and inundation mapping are critical components of risk assessment for tailings dams. In an attempt to develop consistency in reporting tailings data, we established a new tailings-flow runout classification system. Our data analysis applies to the zone corresponding to the extent of the main solid tailings deposit, which is characterized by visible or field-confirmed sedimentation, above typical surface water levels if extending into downstream water bodies. We introduced a new database of 33 tailings dam breaches by independently estimating the planimetric inundation area for each event using remote sensing data. This paper examines the applicability of a semi-physical area-volume relationship using the new database. Our results indicate that the equation A = cV (2/3), which has been used previously to characterize the mobility of other types of mass movements, is a statistically justifiable choice for the relationship between total released volume and planimetric inundation area. Our analysis suggests that, for a given volume, tailings flows are, on average, less mobile than lahars but more mobile than nonvolcanic debris flows, rock avalanches, and waste dump failures.

T2  - STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
M3  - Article
AB  - White extremism in the U.S. has not received much attention in the literature, despite scholars arguing that it represents the most sustained form of terrorism in the U.S. While much of the research on extremist movements has focused on the groups' violent acts, there has been significantly less attention on the nonviolent activities, such as music. Following a social movement theoretical framework, we set out to understand the role that music plays in constructing the worldview and narrative of white extremists. Using lyrics from 337 white power songs from seven white power bands, we analyzed the linear and interconnected narrative that emerges in the music. What we found is a narrative interwoven throughout the music that presents a clear picture of white societies under threat from immigration, the Jewish-controlled media, and liberalism, with clear directives for extreme violence and vigilante justice. Based on this picture, we discuss the potential counterextremism implications and provide several avenues for future research.

TI  - Effectiveness of transfer learning for enhancing tumor classification with a convolutional neural network on frozen sections
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate confirmation of metastasis on the frozen tissue section of intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy is an essential tool for critical surgical decisions. However, accurate diagnosis by pathologists is difficult within the time limitations. Training a robust and accurate deep learning model is also difficult owing to the limited number of frozen datasets with high quality labels. To overcome these issues, we validated the effectiveness of transfer learning from CAMELYON16 to improve performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification model on our frozen dataset (N=297) from Asan Medical Center (AMC). Among the 297 whole slide images (WSIs), 157 and 40 WSIs were used to train deep learning models with different dataset ratios at 2, 4, 8, 20, 40, and 100%. The remaining, i.e., 100 WSIs, were used to validate model performance in terms of patch- and slide-level classification. An additional 228 WSIs from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) were used as an external validation. Three initial weights, i.e., scratch-based (random initialization), ImageNet-based, and CAMELYON16-based models were used to validate their effectiveness in external validation. In the patch-level classification results on the AMC dataset, CAMELYON16-based models trained with a small dataset (up to 40%, i.e., 62 WSIs) showed a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.929 than those of the scratch- and ImageNet-based models at 0.897 and 0.919, respectively, while CAMELYON16-based and ImageNet-based models trained with 100% of the training dataset showed comparable AUCs at 0.944 and 0.943, respectively. For the external validation, CAMELYON16-based models showed higher AUCs than those of the scratch- and ImageNet-based models. Model performance for slide feasibility of the transfer learning to enhance model performance was validated in the case of frozen section datasets with limited numbers.

AB  - The surgical treatment is still the most effective method in curing of early breast cancer. Breast preservation and the application of oncoplastic principles became generally accepted, the sentinel lymph node biopsy in the surgical treatment of the axilla is primary, and the indication for axillary block dissection (ABD) is narrowing further. The neoadjuvant oncological treatment that is applied more and more widely presented surgery with new challenges. Hereunder we summarise our recommendations on the surgical treatment of breast cancer based on the content of the 3rd Breast Cancer Consensus Conference and considering the latest international studies and professional recommendations.

TI  - [4th Hungarian Breast Cancer Consensus Conference - Radiotherapy guidelines].
T2  - Magyar onkologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The radiotherapy (RT) expert panel revised and updated the RT guidelines accepted in 2016 at the 3rd Hungarian Breast Cancer Consensus Conference based on new scientific evidence. Radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is indicated in ductal carcinoma in situ (St. 0), as RT decreases the risk of local recurrence (LR) by 50-60%. In early stage (St. I-II) invasive breast cancer RT remains a standard treatment following BCS. However, in elderly (≥70 years) patients with stage I, hormone receptor positive tumour hormonal therapy without RT can be considered. Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) and for selected cases accelerated partial breast irradiation are validated treatment alternatives of conventional WBI. Following mastectomy RT significantly decreases the risk of LR and improves overall survival of patients having 1 to 3 or ≥4 positive axillary lymph nodes. In selected cases of patients with 1 to 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes axillary dissection can be substituted with axillary RT. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by BCS WBI is mandatory, while after NAC followed by mastectomy locoregional RT should be given in cases of initial stage III-IV and ypN1 axillary status.

TI  - Outbreak of autochthonous cases of malaria in coastal regions of Northeast Brazil: the diversity and spatial distribution of species of <i>Anopheles</i>
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Brazil has the fourth highest prevalence of malaria of all countries in the Americas, with an estimated 42 million people at risk of contracting this disease. Although most cases occur in the Amazon region, cases of an autochthonous nature have also been registered in the extra-Amazonian region where Anopheles aquasalis and An. albitarsis are the mosquito species of greatest epidemiological interest. In 2019, the municipality of Conde (state of Paraiba) experienced an epidemic of autochthonous cases of malaria. Here we present preliminary results of an entomological and case epidemiology investigation, in an attempt to correlate the diversity and spatial distribution of species of Anopheles with the autochthonous cases of this outbreak of malaria.Methods: Case data were collected using case report forms made available by the Conde Municipal Health Department. The entomological survey was carried out from July to November 2019. The various methods of capture included the use of battery-powered aspirators, mouth aspirators, Shannon traps, BG-Sentinel traps (with and without dry ice) and CDC light traps. Captured mosquitoes were separated, packaged and sent to the laboratory for sexing and molecular identification of the various species of anophelines. The data were tabulated and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Spatial analysis of the data was performed using ArcGis 10 software.Results: In 2019, 20 autochthonous cases and one imported case of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax were diagnosed, with three cases of relapses. A total of 3713 mosquitoes were collected, of which 3390 were culicines and 323 were anophelines. Nine species of genus Anopheles were identified, with the most abundant being An. aquasalis (38.9%), followed by An. minor (18.2%) and An. albitarsis (9.0%). Spatial analysis of the data showed that the area could be considered to be at risk of malaria cases and that there was a high prevalence of Anopheles.Conclusions: The results presented indicate that this extra-Amazonian region has an environment conducive to maintenance of the malaria transmission cycle owing to the wide diversity of Anopheles species. This environment in combination with the high influx of people from endemic areas to the study area provides a perfect setting for the occurrence and maintenance of malaria.

TI  - A classification scheme to determine wildfires from the satellite record in the cool grasslands of southern Canada: considerations for fire occurrence modelling and warning criteria
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily polar-orbiting satellite MODIS thermal detections since 2002 were used as the baseline for quantifying wildfire activity in the mixed grass and agricultural lands of southernmost central Canada. This satellite thermal detection record includes both the responsible use of fire (e.g. for clearing crop residues, grassland ecosystem management, and traditional burning) and wildfires in grasslands and agricultural lands that pose a risk to communities and other values. A database of known wildfire evacuations and fires otherwise requiring suppression assistance from provincial forest fire agencies was used to train a model that classified satellite fire detections based on weather, seasonality, and other environmental conditions. A separate dataset of high resolution (Landsat 8 thermal anomalies) of responsible agricultural fire use (e.g. crop residue burning) was collected and used to train the classification model to the converse. Key common attributes of wildfires in the region included occurrence on or before the first week of May with high rates of grass curing, wind speeds over 30 kmh(-1), relative humidity values typically below 40 %, and fires that are detected in the mid-afternoon or evening. Overall, grassland wildfire is found to be restricted to a small number of days per year, allowing for the future development of public awareness and warning systems targeted to the identified subset of weather and phenological conditions.

TI  - Reanalysis of the 2000 Rift Valley fever outbreak in Southwestern Arabia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The first documented Rift Valley hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula occurred in northwestern Yemen and southwestern Saudi Arabia from August 2000 to September 2001. This Rift Valley fever outbreak is unique because the virus was introduced into Arabia during or after the 1997-1998 East African outbreak and before August 2000, either by wind-blown infected mosquitos or by infected animals, both from East Africa. A wet period from August 2000 into 2001 resulted in a large number of amplification vector mosquitoes, these mosquitos fed on infected animals, and the outbreak occurred. More than 1,500 people were diagnosed with the disease, at least 215 died, and widespread losses of domestic animals were reported. Using a combination of satellite data products, including 2 x 2 m digital elevation images derived from commercial satellite data, we show rainfall and potential areas of inundation or water impoundment were favorable for the 2000 outbreak. However, favorable conditions for subsequent outbreaks were present in 2007 and 2013, and very favorable conditions were also present in 2016-2018. The lack of subsequent Rift Valley fever outbreaks in this area suggests that Rift Valley fever has not been established in mosquito species in Southwest Arabia, or that strict animal import inspection and quarantine procedures, medical and veterinary surveillance, and mosquito control efforts put in place in Saudi Arabia following the 2000 outbreak have been successful. Any area with Rift Valley fever amplification vector mosquitos present is a potential outbreak area unless strict animal import inspection and quarantine proceedures are in place.

TI  - A negative binomial regression model for risk estimation of 0-2 axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive clinical trials indicate that patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy do not need axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). However, the ACOSOG Z0011 trial indicates that patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) and 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes having breast conserving surgery with whole breast radiotherapy do not benefit from ALND. The aim of this study is therefore to identify those patients with 0-2 positive nodes who might avoid ALND. A total of 486 patients were eligible for the study with 212 patients in the modeling group and 274 patients in the validation group, respectively. Clinical lymph node status, histologic grade, estrogen receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were found to be significantly associated with ALN metastasis. A negative binomial regression (NBR) model was developed to predict the probability of having 0-2 ALN metastases with the area under the curve of 0.881 (95% confidence interval 0.829-0.921, P<0.001) in the modeling group and 0.758 (95% confidence interval 0.702-0.807, P<0.001) in the validation group. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model was clinically useful. The NBR model demonstrated adequate discriminative ability and clinical utility for predicting 0-2 ALN metastases.

TI  - Assessments of land subsidence along the Rizhao-Lankao high-speed railway at Heze, China, between 2015 and 2019 with Sentinel-1 data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Heze section of Rizhao-Lankao high-speed railway (RLHR-HZ) has been under construction since 2018 and will be in operation by the end of 2021. However, there is a concern that land subsidence in the Heze region may affect the regular operation of RLHR-HZ. In this study, we investigate the contemporary ground deformation in the region between 2015 and 2019 by using more than 350 C-band interferograms constructed from two tracks of Sentinel-1 data over the region. The small baseline subset (SBAS) technique is adopted to compile the time-series displacement. We find that the RLHR-HZ runs through two main subsidence areas: one is located east of the Heze region with rates ranging from -4 to -1 cm yr(-1), and another one is located in the coalfield with rates ranging from -8 to -2 cm yr(-1). A total length of 35 km of RLHR-HZ is affected by the two subsidence basins. Considering the previous investigation and the monthly precipitation, we infer that the subsidence bowl east of the Heze region is due to massive extraction of deep groundwater. Close inspections of the relative locations between the second subsidence area and the underground mining reveals that the subsidence there is probably caused by the groundwater outflow and fault instability due to mining, rather than being directly caused by mining The InSAR-derived ground subsidence implies that it is necessary to continue monitoring the ground deformation along RLHR-HZ.

TI  - Tackling modern-day crises: Why understanding multilevel interconnectivity is vital
T2  - BIOESSAYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex crises like the coronavirus pandemic are showing us that modern societies are becoming increasingly unable to live in equilibrium with nature. These crises are the result of multiple causes, which interact at different scales and across different domains. Therefore, investigating their proximate causes is not enough to fully understand them. It is also crucial to take into account the structural factors involved. As concerns the global pandemic, I suggest four levels of analysis: (i) the surface or "proximate" level of the crisis; (ii) the human-environment-animal interface, as pointed out by the One Health approach; (iii) the broader socioeconomic context; and (iv) the deeper or worldview level. Furthermore, I argue that there is the need for a mindset shift if we want to properly trace causality. Much more attention must be given to the study of multilevel connecting patterns and nonlinear mechanisms as the producers of emergent global effects.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early stage cervical cancer: A meta-analysis
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to determine the specific side detection rate of the sentinel lymph node biopsy and the accuracy in predicting lymph node metastasis in early stage cervical cancer.Methods A systematic search of databases was performed from the inception of the databases to 27 June 2020. Studies of cervical cancer patients with FIGO stage FIGO ?A similar to IIB, evaluating the sentinel lymph node biopsy with blue dye, technetium 99, combined technique (blue dye with technetium 99) or indocyanine green with a reference standard of systematic pelvis lymph node dissection or clinical follow-up were included. Stata12.0 and Meta-Disc 1.4 were used for the meta-analysis.Results Of 2825 articles found, 21 studies (2234 women) were eventually included. Out of 21 studies, 20 met the detection rate evaluation criteria and six were included for sensitivity meta-analysis. Due to heterogeneity, it was inappropriate to pool all studies. The pooled specific side detection rates were 85% in tumors up to 2 cm, 67% in tumors over 2 cm, 75.2% for blue dye, 74.7% for technetium 99, 84% for combined technique, and 85.5% for indocyanine green. The sentinel lymph node biopsy had a pooled specific side sensitivity of 88%. Adverse effects of sentinel lymph node biopsy appear minimal for most patients and are mainly related to the injection of blue dye.Conclusions Sentinel lymph node biopsy using a tracer with a high detection rate and ultrastaging is highly accurate and reliable when limited to seriously selected patients, with satisfactory bilateral lymph node mapping and where enough cases for learning curve optimization exist. Indocyanine green sentinel lymph node mapping seems to be a superior sentinel lymph node mapping technique compared to other methods at present.

TI  - Plasmonic nanoplatforms: From surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing to biomedical applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Review
AB  - In this work, we present an overview of the development and application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and plasmonic nanoplatforms developed in our laboratory in recent years. We have developed a wide variety of plasmonics-active substrates and nanoparticle-based sensing platforms including inverse molecular sentinels (iMS) utilizing gold nanostars (AuNS) and nanorattle DNA sensors (NR). These platforms have been used for a wide variety of applications, such as monitoring genomic biomarkers in plants for renewable bioenergy research, point-of-care diagnostics of infectious diseases (dengue and malaria), and detection of cancer biomarkers for gastrointestinal and head and neck cancers. Applications of plasmonic AuNS in bioimaging, photothermal therapy (PTT), and immunotherapy are also presented. An interesting advance was the development of AuNS-mediated PTT in combination with immunotherapy, a method referred to as Synergistic Immuno Photothermal Nanotherapy (SYMPHONY), which broadens and significantly enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy. This review highlights various applications of the unique plasmonics-enabled sensing and therapeutic nanotechnologies that contribute to the lasting legacy of the discovery of SERS.

TI  - Effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and <i>Giardia duodenalis</i> infection on a sentinel species' gut bacteria
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat disturbance, a common consequence of anthropogenic land use practices, creates human-animal interfaces where humans, wildlife, and domestic species can interact. These altered habitats can influence host-microbe dynamics, leading to potential downstream effects on host physiology and health. Here, we explored the effect of ecological overlap with humans and domestic species and infection with the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis on the bacteria of black and gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya), a key sentinel species, in northeastern Argentina. Fecal samples were screened for Giardia duodenalis infection using a nested PCR reaction, and the gut bacterial community was characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Habitat type was correlated with variation in A. caraya gut bacterial community composition but did not affect gut bacterial diversity. Giardia presence did not have a universal effect on A. caraya gut bacteria across habitats, perhaps due to the high infection prevalence across all habitats. However, some bacterial taxa were found to vary with Giardia infection. While A. caraya's behavioral plasticity and dietary flexibility allow them to exploit a range of habitat conditions, habitats are generally becoming more anthropogenically disturbed and, thus, less hospitable. Alterations in gut bacterial community dynamics are one possible indicator of negative health outcomes for A. caraya in these environments, since changes in host-microbe relationships due to stressors from habitat disturbance may lead to negative repercussions for host health. These dynamics are likely relevant for understanding organism responses to environmental change in other mammals.

TI  - Quantifying aboveground vegetation water storage combining Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1 imageries
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although optical remote sensing has been widely used to monitor vegetation characteristics, its use on aboveground vegetation water storage (AVWS) is quite scare. Therefore, we combined the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1 imageries to quantify AVWS using generalized linear regression (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) with the linkage of field observations in Mao Country, Southwest China. Field observations showed that the AVWS varied significantly among different ecosystems (p < 0.001). In terms of model efficiency and root mean square error, ANN (0.66, 56 Mg ha(-1)) performed best compared to RF (0.52, 66 Mg ha(-1)) and GLM (0.48, 69 Mg ha(-1)). Total AVWS was 3.8 x 10(7) Mg for the whole study area with 76% contributions from coniferous forests. Strong spatial patterns of AVWS were observed among different ecosystems, which were highly consistent with the spatial distributions of vegetation types. This research highlights a potential way to estimate AVWS through the combination of multispectral remote sensing and SAR data by linking machine learning algorithms, particular in mountainous areas.

TI  - Ecosocial Philosophy of Education: Ecologizing the Opinionated Self
T2  - STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While human beings generally act prosocially towards one another - contra a Hobbesian "war of all against all" - this basic social courtesy tends not to be extended to our relations with the more-than-human world. Educational philosophy is largely grounded in a worldview that privileges human-centered conceptions of the self, valuing its own opinions with little regard for the ecological realities undergirding it. This hyper-separation from the 'society of all beings' is a foundational cause of our current ecological crises. In this paper, we develop an ecosocial philosophy of education (ESPE) based on the idea of an ecological self. We aspire to consolidate voices from deep ecology and ecofeminism for conceptualizing education in terms of being responsible to and for, a complex web of interdependent relations among human and more-than-human beings. By analyzing the notion of opinions in light of Gilles Deleuze's critique of the 'dogmatic image of thought,' we formulate three aspects of ESPE capable of supporting an ecological as opposed to an egoistic conception of the self: (i) rather than dealing with fixed concepts, ESPE supports adaptable and flexible boundaries between the self and the world; (ii) rather than fixating on correct answers, ESPE focuses on real-life problems shifting our concern from the self to the world; and (iii) rather than supporting arrogance, EPSE cultivates an epistemic humility grounded in our ecological embeddedness in the world. These approaches seek to enable an education that cultivates a sense of self that is less caught up with arbitrary, egoistic opinions of the self and more attuned to the ecological realities constituting our collective life-worlds.

TI  - A Suite of Tools for Continuous Land Change Monitoring in Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover has been designated by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as an Essential Climate Variable due to its integral role in many climate and environmental processes. Land cover and change affect regional precipitation patterns, surface energy balance, the carbon cycle and biodiversity. Accurate information on land cover and change is essential for climate change mitigation programs such as UN-REDD+. Still, uncertainties related to land change are large, in part due to the use of traditional land cover and change mapping techniques that use one or a few remotely sensed images, preventing a comprehensive analysis of ecosystem change processes. The opening of the Landsat archive and the initiation of the Copernicus Program have enabled analyses based on time series data, allowing the scientific community to explore global land cover dynamics in ways that were previously limited by data availability. One such method is the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC), which uses all available Landsat data to model temporal-spectral features that include seasonality, trends, and spectral variability. Until recently, the CCDC algorithm was restricted to academic environments due to computational requirements and complexity, preventing its use by local practitioners. The situation has changed with the recent implementation of CCDC in the Google Earth Engine, which enables analyses at global scales. What is still missing are tools that allow users to explore, analyze and process CCDC outputs in a simplified way. In this paper, we present a suite of free tools that facilitate interaction with CCDC outputs, including: (1) time series viewers of CCDC-generated time segments; (2) a spatial data viewer to explore CCDC model coefficients and derivatives, and visualize change information; (3) tools to create land cover and land cover change maps from CCDC outputs; (4) a tool for unbiased area estimation of key climate-related variables like deforestation extent; and (5) an API for accessing the functionality underlying these tools. We illustrate the usage of these tools at different locations with examples that explore Landsat time series and CCDC coefficients, and a land cover change mapping example in the Southeastern USA that includes area and accuracy estimates.

TI  - Aerosol-enhanced high precipitation events near the Himalayan foothills
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate emissions can alter the physical and dynamical properties of cloud systems and, in turn, amplify rainfall events over orographic regions downwind of highly polluted urban areas. The Indo-Gangetic Plain, one of the most polluted regions of the world, is located upwind of the Himalayan foothills. The region, therefore, provides an opportunity for studying how aerosol effects, in connection with orographic forcing, affect extreme rainfall events. This study uses 17 years (2001-2017) of observed rain rate, aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological reanalysis fields and outgoing long-wave radiation to investigate high precipitation events on the foothills of the Himalayas. Composite analysis of all these co-located data sets for high precipitation events (daily rainfall > 95th percentile) is done to understand the inherent dynamics and linkages between the AOD and extreme events. Clear and robust associations are found between high precipitation events, high aerosol loading and high moist static energy values. Results show an average increase in AOD by 36 %, along with an average increase in low-level moist static energy (1000-850 hPa) by approximate to 1500 J kg(-1) inside the selected domain for high precipitation events. The finding highlights the crucial role of the aerosol direct radiative effect on high precipitation events over the Himalayan region.

TI  - Using an Ontology to Facilitate More Accurate Coding of Social Prescriptions Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Feasibility Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: National Health Service (NHS) England supports social prescribing in order to address social determinants of health, which account for approximately 80% of all health outcomes. Nevertheless, data on ongoing social prescribing activities are lacking. Although NHS England has attempted to overcome this problem by recommending 3 standardized primary care codes, these codes do not capture the social prescribing activity to a level of granularity that would allow for fair attribution of outcomes to social prescribing.Objective: In this study, we explored whether an alternative approach to coding social prescribing activity, specifically through a social prescribing ontology, can be used to capture the social prescriptions used in primary care in greater detail.Methods: The social prescribing ontology, implemented according to the Web Ontology Language, was designed to cover several key concepts encompassing social determinants of health. Readv2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 codes were identified using the NHS Terms Browser. The Royal College of General Practitioners Research Surveillance Centre, a sentinel network of over 1000 primary care practices across England covering a population of more than 4,000,000 registered patients, was used for data analyses for a defined period (ie, January 2011 to December 2019).Results: In all, 668 codes capturing social prescriptions addressing different social determinants of health were identified for the social prescribing ontology. For the study period, social prescribing ontology codes were used 5,504,037 times by primary care practices of the Royal College of General Practitioners Research Surveillance Centre as compared to 29,606 instances of use of social prescribing codes, including NHS England's recommended codes.Conclusions: A social prescribing ontology provides a powerful alternative to the codes currently recommended by NHS England to capture detailed social prescribing activity in England. The more detailed information thus obtained will allow for explorations about whether outputs or outcomes of care delivery can be attributed to social prescriptions, which is essential for demonstrating the overall value that social prescribing can deliver to the NHS and health care systems.

TI  - Elimination of cervical cancer in low- and middle-income countries: Inequality of access and fragile healthcare systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - In 2018, WHO called for global action to eliminate cervical cancer. The complexity of the processes involved in terms of prevention is often underestimated. Low- and middle-income countries do not have a robust healthcare framework to ensure high-quality programs. The present article discusses how fragile healthcare systems are barriers to eliminating cervical cancer, and also reports the experience of a Brazilian prevention program. The article considers how cervical cancer can be interpreted as an indicator of inequality: how women's attitudes and access to care determine an early or late diagnosis, and how strategies combining vaccine and DNA-HPV tests are crucial. New vaccine schemes, the critical analysis of local data, strengthening communication, managing sentinel events, and integrating vaccination and screening data for the health information system are some of the key activities to sustainable improvement in both access and quality of care.

TI  - Recent global decline of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effects on vegetation photosynthesis
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The enhanced vegetation productivity driven by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) [i.e., the CO2 fertilization effect (CFE)] sustains an important negative feedback on climate warming, but the temporal dynamics of CFE remain unclear. Using multiple long-term satellite- and ground-based datasets, we showed that global CFE has declined across most terrestrial regions of the globe from 1982 to 2015, correlating well with changing nutrient concentrations and availability of soil water. Current carbon cycle models also demonstrate a declining CFE trend, albeit one substantially weaker than that from the global observations. This declining trend in the forcing of terrestrial carbon sinks by increasing amounts of atmospheric CO2 implies a weakening negative feedback on the climatic system and increased societal dependence on future strategies to mitigate climate warming.

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention has implemented an active comprehensive surveillance project of acute respiratory infections in adults in Shanghai, including influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). By testing and identifying a variety of respiratory pathogens, it was found that influenza viruses were the main pathogens in 172 ILI cases in 2019. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 30.81%, 14.53% and 30.55%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 6.40%, with a positive detection peak in the third quarter, while the positive rate of adenovirus was 4.65% with a positive detection peak in the second quarter of the year. Two human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 positive samples, 1 HCoV-HKU1 positive sample and 1 HCoV-NL63 positive sample were detected, respectively, and no HCoV-229E positive sample was detected. The detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus was 17.44%, and the detection rate of Klebsiellapneumoniae was 9.88%. Influenza viruses were also the main pathogens in 1 447 SARI cases. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 5.46%, 1.73% and 0.30%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (17.50%) peaked in the first quarter. The total positive detection rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 2.97%, the positive detection peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was 3.25% and the positive rate of Legionella was 1.04%. 5 HCoV-229E positive samples, 10 HCoV-OC43 positive samples, 7 HCoV-HKU1 positive samples and 6 HCoV-NL63 positive samples were detected. Eight strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected after cultures. By implementing the active surveillance, we not only detected a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in time, but also preliminary understood the pathogenic spectrum characteristics and seasonality of ILI and SARI in Shanghai. In recent years, the surveillance methods have been continuously improved and the number of sentinel hospitals has increased gradually. In particular, for the response to COVID-19, the Surveillance Information Reporting System of Acute Respiratory Infection based on HIS system has been promoted to cover the whole city, which might lay a foundation for the active surveillance and early warning of emerging infectious diseases in the future.

TI  - The shared risk of diabetes between dog and cat owners and their pets: register based cohort study
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - OBJECTIVETo investigate whether dog and cat owners and their pets share a risk of developing diabetes.DESIGNCohort study.SETTINGRegister based longitudinal study, Sweden.PARTICIPANTS208 980 owner-dog pairs and 123 566 owner-cat pairs identified during a baseline assessment period (1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESType 2 diabetes events in dog and cat owners and diabetes events in their pets, including date of diagnosis during the follow-up period (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012). Owners with type 2 diabetes were identified by combining information from the National Patient Register, the Cause of Death Register, and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Information on diabetes in the pets was extracted from veterinary care insurance data. Multi-state models were used to assess the hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals and to adjust for possible shared risk factors, including personal and socioeconomic circumstances.RESULTSThe incidence of type 2 diabetes during follow-up was 7.7 cases per 1000 person years at risk in dog owners and 7.9 cases per 1000 person years at risk in cat owners. The incidence of diabetes in the pets was 1.3 cases per 1000 dog years at risk and 2.2 cases per 1000 cat years at risk. The crude hazard ratio for type 2 diabetes in owners of a dog with diabetes compared with owners of a dog without diabetes was 1.38 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.74), with a multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of 1.32 (1.04 to 1.68). Having an owner with type 2 diabetes was associated with an increased hazard of diabetes in the dog (crude hazard ratio 1.28, 1.01 to 1.63), which was attenuated after adjusting for owner's age, with the confidence interval crossing the null (1.11, 0.87 to 1.42). No association was found between type 2 diabetes in cat owners and diabetes in their cats (crude hazard ratio 0.99, 0.74 to 1.34, and 1.00, 0.78 to 1.28, respectively).CONCLUSIONSData indicated that owners of a dog with diabetes were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes during follow-up than owners of a dog without diabetes. It is possible that dogs with diabetes could serve as a sentinel for shared diabetogenic health behaviours and environmental exposures.

TI  - Newly Discovered Triassic Lithium Deposits in the Dahongliutan Area, NorthWest China: A Case Study for the Detection of Lithium-Bearing Pegmatite Deposits in Rugged Terrains Using Remote-Sensing Data and Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rare metals, such as lithium and cobalt used in rechargeable batteries, have increased in value as demands for them escalates. Concentrations of lithium-bearing minerals are found in closed-basin brines, granitic pegmatites, and associated granitic rocks containing spodumene (LiAl(SiO3)(2)) and various other economic minerals. The recently discovered Dahongliutan Li mineral occurrences are hosted by a pegmatite dyke swarm in NW China, in an area that is also prospective for Be, Rb, Nb, and Ta mineralisation. However, the high altitude and steep topography in the area make it extremely difficult to explore for mineralisation. A combination of geochemical methods, geological mapping, and high-resolution remotely sensed multispectral imagery has been used in this study to pinpoint potential locations of pegmatite-hosted Li occurrences. The exploration method developed has led to the discovery many large Li mineral occurrences in the Bayankala Fold Belt, including the 505, 507, north 509, and South Fulugou 1# and 2# mineral occurrences (documented here) with a combined resource of over 1.7 million tonnes (Mt). The laser ablation multi-receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-MC-ICP-MS) Pb-206/Pb-207-U-238/Pb-207 isochron age of the mineralised pegmatite is 223 +/- 11 Ma (N = 44, MSWD = 2.1). The 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of muscovite in the mineralised pegmatite dates between 197 +/- 1 and 185 +/- 1 Ma. These dates show that these granitic pegmatites (with a monzogranitic composition) were emplaced during the Late Triassic coeval with magmatism in the region. Our data show that the Li mineralisation in the Dahongliutan area has a similar age and genesis as the pegmatite-hosted deposits of the Jiajika area in the western Sichuan Province. This indicates that the Dahongliutan area is highly prospective of various pegmatite-hosted mineral deposits.

TI  - Retrieval of high-resolution nearshore bathymetry from Sentinel-2 twin multispectral imagers using a multi-scene approach
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining nearshore bathymetry by traditional surveying methods is a challenging task as it involves huge costs and efforts. Most of the coastal shallowwater zones worldwide either remain unmapped or not updated. Bathymetry estimations from optical satellite imageries have been increasingly implemented as an alternative tool for traditional bathymetry surveys. In this study, we examine the usefulness of freely available, five-day revisit and relatively high-resolution Multi Spectral Instruments (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2A and 2B twin satellites. A process workflow has been developed which automatically incorporates a robust atmospheric correction through ACOLITE software and multi-scene compositing of several scenes to improve the reliability and no data gaps. Two study sites in India are explored owing to their variability in submarine morphology. High-resolution bathymetry maps are generated through a log-ratio transform model calibrated with minimal in situ data from the jet ski soundings. The satellite-derived bathymetry obtained has an overall bias of -0.01 and 0.02 m, and root mean square error of 1.09 and 0.93 m respectively, at two study sites up to 15 m depth. The consistency in bathymetry retrieval indicates a potential for automated application for the benefit of operational and scientific studies. These high-resolution maps capture small-scale nearshore features like sandbars and rip channels, which are of prime importance for coastal and beach managers.

TI  - Predicting <i>Aedes aegypti</i> infestation using landscape and thermal features
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying Aedes aegypti breeding hotspots in urban areas is crucial for the design of effective vector control strategies. Remote sensing techniques offer valuable tools for mapping habitat suitability. In this study, we evaluated the association between urban landscape, thermal features, and mosquito infestations. Entomological surveys were conducted between 2016 and 2019 in Vila Toninho, a neighborhood of SAo Jose do Rio Preto, SAo Paulo, Brazil, in which the numbers of adult female Ae. aegypti were recorded monthly and grouped by season for three years. We used data from 2016 to 2018 to build the model and data from summer of 2019 to validate it. WorldView-3 satellite images were used to extract land cover classes, and land surface temperature data were obtained using the Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). A multilevel negative binomial model was fitted to the data, which showed that the winter season has the greatest influence on decreases in mosquito abundance. Green areas and pavements were negatively associated, and a higher cover of asbestos roofs and exposed soil was positively associated with the presence of adult females. These features are related to socio-economic factors but also provide favorable breeding conditions for mosquitos. The application of remote sensing technologies has significant potential for optimizing vector control strategies, future mosquito suppression, and outbreak prediction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE CHAPLAINCY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the multiple uses of religion/spirituality (R/S) in healthcare and on the practices of healthcare chaplaincy support creation of a middle-range, prescriptive theory for chaplaincy for patients who use R/S in their healthcare experiences. Religiously Informed, Relationally Skillful Chaplaincy Theory (RIRSCT) seeks to integrate research into practice in order to improve spiritual care and allow for testing RIRSCT. The components of RIRSCT are: patients whose religion is a significant part of their worldview often use R/S in healthcare to make meaning, to cope, and to make medical decisions; chaplains should be the members of the healthcare team to assess and address R/S; healthcare teams could provide more personalized treatment by integrating patients' R/S into the treatment plan, which could improve patient experience. This article describes the components of RIRSCT and provides examples of chaplaincy guided by RIRSCT. Selected research articles supporting theory components are reviewed.

TI  - Reconciling irrigation demands for agricultural expansion with environmental sustainability - A preliminary assessment for the Ica Valley, Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation expansion driven by a growing global food demand is threatening the sustainability of scarce water resources. An exemplar is the Ica Valley in Peru which has experienced significant agricultural transformation over the last three decades with uncontrolled abstractions leading to over-exploitation of the Ica-Villacuri aquifer. This paper critically assesses the impacts of agricultural expansion on the longterm sustainability of groundwater resources in the Ica Valley. We apply a combination of spatial analysis and irrigation modelling by farming type (large and small-scale), followed by a multi-criteria assessment on irrigation water use. Historical trends in cropped area were analysed using Landsat satellite imagery to identify agricultural expansion and the changing composition between large and small-scale farms. The blue water footprint (WFblue) for croplands was calculated distinguishing between surface and groundwater abstractions for eight disaggregated geographical zones within the Ica Valley. The economic benefits of water consumption were assessed using the water productivity indicator, and the environmental sustainability of water resources spatially evaluated using a monthly blue water sustainability index and adapted version of the groundwater debt. The analyses showed that the groundwater footprint accounts for 87% of the total WFblue (483 Mm(3)) with 286 Mm(3) groundwater consumed under unsustainable conditions (exceeding groundwater recharge). The highest water productivity (2.4-5.4 sol/ton) occurs in zones with intensive groundwater abstractions and where most large-farms are located, but it is also where the sustainability issue is most acute. Modelling showed that based on existing climate conditions and cropping patterns, irrigated agriculture is locally unsustainable throughout the valley, with the exception of small-scale farming in the peri-urban and middle valley areas. Around 10% of total aquifer recharge results from small-scale irrigated farming, whereas recharge from large scale farming is negligible. The greatest impacts occur in zones dominated by large-scale farms, where a period of 3.7-5.9 years is estimated to be needed to replenish water resources consumed by agricultural production. There is thus an urgent need to manage water resources more effectively and promote more sustainable use of water to protect both traditional and agro-export agricultural practices as well as allocations for urban water supply and the environment.

TI  - Zoonotic Tick-Borne Pathogens in Temperate and Cold Regions of Europe-A Review on the Prevalence in Domestic Animals
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Ticks transmit a variety of pathogens affecting both human and animal health. In temperate and cold regions of Europe (Western, Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe), the most relevant zoonotic tick-borne pathogens are tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Borrelia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. More rarely, Rickettsia spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis, and zoonotic Babesia spp. are identified as a cause of human disease. Domestic animals may also be clinically affected by these pathogens, and, furthermore, can be regarded as sentinel hosts for their occurrence in a certain area, or even play a role as reservoirs or amplifying hosts. For example, viraemic ruminants may transmit TBEV to humans via raw milk products. This review summarizes the role of domestic animals, including ruminants, horses, dogs, and cats, in the ecology of TBEV, Borrelia spp., A. phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp., N. mikurensis, and zoonotic Babesia species. It gives an overview on the (sero-)prevalence of these infectious agents in domestic animals in temperate/cold regions of Europe, based on 148 individual prevalence studies. Meta-analyses of seroprevalence in asymptomatic animals estimated an overall seroprevalence of 2.7% for TBEV, 12.9% for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), 16.2% for A. phagocytophilum and 7.4% for Babesia divergens, with a high level of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses with regard to animal species, diagnostic test, geographical region and decade of sampling were mostly non-significant, with the exception of significantly lower B. burgdorferi s.l. seroprevalences in dogs than in horses and cattle. More surveillance studies employing highly sensitive and specific test methods and including hitherto non-investigated regions are needed to determine if and how global changes in terms of climate, land use, agricultural practices and human behavior impact the frequency of zoonotic tick-borne pathogens in domestic animals.

TI  - A recent history of deglaciation and vegetation establishment in a contrasted geomorphological context, Glacier Blanc, French Alps
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper combines a new chronosequence of deglaciation from 1952 to 2015 for Glacier Blanc, French Alps, with an analysis of the proglacial area greening trend. Deglaciated landscapes are ideal natural arenas to investigate geoecological processes, and the Glacier Blanc is an interesting case as it offers a contrasted geomorphological context. The relationships between vegetation and glaciological, geomorphological and hydrological features have first been assessed by revising the existing chronosequence of deglaciation by geo-referencing 12 historical images which has allowed the production of a dense high resolution glacier outline sequence since 1952. Geomorphological and hydrological features have been mapped by photo-interpretation of historical images. The spatial distribution of vegetation and greening trends were assessed using a 2015 high resolution infra-red images and 35-years of Landsat images from 1984 to 2019. The main map illustrates the spatial intertwining of geomorphological and hydrological features with vegetation primary succession in a deglaciated landscapes.

TI  - The human bone marrow harbors a CD45<SUP>-</SUP> CD11B<SUP>+</SUP> cell progenitor permitting rapid microglia-like cell derivative approaches
T2  - STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microglia, the immune sentinel of the central nervous system (CNS), are generated from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors that populate the developing CNS. Interestingly, a specific type of bone marrow-derived monocyte is able to express a yolk sac microglial signature and populate CNS in disease. Here we have examined human bone marrow (hBM) in an attempt to identify novel cell sources for generating microglia-like cells to use in cell-based therapies and in vitro modeling. We demonstrate that hBM stroma harbors a progenitor cell that we name stromal microglial progenitor (STR-MP). STR-MP single-cell gene analysis revealed the expression of the consensus genetic microglial signature and microglial-specific genes present in development and CNS pathologies. STR-MPs can be expanded and generate microglia-like cells in vitro, which we name stromal microglia (STR-M). STR-M cells show phagocytic ability, classically activate, and survive and phagocyte in human brain tissue. Thus, our results reveal that hBM harbors a source of microglia-like precursors that can be used in patient-centered fast derivative approaches.

TI  - Geomorphology of the northeastern extreme of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 1:60,000 scale geomorphological map of the Argentine side of the northeastern extreme of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego in southernmost South America is presented. This paper describes and summarizes the geomorphology of the mapped area, which includes glacial, periglacial, fluvial, coastal, aeolian, lacustrine, and anthropogenic landforms that span over 680 km(2)north of San Sebastian Bay in a sparsely populated semiarid and cold steppe used for sheep breeding and hydrocarbon extraction. We used Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and ALOS-PALSAR satellite products combined with field validation to create the map. Glacial advances and retreats as well as climatic and sea level fluctuations that controlled fluvial systems and coastal dynamics were the main sculptors of the landscape during the Late Cenozoic. Aeolian, lacustrine, and anthropogenic activity were later minor contributors. The presented free, open access, vector geomorphological map is intended to be a supporting tool for multidisciplinary researchers and decision-makers.

TI  - You don't have to tell a story! A registered report testing the effectiveness of narrative versus non-narrative misinformation corrections
T2  - COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Misinformation often has an ongoing effect on people's memory and inferential reasoning even after clear corrections are provided; this is known as the continued influence effect. In pursuit of more effective corrections, one factor that has not yet been investigated systematically is the narrative versus non-narrative format of the correction. Some scholars have suggested that a narrative format facilitates comprehension and retention of complex information and may serve to overcome resistance to worldview-dissonant corrections. It is, therefore, a possibility that misinformation corrections are more effective if they are presented in a narrative format versus a non-narrative format. The present study tests this possibility. We designed corrections that are either narrative or non-narrative, while minimizing differences in informativeness. We compared narrative and non-narrative corrections in three preregistered experiments (total N = 2279). Experiment 1 targeted misinformation contained in fictional event reports; Experiment 2 used false claims commonly encountered in the real world; Experiment 3 used real-world false claims that are controversial, in order to test the notion that a narrative format may facilitate corrective updating primarily when it serves to reduce resistance to correction. In all experiments, we also manipulated test delay (immediate vs. 2 days), as any potential benefit of the narrative format may only arise in the short term (if the story format aids primarily with initial comprehension and updating of the relevant mental model) or after a delay (if the story format aids primarily with later correction retrieval). In all three experiments, it was found that narrative corrections are no more effective than non-narrative corrections. Therefore, while stories and anecdotes can be powerful, there is no fundamental benefit of using a narrative format when debunking misinformation.

TI  - Emergency department syndromic surveillance systems: a systematic review
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundSyndromic surveillance provides public health intelligence to aid in early warning and monitoring of public health impacts (e.g. seasonal influenza), or reassurance when an impact has not occurred. Using information collected during routine patient care, syndromic surveillance can be based on signs/symptoms/preliminary diagnoses. This approach makes syndromic surveillance much timelier than surveillance requiring laboratory confirmed diagnoses.The provision of healthcare services and patient access to them varies globally. However, emergency departments (EDs) exist worldwide, providing unscheduled urgent care to people in acute need. This provision of care makes ED syndromic surveillance (EDSyS) a potentially valuable tool for public health surveillance internationally.The objective of this study was to identify and describe the key characteristics of EDSyS systems that have been established and used globally.MethodsWe systematically reviewed studies published in peer review journals and presented at International Society of Infectious Disease Surveillance conferences (up to and including 2017) to identify EDSyS systems which have been created and used for public health purposes. Search criteria developed to identify "emergency department" and "syndromic surveillance" were applied to NICE healthcare, Global Health and Scopus databases.ResultsIn total, 559 studies were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review, comprising 136 journal articles and 423 conference abstracts/papers. From these studies we identified 115 EDSyS systems in 15 different countries/territories across North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. Systems ranged from local surveillance based on a single ED, to comprehensive national systems. National EDSyS systems were identified in 8 countries/territories: 2 reported inclusion of >= 85% of ED visits nationally (France and Taiwan).ConclusionsEDSyS provides a valuable tool for the identification and monitoring of trends in severe illness. Technological advances, particularly in the emergency care patient record, have enabled the evolution of EDSyS over time. EDSyS reporting has become closer to 'real-time', with automated, secure electronic extraction and analysis possible on a daily, or more frequent basis.The dissemination of methods employed and evidence of successful application to public health practice should be encouraged to support learning from best practice, enabling future improvement, harmonisation and collaboration between systems in future.Prospero numberCRD42017069150.

TI  - Global proliferation of offshore gas flaring areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term venting and combustion of offshore associated gas have substantial adverse effects on the ecological environment, so characterizing the global proliferation of offshore gas flaring areas is very important for marine environmental protection and climate change research. However, the use of a single fire/light remote sensing product makes it difficult to conduct long-term observations. In this study, we detected global offshore gas flaring areas during the 27-year interval from 1992 to 2018, using temporal and spatial complementarity of six different remote sensing data products, which are as follows: DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights; (A)ATSRs; MODIS and VIIRS active fire products; and VIIRS Night Fire and Nighttime Light. Our aim was to achieve more comprehensive extraction results and to analyze a longer time-interval than has been attempted previously. In addition, the resulting map of the global proliferation of offshore gas flaring areas enables their locational and temporal characteristics to be visualized.

TI  - Diverse supraglacial drainage patterns on the Devon ice Cap, Arctic Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Devon Ice Cap (DIC) is one of the largest ice masses in the Canadian Arctic. Each summer, extensive supraglacial river networks develop on the DIC surface and route large volumes of meltwater from ice caps to the ocean. Mapping their extent and understanding their temporal evolution are important for validating runoff routing and melt volumes predicted by regional climate models (RCMs). We use 10 m Sentinel-2 images captured on 28 July and 10/11 August 2016 to map supraglacial rivers across the entire DIC (12,100 km(2)). Both dendritic and parallel supraglacial drainage patterns are found, with a total length of 44,941 km and a mean drainage density (D-d ) of 3.71 km(-1). As the melt season progresses, D-d increases and supraglacial rivers form at progressively higher elevations. There is a positive correlation between RCM-derived surface runoff and satellite-mapped D-d , suggesting that supraglacial drainage density is primarily controlled by surface runoff.

TI  - A global long-term (1981-2000) land surface temperature product for NOAA AVHRR
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays an important role in the research of climate change and various land surface processes. Before 2000, global LST products with relatively high temporal and spatial resolutions are scarce, despite a variety of operational satellite LST products. In this study, a global 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees historical LST product is generated from NOAA advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data (1981-2000), which includes three data layers: (1) instantaneous LST, a product generated by integrating several split-window algorithms with a random forest (RF-SWA); (2) orbital-drift-corrected (ODC) LST, a drift-corrected version of RF-SWA LST; and (3) monthly averages of ODC LST. For an assumed maximum uncertainty in emissivity and column water vapor content of 0.04 and 1.0 g cm(-2), respectively, evaluated against the simulation dataset, the RF-SWA method has a mean bias error (MBE) of less than 0.10 K and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.10 K. To compensate for the influence of orbital drift on LST, the retrieved RF-SWA LST was normalized with an improved ODC method. The RF-SWA LST were validated with in situ LST from Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) sites and water temperatures obtained from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). Against the in situ LST, the RF-SWA LST has a MBE of 0.03 K with a range of -1.59-2.71 K, and SD is 1.18 K with a range of 0.84-2.76 K. Since water temperature only changes slowly, the validation of ODC LST was limited to SURFRAD sites, for which the MBE is 0.54 K with a range of -1.05 to 3.01 K and SD is 3.57 K with a range of 2.34 to 3.69 K, indicating good product accuracy. As global historical datasets, the new AVHRR LST products are useful for filling the gaps in long-term LST data. Furthermore, the new LST products can be used as input to related land surface models and environmental applications. Furthermore, in support of the scientific research community, the datasets are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3934354 for RF-SWA LST (Ma et al., 2020a), https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3936627 for ODC LST (Ma et al., 2020c), and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3936641 for monthly averaged LST (Ma et al., 2020b).

TI  - Landsat near-infrared (NIR) band and ELM-FATES sensitivity to forest disturbances and regrowth in the Central Amazon
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance and regrowth are key processes in forest dynamics, but detailed information on these processes is difficult to obtain in remote forests such as the Amazon. We used chronosequences of Landsat satellite imagery (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) to determine the sensitivity of surface reflectance from all spectral bands to windthrow, clear-cut, and clear-cut and burned (cut + burn) and their successional pathways of forest regrowth in the Central Amazon. We also assessed whether the forest demography model Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FAIES) implemented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), ELM-FAILS, accurately represents the changes for windthrow and clearcut. The results show that all spectral bands from the Landsat satellites were sensitive to the disturbances but after 3 to 6 years only the near-infrared (NIR) band had significant changes associated with the successional pathways of forest regrowth for all the disturbances considered. In general, the NIR values decreased immediately after disturbance, increased to maximum values with the establishment of pioneers and early successional tree species, and then decreased slowly and almost linearly to pre-disturbance conditions with the dynamics of forest succession. Statistical methods predict that NIR values will return to pre-disturbance values in about 39, 36, and 56 years for windthrow, clear-cut, and cut + burn disturbances, respectively. The NIR band captured the observed, and different, successional pathways of forest regrowth after windthrow, clear-cut, and cut + burn. Consistent with inferences from the NIR observations, ELMFAIES predicted higher peaks of biomass and stem density after clear-cuts than after windthrows. ELM-FAILS also predicted recovery of forest structure and canopy coverage back to pre-disturbance conditions in 38 years after windthrows and 41 years after clear-cut. The similarity of ELM-FAILS predictions of regrowth patterns after windthrow and clearcut to those of the NIR results suggests the NIR band can be used to benchmark forest regrowth in ecosystem models. Our results show the potential of Landsat imagery data for mapping forest regrowth from different types of disturbances, benchmarking, and the improvement of forest regrowth models.

TI  - The glacial geomorphology of western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing the response of present-day ice sheets to past global climate change is important for constraining and refining the numerical models which forecast future contributions of these ice sheets to sea-level change. Mapping landforms is an essential step in reconstructing glacial histories. Here we present a new map of glacial landforms and deposits on nunataks in western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. Nunataks are mountains or ridges that currently protrude through the ice sheet and may provide evidence that they have been wholly or partly covered by ice, thus indicating a formerly more extensive (thicker) ice sheet. The map was produced through a combination of mapping from Worldview satellite imagery and ground validation. The sub-metre spatial resolution of the satellite imagery enabled mapping with unprecedented detail. Ten landform categories have been mapped, and the landform distributions provide evidence constraining spatial patterns of a previously thicker ice sheet.

TI  - Apocalyptic Arithmetic: Numbers and Worldview in the Book of Revelation
T2  - HEYTHROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most noticeable features of the book of Revelation is the ubiquity of arithmetic in the text. In this article, I survey the arithmetical functions found in the text (not only numbers but functions such as multiplication and applied mathematics, such as measurements), and note some patterns in John's use of numbers. Then the article explores precedents in the Hebrew Scriptures, Hellenistic culture (including astrology) and Jewish apocalyptic literature. I argue rhetorical criticism helps us identify what John is trying to do with his apocalyptic arithmetic. I draw on theological analysis, literary analysis (particularly the "writerly" nature of the text with its missing pieces for the audience to fill in) and especially intertextuality to understand his rhetorical strategy. I discuss various numbers but focus especially on ten and two passages (Rev 14:20 and 12:1-6) as examples of John's use of numbers and arithmetical functions. I conclude that John uses arithmetic to support his Christocentric narrative and worldview in addressing his Jewish and Greek audience.

TI  - Economic utility of 3D remote sensing data for estimation of site index in Nordic commercial forest inventories: a comparison of airborne laser scanning, digital aerial photogrammetry and conventional practices
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest productivity is a crucial variable in forest planning, usually expressed as site index (SI). In Nordic commercial forest inventories, SI is commonly estimated by a combination of aerial image interpretation, field assessment and information obtained from previous inventories. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data can alternatively be used for SI estimation, however the economic utilities of the inventory methods have not been compared. We compared seven methods of SI estimation in a cost-plus-loss analysis, by which we added the expected economic losses due to sub-optimal treatment decisions to the inventory costs. The methods comprised direct and indirect estimation from combinations of ALS, DAP and stand register data, and manual interpretation from aerial imagery supported by field assessment and information from previous inventories (conventional practices). The choice of method had great impact on both the accuracy and the economic value of the produced estimates. Direct methods using bitemporal ALS and DAP data gave the best accuracy and the smallest total cost. DAP was a suitable and low-cost data source for SI estimation. Estimation from single-date ALS and DAP data and age obtained from the stand register provided practical alternatives when applied to even-aged stands.

TI  - Optimization of alongwind and crosswind force coefficients on a tall building with horizontal limbs using surrogate modeling
T2  - STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF TALL AND SPECIAL BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - For tall buildings, values of wind force coefficients can be obtained from wind tunnel tests or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This paper is concentrated to analyze a set of CFD data and propose parametric equations for determining force coefficients in the alongwind and crosswind direction (C-fx and C-fy) of tall buildings with horizontal limbs. Initially, a parametric study is performed with CFD analysis considering RANS k - epsilon turbulence models keeping a constant plan area 22,500 mm(2). The length and velocity scales are taken as 1:300 and 1:5, respectively. The required design parameters are obtained and used for fitting parametric equations. The CFD data are further utilized for training artificial neural networks of C-fx and C-fy. The results of CFD, ANN, and parametric equations are compared. The parametric equations are validated by employing a wind tunnel study. Finally, three optimization studies are carried out using a genetic algorithm (GA), of which the first two aim to present the maximum and minimum force coefficients considering single objectives. The third optimization is a multi-objective optimization problem, carried out to simultaneously minimize and maximize the two orthogonal force coefficients. Pareto-optimal design results are presented.

TI  - Functional integrity of aging skin, from cutaneous biology to anti-aging strategies
T2  - M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The skin is a sentinel organ making easily visible the passing of time. Chronological and environmental aging weakens skin structure and functions. The skin barrier, the elastic and mechanical properties of the cutaneous tissue as well as its vascular reactivity are impacted by aging. The barrier dysfunction in aged skin is caused by defects in epidermal keratinocytes renewal and differentiation notably linked to abnormal expression of microRNAs regulating cell death and autophagy. An abnormal balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix proteins modifies the mechanical properties of the dermis in aged skin. Finally, a reduction of the vascular reactivity linked to endothelial dysfunctions is observed in elderly people. These biological processes can be targeted by therapeutic approaches either topical or systemic, especially using anti-oxydants or senolytics. These anti-aging strategies might contribute to restore, at least in part, the functional integrity of aged skin.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a geomorphic map of the landforms created by the Patagonian Ice Sheet during the local Last Glacial Maximum and perhaps prior glaciations in southernmost Patagonia. Building on prior work, the new mapping focuses in unprecedented detail on the right lateral and frontal landforms formed by the Strait of Magellan ice lobe. We produced the map using aerial orthophotography, Sentinel-2 and SPOT satellite imagery, ALOS PALSAR digital elevation model and fieldwork to ground-truth preliminary interpretations. We delineate at least five glacial events defined by a sequence of moraine drifts and associated glaciofluvial features. In contrast to previous studies, we propose the Magellan ice lobe extended similar to 65 km farther, to the Primera Angostura peninsula, during the local Last Glacial Maximum. Our study provides a new context to establish a precise glacial chronology of the Magellan ice lobe during the last glacial cycle in the middle-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.

TI  - Maiming buried paleoaeograohical features of the Nile Delta (Egypt) using the Landsat archive
T2  - E&G QUATERNARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution highlights the use of Landsat spectral-temporal metrics (STMs) for the detection of surface anomalies that are potentially related to buried near-surface paleogeomorphological deposits in the Nile Delta (Egypt), in particular for a buried river branch close to Buto. The processing was completed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for the entire Nile Delta and for selected seasons of the year (summer/winter) using Landsat data from 1985 to 2019. We derived the STMs of the tasseled cap transformation (TC), the Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These features were compared to historical topographic maps of the Survey of Egypt, CORONA imagery, the digital elevation model of the TanDEM-X mission, and modern high-resolution satellite imagery. The results suggest that the extent of channels is best revealed when differencing the median NDWI between summer (July/August) and winter (January/February) seasons (Delta NDWI). The observed difference is likely due to lower soil/plant moisture during summer, which is potentially caused by coarser-grained deposits and the morphology of the former levee Similar anomalies were found in the immediate surroundings of several Pleistocene sand hills ("geziras") and settlement mounds ("tells") of the eastern delta, which allowed some mapping of the potential near-surface continuation. Such anomalies were not observed for the surroundings of tells of the western Nile Delta. Additional linear and meandering Delta NDWI anomalies were found in the eastern Nile Delta in the immediate surroundings of the ancient site of Bubastis (Tell Basta), as well as several kilometers north of Zagazig. These anomalies might indicate former courses of Nile river branches. However, the Delta NDWI does not provide an unambiguous delineation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of water quality variables and hydrography in a seabream cage culture farm off the coast of Oman
T2  - AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mariculture cage farming in Oman is in its infancy stage. This study provides important baseline information about the initial state of mariculture in Oman and for the sustainable management of future local cage farming. Our main objective was to evaluate the spatio-temporal variations of water quality and hydrography around a gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) cage farm in Quriyat (Sea of Oman). Starting in July 2018, we conducted a monitoring program over one year in which physico-chemical variables and nutrient levels were regularly measured at the farm cages and at reference sites away from the farm. Vertical flow profiles were recorded at the farm and analysed together with remotely sensed data. The results showed no significant differences among physico-chemical variables and nutrient levels between cages and reference sites. However, there were clear seasonal as well as significant short-term variations in the measurements. Winter conditions are usually homogeneous over the water column without reaching extremes. In summer we recorded surface temperatures of up to 32 degrees C and extended periods of hypoxia below 35 m depth. Periods of pronounced stratification were interrupted by energetic irregular flow pulses that triggered short up or down-welling events which lead to strong variations of temperature and oxygen. We did not measure a significant impact of the cage farm on the local environment. Our results rather point to the particular importance of monitoring temperature and oxygen levels. Both variables can approach threshold levels for fish farming, especially during summer. We determined the relevant characteristics of the local system and defined requirements for adequate monitoring. The findings of this study provide a timely baseline for future research on the interactions between local cage farms and the marine ecosystem and will assist in the planning and management of mariculture in Oman.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Over the past 2 decades, several global burned area products have been produced and released to the public. However, the accuracy assessment of such products largely depends on the availability of reliable reference data that currently do not exist on a global scale or whose production require a high level of dedication of project resources. The important lack of reference data for the validation of burned area products is addressed in this paper. We provide the Burned Area Reference Database (BARD), the first publicly available database created by compiling existing reference BA (burned area) datasets from different international projects. BARD contains a total of 2661 reference files derived from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. All those files have been checked for internal quality and are freely provided by the authors. To ensure database consistency, all files were transformed to a common format and were properly documented by following metadata standards. The goal of generating this database was to give BA algorithm developers and product testers reference information that would help them to develop or validate new BA products. BARD is freely available at https://doi.org/10.21950/BBQQU7 (Franquesa et al., 2020).

TI  - Spatially resolved evaluation of Earth system models with satellite column-averaged CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) showed large uncertainties in simulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We utilize the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) to evaluate emission-driven CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations with satellite data of column-average CO2 mole fractions (XCO2). XCO2 time series show a large spread among the model ensembles both in CMIP5 and CMIP6. Compared to the satellite observations, the models have a bias of +25 to -20 ppmv in CMIP5 and +20 to -15 ppmv in CMIP6, with the multi-model mean biases at +10 and +2 ppmv, respectively. The derived mean atmospheric XCO2 growth rate (GR) of 2.0 ppmv yr(-1) is overestimated by 0.4 ppmv yr(-1) in CMIP5 and 0.3 ppmv yr(-1) in CMIP6 for the multi-model mean, with a good reproduction of the interannual variability. All models capture the expected increase of the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) with increasing latitude, but most models underestimate the SCA. Any SCA derived from data with missing values can only be considered an "effective" SCA, as the missing values could occur at the peaks or troughs. The satellite data are a combined data product covering the period 2003-2014 based on the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY)/Envisat (2003-2012) and Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier transform spectrometer/Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (TANSO-FTS/GOSAT) (2009-2014) instruments. While the combined satellite product shows a strong negative trend of decreasing effective SCA with increasing XCO2 in the northern midlatitudes, both CMIP ensembles instead show a non-significant positive trend in the multi-model mean. The negative trend is reproduced by the models when sampling them as the observations, attributing it to sampling characteristics. Applying a mask of the mean data coverage of each satellite to the models, the effective SCA is higher for the SCIAMACHY/Envisat mask than when using the TANSO-FTS/GOSAT mask. This induces an artificial negative trend when using observational sampling over the full period, as SCIAMACHY/Envisat covers the early period until 2012, with TANSO-FTS/GOSAT measurements starting in 2009. Overall, the CMIP6 ensemble shows better agreement with the satellite data than the CMIP5 ensemble in all considered quantities (XCO2, GR, SCA and trend in SCA). This study shows that the availability of column-integral CO2 from satellite provides a promising new way to evaluate the performance of Earth system models on a global scale, complementing existing studies that are based on in situ measurements from single ground-based stations.

TI  - The Celtic Sea Through Time and Space: Ecosystem Modeling to Unravel Fishing and Climate Change Impacts on Food-Web Structure and Dynamics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Both trophic structure and biomass flow within marine food webs are influenced by the abiotic environment and anthropogenic stressors such as fishing. The abiotic environment has a large effect on species spatial distribution patterns and productivity and, consequently, spatial co-occurrence between predators and prey, while fishing alters species abundances and food-web structure. In order to disentangle the impacts of the abiotic environment and fishing in the Celtic Sea ecosystem, we developed a spatio-temporal trophic model, specifically an Ecopath with Ecosim with Ecospace model, for the period 1985-2016. In this model, particular attention was paid to the parameterization of the responses of all trophic levels to abiotic environmental changes. Satellite remote sensing data were employed to determine the spatial distribution and annual fluctuations of primary production (PP). Spatial and temporal changes in the habitat favorable for zooplankton were predicted with a novel ecological-niche approach using daily detection of productivity fronts from satellite ocean color. Finally, functional responses characterizing the effect of several abiotic environmental variables (including, among others, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration, both at the surface and at the bottom) on fish species groups' habitat suitability were produced from the predictions of statistical habitat models fitted to presence-absence data collected by multiple fisheries-independent surveys. The dynamic component of our model (Ecosim) was driven by time-series of fishing effort, PP, zooplankton habitat suitability and abiotic environmental variables, and was fitted to abundance and fisheries catch data. The spatial component of our model (Ecospace) was constructed, for specific years of the period 1985-2016 with contrasted abiotic environmental conditions, to predict the variable distribution of the biomass of all functional groups. We found that fishing was the main driver of observed ecosystem changes in the Celtic Sea over the period 1985-2016. However, the integration of the environmental variability into the model and the subsequent improvement of the fit of the dynamic Ecosim component highlighted (i) the control of the overall pelagic production by PP and (ii) the influence of temperature on the productivity of several trophic levels in the Celtic Sea, especially on trophic groups with warm and cold water affinities. In addition, Ecospace predictions indicated that the spatial distributions of commercial fish species may have substantially changed over the studied period. These spatial changes mainly appeared to be driven by temperature and may, therefore, largely impact future fisheries given the continuity of climatic changes.

TI  - Characterization of impressions created by turfgrass arthropods on clay models
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Lepidopteran pests such as fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith), and black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel (both Noctuidae), are serious problems of turfgrass (Poaceae) in the USA. Several predators in turfgrass systems attack lepidopteran larvae; however, their predaceous activity is rarely recorded, as they leave hardly any evidence. Predaceous activity can be studied using clay models, an approach still rarely employed in turfgrass. Thus, assays were conducted to determine the types of impressions that common turfgrass arthropods leave on clay models simulating lepidopteran larvae. Nine impression types were characterized after exposing 16 arthropod taxa in enclosed arenas in the laboratory and one taxon in the field to two sizes of clay models, including scratches, paired marks, pricks, deep distortions, disturbed surfaces, detached segments, granulated surfaces, dents, and elongated scratches. Most arthropods produced scratches and paired marks, whereas granulated surfaces and elongated scratches were produced by only a few of the selected arthropods. To ensure that the impressions were correctly identified, non-expert volunteers reviewed the impressions, and they were accurately identified in >85% of the responses. Video recordings of arthropod interactions were captured to determine the behavior of the arthropods during their first interaction with the clay models. Most arthropods first interacted with the terminal rather than the middle regions of the models. There were no differences between their interactions with the large or small models, and they used their mouthparts as often as their legs. Knowledge of the impression types caused by common arthropods will improve the utilization of the clay model technique for field studies in turfgrass. This could contribute to improved management of natural enemies as part of an integrated pest management approach.

TI  - A coastally improved global dataset of wet tropospheric corrections for satellite altimetry
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The accuracy of satellite radar altimetry (RA) is known to deteriorate towards the coastal regions due to several reasons, amongst which the improper account for the wet path delay (WPD) can be pointed out. The most accurate WPDs for RA are derived from the on-board microwave radiometer (MWR) radiance measurements, acquired simultaneously as the altimeter ranges. In the coastal zone, however, the signal coming from the surrounding land contaminates these measurements and the water vapour retrieval from the MWR fails. As meteorological models do not handle coastal atmospheric variability correctly yet, the altimeter measurements are rejected whenever MWR observations are absent or invalid. The need to solve this RA issue in the coastal zone, simultaneously responding to the growing demand for data in these regions, motivated the development of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) derived Path Delay (GPD) algorithm.GPD combines WPD from several sources through objective analysis (OA) to estimate the WPD or the corresponding RA correction accounting for this effect, the wet tropospheric correction (WTC), for all along-track altimeter points for which this correction has been set as invalid or is not defined. The current GPD version (GPD Plus, GPD C) uses as data sources WPD from coastal and island GNSS stations, from satellites carrying microwave radiometers, and from valid on-board MWR measurements. GPD C has been tuned to be applied to all, past and operational, RA missions, with or without an on-board MWR. The long-term stability of the WTC dataset is ensured by its inter-calibration with respect to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and SSM/I Sounder (SSMIS). The dataset is available for the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P); Jason-1 and Jason-2 (NASA and CNES); Jason-3 (NASA and EUMETSAT); ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat and CryoSat-2 (ESA); SARAL/AltiKa (ISRO and CNES); and GFO (US Navy) RA missions. The GPD C WTC for Sentinel-3 (ESA and EUMET-SAT) shall be released soon. The present paper describes the GPD C database and its assessment through statistical analyses of sea level anomaly (SLA) datasets, calculated with GPD C, the ECMWF Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) model or MWR-derived WTCs. Global results, as well as results for three regions (the North American and European coasts and the Indonesia region), are presented for ESA's recent Envisat Full Mission Reprocessing (FMR) V3.0. Global results show that the GPD C WTC leads to a reduction in the SLA variance of 1-2 cm(2) in the coastal zones, when used instead of the ERA WTC, which is one of the WTCs available in these products and can be adopted when the MWR-derived WTC is absent or invalid. The improvement of the GPD C WTC over the ERA WTC is maximal over the tropical oceans, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, showing that the model-derived WTC is not able to capture the full variability in the WPD field yet. The statistical assessment of GPD C for the North American coast shows a reduction in SLA variance, when compared to the use of the ERA-derived WTC, of 1.2 cm(2), on average, for the whole range of distances from the coast considered (0-200 km). Similar results are obtained for the European coasts. For the Indonesia region, the use of the GPD C WTC instead of that from ERA leads to an improvement, on average, on the order of 2.2 cm(2) for distances from the coast of up to 100 km. Similar results have been obtained for the remaining missions, particularly for those from ESA. Additionally, GPD+ recovers the WTC for a significant number of along-track altimeter points with missing or invalid MWR-derived WTCs, due to land, rain and ice contamination and instrument malfunctioning, which otherwise would be rejected. Consequently, the GPD+ database has been chosen as the reference WTC in the Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (CCI) products; GPD+ has also been adopted as the reference in CryoSat-2 Level-2 Geophysical Ocean Products (GOP). Strategies to further improve the methodology, therefore enhancing the quality of the database, are also discussed. The GPD+ dataset is archived on the home page of the Satellite Altimetry Group, University of Porto, publicly available at the repository https://doi.org/10.23831/FCUP_UPORTO_GPDPlus_v1.0 (Fernandes et al., 2019).

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimation of probable maximum precipitation (PMP) is critical to ensure the safety and resilience of communities. The aim of this study is to improve the estimation of 24-h PMP using ground-based and remotely sensed data, particularly over data-scarce regions. Gumbel copula, as a bivariate extreme value distribution based on a moisture maximization method, was applied to estimate PMP. The framework allows us to examine the simultaneous occurrence of extreme precipitable water vapour (PW) and precipitation efficiency (PE) and determines extreme PW values using a regional remote sensing algorithm. This novel framework was compared with conventional methods including the Hershfield and moisture maximization approaches, which do not consider the dependencies between extreme PW and PE. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the dependence structure between extreme PW and PE in the estimation of PMP and the applicability of remotely sensed data, especially for data-scarce regions.

TI  - Assessing temporal dynamics of predation and effectiveness of caterpillar visual defense using sawfly larval color and resting posture as a model
T2  - INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Caterpillars (Lepidoptera and Symphyta larvae) employ diverse visual defensive tactics, and effectiveness of such tactics may be highly dynamic across time due to seasonal changes in the predator assemblages and their preferences. However, this has rarely been studied especially in tropical regions. Here we assessed temporal changes in the defensive value of caterpillar color and shape, using six types of plasticine dummy caterpillars: three colors (green, black, and white) x two shapes (curled and straight). These dummy caterpillars were deployed five times over different seasons in tropical forests of Xishuangbanna (China) and, as a comparison, twice in a temperate forest of Hirosaki (Japan). The colors and shapes of dummy caterpillars simulate visual traits of black sawfly larvae which take the curled resting posture in tropical rainforests of Xishuangbanna, apparently masquerading excrements commonly found on plants, while in Hirosaki there is no black-curled sawfly larvae and few excrements on plants. We found no significant effects of caterpillar colors or shapes on predation in Hirosaki. In contrast, black and curled caterpillars received significantly lower predation by birds in Xishuangbanna constantly across time. However, we were unable to provide evidence that the black-curled sawfly larvae are masquerading as excrements. Shapes of the dummy caterpillars also affected the predation by ants and parasitoid wasps at certain times. This is the first report on ecological function of the curled posture of sawfly larvae, and we demonstrated the importance to assess the temporal dynamics of predation and effectiveness of defensive tactics in tropical forests.

TI  - Dogmatism manifests in lowered information search under uncertainty
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - When knowledge is scarce, it is adaptive to seek further information to resolve uncertainty and obtain a more accurate worldview. Biases in such information-seeking behavior can contribute to the maintenance of inaccurate views. Here, we investigate whether predispositions for uncertainty-guided information seeking relate to individual differences in dogmatism, a phenomenon linked to entrenched beliefs in political, scientific, and religious discourse. We addressed this question in a perceptual decision-making task, allowing us to rule out motivational factors and isolate the role of uncertainty. In two independent general population samples (n = 370 and n = 364), we show that more dogmatic participants are less likely to seek out new information to refine an initial perceptual decision, leading to a reduction in overall belief accuracy despite similar initial decision performance. Trial-by-trial modeling revealed that dogmatic participants placed less reliance on internal signals of uncertainty (confidence) to guide information search, rendering them less likely to seek additional information to update beliefs derived from weak or uncertain initial evidence. Together, our results highlight a cognitive mechanism that may contribute to the formation of dogmatic worldviews.

TI  - Immovable Object Meets Unstoppable Force? Dialogue Between Resident and Peripheral Myeloid Cells in the Inflamed Brain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Inflammation of the brain parenchyma is characteristic of neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and neuroinflammatory diseases. During this process, microglia, which populate the embryonic brain and become a permanent sentinel myeloid population, are inexorably joined by peripherally derived monocytes, recruited by the central nervous system. These cells can quickly adopt a morphology and immunophenotype similar to microglia. Both microglia and monocytes have been implicated in inducing, enhancing, and/or maintaining immune-mediated pathology and thus disease progression in a number of neuropathologies. For many years, experimental and analytical systems have failed to differentiate resident microglia from peripherally derived myeloid cells accurately. This has impeded our understanding of their precise functions in, and contributions to, these diseases, and hampered the development of novel treatments that could target specific cell subsets. Over the past decade, microglia have been investigated more intensively in the context of neuroimmunological research, fostering the development of more precise experimental systems. In light of our rapidly growing understanding of these cells, we discuss the differential origins of microglia and peripherally derived myeloid cells in the inflamed brain, with an analysis of the problems resolving these cell types phenotypically and morphologically, and highlight recent developments enabling more precise identification.

TI  - Evolution of events before and after the 17 June 2017 rock avalanche at Karrat Fjord, West Greenland - a multidisciplinary approach to detecting and locating unstable rock slopes in a remote Arctic area
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 17 June 2017 rock avalanche in the Karrat Fjord, West Greenland, caused a tsunami that flooded the nearby village of Nuugaatsiaq and killed four people. The disaster was entirely unexpected since no previous records of large rock slope failures were known in the region, and it highlighted the need for better knowledge of potentially hazardous rock slopes in remote Arctic regions.The aim of the paper is to explore our ability to detect and locate unstable rock slopes in remote Arctic regions with difficult access. We test this by examining the case of the 17 June 2017 Karrat rock avalanche. The workflow we apply is based on a multidisciplinary analysis of freely available data comprising seismological records, Sentinel-1 spaceborne synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, and Landsat and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery, ground-truthed with limited fieldwork. Using this workflow enables us to reconstruct a timeline of rock slope failures on the coastal slope here collectively termed the Karrat Landslide Complex.Our analyses show that at least three recent rock avalanches occurred in the Karrat Landslide Complex: Karrat 2009, Karrat 2016, and Karrat 2017. The latter is the source of the above-mentioned tsunami, whereas the first two are described here in detail for the first time. All three are interpreted as having initiated as dip-slope failures. In addition to the recent rock avalanches, older rock avalanche deposits are observed, demonstrating older (Holocene) periods of activity. Furthermore, three larger unstable rock slopes that may pose a future hazard are described. A number of non-tectonic seismic events confined to the area are interpreted as recording rock slope failures. The structural setting of the Karrat Landslide Complex, namely dip slope, is probably the main conditioning factor for the past and present activity, and, based on the temporal distribution of events in the area, we speculate that the possible trigger for rock slope failures is permafrost degradation caused by climate warming.The results of the present work highlight the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach, based on freely available data, to studying unstable rock slopes in remote Arctic areas under difficult logistical field conditions and demonstrate the importance of identifying minor precursor events to identify areas of future hazard.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics-Based Signature to Predict Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis and Disease-Free Survival in Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) status, typically estimated using an invasive procedure with a high false-negative rate, strongly affects the prognosis of recurrence in breast cancer. However, preoperative noninvasive tools to accurately predict ALNM status and disease-free survival (DFS) are lacking. Objective To develop and validate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) radiomic signatures for preoperative identification of ALNM and to assess individual DFS in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective prognostic study included patients with histologically confirmed early-stage breast cancer diagnosed at 4 hospitals in China from July 3, 2007, to September 21, 2019, randomly divided (7:3) into development and vaidation cohorts. All patients underwent preoperative MRI scans, were treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy or ALN dissection, and were pathologically examined to determine the ALNM status. Data analysis was conducted from February 15, 2019, to March 20, 2020. Exposure Clinical and DCE-MRI radiomic signatures. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end points were ALNM and DFS. Results This study included 1214 women (median [IQR] age, 47 [42-55] years), split into development (849 [69.9%]) and validation (365 [30.1%]) cohorts. The radiomic signature identified ALNM in the development and validation cohorts with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.88 and 0.85, respectively, and the clinical-radiomic nomogram accurately predicted ALNM in the development and validation cohorts (AUC, 0.92 and 0.90, respectively) based on a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-logistic regression model. The radiomic signature predicted 3-year DFS in the development and validation cohorts (AUC, 0.81 and 0.73, respectively), and the clinical-radiomic nomogram could discriminate high-risk from low-risk patients in the development cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.11; P < .001) and the validation cohort (HR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.004-0.32; P < .001) based on a random forest-Cox regression model. The clinical-radiomic nomogram was associated with 3-year DFS in the development and validation cohorts (AUC, 0.89 and 0.90, respectively). The decision curve analysis demonstrated that the clinical-radiomic nomogram displayed better clinical predictive usefulness than the clinical or radiomic signature alone. Conclusions and Relevance This study described the application of MRI-based machine learning in patients with breast cancer, presenting novel individualized clinical decision nomograms that could be used to predict ALNM status and DFS. The clinical-radiomic nomograms were useful in clinical decision-making associated with personalized selection of surgical interventions and therapeutic regimens for patients with early-stage breast cancer.Question Can multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic profiles be used to predict axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with early-stage breast cancer? Findings In this prognostic study that included 1214 patients, 2 clinical-radiomic nomograms were developed that accurately predicted ALNM and stratified patients into low-risk and high-risk groups for DFS. Meaning In this study, clinical-radiomic nomograms were useful in clinical decision-making associated with personalized selection of surgical interventions and therapeutic regimens for patients with early-stage breast cancer.This prognostic study develops and validates dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) radiomic signatures for preoperative identification of axillary lymph node metastasis and to assess individual disease-free survival in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Detecting turbulent structures on single Doppler lidar large datasets: an automated classification method for horizontal scans
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium-to-large fluctuations and coherent structures (mlf-cs's) can be observed using horizontal scans from single Doppler lidar or radar systems. Despite the ability to detect the structures visually on the images, this method would be time-consuming on large datasets, thus limiting the possibilities to perform studies of the structures properties over more than a few days. In order to overcome this problem, an automated classification method was developed, based on the observations recorded by a scanning Doppler lidar (Leosphere WLS100) installed atop a 75 m tower in Paris's city centre (France) during a 2-month campaign (September-October 2014). The mlf-cs's of the radial wind speed are estimated using the velocity-azimuth display method over 4577 quasi-horizontal scans. Three structure types were identified by visual examination of the wind fields: unaligned thermals, rolls and streaks. A learning ensemble of 150 mlf-cs patterns was classified manually relying on in situ and satellite data. The differences between the three types of structures were highlighted by enhancing the contrast of the images and computing four texture parameters (correlation, contrast, homogeneity and energy) that were provided to the supervised machine-learning algorithm, namely the quadratic discriminant analysis. The algorithm was able to classify successfully about 91 % of the cases based solely on the texture analysis parameters. The algorithm performed best for the streak structures with a classification error equivalent to 3.3 %. The trained algorithm applied to the whole scan ensemble detected structures on 54 % of the scans, among which 34 % were coherent structures (rolls and streaks).

TI  - Feeding Practices, Lines, and Hospital-Acquired Infection during the Sustenance Phase of Infection Control Quality Improvement
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Nosocomial infections are a significant threat to the survival and neurodevelopment of neonates .The present study attempts to correlate enteral feeding practices as measured by nil per oral (NPO days) with bloodstream infection (BSI) rates and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) over a period of 2 years and 3 months. Methods This was a prospective observational study done in a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Data were recorded on the presence of central lines or peripheral intravenous (IV) lines, receipt of intravenous fluids (IVF), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or IV antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation status. BSI and CLABSI, regarded as sentinel events, were recorded and root cause analysis done.Results A total of 3,448 infants constituting 17,846 patient days with mean gestational age and birth weight of 34.33 weeks and 1,868 +/- 434g, respectively were studied. NPO per 1,000 days shows a significant positive correlation with BSI (rho=0.513; p =0.004), CLABSI (rho = 0.425; p =0.021), antibiotic days (rho = 0.7; p <0.000), IV fluid days (rho = 0.459; p =0.014), and central line days (rho = 0.634; p <0.001). The IV fluid days showed correlation with BSI (rho =0.4, p <= 0.03) and CLABSI (rho =0.43, p =0.02).Conclusion BSI in NICU correlates with higher NPO and IV fluid days. Strengthening of enteral feeding practices reduces health care-associated infections.

TI  - Adaptive Attention with Consumer Sentinel for Movie Box Office Prediction
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the movie box office prediction accuracy, this paper proposes an adaptive attention with consumer sentinel (LSTM-AACS) for movie box office prediction. First, the influencing factors of the movie box office are analyzed. Tackling the problem of ignoring consumer groups in existing prediction models, we add consumer features and then quantitatively analyze and normalize the box office influence factors. Second, we establish an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) box office prediction model and inject the attention mechanism to construct an adaptive attention with consumer sentinel for movie box office prediction. Finally, 10,398 pieces of movie box office dataset are used in the Kaggle competition to compare the prediction results with the LSTM-AACS model, LSTM-Attention model, and LSTM model. The results show that the relative error of LSTM-AACS prediction is 6.58%, which is lower than other models used in the experiment.

TI  - Satellite-based regional-scale evapotranspiration estimation mapping of the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu: A little water to spare*
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved regular and rapid monitoring techniques are needed to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) precisely on agricultural fields to enhance the efficient usage of water resources and protect water quality and the environment. This study proposes estimating and mapping ET using a vegetation index coupled with a crop coefficient estimation method over the famous rice bowl region of Tamil Nadu, India. The study utilized a very high-resolution satellite-Sentinel-of resolution 10 m. The study is based on a crop coefficient-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based ET estimation, which is one of the most adaptable practical approaches in quantifying crop water usage in multiple phases of crop growth on a regional scale. The results have been further calibrated using the surface energy-based Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model to assess estimation correctness. The estimations analysed for the 2016-2019 kharif cropping season show good overall correlation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of >= 0.72, with mean bias error (MBE) of <= 0.0009 mm day(-1) and root mean square error (RMSE) of <= 0.67 mm day(-1), indicating a positive assessment of ET for the delta region of Tamil Nadu for reaching vindicable intendance of crop water in this region.

TI  - Temporary spontaneous regression of male breast cancer: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSpontaneous regression (SR) of a malignant tumor is the partial or complete disappearance of primary or metastatic tumor tissue in the absence of treatment, which can be temporary or permanent. Here, we report an extremely rare case of male breast cancer that exhibited temporary SR followed by reappearance 8 months after tumor disappearance.Case presentationA 70-year-old man presented at our hospital with a primary complaint of pain and a lump in his left breast. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic lesion measuring 12 mmx10 mmx8 mm. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed numerous necrotic and degenerated cells and few sheet-like clusters of atypical ductal epithelial cells. The atypical cells had mildly enlarged nuclei with nucleoli, were focally overlapped and formed tubular patterns. The cytological diagnosis indicated a suspicion of malignancy. Core needle biopsy (CNB) revealed necrotic and degenerated cells with microcalcification. The pathological diagnosis was indeterminate because there was no area of viable atypical cells. An excisional biopsy of the left breast lesion was scheduled one month later. However, it was difficult to detect the tumor during physical examination and ultrasonography performed 1 month after the patient's first visit. The operation was canceled, and the patient received follow-up observation. After 8 months of follow-up, ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) revealed reappearance of a 0.6-cm-diameter breast tumor in the same place. CNB was performed again and revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. A total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed 13 months after the first tumor disappeared. Histopathological examination revealed invasive cribriform carcinoma without sentinel lymph node metastasis. The patient did not have any complications, and adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen was started. The patient was alive without recurrence 7 months after surgery.ConclusionsTemporary SR followed by tumor reappearance can occur in breast cancer cases, and it is important to follow patients even if their breast tumor has seemingly disappeared. When breast tumors disappear without treatment, clinicians must be aware of the possibility of SR of cancer and should follow the patient for early detection of tumor reappearance.

TI  - TanDEM-X multiparametric data features in sea ice classification over the Baltic sea
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assess the potential of X-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery for automated classification of sea ice over the Baltic Sea. A bistatic SAR scene acquired by the TanDEM-X mission over the Bothnian Bay in March of 2012 was used in the analysis. Backscatter intensity, interferometric coherence magnitude, and interferometric phase have been used as informative features in several classification experiments. Various combinations of classification features were evaluated using Maximum likelihood (ML), Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to achieve the best possible discrimination between open water and several sea ice types (undeformed ice, ridged ice, moderately deformed ice, brash ice, thick level ice, and new ice). Adding interferometric phase and coherence-magnitude to backscatter-intensity resulted in improved overall classification performance compared to using only backscatter-intensity. The RF algorithm appeared to be slightly superior to SVM and ML due to higher overall accuracies, however, at the expense of somewhat longer processing time. The best overall accuracy (OA) for three methodologies were achieved using combination of all tested features were 71.56, 72.93, and 72.91% for ML, RF and SVM classifiers, respectively. Compared to OAs of 62.28, 66.51, and 63.05% using only backscatter intensity, this indicates strong benefit of SAR interferometry in discriminating different types of sea ice. In contrast to several earlier studies, we were particularly able to successfully discriminate open water and new ice classes.

TI  - Regional trends in snowmelt timing for the western United States throughout the MODIS era
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt controls important physical and ecological processes and is widely expected to occur earlier under most climate change scenarios. The western United States (US) is dependent on seasonal snowpack for water resources and recreation, and this diverse landscape is likely to experience continued changes to snowmelt timing that will differ across the domain. In this study, we use NASA's cloud gap-filled snow-cover maps (MOD10A1F and MYD10A1F) to detect trends in snowmelt timing for hydrologic years 2001-2018. We find that 7.04% of the snow zone (i.e., areas with 10+ years of snow throughout the study period) of the western US is experiencing statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) trends of earlier snowmelt, while 2.62% of the snow zone is experiencing significant trends of later snowmelt. Analyses at the ecoregion level reveal regional trends, with many southwestern ecoregions experiencing large areas of dramatically earlier snowmelt (e.g., 19.84% of the Mojave Basin and Range). Interestingly, the North Cascades and the Northern Rockies ecoregions have substantial areas of later snowmelt (5.45% and 4.99%, respectively). Our work builds upon previous estimates of snowmelt timing to identify an overall trend of earlier snowmelt while highlighting the high spatial variability in snowmelt trends throughout the western US.

TI  - Linkage mapping and QTL analysis of flowering time using ddRAD sequencing with genotype error correction in <i>Brassica napus</i>
T2  - BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBrassica napus is an important oilseed crop cultivated worldwide. During domestication and breeding of B. napus, flowering time has been a target of selection because of its substantial impact on yield. Here we use double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) to investigate the genetic basis of flowering in B. napus. An F-2 mapping population was derived from a cross between an early-flowering spring type and a late-flowering winter type.ResultsFlowering time in the mapping population differed by up to 25days between individuals. High genotype error rates persisted after initial quality controls, as suggested by a genotype discordance of similar to 12% between biological sequencing replicates. After genotype error correction, a linkage map spanning 3981.31cM and compromising 14,630 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was constructed. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome C2 was detected, covering eight flowering time genes including FLC.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the ddRAD approach to sample the B. napus genome. Our results also suggest that ddRAD genotype error rates can be higher than expected in F-2 populations. Quality filtering and genotype correction and imputation can substantially reduce these error rates and allow effective linkage mapping and QTL analysis.

TI  - Culture of death in Mexico: Psychoanalytic inquiry about mourning rites and the symbolic function of society
T2  - CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mexico stands out for its unique rites of symbolization of death. Being historically determined by the richness of its pre-Hispanic cultures, and with the fusion of catholic and Mesoamerican rites, Mexicans' relationship with death is unique. Mourning rites are imbued with a circular worldview of life and death. Some of the basic psychoanalytic components of mourning are present in Mexican mourning rites: symbolic function, cathartic affects, identification, and socialization of signifiers. Nowadays, the massive deaths as a result of violence imposes the encryption of mourning as a perverse demand. The lack of response to the cries for help render useless the symbolic functions of mourning rites, which brings about a new way of socializing the loss, through massive social movements. We inquire, through a psychoanalytic reading of mourning and its socio-historical aspects in Mexico, and by emphasizing the traditions of mourning and its multiple symbolic values, the different ways Mexicans deal with death, in order shed some light into Mexicans' symbolic responses and relationship with death while facing the perverse challenge of a violent regime.

AB  - The imaging instruments on the polar-orbiting S-NPP and NOAA-20 satellite platforms [e.g., Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)] and on geostationary GOES and Himawari platforms [e.g., Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)] have high horizontal spatial resolution but coarse vertical information about tropospheric gases and temperatures. An approach for fusing a high spatial resolution imager (e.g., VIIRS, ABI, and AHI) and a high information content sounder or trace gas monitor [e.g., Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)] offers the opportunity to construct retrieval products (e.g., trace gas concentrations of CO, SO2, and NH3) via product fusion at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, these products can also be provided at high temporal resolution when geostationary imager (ABI and AHI) data are used in the product fusion. Promising results from VIIRS/CrIS, VIIRS/TROPOMI, and AHI/TROPOMI fusion are presented. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.

TI  - The Effects of Modified Lymphoscintigraphy Techniques on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Success During the COVID-19 Pandemic Period
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectiveSampling of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in breast cancer provides accurate information about the condition of the axilla in 95% of cases. Technically in detecting SLN; radioactive substance, dyers or both are used. During the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, delayed images were not taken in lymphoscintigraphy to reduce the risk of transmission by shortening the waiting time in our center. In this study, the effects of early and delayed lymphoscintigraphic images and only early images on our clinical practice were evaluated.MethodsWe investigated the data of 147 patients in this study who underwent SLNB due to early-stage breast cancer at our institute during the COVID-19 pandemic period (PP) (March/April/May 2020) and within 3 months before the pandemic were evaluated.ResultsPatients were divided into two groups, before pandemic (BP) and PP. BP consisted of patients whose early and delayed images were taken in lymphoscintigraphy whereas PP consisted of those with early images only. There were 74 patients in the BP group and 73 patients in the PP group. Early phase increased uptake was not observed in 23 patients, and increased uptake was obtained from 22 of these patients with delayed imaging in BP period. In PP, increased uptake was not observed in 12 patients. SLN was not detected in 2 patients in the BP group and 7 in the PP group. It was found that the sensitivity, NPV and accuracy of the SLNB procedure performed after taking delayed images was higher.ConclusionsIn the present study, we believe that if technically possible, delayed images taken during the lymphoscintigraphy can assist the surgeon in terms of SLN detection and the number of SLNs removed.

TI  - Capsular Polysaccharide From <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> Protects Against Ulcerative Colitis in an Undegraded Form
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prominent human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis protects animals from intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, and its capsular polysaccharide plays a key role in reducing inflammation. B. fragilis strain ZY-312 was isolated from the feces of a healthy breast-fed infant, and the zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide zwitterionic polysaccharide, TP2, was extracted. In rats with 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced enteritis, TP2 at an optimal dose of 2.5 mg/kg could significantly alleviate enteritis and reduced the degree of intestinal adhesions, the intestinal ulcer area, and the incidence of ulcers in rats. To understand the underlying mechanism, TP2 was labeled with Fluorescein isothiocyanate and orally administered at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg in rats. TP2 was mainly distributed in the cecum and colorectum, but it was not detected in the blood and other organs except that a compound with a molecular weight greater than that of TP2-FITC was found in liver tissue. During the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, TP2 was indigestible. These results were further confirmed by investigation in the simulated gastric, intestinal fluid, and colonic fluid with fecal microbiota in vitro, where TP2 remained unaltered at different time points. Furthermore, flora composition was analyzed in simulated colonic fluid with TP2 added and it was found that TP2 increased the abundance of Faecalibacterium, Enterococcus romboutsia, and Ruminococcaceae, whereas the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria represented by Sutterella, Desulfovibrio, and Enterobacteriaceae was decreased. However, the amount of short-chain fatty acids in the simulated colonic fluid was not changed by intestinal flora post-TP2 addition. In conclusion, these findings confirmed that TP2, a capsular polysaccharide of B. fragilis, protects against ulcerative colitis in an undegraded form.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton provides important information on the health and richness of a marine ecosystem. In the Mediterranean Sea, significant phytoplankton variability has been observed between the western and eastern basins and between open ocean and coastal waters. In this study, we used eleven years' (2003-2013) MERIS and MODIS sea surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) data to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton in the Algerian shelf and slope waters (ASW), in the southwestern part of the Mediterranean Sea. We assessed the inter-annual and seasonal variability of phytoplankton biomass, retrieved thirteen pixel-based phenology metrics using TIMESAT algorithms, and determined the influence of precipitation on phytoplankton dynamics. Our results reveal differences between the western and eastern parts of ASW. In the eastern part of the coast, the production season starts one month later than in the western region. It also peaks about 15 days earlier and ends one month earlier as compared to the west. As a result, the productive season is shorter in the east than in the west. The area between Be ' jaia and Skikda stands out, with the highest Chla values and the highest variability. These findings show that the phytoplankton dynamics varies also at the scale of ASW in timing and magnitude, which is complementary with studies previously conducted at the Mediterranean Sea scale. Correlation analysis shows that rainfall influences phytoplankton biomass and some phenology metrics' variability. However, other physical and biogeochemical variables should be investigated for a more complete understanding of the plankton dynamics and to assess the impact of this variability on species abundance and diversity.

TI  - Geoenvironmental assessment of the mut wastewater ponds in the Dakhla Oasis, Egypt
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Disposal and accumulation of agricultural and sanitary wastewater in poorly engineered ponds in the Mut region, Dakhla Oasis of Egypt is a concern due to their poor water quality; significant expansion over a large spatial area, and their consequential impact on the environment. GIS and remote sensing were useful tools for determining spatiotemporal and the impact of wastewater ponds and land use/cover. The objective of this study is to map wastewater ponds and land use/cover changes over the period of 1984 to 2019. For this purpose, multi-temporal Landsat chronological images were used to assess the spatiotemporal activities. The findings indicated that the total area of wastewater bodies were about 1.79 km(2) in 1984, 3.92 km(2) in 2000, and 7.91 km(2) in 2019. This progressive spatial growth is a response to irresponsible usage of groundwater. Several environmental impacts were noticed, including depletion of the groundwater table, and soil salinization is one aspect of land degradation process. Finally, this study proposes implementation of a strict groundwater resource conservation act, preventing uncontrolled irrigation flooding and suggesting suitable low water consumption agricultural crops.

TI  - Estimating volume of deep-seated landslides and mass transport in Basihlan river basin, Taiwan
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep-seated landslides are often caused by severe rainfall, but the displaced potential landslide mass often does not slide downslope entirely in one time. Evaluation of the mobilized volume of the deep-seated landslide and the volume of the remaining potentially unstable landslide mass on the slope is vital for hazard mitigation. In this study, an integrated method was developed for evaluation of the potential landslide volume and mass transport of deep-seated landslides caused by Typhoon Morakot in Basihlan River Basin, Taiwan. A combination of various types of remote-sensing data, including aerial photographs, satellite images, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, from before and after the event were used for locating landslides, and the deep-seated landslides were identified in the Basihlan River Basin, Liuoguey District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. A stability analysis and a profile analysis were conducted to determine the critical sliding surface of each deep-seated landslide, and the volumes (masses) of the landslides were estimated. The total volume of all the deep-seated landslides was approximately 6,017,000 m(3) in the Basihlan River Basin. A topographic analysis was performed to evaluate the mass transport of the deep-seated landslides using LiDAR-derived digital terrain models (DTMs) before and after Typhoon Morakot. The mass transport of deep-seated landslides in the Basihlan River Basin was determined to be approximately 3,527,300 m(3), which suggested the volume of the remaining potentially unstable landslide mass on slope of approximately 41.4%. The available field data suggested subsequent reactivations of the deep-seated landslides after Typhoon Morakot, including debris flow generation, which damaged the infrastructure. Thus, a large landslide volume remaining in the Basihlan River Basin can cause more landslides or debris flow hazards in the future. Estimation of the potential landslide volume and mass volume remaining on slopes is essential for both short- and long-term mitigation strategies.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes of Australian dermatologists towards sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma: a mixed methods study
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objectives: In melanoma management, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is used to stage patients and to indicate prognosis. More recently, it has been used to select patients for adjuvant therapy. This study aimed to report knowledge of and attitudes towards SLNB for patients with melanoma among Australian dermatologists.Methods: Mixed methods study using cross-sectional questionnaires (n = 88) and semi-structured interviews (n = 13), May-September 2019.Results: Of the dermatologists surveyed, 56% thought SLNB had an important role in melanoma management, 26% were unsure and 18% thought SLNB unimportant. Of the 92% who would discuss SLNB with their patients, the main stated value of SLNB was for assessing eligibility for adjuvant therapies (79%); only 60% indicated SLNB was of value for providing prognostic information, and just over half (53%) thought it could improve staging. Interview data indicated that attitudes towards SLNB are shifting among dermatologists, driven by data from landmark clinical trials and the influence of professional networks. Accordingly, interviewees adopted one of three positions in relation to SLNB: (a) believed in utility of SLNB and adhered to the guidelines; (b) were unconvinced about utility of SLNB but adhered to the guidelines; and (c) were unconvinced about utility of SLNB and did not adhere to the guidelines.Conclusion: Although most of the dermatologists surveyed were familiar with and follow the SLNB recommendations, some disagreement with and distrust of the recommendations was evident. Greater acceptance of the SLNB recommendations appeared to be driven by the improved outcomes demonstrated in stage III patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy.

TI  - Management of the axilla with sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer A single-center study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the gold standard initial treatment of the locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). However, the reliability of methods that used to assess response the NAC is still controversial. In this study, patients with LABC who underwent NAC were evaluated retrospectively. The assessment of response to NAC and the effect of axillary approach were investigated on LABC course. The study comprised 94 patients who received NAC with an LABC diagnosis between 2008 and 2020. In our center, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and (18) F-flouro deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and, for some patients, fine-needle aspiration biopsy of suspicious axillary lymph nodes have been performed to assess the effects of NAC. Patients with positive hormone receptor status received adjuvant hormonotherapy, and those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene expression were treated with trastuzumab. Adjuvant radiotherapy was applied to all patients undergoing breast conserving surgery. Radiotherapy was applied to the peripheral lymphatic areas in the clinical N1 to N3 cases regardless of the response to NAC. The clinical response to the NAC was found that partial in 59% and complete in 19% of the patients. However, 21.2% of the patients were unresponsive. The mean of lymph nodes that excised with the procedure of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was 2.4 (range 1-7). In 22 of the 56 patients who underwent SLNB, axillary dissection (AD) was added to the procedure upon detection of metastasis in frozen section examinations. There was no difference between the SLNB and AD groups regarding overall survival (OS; P = .472) or disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P = .439). However, there were differences in the OS (P < .05) and DFS (P = .05) rates on the basis of the LABC histopathological subtypes. The study found that a relationship between molecular subtypes and LABC survival. However, the post-NAC axillary approach had no effect on OS or DFS. Therefore, multiple imaging and interventional methods are needed for the evaluation of NAC response. In addition, morbidity can be avoided after AD by the use of SLNB in cN0 patients.

TI  - Documentation of Atlantic tarpon (<i>Megalops atlanticus</i>) space use and move persistence in the northern Gulf of Mexico facilitated by angler advocates
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus, hereafter tarpon) are facing a multitude of stressors and are considered Vulnerable by the IUCN; however, significant gaps remain in our understanding of tarpon space use and movement. From 2018 to 2019, citizen scientists facilitated tagging of 23 tarpon with SPOT tags to examine space use and movement across the northern Gulf of Mexico. Movement-based kernel densities were used to estimate simplified biased random bridge-based utilization distributions and a joint move persistence model was used to estimate a behavioral index for each fish. Tarpon showed consistent east-west movement from the Alabama/Florida border to Louisiana, and utilization distributions were highest in the Mississippi River Delta. Move persistence was highest in Alabama and Mississippi and lowest in Louisiana. Our examination of tarpon space use and movement indicates that Louisiana is a critical, yet understudied, part of their range.

TI  - Remote sensing in support for monitoring rice in the Senegal catchment
T2  - HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU
M3  - Article
AB  - Senegal River catchment represents a vital source for its four riparian countries Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, which cooperate within the interstate agency OMVS (Senegal River Basin Development Authority). The key issue of integrated water resources management addressed major challenges, especially with climate change. Satellite imagery represents thus a relevant and inexpensive source of data for observing land use changes at large scale and thus provides management support. In this context, MOSIS project (Monitoring of Observations from Satellites for Innovative Services) arose based on a "Living Lab" approach between SOGED, CACG and E2L. Based on the needs of end-users, an operational tool was co-designed in a single year to localise and quantify rice producing areas using Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and Web resources. The purpose of the created WebGIS was to improve the recovery rate of the irrigation fee. Many added values have emerged when used in the field: improved identification of water users and land management, an access to water use history, performance of field agents and improved communication with users and other partners. As a first step, the Senegal River Delta alone was investigated where 80% of irrigated surfaces are. Next steps are (1) the functional improvement of the WebGIS and the satellite image processing, (2) capacity building of SOGED, (3) regulatory certification of the tool and (4) extension of the study zone to the catchment area. The created Geo-Web service also aroused a great deal of interest among different partners and state structures. It enabled to bring out several ideas of other potential services that would rely on WEB resources and remote sensing in order to estimate spatialised, reliable and permanent management indicators on the Senegal catchment.

TI  - MODIS aerosol optical depth retrieval based on random forest approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite significant improvement in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval, high-resolution-high-accuracy AOD retrieval remains a challenging task. This study utilises machine learning for AOD retrieval of MODIS data. The global long-time-series data of AERONET sites and corresponding MODIS data in time and space were used as sample training data for aerosol retrieval via use of the random forest (RF) approach. The accuracy and stability of retrieval were ensured by processing AERONET site data, performing time-space matching between different data types, and determining related parameters in the RF model. MODIS data use bands 1-7 of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOA) - extending from the visible to near-infrared radiation spectra - along with the corresponding observation geometry data, global land surface satellite (GLASS) albedo dataset, and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The proposed method facilitates realisation of high-accuracy aerosol retrieval. Furthermore, significant enhancement in the efficiency of aerosol inversion is an added advantage.

TI  - Constraining the Twomey effect from satellite observations: issues and perspectives
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Twomey effect describes the radiative forcing associated with a change in cloud albedo due to an increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. It is driven by the perturbation in cloud droplet number concentration (Delta N-d, (ant)) in liquid-water clouds and is currently understood to exert a cooling effect on climate. The Twomey effect is the key driver in the effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions, but rapid adjustments also contribute. These adjustments are essentially the responses of cloud fraction and liquid water path to Delta N-d, (ant) ant and thus scale approximately with it. While the fundamental physics of the influence of added aerosol particles on the droplet concentration (N-d) is well described by established theory at the particle scale (micrometres), how this relationship is expressed at the large-scale (hundreds of kilometres) perturbation, Delta N-d, (ant), remains uncertain. The discrepancy between process under-standing at particle scale and insufficient quantification at the climate-relevant large scale is caused by co-variability of aerosol particles and updraught velocity and by droplet sink processes. These operate at scales on the order of tens of metres at which only localised observations are available and at which no approach yet exists to quantify the anthropogenic perturbation. Different atmospheric models suggest diverse magnitudes of the Twomey effect even when applying the same anthropogenic aerosol emission perturbation. Thus, observational data are needed to quantify and constrain the Twomey effect. At the global scale, this means satellite data. There are four key uncertainties in determining Delta N-d, (ant) namely the quantification of (i) the cloud-active aerosol - the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations at or above cloud base, (ii) N-d, (iii) the statistical approach for inferring the sensitivity of N-d to aerosol particles from the satellite data and (iv) uncertainty in the anthropogenic perturbation to CCN concentrations, which is not easily accessible from observational data. This review discusses deficiencies of current approaches for the different aspects of the problem and proposes several ways forward: in terms of CCN, retrievals of optical quantities such as aerosol optical depth suffer from a lack of vertical resolution, size and hygroscopicity information, non-direct relation to the concentration of aerosols, difficulty to quantify it within or below clouds, and the problem of insufficient sensitivity at low concentrations, in addition to retrieval errors. A future path forward can include utilising co-located polarimeter and lidar instruments, ideally including high-spectral-resolution lidar capability at two wavelengths to maximise vertically resolved size distribution information content. In terms of N-d, a key problem is the lack of operational retrievals of this quantity and the inaccuracy of the retrieval especially in broken-cloud regimes. As for the N-d-to-CCN sensitivity, key issues are the updraught distributions and the role of N-d sink processes, for which empirical assessments for specific cloud regimes are currently the best solutions. These considerations point to the conclusion that past studies using existing approaches have likely underestimated the true sensitivity and, thus, the radiative forcing due to the Twomey effect.

TI  - Geological methane emissions and wildfire risk in the degraded permafrost area of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming, the carbon pool in the degradation zone of permafrost around the Arctic will gradually be disturbed and may enter the atmosphere in the form of released methane gas, becoming an important factor of environmental change in permafrost areas. We selected the northwestern section of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains in China as the study area, located in the degradation zone on the southern margin of the permafrost region in Eurasia, and set up multiple study monitoring areas equipped with methane concentration sensors, air temperature sensors, pore water pressure sensors and soil temperature sensors for long-term monitoring of data changes using the high-density electrical method, ground penetrating radar and on-site drilling to survey the distribution of frozen soil and geological conditions in the study area, combined with remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 L1C and unmanned aerial vehicle photographs and three-dimensional image reconstruction, analysis of fire activities and related geological environmental factors. The results show that since 2004, the permafrost thickness of the marsh wetland in the study area has gradually reduced and the degradation rate obviously accelerated; the organic matter and methane hydrate (metastable methane hydrate and stable methane hydrate) stored in the permafrost under the marsh wetland are gradually entering the atmosphere in the form of methane gas. Methane emissions show seasonal changes, and the annual methane emissions can be divided into three main stages, including a high-concentration short-term emission stage (March to May), a higher-concentration long-term stable emission stage (June to August) and a higher-concentration short-term emission stage (September to November); there is a certain correlation between the change in atmospheric methane concentration and the change in atmospheric pressure and pore water pressure. From March to May every year (high-concentration short-term emission stage), with snow melting, the air humidity reaches an annual low value, and the surface methane concentration reaches an annual high value. The high concentration of methane gas entering the surface in this stage is expected to increase the risk of wildfire in the permafrost degradation area in two ways (increasing the regional air temperature and self-combustion), which may be an important factor that leads to a seasonal wildfire frequency difference in the permafrost zone of Northeast China and Southeast Siberia, with the peak in spring and autumn and the monthly maximum in spring. The increase in the frequency of wildfires is projected to further generate positive feedback on climate change by affecting soil microorganisms and soil structure. Southeastern Siberia and northeastern China, which are on the southern boundary of the permafrost region of Eurasia, need to be targeted to establish fire warning and management mechanisms to effectively reduce the risk of wildfires.

TI  - OPTIMAL SELECTION OF VIRTUAL CONTROL POINTS WITH PLANAR CONSTRAINTS FOR LARGE-SCALE BLOCK ADJUSTMENT OF SATELLITE IMAGERY
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - In large-scale block adjustment of high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) without ground control points (GCPs), the selection of virtual control points (VCPs) is an important factor in determining the block adjustment accuracy. The traditional VCP generation method is based on a regular grid and uses the initial rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) files but without considering topographic factors. To further improve the accuracy, this paper proposes an approach for the optimal selection of VCPs with planar constraints, which ensures that the VCPs are mostly in areas with small elevation differences and are not influenced by vegetation and buildings. A three-step approach generates the 3D coordinates of tie points based on forward intersection, calculates their mean values and finally selects optimal VCPs using a threshold value. Experiments conducted using ZY3-01 satellite images show the accuracy of the proposed method without GCPs outperforms the existing method.

AB  - This study aims to explore the role of cooperative norms and discount factors in global deforestation. Previous studies have revealed that these preferences lead to the better management of common-pool resources. However, since these case studies focus on small geographical areas, external validity remains an important issue. By using high-resolution satellite data and a unified measure of cooperative norms and discount factors, this study demonstrates that higher levels of cooperative norms are associated with a lower level of deforestation across the world, whereas no significant association is found between discount factors and deforestation.

TI  - Analysis and Classification of Stormwater and Wastewater Runoff From the Tijuana River Using Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban runoff represents the primary cause of marine pollution in the Southern California coastal oceans. This study focuses on water quality issues originating from the Tijuana River watershed, which spans the southwest border of the United States and Mexico. Frequent discharge events into the coastal ocean at this boundary include stormwater and wastewater. This study focuses on differences in spectral features, as assessed by RapidEye, Sentinel-2 A/B, and Landsat-8 satellite data, along with physical and biological in situ data, to characterize and classify plumes into four key categories: stormwater, wastewater, open ocean/no plume, and mixed (when both types of plumes are present). Key spectral differences in the visible to NIR bands showed that stormwater had elevated reflectance (0.02 to 0.09), followed by mixed (0 to 0.08), wastewater (0 to 0.05), and open ocean/no plume (0 to 0.03) events. We also examined biophysical parameters and found that stormwater events had the highest values in remote sensing based estimates of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (0.98 to 2.1 m(-1)) and turbidity (12.4 to 45.7 FNU) and also had a large range for in situ variables of enterococcus bacteria and flow rates. This study also finds that the use of spectral features in a hierarchical cluster analysis can correctly classify stormwater from wastewater plumes when there is a dominant type. These results of this study will enable improved determination of the transport of both types of plumes and transboundary monitoring of coastal water quality across the Southern California/Baja California region.

TI  - Influence of urbanization on the avian species-area relationship: insights from the breeding birds of Rome
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the most investigated patterns in ecology and conservation biology, yet there is no study testing how different levels of urbanization influence its shape. Here we tested the impact of urbanization on avian SARs along a rural-urban gradient using the breeding birds of Rome (Central Italy). We divided the city into 360 cells of 1 km(2). Each cell was classified as rural, suburban or urban using the proportion of impervious surface calculated from remote sensing data. For each of these three landscape categories, we constructed a SAR as a species accumulation curve (Gleason function) using bird species distribution data. SAR intercepts (i.e. the number of species per unit area) decreased from rural to urban areas, which indicates that urbanization depressed the number of species, reflecting the loss of specialized species strictly associated with natural habitats. The slope was highest for the rural curve, indicating that natural landscapes have the highest turnover due to their higher habitat heterogeneity. A higher slope for the urban cells, compared to the suburban ones, can be explained by the presence of green spaces embedded in the built-up matrix which host different avian communities. Previous studies that compared whole cities with natural areas failed to find differences in the respective SARs. Our study, which constructed SARs for different levels of urbanization, indicated significant changes in the SARs along the rural-urban gradient. Further analyses in other cities and taxa will be useful to test how general are our findings.

TI  - More dynamic than expected: an updated survey of surging glaciers in the Pamir
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The investigation of surging glaciers using remote sensing has recently seen a strong increase as freely available satellite data and digital elevation models (DEMs) can provide detailed information about surges that often take place in remote and inaccessible regions. Apart from analysing individual surges, satellite information is increasingly used to collect valuable data on surging glaciers. Related inventories have recently been published for several regions in High Mountain Asia including the Karakoram or parts of the Pamir and western Kunlun Shan, but information for the entire Pamir is solely available from a historic database listing about 80 glaciers with confirmed surges. Here we present an updated inventory of confirmed glacier surges for the Pamir that considers results from earlier studies and is largely based on a systematic analysis of Landsat image time series (1988 to 2018), very high-resolution imagery (Corona, Hexagon, Bing Maps, Google Earth) and DEM differences. Actively surging glaciers (e.g. with advancing termini) were identified from animations and flicker images and the typical elevation change patterns (lowering in an upper reservoir zone and thickening further down in a receiving zone). In total, we identified 206 spatially distinct surges within 186 glacier bodies mostly clustered in the northern and western part of the Pamir. Where possible, minimum and maximum glacier extents were digitised, but often interacting tributaries made a clear separation challenging. Most surging glaciers (n = 70) are found in the larger size classes (> 10 km(2)), but two of them are very small (< 0.5 km(2)). We also found several surges where the length of the glacier increased by more than 100 %. The created datasets are available at: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.914150 (Goerlich et al., 2020).

TI  - Estimation of mean movement rates for blue sharks in the northwestern Pacific Ocean
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe blue shark Prionace glauca is a highly migratory species with a circumglobal distribution. Mean movement rate, defined by the horizontal tracking distance between two data points over the duration of time, is commonly used to understand the horizontal displacement of highly migratory species across a wide range. However, the estimation of mean movement rates for blue sharks has never been conducted using a statistical model. We therefore investigated the mean movement rates using a generalized linear mixed model with data from satellite tags to estimate the range of mean movement rates for 10 blue sharks in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and to reveal the interaction of mean movement rate with several factors.Results(1) Estimations of mean movement rates for the 10 blue sharks were significantly influenced by behavioral differences among individuals; (2) uncertainty in the estimation (i.e., predictive and confidence intervals) of mean movement rates for these blue sharks was larger over shorter time periods, and (3) the predictive intervals of mean movement rates for the sharks ranged widely from 0.33 to 5.02 km/h.ConclusionBlue sharks are considered to opportunistically change their mean movement rates regardless of differences in sex, movement direction, or season.

TI  - Method of urban land change detection that is based on GF-2 high-resolution RS images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the successful launch of China's high spatial resolution satellite Gaofen-2 (GF-2), the use of high spatial resolution satellite images for land change detection has high research potential. Based on the images from GF-2, this study combines principal component analysis and the spectral feature change method to identify different land changes in the form of different coloured patches. Then, three decision tree classification models are constructed to automatically detect the change, which includes information on the increase in the number of airports and buildings and increased or decreased vegetation. Further, through Quick Bird images for identical regions in the same periods, a sample of 2624 pixels is selected using a stratified random sampling method to verify the accuracy of the results indicating a change. The results show that the overall accuracy of the extracted information on land change was 98.21%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9604. Therefore, the method for land change detection and extraction of land change information used in this study is proven to be effective.

TI  - Effect of antimicrobial use and production system on <i>Campylobacter</i> spp., <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. and <i>Salmonella</i> spp. resistance in Spanish swine: A cross-sectional study
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide public health threat; hence, current trends tend to reduce antimicrobial use in food-producing animals and to monitor resistance in primary production. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of antimicrobial use and production system on swine farms in the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter, Salmonella and Staphylococcus, the main zoonotic pathogens in pig herds, in order to assess their potential value as sentinel microorganisms in antimicrobial resistance surveillance schemes. A total of 37 Spanish swine farms, 18 intensive and 19 organic/extensive farms, were included in the study. The antimicrobial resistance of 104 Campylobacter, 84 Staphylococcus and 17 Salmonella isolates was evaluated using Sensititre plates following the EUCAST guidelines. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to evaluate the influence of production system and antimicrobial use in resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes to the antimicrobials tested. The results showed that antimicrobial use was higher (p < .001) on intensive farms than on organic/extensive farms. MDR in Campylobacter and Staphylococcus was lower on organic/extensive farms (OR p < .001). Antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter and Staphylococcus isolates was, also for most of the antimicrobials studied, significantly higher in intensive than organic/extensive pig herds. Tetracycline resistance was associated with total antimicrobial consumption in both microbial species (p < .05), and some cross-associations between distinct antimicrobial substances were established, for instance resistance to erythromycin was associated with macrolide and phenicol consumption. No significant associations could be established for Salmonella isolates. The results demonstrate the link between antimicrobial consumption and resistance in zoonotic bacteria and evidence the potential value of using Campylobacter and Staphylococcus species in monitoring activities aimed at determining the impact of antimicrobials use/reduction on the occurrence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - ASTER mapping of gypsum deposits of Thumrait region of southern Oman
T2  - RESOURCE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the use of ASTER data for the mapping of gypsum deposits and associated geological formations that occurred in the Thumrait region of southern Oman. The measurement of spectra over samples of gypsum in the 1,300-2,500 nm wavelength using a PIMA spectrometer showed the presence of distinct absorptions at 1400-1600, 1750, 1940, 2,100, and 2,400 nm characteristics to O-H stretching, H2O combinations, and S-O bending overtones and stretching, respectively. Studying the unique spectral absorption characters of gypsum samples, we developed a false color composite (FCC) and an image by decorrelation stretch using the spectral bands 7, 3, and 2 of ASTER. The results FCC showed the regions of gypsum occurrences, and the decorrelated image discriminated the gypsum occurrences from other geological formations of the area. The study of surface mineralogy of the region using the VNIR-SWIR bands by the spectral angle mapper method showed the presence of sulfate, carbonate, and clay minerals of the geological formations in the study area. We compared the results of ASTER with the results obtained using spectral bands 12, 8, and 4 of Sentinel-2A processed by the same methods. The study showed that the spectral bands of ASTER can be used for mapping the gypsum and associated geological formations.

TI  - Excess forest mortality is consistently linked to drought across Europe
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pulses of tree mortality caused by drought have been reported recently in forests around the globe, but large-scale quantitative evidence is lacking for Europe. Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe. The relationship between water availability and mortality showed threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below -1.6 standard deviations of its long-term average. For -3.0 standard deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6% (83.8-97.5%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000ha of excess forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe.

TI  - Multiple Microinvasion Foci in Ductal Carcinoma <i>In Situ</i> Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Recurrence and Worse Survival Outcome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDuctal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM) was defined as one or more foci of invasion beyond the basement membrane within 1 mm. The size of primary lesion is associated with axillary status and prognosis in patients with invasive breast cancer; thus, it is of interest to determine whether multiple foci of microinvasion are associated with a higher risk of positive axillary status or worse long-term outcomes in patients with DCISM.MethodsThis study identified 359 patients with DCISM who had undergone axillary evaluation at our institute from January 2006 to December 2015. Patients were categorized as one focus or multiple foci (>= 2 foci) according to the pathological results. Clinicopathological features, axillary status, and disease-free survival rate were obtained and analyzed.ResultsOf 359 patients, 233 (64.90%) had one focus of microinvasion and 126 (35.10%) had multiple foci. Overall, 242 (67.41%) and 117 (32.59%) patients underwent sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND), respectively. Isolated tumor cells were found in four (1.11%) patients and axillary metastasis rate was 2.51%. Neither axillary evaluation methods (P = 0.244) nor axillary metastasis rate (P = 0.559) was significantly different between patients with one focus and multiple foci. In univariate analysis, patients with multiple foci tended to have larger tumor size (P < 0.001), higher nuclear grade (P = 0.001), and higher rate of lymphatic vascular invasion (P = 0.034). Also, the proportion of positive HER2 (P = 0.027) and Ki67 level (P = 0.004) increased in patients with multiple foci, while in multivariate analysis, only tumor size showed significant difference (P = 0.009). Patients with multiple foci were more likely to receive chemotherapy (56.35 vs 40.77%; P = 0.028). At median 5.11 years follow-up, overall survival rate was 99.36%. Patients with multiple microinvasive foci had worse disease-free survival rate compared with one-focus patients (98.29 vs 93.01%, P = 0.032).ConclusionEven though the numbers of microinvasion were different and patients with multiple foci of microinvasion tended to have larger tumor size, there was no higher risk of axillary involvement compared with patients with one focus of microinvasion, while patients with multiple microinvasive foci had worse DFS rate. Thus, DCISM patients with multiple foci of microinvasion may be the criterion for more aggressive local-regional treatment. Optimization of adjuvant therapy in DCISM patients is required.

TI  - Climatology and seasonal variability of satellite-derived chlorophyll <i>a</i> around the Shandong Peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll a (Chl a) is an important indicator of marine ecosystems. The spatiotemporal variation of the Chl a greatly affects the mariculture and marine ranching in coastal waters of the Shandong Peninsula. In the current study, the climatology and seasonal variability of surface Chl-a concentration around the Shandong Peninsula are investigated based on 16 years (December 2002-November 2018) of satellite observations. The results indicate that the annual mean Chl-a concentration is greater in the Bohai Sea than in the Yellow Sea and decreases from coastal waters to offshore waters. The highest Chl-a concentrations are found in Laizhou Bay (4.2-8.0 mg/m(3)), Haizhou Bay (4.2-5.9 mg/m(3)) and the northeast coast of the Shandong Peninsula (4.4-5.0 mg/m(3)), resulting from the combined effects of the intense riverine input and long residence time caused by the concave shape of the coastline. The seasonal Chl-a concentration shows a significant spatial variation. The Chl-a concentrations in these three subregions generally exhibit an annual maximum in August/September, due to the combined effects of sea surface temperature, river discharge and sea surface wind. In the southeast coast region, however, the Chl-a concentration is lowest throughout the year and reaches a maximum in February with a minimum in July, forced by the seasonal evolution of the Yellow Sea Cold Water and monsoon winds. The interannual Chl-a concentration trends vary among regions and seasons. There are significant increasing trends over a large area around Haizhou Bay from winter to summer, which are mainly caused by the rising sea surface temperature and eutrophication. In other coastal areas, the Chl-a concentration shows decreasing trends, which are clearest in summer and induced by the weakening land rainfall. This study highlights the differences in the Chl-a dynamics among regions around the Shandong Peninsula and is helpful for further studies of coupled physical-ecological-human interactions at multiple scales.

TI  - Redefining Criteria to Ensure Adequate Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy With Dual Tracer for Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFor sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer, the dual tracer of blue dye and radioisotope with the 10% rule that all nodes with radioactive count of 10% or more of the hottest node ex vivo should be removed is widely accepted. However, the cut-off point of radioactivity is being questioned for possibly excessive removal of negative nodes.MethodsTo compare different percentile rules and optimize the criteria for identifying SLNs, we established a database which prospectively collected the radioactivity, status of blue dye and the pathological results of each SLN in breast cancer patients who successfully underwent SLNB with a combination of methylene blue and radioisotope.ResultsA total of 2,529 SLNs from 1,039 patients were identified from August 2010 to August 2019. 16.4% (414/2,529) positive nodes were removed at a cost of 83.6% (2115/2,529) negative nodes removed excessively. Up to 17.9% (375/2,115) negative nodes were removed as radioactively hot nodes without blue staining. By gradually increasing the threshold by each 10%, the number of negative nodes identified reduced by 18.2% (385/2,115) with only three node-positive patients (1.0%) missed to be identified using the "40% + blue" rule. In patients with >= 2 SLNs removed, 12.3% (238/1,942) negative nodes avoided unnecessary removal with only 0.8% (2/239) positive patients missed with the "hottest two + blue" rule.ConclusionsOur data indicated that the "40% + blue" rule or the "hottest two + blue" rule for SLNB with the dual tracer of blue dye and radioisotope may be considered as a potential alternative rule to minimize extra nodes resected. Nonetheless, it should be validated by prospective trials with long-term follow-up.

TI  - Comparison of pixel- and object-based image analysis for tea plantation mapping using hyperspectral Gaofen-5 and synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping tea plantation distribution is crucial to environmental protection and sustainable development. Hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have recently been widely used in land cover classification, but their ability to extract tea plantation regions still needs to be confirmed. Compared with traditional pixel-based image analysis (PBIA), object-based image analysis (OBIA) for tea plantation mapping is more worthy of implementation. This study explored the performance of Gaofen-5 (GF-5) and copolarized SAR data for tea plantation mapping using pixel- and object-based support vector machine algorithms in Wuyishan, China. Comparison of PBIA and OBIA demonstrated the significant differences in visual effect and classification accuracy. The object-based classifications especially offered a more contiguous depiction with fewer speckles of tea plantations than pixel-based classifications did. Moreover, object-based classifications improved overall accuracy (OA) between 1.7% and 7.9% in all scenarios when compared to pixel-based classifications. As for datasets, classifications using only GF-5 data obtained an OA of over 85%, while fusing images decreased classification accuracy due to the lower separability between tea and forest, showcasing that the fusion of hyperspectral and SAR data does not guarantee the improvement of classification accuracy. The integration of GF-5, horizontal transmit and horizontal receive (HH), and vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarized data outperformed other data combinations in both pixel- and object-based classifications and achieved the highest OA (95.58%) in OBIA, with a 98.13% producer accuracy and 93.34% user accuracy of tea plantations. The results indicated OBIA could overcome the shortcomings of the PBIA and effectively improve the mapping accuracy of tea plantation, and OBIA integrating GF-5, HH, and VV polarized data could play a distinguished role in tea plantation mapping. This work provides a promising approach for mapping tea plantations and demonstrates that the integration of GF-5 and copolarized data can improve spectral separability of vegetation, which is also significant for general forest mappings.

TI  - MicroRNA-1291 Is Associated With Locoregional Metastases in Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the various steps of metastasis is increasing. Several studies have looked at the miRNA expression profile in primary breast tumors but few have compared primary tumor and sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. We correlated the expression of miRNAs with the SLN status and the outcome of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in 60 patients with early breast cancer. We profiled the expression of miRNAs in paired breast tumor samples and SLNs using the NextSeq500 Illumina platform and key findings were validated by qPCR. MultiMiR Bioconductor and Reactome pathways analysis were performed to identify target genes and signaling pathways affected by altered expressed miRNAs. Our results show that nine miRNAs were differentially expressed in tumor tissues (q <= 0.05). In tumor samples, a 13.5-fold up-regulation of miR-7641-2 (q < 0.001) and a 2.9-fold down-regulation of miR-1291 (q < 0.001) were associated with tumors with positive SLNs. However, only down-regulation of miR-1291 (q = 0.048) remained significant in paired SLNs samples. Interestingly, a 10.5 up-regulation of miR-1291 in SLNs samples was associated with additional axillary lymph node involvement (q < 0.001). The enrichment analyses showed that canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways and negative regulation of various receptor tyrosine kinases signaling pathways were targets of miR-1291 and supports the role of miR-1291 as a tumor suppressor gene (TSG). Further studies are warranted to investigate the use of miR-1291 as a surrogate biomarker of SLN node metastasis in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Locoregional relapse is a strong prognostic indicator of distant metastatic progression in breast cancer patients after negative sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node biopsy is routinely used in breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. Locoregional relapses after negative sentinel lymph node biopsy are infrequent, occurring in up to 3% of patients.Methods Six thousand and eight patients underwent breast cancer surgery in our center between 2006 and 2015. We analyzed 1466 patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy and no prior systemic treatment. Mastectomy without irradiation was used in 25.4% of these patients and breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy in 74.6%. Forty-seven (3.21%) locoregional relapses were identified within a median of 51 months (10-138 months). The molecular type was analyzed as a risk factor for locoregional relapses and distant metastases. The locoregional relapse location was then analyzed as a risk factor for distant metastases.Results Triple-negative breast cancer (P = .003), age <40 year (P = .007), multifocality (P = .011), and mastectomy (P < .0001) were risk factors for locoregional relapses. Patients who developed locoregional relapses more frequently developed distant metastases (P < .0001). The distribution of molecular types did not differ significantly in patients with locoregional relapses and distant metastases, concentrating in triple-negative and Luminal B tumor cases with distant metastases in almost 58% of cases, while not occurring in Luminal A patients. The locoregional-to-distant metastasis interval was shorter in cases of chest wall and lymph nodes relapse compared with breast-only relapse locations(P = .028).Conclusion Molecular type, especially triple-negative, young age, mastectomy without adjuvant irradiation, and multifocality are risk factors for locoregional relapse in sentinel lymph node biopsy negative breast cancer patients. Locoregional relapse is an important risk factor for developing distant metastasis, except in Luminal A breast cancer patients and those who suffer from breast-only relapse.

TI  - Spectral linear mixing model applied to data from passive microwave radiometers for sea ice mapping in the Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes the use of a Spectral Linear Mixing Model (SLMM) on passive microwave data for mapping the concentration and area of young and/or first-year ice in the oceanic region located in the northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula. Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used to estimate fraction images needed for subpixel analysis of passive microwave data acquired by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) in the 19H, 19 V, 37H, and 37 V channels and polarizations. Sea ice concentrations estimated by the SLMM approach had a difference of 1.4% (13.6% standard deviation, 15.3% root mean square error) when compared to sea ice concentrations mapped using Sentinel-1A SAR data. The evolution in the total area covered by young and/or first-year ice with concentrations >= 15% showed a negative linear trend for the studied region from 1979 to 2018.

TI  - Improved cloud detection over sea ice and snow during Arctic summer using MERIS data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The historic MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor on board Envisat (Environmental Satellite, operation 2002-2012) provides valuable remote sensing data for the retrievals of summer sea ice in the Arctic. MERIS data together with the data of recently launched successor OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) on board Sentinel 3A and 3B (2016 onwards) can be used to assess the long-term change of the Arctic summer sea ice. An important prerequisite to a high-quality remote sensing dataset is an accurate separation of cloudy and clear pixels to ensure lowest cloud contamination of the resulting product. The presence of 15 visible and near-infrared spectral channels of MERIS allows high-quality retrievals of sea ice albedo and melt pond fraction, but it makes cloud screening a challenge as snow, sea ice and clouds have similar optical features in the available spectral range of 412.5-900 nm.In this paper, we present a new cloud screening method MECOSI (MERIS Cloud Screening Over Sea Ice) for the retrievals of spectral albedo and melt pond fraction (MPF) from MERIS. The method utilizes all 15 MERIS channels, including the oxygen A absorption band. For the latter, a smile effect correction has been developed to ensure high-quality screening throughout the whole swath. A total of 3 years of reference cloud mask from AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) (Istomina et al., 2010) have been used to train the Bayesian cloud screening for the available limited MERIS spectral range. Whiteness and brightness criteria as well as normalized difference thresholds have been used as well.The comparison of the developed cloud mask to the operational AATSR and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) cloud masks shows a considerable improvement in the detection of clouds over snow and sea ice, with about 10% false clear detections during May-July and less than 5% false clear detections in the rest of the melting season. This seasonal behavior is expected as the sea ice surface is generally brighter and more challenging for cloud detection in the beginning of the melting season.The effect of the improved cloud screening on the MPF-albedo datasets is demonstrated on both temporal and spatial scales. In the absence of cloud contamination, the time sequence of MPFs displays a greater range of values throughout the whole summer. The daily maps of the MPF now show spatially uniform values without cloud artifacts, which were clearly visible in the previous version of the dataset.The developed cloud screening routine can be applied to address cloud contamination in remote sensing data over sea ice.

TI  - Structural resistance and functional resilience of the Chaco forest to wildland fires: an approach with MODIS time series
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests have resistance that allows them to resist fires without changing to another state, and resilience that allows them to recover after disturbance. These properties are determined by many structural and functional determinants that interact between them. Despite the importance of structural resistance and functional resilience to wildland fires, few studies have evaluated the combined effect that structural and functional determinants have on them. Our goal was to assess the structural resistance and functional resilience to fire using remote sensing information. We specifically assessed the combined effect of pre-fire vegetation characteristics, burn severity, and post-fire precipitation on forest structural resistance and functional resilience to fire. Eighty-five forest plots of 250 m x 250 m were selected in areas that burned in 2003. For each burned plot, a paired unburned control plot of 250 m x 250 m was selected outside the burned areas. We measured burn severity and post-fire precipitations (2004-2011). We analysed MODIS time series in order to calculate the following pre- (2002) and post-fire (2011) phenological parameters: minimum level of photosynthetic activity per year; maximum level of photosynthetic activity per year; length of growing season per year; integral of annual photosynthetic activity; relative seasonality of photosynthetic activity. Also we detected plots that changed into a shrubland eight years after the fire. Fifty three per cent of burned plots changed from forest into a shrubland state. Results show that the forest structural resistance to fire depends on the balance between the level of severity and the parameters related to pre-fire aboveground net primary production. The impact of pre-fire vegetation characteristics on functional resilience ability was driven by burn severity and it's interactions with pre-fire productivity and seasonality. Results suggest that changes in forest species composition and aboveground net primary production reduced forest structural resistance and functional resilience to fire.

M3  - Article
AB  - This forum addresses Laura Zanotti's Ontological Entanglements, Agency, and Ethics in International Relations: Exploring the Crossroads, a landmark work for quantum International Relations (IR) that seeks to demonstrate the critical purchase of quantum thinking for exploring novel worldview. Interveners question the value added by the quantum turn in IR theory, both as it related to critical and broader debates. Zanotti's particular intervention - drawing on a wide variety of themes in social theory, peace studies, feminist theory, metatheoretical debates in IR, international organisations, international development, and beyond - is approaches from the perspective of feminist theory, affect theory, temporality, philosophy of social science, and critical theory. In the spirit of exploring the crossroads, this forum brings together different lines of thinking that intersect through Ontological Entanglements but also extend onward, opening provocative questions for future scholarship in critical quantum IR.

TI  - Impacts of long-range transport of aerosols on marine-boundary-layer clouds in the eastern North Atlantic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical profiles of aerosols are inadequately observed and poorly represented in climate models, contributing to the current large uncertainty associated with aerosol- cloud interactions. The US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) aircraft field campaign near the Azores islands provided ample observations of vertical distributions of aerosol and cloud properties. Here we utilize the in situ aircraft measurements from the ACE-ENA and ground-based remote-sensing data along with an aerosol-aware Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to characterize the aerosols due to long-range transport over a remote region and to assess their possible influence on marine-boundary-layer (MBL) clouds. The vertical profiles of aerosol and cloud properties measured via aircraft during the ACE-ENA campaign provide detailed information revealing the physical contact between transported aerosols and MBL clouds. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (ECMWF-CAMS) aerosol reanalysis data can reproduce the key features of aerosol vertical profiles in the remote region. The cloud-resolving WRF sensitivity experiments with distinctive aerosol profiles suggest that the transported aerosols and MBL cloud interactions (ACIs) require not only aerosol plumes to get close to the marine-boundary-layer top but also large cloud top height variations. Based on those criteria, the observations show that the occurrence of ACIs involving the transport of aerosol over the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) is about 62 % in summer. For the case with noticeable long-range-transport aerosol effects on MBL clouds, the susceptibilities of droplet effective radius and liquid water content are -0.11 and +0.14, respectively. When varying by a similar magnitude, aerosols originating from the boundary layer exert larger microphysical influence on MBL clouds than those entrained from the free troposphere.

TI  - Characterizing the long-term dynamics of aerosol optical depth in the Yangtze River Middle-Reach urban agglomeration, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with the rapid urbanization and economic development, the Yangtze River Middle-Reach urban agglomeration (YRMR) has suffered from increasingly serious environmental problems. Characterizing the long-term dynamics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in YRMR is of important significance for scientific control of aerosol pollutants over this region. Previously, numerous researches have analysed the temporal and spatial characteristics of AOD in different regions through statistical values of AOD time series or using trend analysis methods based on linear regression models. It is challenging to approximate nonlinear trends and identify change points of AOD time series. This paper proposed a new methodology for investigating the dynamics of AOD over the YRMR region on a monthly basis by using the Terra MODIS Collection 6.1 Level 2 aerosol products (MOD04_L2) during 2001-2017. A three-dimensional spatio-temporal interpolation method was used to generate gap-filled monthly AOD maps, and then a generic Bayesian time series decomposition algorithm was applied to analyse the trends and change points of monthly AOD time series. The results showed that the areas with high AOD values were mainly located in the core cities and the connecting belts. Strong positive AOD anomalies had been observed during 2006-2011, whereas the positive anomalies were typically intermingled with negative anomalies and it indicated that the evolution patterns of AOD for different regions were different and influenced by fluctuations. Trend analysis of the monthly mean AOD values indicated that AOD in YRMR increased first, then fluctuated, and finally decreased. Although it was difficult to separate the increasing and fluctuating periods from each other due to the fluctuation, the decreasing trend after 2011 was significant, and a significant drop of AOD had been observed since 2014. Long-term AOD variations were closely related to national policies, and the results could provide useful references for regional environmental assessment and decision-making.

TI  - Landsat 8 Utilizing sensitive response bands concept for image processing and mapping of basalts
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral signature curve behavior of basalt and its relationship with the surface reflectance (SR) values of Landsat 8 OLI data, (Operational Land Imager), is considered as the key factor for determination of the sensitive response bands for basalt interaction to be used in both Object-Oriented Principal Components (PCA) & Independent Component (ICA) analyses. Also, it is extremely beneficial in develop mathematical formulas which express the best band ratios for the precise illustration and mapping of basalts. The integration of those sensitive bands and the three mentioned methods are the main objectives of the present investigation. This should permit to create the basalt spatial distribution map for a given area. These methods were applied in west central Sinai, Egypt.The measured spectral signature reflectance curve of the basalt was resampled to meet the spectral characteristics of Landsat 8 bands, both curves were carefully examined to determine the most significant response bands for basalts; which were found to be bands 4, 5, 6 and 7. The examined spectral behavior led to three significant band ratios. Moreover, two false color composite (PC1, PC2, PC4) and (IC4, IC3, IC1) in RGB, were determined by execution and examination of the PCA and ICA images, respectively of the study area.ERDAS Imagine (2010) and ArcGIS 10.3 packages were used for digital/mathematical processing steps and to apply the resulted models on the study area.& COPY; 2019 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Experimental and Numerical Determination of the Head Loss of a Pressure Driven Flow through an Unlined Rock-Blasted Tunnel
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The friction loss in a part of the rock-blasted unlined tunnel of the Litjfossen hydropower plant in Norway was determined from experimental and numerical studies. Remote sensing data from the prototype tunnel provided the input data for both the numerical model and the construction of a 1:15 scale model with an innovative milling approach. The numerical simulations were based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the CFD program OpenFoam. Head loss measurements in the scale model were carried out by means of pressure measurements for a range of discharges and were compared against the results of the numerical model. The measured data were used to determine the Darcy-Weisbach and Manning friction factors of the investigated tunnel reach. The high-resolution remote sensing data were also used to test the applicability of existing approaches to determine the friction factor in unlined rock blasted tunnels. The results of the study show the usefulness of the chosen hybrid approach of experimental investigations and numerical simulations and that existing approaches for the determination of head losses in unlined tunnels need to be further refined.

TI  - The Realism and Evolutionary Personalism of NO Lossky
T2  - SOPHIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to Nikolay Lossky who was one of the leading Russian philosophers of the first half of the twentieth century. We demonstrate the interrelationship between three aspects of Lossky's philosophy: realism in the theory of knowledge, hierarchical personalism, and supra-naturalistic concept of evolution. We pay attention to the contemporary relevance of Lossky, and we discuss and critique his ideas in light of those of other philosophers (V. S. Solovyov, R. Bhaskar, N. Rescher, etc.). Lossky acknowledges that the subject interacts with being itself and that knowledge is not a shadow or copy of being. His ontology is based on intuitivism and epistemological optimism. Its main categories are God, as the super-systematic principle, and monads. In Lossky's metaphysics, the idea of abstract ideal principles of being is quite harmoniously combined with personalism. Lossky's ontology has strong ethical underpinnings. He considers that values are rooted in being and that the evolution of the world is directed by God towards the good. Lossky elaborates a supra-naturalistic concept of evolution. He extrapolates principles of teleological determination, which are fundamental to human existence, on the underlying levels of the world as a whole. Many trends of modern thought are in tune with Lossky's philosophy, including a return to metaphysics, panpsychism, Platonism, and the desire to unite the religious worldview with new scientific discoveries.

TI  - Modelling and monitoring house fly<i> M.</i><i> domestica</i> using remote sensing data and geographic information system
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing (RS) techniques and geographic information system (GIS) analyses have enhanced field studies of environmental factors affecting the spatial distribution of vector-borne diseases. These techniques have been used previously to map and monitor the fly vector in Egypt. Using RS and GIS were applied in relation to contextual environmental factors, including land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and house fly density to model and predict the house fly density in a given location. Results found a strong correlation between the house fly density and Wetness (r = 0.98), NDWI35 (r = -0.98) and LST (r = 0.90). These three variables with the NDVI index were found forming the best accurate model to predict the house fly density with the highest coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.97) and lowest Variance Inflation Factor (VIF = 5.67) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC = 7.95) among other tested models. This study suggests that future studies should include other factors related to vector abundance, vector competence, and human population to produce more comprehensive risk maps, thus helping in planning effective prevention and control strategies, also these studies have emphasized the importance of community efforts toward fly control.& COPY; 2019 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Robotic approaches and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy are both strategies that evolved driven by the need to reduce impact of head and neck oncological surgery in terms of operative timing, morbidity, hospitalization time, and aesthetic results. A comprehensive review of the scientific literature was performed on PubMed, Embase, ResearchGate, Cochrane, and CENTRAL electronic databases with the aim to discuss the role that these two approaches can play together in the management of head and neck cancers (HNCs) of various sites.Dedicated publications on the combined robotics and SLN biopsy approaches resulted, up to now very limited, while their separated application in non-shared fields is gaining strength. However, the possibility to implement and combine technologies to minimize sequelae of head and neck surgery is an interesting and evolving topic.

TI  - Quantification and Mapping of Satellite Driven Surface Energy Balance Fluxes in Semi-Arid to Arid Inter-Mountain Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimates, on a regional scale, hold enormous potential in managing surface and groundwater resources. This is particularly important for the headwater state of Wyoming, which provides water to found major river basins of the US. In this study, METRIC (Mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration), a satellite-based image processing model, was used to map and quantify daily, monthly, and seasonal ETc and other energy balance fluxes, i.e., net radiation (R-n), sensible heat (H), and soil heat flux (G) dynamics for different land-use classes. Monthly and seasonal ETc estimated were further used to approximate regional water consumption patterns for different land-use types for nine irrigation districts in semi-arid to arid intermountain region of Big Horn Basin (BHB), Wyoming. The validation of METRIC retrievals against Bowen ratio energy balance system (BREBS) fluxes measured over three vegetative surfaces, viz. sugar beet in 2017, dry bean in 2018, and barley in 2019, indicated high accuracy. The pooled correlation observed between estimated (pooled) and measured instantaneous fluxes had R-2 values of 0.91 (RMSE = 0.08 mm h(-1), NSE = 0.91), 0.81 (RMSE = 49.6 Wm(-2), NSE = 0.67), 0.53 (RMSE = 27.1 Wm(-2), NSE = 0.53), and 0.86 (RMSE = 59.2 Wm(-2), NSE = 0.84) for ETc, R-n, G, and H, respectively. The biggest discrepancy between measured and estimated monthly ETc values was observed during times when BREBS flux tower footprint was devoid of any crops or the crops at footprint were not actively transpiring. Validation results improved when comparisons were made on monthly scales with METRIC underestimating growing season ETc in the range between 3.2% to 6.0%. Seasonal ETc by land-use type showed significant variation over the study area where crop ETc was 52% higher than natural vegetation ETc. Furthermore, it was found that, in the arid to semi-arid intermountain region of Wyoming, the contribution of irrigation to total seasonal ETc varied in the range of 73-81% in nine irrigation districts that fall within the study area. The high relative contribution of irrigation highlights the importance of identifying and quantifying ETc for improved management in irrigation system design and water allocation.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A female patient who was in her 50s visited our hospital complaining right breast tumor, 18 years after her right breast- conserving partial mastectomy with right axillary lymph nodes dissection. Ultrasonography revealed a right breast tumor and an enlarged lymph node at left axilla. Core needle biopsy(CNB)from the right breast tumor showed the recurrence of her breast cancer and fine-needle aspiration(FNA)from her left axillary lymph node showed Class Ⅴ. We concluded the recurrence of right breast cancer with left axillary metastasis. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she underwent right mastectomy and left axillary lymph node dissection. When the recurrence of residual breast is seen, the contralateral axillary lymph node might become a new sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Ultra-orthodoxy and selective voluntarism: How did the Orban regime react to the first wave of the pandemic?
T2  - EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Viktor Orban's regime in Hungary is a prime example of authoritarian populism in a relatively developed country that has been part of the European Union since 2004. The paper argues that in response to the pandemic, the Orban government pursued a set of selectively voluntarist policies that have been informed by an ultra-orthodox, state-centered worldview that sought to minimize the regime's democratic accountability and to reduce the counter-mobilization ability of the opposition. These policies had been associated with comparatively low infection and death rates in the first wave of the pandemic, hence enabling high approval ratings for the government despite generating considerable human and economic costs. In light of rising infection and death rates from September 2020, however, it is yet to be seen whether the COVID-19 crisis, in balance, will reinforce or undermine popular support to the regime.

TI  - Early warning systems development for agricultural drought assessment in Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing drought monitoring mechanisms in the sub-Saharan Africa region mostly depend on the conventional methods of drought monitoring. These methods have limitations based on timeliness, objectivity, reliability, and adequacy. This study aims to identify the spread and frequency of drought in Nigeria using Remote Sensing/Geographic Information Systems techniques to determine the areas that are at risk of drought events within the country. The study further develops a web-GIS application platform that provides drought early warning signals. Monthly NOAA-AVHRR Pathfinder NDVI images of 1 km by 1 km spatial resolution and MODIS with a spatial resolution of 500 m by 500 m were used in this study together with rainfall data from 25 synoptic stations covering 32 years. The spatio-temporal variation of drought showed that drought occurred at different times of the year in all parts of the country with the highest drought risk in the north-eastern parts. The map view showed that the high drought risk covered 5.98% (55,312 km(2)) of the country's landmass, while low drought risk covered 42.4% (391,881 km(2)) and very low drought risk areas 51.5% (476,578 km(2)). Results revealed that a strong relationship exists between annual rainfall and season-integrated NDVI (r(2) = 0.6). Based on the spatio-temporal distribution and frequency of droughts in Nigeria, drought monitoring using remote sensing techniques of VCI and NDVI could play an invaluable role in food security and drought preparedness. The map view from the web-based drought monitoring system, developed in this study, is accessible through localhost.

TI  - Geometric Accuracy Assessment of Deimos-2 Panchromatic Stereo Pairs: Sensor Orientation and Digital Surface Model Production
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate elevation data, which can be extracted from very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images, are vital for many engineering and land planning applications. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the capabilities of VHR Deimos-2 panchromatic stereo pairs to obtain digital surface models (DSM) over different land covers (bare soil, urban and agricultural greenhouse areas). As a step prior to extracting the DSM, different orientation models based on refined rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) and a variable number of very accurate ground control points (GCPs) were tested. The best sensor orientation model for Deimos-2 L1B satellite images was the RPC model refined by a first-order polynomial adjustment (RPC1) supported on 12 accurate and evenly spatially distributed GCPs. Regarding the Deimos-2 based DSM, its completeness and vertical accuracy were compared with those obtained from a WorldView-2 panchromatic stereo pair by using exactly the same methodology and semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm. The Deimos-2 showed worse completeness values (about 6% worse) and vertical accuracy results (RMSEZ 42.4% worse) than those computed from WorldView-2 imagery over the three land covers tested, although only urban areas yielded statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).

TI  - Understanding Volumetric Water Storage in Monsoonal Wetlands of Northeastern Bangladesh
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The volume of water stored in seasonal wetlands is a fundamental but difficult to measure variable for developing a physical understanding of wetland behavior. For seasonal wetlands that are a major source of water for rice and fish production, this physical understanding is key to planning for water-food security and ecosystem services. This study quantified variations in volumetric storage for the numerous seasonal wetlands of northeastern Bangladesh, locally known as "haors." These haors receive transboundary runoff from densely vegetated and mountainous terrain in India and face persistent monsoonal cloud cover as they become full. We estimated volumetric storage for 13 haors by using extensive remote sensing data on water surface extent and elevation that was complemented with citizen-contributed gauge data. Assuming a trapezoidal bathymetry, an area-volume relationship was developed for selected haors. This relationship was assumed to be valid for extrapolating volumetric estimations over all the haors in the region. Results suggested that as haors get filled with the onset of monsoon rains, total estimated storage relative to the lowest observable level varied from 6.5 (+/- 0.4) km(3) in May to 30.9 (+/- 2.0) km(3) in July (peak of monsoon). Choosing a rectangular bathymetry can lead to 47% higher estimates compared to trapezoidal cross section. Estimating this intra-annual/interannual increase in storage is important for the region to plan water management policies that balance the human and ecosystem needs. Our analytical approach has potential for application to wetlands worldwide in light of the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability in Bio-Optical Properties of the Southern Caspian Sea: A Historic Analysis of Ocean Color Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, satellite ocean color imageries play an important role in monitoring of water properties in various oceanic, coastal, and inland ecosystems. Although there is a long-time and global archive of such valuable data, no study has comprehensively used these data to assess the changes in the Caspian Sea. Hence, this study assessed the variability of bio-optical properties of the upper-water column in the Southern Caspian Sea (SCS) using the archive of the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The images acquired from SeaWiFS (January 1998 to December 2002) and MODIS Aqua (January 2003 to December 2015) satellites were used to investigate the spatial-temporal variability of bio-optical properties including Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), attenuation coefficient, and remote sensing reflectance, and environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), wind stress and the El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) phenomena at different time lags in the study area. The trend analysis demonstrated an overall increase of 0.3358 mg m(-3) in the Chl-a concentration during 1998-2015 (annual increase rate of 0.018 mg m(-3) year(-1)) and four algal blooms and in turn an abnormal increase in Chl-a concentration were occurred in August 2001, September 2005, 2009, and August 2010. The linear model revealed that Chl-a in the northern and middle part of the study area had been influenced by the attenuation coefficient after a one-month lag time. The analysis revealed a sharp decline in Chl-a concentration during 2011-2015 and showed a high correlation with the turbidity and attenuation coefficient in the southern region, while Kd_490nm and remote sensing reflectance did a low one. Generally, Chl-a concentration exhibited a positive correlation with the attenuation coefficient (r = 0.63) and with remote sensing reflectance at the 555 nm (r = 0.111). This study can be used as the basis for predictive modeling to evaluate the changes of water quality and bio-optical indices in the Southern Caspian Sea (SCS).

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Egypt, water resources management is considered a major socio-economic issue and a central component for future development. With the increasing rate of population growth, urbanization and agricultural expansion, groundwater resources are gaining more demand and attention. Wadi El Tarfa area is one of the semi-arid areas located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, composed of Cretaceous and Eocene limestone and Quaternary sediments. This study focused on delineation, evaluation and verification of the groundwater potential zones using remote sensing, geospatial techniques and field work. In this regard, thematic maps of the contributing factors such as stream networks, lineaments, lithology, slope, landcover/landuse and rainfall were generated using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. Based on the determined recharge favorability, weighing, and overlaying, a groundwater potential of the study area was prepared. The output recharge potential map shows three zones of groundwater prospective potential: good, moderate and low constituting 25%, 69% and 6% of the study area respectively. Of them, the high and moderate zones are strongly recommended for further exploration. The geophysical, water data and transmissivity data for some water points located within the targeted area confirmed the recommended zones. The overall results reflect the effectiveness of using the remote sensing data and geospatial techniques to target areas for groundwater exploration.

TI  - Radiometric Cross Calibration of KOMPSAT-3 and Lnadsat-8 for Time-Series Harmonization
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to produce crop information using remote sensing, we use classification and growth monitoring based on crop phenology. Therefore, time-series satellite images with a short period are required. However, there are limitations to acquiring time-series satellite data, so it is necessary to use fusion with other earth observation satellites. Before fusion of various satellite image data, it is necessary to overcome the inherent difference in radiometric characteristics of satellites. This study performed Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3) cross calibration with Landsat-8 as the first step for fusion. Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance was compared by applying Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) to each satellite using hyperspectral sensor band aggregation. As a result of cross calibration, KOMPSAT-3 and Landsat-8 satellites showed a difference in reflectance of less than 4% in Blue, Green, and Red bands, and 6% in NIR bands. KOMPSAT-3, without on-board calibrator, idicate lower radiometric stability compared to ladnsat-8. In the future, efforts are needed to produce normalized reflectance data through BRDF (Bidirectional reflectance distribution function) correction and SBAF application for spectral characteristics of agricultural land.

TI  - The use of Atlantic hagfish (<i>Myxine glutinosa</i>) as a bioindicator species for studies on effects of dumped chemical warfare agents in the Skagerrak. 2. Biochemical biomarkers
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea bottom of the Skagerrak Strait (North Sea) contains munitions loaded with chemical warfare agents (CWA), mostly stored in shipwrecks scuttled intentionally after the end of the World War II. The munition shells inside the wrecks are in different states of deterioration and corrosion and their environmental risk potential is unknown. The Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), a sediment-dwelling chordate, was used as a model organism to study the potential impact of dumped CWA on the local ecosystem by using biochemical biomarkers. The hagfish were collected in 2017 and 2018 at three sampling sites: in the immediate vicinity of a wreck with CWA in the Skagerrak, a few kilometres from the wreck, and a reference site 21 km from the wreck, considered to be free of CWA. Significant differences were observed between the wreck site and the reference sites in the activities of glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase, while the activity levels of catalase and acetylcholinesterase were identical at all sites. The recorded differences demonstrated negative biological effects in the hagfish sampled close to the dumped chemical munitions. Due to the limited knowledge of hagfish biology and of the extent of CWA contamination in Skagerrak, the results presented here warrant more research to further elucidate the potential environmental risks of the scuttled wrecks. The usefulness of the species as a bioindicator organism is further discussed.

TI  - Landscape-Scale Crop Lodging Assessment across Iowa and Illinois Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop lodging, the tilting of stems from their natural upright position, usually occurs after a heavy storm event. Since lodging of a crop seriously affects its yield, rapid assessment of crop lodging is valuable for farmers, policymakers, agronomists, insurance companies, and relief workers. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have been recognized as valuable data sources for mapping lodging extent because of their good penetrating power and high-resolution remote sensing ability. Compared to other sources, SAR's weather and illumination independence and large area coverage at fine spatial resolution (3 m to 20 m) support frequent and detailed observations. Because of these advantages, SAR has the potential in supporting near real-time monitoring of lodging in fields when combined with automated image processing. In this study, a method based on change detection using modified Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) and Sentinel-1A data were utilized to identify lodging and map its extent. Results obtained have shown that when lodging occurs, the VH polarization's backscatter (sigma VH) increases between the pre-lodging event image and the post-lodging event image. The increase in sigma VH is due to the increase in volume scattering and vegetation-soil double bounce scattering resulting from the structural changes in the crop canopy. Using Sentinel-1A images and applying our proposed approach across several fields in Iowa and Illinois, we mapped the extent of the 2020 Derecho (wind storm) lodging disaster. In addition, we separated lodged regions into severely and moderately lodged areas. We estimated that approximately 2.56 million acres of corn and 1.27 million acres of soybean were lodged. Further analysis also showed the separation between un-lodged (healthy) fields and lodged fields. The observations in this study can guide future use of SAR-based information for operational crop lodging assessment.

TI  - Application of RUSLE integrated with GIS and remote sensing techniques to assess soil erosion in Anambra State, South-Eastern Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion and mass movement processes spread across Anambra State in Nigeria, therefore making management and conservation techniques expensive and difficult in execution across the entire state. This study employed the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model with the integration of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to assess the risk of soil erosion and hotspots in the area. Remotely sensed data such as Landsat 8 imagery, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery, Era-Interim coupled with world soil database were used as digital data sources for land use map, digital elevation model, rainfall and soil data, respectively, to generate the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) parameters. The results indicated vulnerability levels in low, medium and high cover areas of 4,143.62 (91%), 332.29 (7%) and 84.06 (2%) km(2), respectively, with a total soil loss between 0 and 181.237 ton/ha/yr (metric ton per hectare per year). This study revealed that high rainfall erosivity, steep and long slopes, and low vegetation cover were the main factors promoting soil loss in the area. Thus, the amount of soil loss in Anambra State is expected to increase with climate change and anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Variation of urban vegetation cover and its impact on minimum and maximum heat islands
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat satellite imageries, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the entire vegetation cover has been calculated at two times (i.e. winter and summer) of each year for 2008, 2013 and 2019. Concomitantly, we calculated the seasonal and annual minimum and maximum urban heat island (UHI) intensity, using daily minimum and maximum air temperatures measured at two different places: 1) at an urban site located on the roof of a building in the city center, 2) at a rural site at the countryside close to the city. The fractional areas with their ratios of vegetated spaces are also computed and the results show that the highest mean NDVI occurred in 2013 and the lowest in 2008 and 2019. The results showed that minimum UHI has positive values ranged from 3.4 to 6.4 degrees C while maximum UHI ranged from -0.7 to 0.3 degrees C and both have increased trends over the period. The linear relation between mean NDVI areas and minimum and maximum UHIs is found to tend weak, which demonstrate that vegetated areas correlate negatively with minimum UHI and positively with maximum UHI. Thus, urban vegetation should be maintained to reduce local intensity of UHI. Urban heat is a problem in cities, so this article described the changes in spatial patterns of vegetation cover and its linkage to minimum and maximum UHI in the Metropolitan city of Baghdad.

TI  - Evaluation of Total Compressive Stress in Steel W-Flange Members Using Ultrasonic Shear Waves
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates the potential for ultrasonic stress measurement (USM) to be used to evaluate the total stress in wide-flange steel sections (W-section) for a postevent condition assessment of buildings. The research utilizes acoustic birefringence measurements that are proportional to stress in the material to assess stress based on the velocities of orthogonally polarized shear waves. The nondestructive measurement of stress in the material provides a means to determine the force carried in the member and a potential solution to limitations of structural evaluations based on theoretical modeling and design assumptions. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the acoustoelastic properties for a common structural steel material, assess the accuracy of the stress measurement under axial compression, and assess the in situ birefringence and residual stress distribution in a W-section. The research found a variation of the in situ birefringence at different locations on a typical W-section as a result of residual stress distribution and texture of the material. Axial compression tests showed there were differences in the acoustic constants that relate stress to the birefringence measurement for materials from different sources and at different locations within a single wide-flange section. The birefringence profiles showed a linear variation with a compressive load and could be used to determine the stress in a steel member. The research found birefringence USM could be used to determine stress accurately to approximately +/- 46 MPa (+/- 6.7ksi) or 12% fy for a scenario in which generalized acoustic constants were used and about +/- 7 MPa (+/- 1ksi) or 2% fy for a scenario in which location-specific constants were used in calculating the stress present in the member.

TI  - Using Landsat satellite data for assessing the land use and land cover change in Kashmir valley
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change has been one of the most immense and perceptible transformations of the earth's surface. Evaluating LULC change at varied spatial scales is imperative in wide range of perspectives such as environmental conservation, resource management, land use planning, and sustainable development. This work aims to examine the land use and land cover changes in the Kashmir valley between the time periods from 1992-2001-2015 using a set of compatible moderate resolution Landsat satellite imageries. Supervised approach with maximum likelihood classifier was adopted for the classification and generation of LULC maps for the selected time periods. Results reveal that there have been substantial changes in the land use and cover during the chosen time periods. In general, three land use and land cover change patterns were observed in the study area: (1) consistent increase of the area under marshy, built-up, barren, plantation, and shrubs; (2) continuous decrease in agriculture and water; (3) decrease (1992-2001) and increase (2001-2015) in forest and pasture classes. In terms of the area under each LULC category, most significant changes have been observed in agriculture (-), plantation (+), built-up (+), and water (-); however, with reference to percent change within each class, the maximum variability was recorded in built-up (198.45%), plantation (87.98%), pasture (- 71%), water (- 48%) and agriculture (- 28.85%). The massive land transformation is largely driven by anthropogenic actions and has been mostly adverse in nature, giving rise to multiple environmental issues in the ecologically sensitive Kashmir valley.

TI  - Perioperative outcomes and disparities in utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy in minimally invasive staging of endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To assess the emergence of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for disparities in utilization, and impacts on perioperative outcomes.Methods. Retrospective cohort study of the National Cancer Database, selecting for patients with T1NxM0 endometrial cancer undergoing minimally invasive surgical staging from 2012 to 2016. Disparities in SLNB utilization were described. Propensity matching was performed. Association of SLNB with perioperative outcomes was assessed with logistic regression.Results. Among 67,365 patients, 6356 (9.4%) underwent SLNB, increasing from 2.8% to 16.3% from 2012 to 2016. Disparities were identified within race (7.0% Black, 9.4% non-Black), ethnicity (8.3% Hispanic, 9.5% non-Hispanic), insurance (6.0% uninsured, 9.5% insured), county density (3.7% rural, 9.8% metro), and income (7.0% bottom-quartile, 11.8% top-quartile). Risk of conversion to open surgery was lower with SLNB alone (1.03%) or SLNB followed by LND (1.40%), versus upfront LND (2.80%). SLNB was associated with reduced risk of conversion to open surgery in Intention-To-Treat (SLNB+/-LND vs. upfront LND; ORITT = 0.53; 95%CI 0.39-0.72) and Per-Protocol (PP; SLNB alone vs. upfront LND or SLNB+LND; ORPP = 0.49; 95%CI 0.32-0.75) comparisons. SLNB was also associated with lower risk of length of stay >1 day (overall rate 6.3%; ORITT = 0.51; 95%CI 0.40-0.64; ORPP = 0.39; 95%CI 0.28-0.55), and unplanned readmission (overall rate 2.3%; ORPP = 0.52; 95%CI 0.33-0.81). There were no deaths within 90 days among 1370 SLNB alone cases, versus 2/1294 (0.15%) for SLNB+LND, and 123/28,828 (0.41%) for upfront LND.Conclusion. We identified significant disparities in the utilization of SLNB, as well as evidence that this less-invasive technique is associated with lower rates of certain perioperative complications. Equitable access to this emerging technique could lessen disparate outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Eighteen years of implementation of a control programme against Rift Valley fever, 2000-2018, Saudi Arabia: a review study
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a serious life-threatening disease with severe clinical manifestations and health consequences for humans and a wide range of domestic animals. In September 2000, an RVF outbreak was reported in the Jazan region in the south-west part of Saudi Arabia with 886 human cases including 124 deaths. This review provides: a) an overview of the RVF control programme in Saudi Arabia, and b) an assessment of some of the control measures that have been launched since the early recognition of RVF. Currently, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, devastating outbreaks of RVF continue to occur and the number of countries reporting cases has increased rapidly. At least 19 large outbreaks including substantial numbers of human and animal deaths have been reported for the period between 2000 and 2018. In contrast to the aforementioned situation in endemic areas, the RVF control programme that was set up in Saudi Arabia has completely reversed the risk of re-occurrence of RVF over the past 18 years and provided long-term protection against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) exposure. The control programme involved: a) vector control campaigns (using conventional and microbial insecticides, drainage and filling of water swamps with soil, and mosquito surveillance) and b) host-driven controls such as sustained vaccination campaigns, regular examination of sentinel herds, including seasonal surveillance reinforcement (targeted sero-surveillance during rainy seasons), and serological examination of clandestine animal imports kept at Al-Twal quarantine station, at the border with Yemen.The effectiveness of the current control programme can be demonstrated not only by the decrease in antibody prevalence of RVF virus-specific immunoglobulin M, from 12.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8-17.8) in 2000 to 0.10% (95% CI: 0.01-0.2) in 2017, but also by the absence of human and animal cases since the 2000 outbreak. The mosquito infection rates with RVFV have also declined, from 0.045 per 1,000 for the genus Culex in 2014 to zero from 2015 to 2018. Additionally, the integrated vector management methods targeting outdoor habitats in the Jazan region substantially contributed to vector control and should be considered one of the most important factors contributing to the significant reduction of malaria case incidence from 2000 to 2014. The Saudi current control initiative could be used as a guideline for control of RVF or as a suitable model for other endemic countries.

TI  - Monitoring and forecasting spatio-temporal LULC for Akure rainforest habitat in Nigeria
T2  - REPORTS ON GEODESY AND GEOINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - For several decades, Nigerian cities have been experiencing a decline in their biodiversity resulting from rapid land use land cover (LULC) changes. Anticipating short/long-term consequences, this study hypothesised the effects of LULC variables in Akure, a developing tropical rainforest city in south-west Nigeria. A differentiated trend of urban LULC was determined over a period covering 1999-2019. The study showed the net change for bare land, built-up area, cultivated land, forest cover and grassland over the two decades to be -292.68 km(2), +325.79 km(2), +88.65 km(2), +8.62 km(2) and -131.38 km(2), respectively. With a projected population increase of about 46.85%, the study identified that the built-up land cover increased from 1.98% to 48.61%. The change detection analysis revealed an upsurge in built area class. The expansion indicated a significant inverse correlation with the bare land class (50.97% to 8.66%) and grassland class (36.33% to 17.94%) over the study period. The study observed that the land consumption rate (in hectares) steadily increased by 0.00505, 0.00362 and 0.0687, in the year 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. This rate of increase is higher than studies conducted in more populated cities. The Cellular Automata (CA) Markovian analysis predicted a 37.92% growth of the study area will be the built-up area in the next two decades (2039). The 20-year prediction for Akure built-up area is within range when compared to CA Markov prediction for other cities across the globe. The findings of this study will guide future planning for rational LULC evaluation.

TI  - Assessment of Relative Tectonics Activity Zones in Masila Oil Field, Yemen
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Masila oil field, a part of rift graben basin (Sayun-Masila basin), Yemen, is affected by several tectonic events since Pre-Cambrian period. The present study makes an effort to assess the relative tectonic activity in this oil field. Several geomorphic indices, lineaments, and depth structural anomalies were generated as thematic maps using remotely sensed data, wells data, and existing geological and seismic data in a GIS platform. The thematic maps were converted into a grid format, classified into different categories based on their relative importance, and integrated using the GIS integration tool. The final map, generated by the integration of thematic maps, was categorized into five relative tectonic zones, namely very high relative tectonic zone (9.2%), high relative tectonic zone (10.6%), moderate relative tectonic zone (30%), low relative tectonic zone (36%), and very low relative tectonic zone (14.2%). The surface lineament anomalies and subsurface geological cross-section were subsequently used to validate the derived results. The results obtained through this approach may be helpful for exploring resources, such as hydrocarbons, and predicting hazards. The study highlights the advantage of using different datasets from various sources and their overlay in a GIS platform for assessing relative tectonic activity.

TI  - Ensemble matching of repeat satellite images applied to measure fast-changing ice flow, verified with mountain climber trajectories on Khumbu icefall, Mount Everest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Velocities within an icefall are typically the fastest within a glacier system and experience complex flow. The combination of convergent and fast flow, and steep slope generate a quickly changing and intensely fractured surface. This complicates velocity extraction from repeat satellite images, especially when common pattern matching procedures are used. In this study, we exploit the high temporal revisit of medium-resolution satellite images using a novel image matching technique, ensemble matching, making it possible to generate a high-resolution (30 m) velocity field from high-repeat image sequences despite challenging image conditions. We demonstrate this technique for the first time in the glaciology domain using repeat Sentinel-2 optical data over the famous Khumbu icefall, situated on the southern slopes of Mount Everest. Estimates of velocity go just over 1 m d(-1), which is slower than summer velocities from noisy single pair image matching. This icefall is frequently crossed by high-altitude mountaineers who use a route confined by fixed ropes and ladders set out every season. The mountain climbers typically record their trajectory on their personal satellite navigation device. We use such volunteered geographic information to verify our velocity estimates, confirming our underestimation with ensemble matching. Besides unprecedented remotely sensed surface velocities over the icefall, we also note that the generated velocity field can aid with the planning of a safe passage through this icefall.

TI  - Can risk groups accurately predict non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in sentinel lymph node-positive endometrial cancer patients? A Turkish Gynecologic Oncology Group Study (TRSGO-SLN-004)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives The purpose of this study was to find out the risk factors associated with non-sentinel lymph node metastasis and determine the incidence of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis according to risk groups in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive endometrial cancer patients.Methods Patients who underwent at least bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy after SLN mapping were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into low, intermediate, high-intermediate, and high-risk groups defined by ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO.Results Out of 395 eligible patients, 42 patients had SLN metastasis and 16 (38.1%) of them also had non-SLN metastasis. Size of SLN metastasis was the only factor associated with non-SLN metastasis (p = .012) as 13/22 patients with macrometastasis, 2/10 with micrometastasis and 1/10 with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) had non-SLN metastasis. Although all 4 metastases (1.8%) among the low-risk group were limited to SLNs, the non-SLN involvement rate in the high-risk group was 42.9% and all of these were seen in patients with macrometastatic SLNs.Conclusions Non-SLN metastasis was more frequent in higher-risk groups and the risk of non-SLN metastasis increased with the size of SLN metastasis. Proceeding to complete lymphadenectomy when SLN is metastatic should further be studied as the effect of leaving metastatic non-SLNs in-situ is not known.

TI  - Surface Urban Heat Island in Middle City: Spatial and Temporal Characteristics
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, cities have aroused the interest of researchers due the local climate change caused by the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. The impact of anthropogenic land use and cover changes has led to more frequent intense SUHI, with direct consequences on urban quality of life. Therefore, this research aims at analyzing the influences of natural and anthropogenic variables on the seasonality and spatial SUHI intensity in a Brazilian city, using remote sensing data and analysis of several physical parameters. Results show that the city of Sao Carlos has an SUHI mosaic and surface urban freshness island (SUFI). On average, 86% of the urban area presented a SUHI, whilst most SUFIs are located near watercourses, parks, slopes and valley bottoms, revealing the effects of green areas and relief on creation of microclimates. The SUHI showed significant seasonal variability.

TI  - Water stress coefficient determined by orbital remote sensing techniques
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions where the irrigated area is increasing and water availability is reduced, such as the West of the Bahia state, Brazil, the use of techniques that contribute to improving water use efficiency is paramount. One of the ways to improve irrigation is by improving the calculation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), which among other factors is influenced by soil drying, so it is important to understand this relationship, which is usually accounted for in irrigation management models through the water stress coefficient (Ks). This study aimed to estimate the water stress coefficient (Ks) through information obtained via remote sensing, combined with field data. For this, a study was carried out in the municipality of SAo Desiderio, an area located in western Bahia, using images of the Landsat-8 satellite. Ks was calculated by the relationship between crop evapotranspiration and ETa, calculated by the Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER). The Ks estimated by remote sensing showed, for the development and medium stages, average errors on the order of 5.50%. In the final stage of maize development, the errors obtained were of 23.2%.

TI  - Monitoring agricultural drought using geospatial techniques: a case study of Thal region of Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thal region of Punjab often experiences dry weather conditions with extreme variability in rainfall on a spatiotemporal scale during Rabi cropping season. The current study assesses the impacts of agricultural drought on wheat crops for 2000-2015. MOD13Q1 and CHIRPS data were used for identifying and assessing variation in agricultural drought patterns and severity. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Stress Vegetation Index (STVI) and wheat crop yield anomalies were computed to characterize the gravity of drought across the Thal region. The results indicate that the wheat Rabi cropping seasons of the years 2000-2002 experienced extreme agricultural drought, with a spatial difference in severity level causing low and poor yield, while the years 2011 and 2014 were almost normal among all the years, leaving varied impacts on wheat yield. The combined agricultural risk map was generated by integrating the agricultural and meteorological droughts severity maps. The combined risk map generated using weighted overlay analysis of all the parameters indicate that the total Thal area can be classified into slight, moderate and no drought covering 28.12, 12.76, and 59.12% respectively of the total area. Hence an agricultural risk map would be extremely helpful as a tool to guide the decision-making process for monitoring drought risk on agricultural productivity.

TI  - Efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub>-baited CDC miniature light traps under semi-field conditions and characterizing response behaviors of female <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is an important vector of viruses causing dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever and as such is a threat to public health worldwide. Effective trapping methods are essential for surveillance of both mosquito species and disease presence. The Centers for Disease Control Miniature Light Trap (CDC-MLT) is an updated version of the New Jersey light trap, which was developed early in the 20th century. This trap is widely reported as being less successful for Ae. aegypti than for other mosquito species, although the reason for this is unclear. This trap has engendered more Ae. aegypti-tailored designs that still represent the basic design model. The efficiency of the CDC-MLT alone and with CO2 was tested under semi-field conditions and the behavior of responding female Ae. aegypti was characterized. The CDC-MLT alone failed to capture any mosquitoes and with CO2 the capture efficiency was less than 2%. Understanding the behaviors that mosquitoes exhibit while encountering a particular trap design or trapping concept may suggest trap improvements to increase capture efficiency. Moreover, this work contributes to our understanding of mosquito host-seeking behavior.

TI  - The Dilemma of Drains after Pancreatoduodenectomy: Still an Issue?
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Routine drainage after pancreatoduodenectomy is a controversial issue. In this article, we present and discuss the current evidence on abdominal drains in pancreatic surgery. Material and Methods: Review of the pertinent English-language literature. Results: There is a growing body of evidence showing a lack of benefit of prophylactic drainage after pancreatoduodenectomy. Randomized trials have reported similar outcomes with or without routine drains. If drains were used, early removal was found to be superior to late removal in patients with a low risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula. Consequently, criteria for early drain removal have been developed based on the measurement of drain amylase levels. On the contrary, there exists a subgroup of patients where drains may have a role. In patients with high risk of pancreatic fistula formation, such as those having a soft pancreatic texture, small pancreatic duct and high body mass index, the placement of drains may give sentinel information about future clinical deterioration. The drain may thus help reduce failure-to-rescue rates. Conclusion: Despite much research, there are many unanswered questions regarding drains in pancreatic surgery. It is evident that routine drainage should be abandoned for a more selective strategy. Furthermore, what is needed is a postoperative warning score that early on can identify patients at risk of a pancreatic fistula, without the routine placement of drains.

TI  - Circulation of Waters in the Northwestern Part of the Bering Sea According to Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A study of water circulation in the northwestern part of the Bering Sea using AVISO satellite data on velocities of geostrophic currents from 2002 to 2017 showed a significantly variable dynamics of the surface waters. In January, the main current of the surface waters is directed toward the southwest along the continental slope in contrast to anticyclone water circulation in shelf. In July, the surface water current is oriented to the northeast along the continental slope, whereas cyclonic water circulation is dominant at shelf. The formation of winter mesoscale anticyclones is caused by a gain of low-temperature and low-saline shelf waters. The temporal variability of direction and velocity of summer currents is related to coastal upwelling, which is caused by the southern winds over the western part of the Bering Sea. The presence of upwelling and eddies should be considered one of the factors leading to the formation of an area with high chlorophyll concentration close to the coast during summer.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Analysis and Trends of the Drought Based on MODIS Data in Agricultural Areas, Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of the Drought Severity Index (DSI) in Romania and its validation based on other data sources (meteorological data, soil moisture content (SMC), agricultural production). Also, it is to assess the drought based on a multi-temporal analysis and trends of the DSI obtained from Terra MODIS satellite images. DSI is a standardized product based on evapotranspiration (ET) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), highlighting the differences over a certain period of time compared to the average. The study areas are located in Romania: three important agricultural lands (Oltenia Plain, Baragan Plain and Banat Plain), which have different environmental characteristics. MODIS products have been used over a period of 19 years (2001-2019) during the vegetation season of the agricultural crops (April-September). The results point out that those agricultural areas from the Baragan Plain and Oltenia Plain were more affected by drought than those from Banat Plain, especially in the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. Also, the drought intensity and the agricultural surfaces affected by drought decreased in the first part of the vegetation season (March-May) and increased in the last part (August-September) in all three study areas analyzed. All these results are confirmed by those of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA) indices.

TI  - "Our Brother-In-Law Harald Is Going to Sail": Russian History in the Ballads of Aleksey K. Tolstoy
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the ballads by Aleksey K. Tolstoy as a stage in the history of the genre. The attention is focused on structural and semantic transformations of the ballad canon in the poet's work, as well as on self-commentaries to his own texts presented in Tolstoy's epistolary heritage. The key thesis of the article is as follows. The ballad works by Tolstoy as a whole are an effort to transfer the plot on the origin of the hero, the debate on his legitimacy (sometimes ambiguous) onto the historical and ideological grounds. Such a deliberate ideologization of the ballad text was organically included into the context of mid-19th-century scientific and public discussions on the genesis and future fate of Russia and echoed with disputes about the dominance of European, Asian, or symbiosis of both, elements in its history. From an instrumental point of view, the poet's genre experiment was presented in relation to the romantic ballad by Vasily Zhukovsky as a consistently developed system of "minus-devices" that transformed, primarily, the levels of artistic modality, intonation, and plot-motif organization of the text. As it is shown in the work, the poet, basing on the plots of Karamzin's The History of the Russian State and his concept of the "Tatar Yoke", reflected his own view of national history in his ballads. Karamzin's main idea, which had an impact on Tolstoy's worldview and creative practice, was the idea of the originally European nature of Russia's statehood and culture and, consequently, the drastic distortion of the both caused by the influence from the Golden Horde. Works by S.S. Averintsev, V.I. Tyupa, and A.S. Yanushkevich on the historical poetics of the genre and by I. Yu. Vinitsky, T.T. Guzairov, A.L. Zorin, and V.S. Kiselev on the historical and ideological potential of Russian classical texts ( first of all, works by Zhukovsky as the founder of the ballad canon in Russian literature) have become the methodological basis of the study. The author also uses works by A.I. Reitblat in the field of biography studies. The study of Tolstoy's historical ballads allowed drawing the following conclusion. In the works that used the plots taken from the pre-Mongol period, the poet sought to place medieval Russia in the coordinates of the great European history, and put the Rurik dynasty on a par with the prominent Western royal families. Tolstoy modeled history according to the sample of the romantic ballad: he demonstrated the idyllic union of Russia and the Varangians in the fabric of artistic works in the semantic coordinates of love and marriage relations which were destroyed by the lawless invasion of the Horde, whose khans replaced the Scandinavians and threw their "seed" on Russian soil. The next problem that is formulated and partially solved in the article is the essence of Tolstoy's relationship with Zhukovsky's poetic heritage. The author of "Prince Serebrenni", in his correspondence, contrasted his "major" ballads with the "minor" works by "the first Russian Romanticist". The article also examines the echoes of Tolstoy's reputation, whose personal biography, in this respect similar to that of Zhukovsky, was burdened with rumors on the legality of the origin, creating a certain background for emphasizing the plot on family ties, which Tolstoy puts in the vicissitudes of medieval history.

TI  - Modelling and Analysis of Aerosol and Cloud-Precipitable Water Inter-Hemispheric Interactions of Aerosol-Satellite Data Using Ground Observation
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the seasonal and spatiotemporal variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm with cloud fraction (CF) and precipitable water (PW) from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI/Aura) as satellite-based and Aeronet Robotic Network (AERONET) as ground-based stations for the period from 2008 to 2019 and optimized from 2020 to 2025 using neural network model. The exact interaction of AOD-CF-PW remains a good area of scientific interest but has remained poorly represented. However, the idea of the statistical approach of data interpolation and extrapolation to extract AOD-CF-PW data gaps using inter-hemispheric approach of the Northern hemisphere (Ilorin 8.484 N, 4.675 E and Saada 31.626 N, 8.156 W) and Southern hemisphere (ICIPE-Mbita 0.432 S, 34.206 E and Skukuza 24.992 S, 31.587 E) of the African continent. An estimation of relative bias error values of both AODs-CF-PW data was validated by correlating the results and performing the standard deviation (SD) analysis. To conclude the interaction error in AOD-CF-PW values, root mean square error (RMSE), relative bias (RD), absolute bias (AD) and mean absolute error (MAE) were performed. Furthermore, to provide knowledge of major aerosols contributors over both hemispheres, an estimation of jet winds to see the zonal and meridional impact through 7 days kinematic back trajectories at various initial pressures was performed. Winter season of Skukuza presents correlation results of OMI-PW (r = 0.125), CF (r = - 0.041) and AERONET-derived-PW (r = - 0.075) and CF (r = - 0.010) with corresponding analysis of (%EE = 22.33), (RMSE = 0.017), (RB = 0.287), (MAE = 0.002), (SD = 0.285), (AD = 0.243). Interestingly, the Skukuza of the southern hemisphere during the month of winter shows the least value of (RMSE = 0.017), indicating good agreement of OMI and AERONET AODs. This result indicated that OMI satellite remote sensing does not give an accountable result of AOD-CF-PW interactions but depends more on geographic terrain.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols and cloud interaction remains highly important in the climatic process and its validation with space -based Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and ground-based observation of Aeronet Robotic Network (AERONET) is therefore essential. OMI and AERONET AODs was logrithmically subset and variations observed in both instruments show spatio-temporal quality of being more noticeable, which could lead to changes in the micro -physical scale of clouds and instrumental biases. In this study, we have examined the spatio-temporal OMI AODs variations over Banizoumbou and validated results using AERONET AOD, precipitable water and cloud fraction data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from the period between 2014 and 2018. Additionally, estimated the absolute mean bias values of both AODs, correlating the results and performing the mean and standard deviation analysis. To validate instrumental error in retrieving AOD values, we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with standard error of measurements and perform 7 day kinematic back trajectories at various initial pressures to estimate zonal and meridional jet winds. Additionally, the seasonal loading of aerosols from the Dust Surface Mass Concentration shows aerosols masking cloud. The results show that winter season has period of good AODs agreement and the absolute bias error and its standard deviation for OMI and AERONET AODs is 0.216 +/- 0.08. The correlation results obtained with cloud and precipitable water are 0.51, 0.32 and 0.20,-0.18 which show high monsoon AOD dominance the desert. It could be concluded that instrumental performance has spatio-temporal bias.

TI  - Ancient Burial Mounds - Stepping Stones for Semi-Natural Habitats in Agricultural Landscape
T2  - Ecologia Balkanica
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent agricultural intensification followed by land homogenization require for connectivity of remaining semi-natural habitats for biodiversity preservation. This study is the first attempt to assess the importance of Bulgarian ancient burial mounds (kurgans) as refuges for semi-natural vegetation and for the connectivity to other semi-natural lands based on remote sensing data. A set of 509 kurgans were selected and their main vegetation cover and the landscape within 200 m surrounding buffer were studied. The general kurgan characteristics as height and diameter of the base resemble dimensions reported for Ukraine and Hungary. Our results show the high level of kurgan isolation in Bulgaria. More than the half of the studied kurgans surroundings are occupied by over 75% of agricultural and urban or other artificial landscape. This finding emphasizes the kurgans' role for preservation of semi-natural habitats and their inhabitants. We highlight the importance of Bulgarian kurgans that save a cumulative area of semi-natural type equal to the 0.09% of the whole country territory. Kurgans could be treated as relictual landscape in highly modified matrix. The importance of kurgans for biodiversity conservation should encourage the local community to increase the education and activities for proper management ensuring their further protection.

TI  - Episodic ground deformation associated with geothermal energy production at the Guayabo Caldera, Costa Rica
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground response to the production of energy in geothermal fields can be observed in the form of ground displacement and seismic activity. Changes in the temperature, volume, pressure of the reservoir can culminate in surface deformation and in seismicity at the reservoir edges and/or near the production wells. Identifying the origin of the ground response enables controlled management of the reservoir and can help prevent damage to structures. Satellite remote sensing (InSAR) permits the study of the deformation at these sites with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, Central America has a dynamic atmosphere with considerable water vapour and constant growth of vegetation all year long, which leads to decorrelation between SAR images. Here we study the Dr. Alfredo Mainieri Protti geothermal field, located near Miravalles Volcano in the Northern Costa Rica volcanic arc. We measure the deformation associated with geothermal energy production using data from two satellites (ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1) between January 2015 and January 2017. The ALOS-2 data was used to obtain the extent of the affected area, and two StaMPS multi-temporal methods (Persistent Scatter (PS) InSAR, and Small Baselines(SB)) were applied to the Sentinel-1 data, to obtain the temporal pattern of the ground displacements. Results show a direct response of the ground to the extraction of fluids. The pattern of deformation obtained with ALOS-2 is spatially correlated with the geothermal field, and with the recorded seismicity. Between April 2015 to October 2016, periods of uplift and subsidence were observed with values between-2.0 to 3.0 cm every 120 days, linked to changes in the amount of fluids extracted from the reservoir. The results also show the ability of the reservoir to recover rapidly following a decrease in extraction rate. This work has shown that even in this tropical region it is possible to monitor anthropogenic ground motion using InSAR. This is beneficial for the Central American region, as satellite images are becoming more frequently acquired and available, and can be used to boost the monitoring of seismic regions, volcanic activity and anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Landscape Changes from VHR Images in Three Different Permafrost Areas in the Western Russian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study highlights the usefulness of very high resolution (VHR) images to detect various types of disturbances over permafrost areas using three example regions in different permafrost zones. The study focuses on detecting subtle changes in land cover classes, thermokarst water bodies, river dynamics, retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) and infrastructure in the Yamal Peninsula, Urengoy and Pechora regions. Very high-resolution optical imagery (sub-meter) derived from WorldView, QuickBird and GeoEye in conjunction with declassified Corona images were involved in the analyses. The comparison of very high-resolution images acquired in 2003/2004 and 2016/2017 indicates a pronounced increase in the extent of tundra and a slight increase of land covered by water. The number of water bodies increased in all three regions, especially in discontinuous permafrost, where 14.86% of new lakes and ponds were initiated between 2003 and 2017. The analysis of the evolution of two river channels in Yamal and Urengoy indicates the dominance of erosion during the last two decades. An increase of both rivers' lengths and a significant widening of the river channels were also observed. The number and total surface of RTS in the Yamal Peninsula strongly increased between 2004 and 2016. A mean annual headwall retreat rate of 1.86 m/year was calculated. Extensive networks of infrastructure occurred in the Yamal Peninsula in the last two decades, stimulating the initiation of new thermokarst features. The significant warming and seasonal variations of the hydrologic cycle, in particular, increased snow water equivalent acted in favor of deepening of the active layer; thus, an increasing number of thermokarst lake formations.

TI  - Intra- and Inter-Annual Variability of North Brazil Current Rings Using Angular Momentum Eddy Detection and Tracking Algorithm: Observations From 1993 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate intra- and inter-annual variability of North Brazil Current (NBC) rings, angular momentum eddy detection and tracking algorithm (AMEDA) was used for identification of their occurrence, trajectories, and parameters. Based on 24 years (1993-2016) of geopotential height and geostrophic current fields reanalysis data from ARMOR 3D (1/4 degrees), we identified an average rate of five NBC rings shed by year. The rings present an average lifetime of 15.3 (+/- 5.4) weeks, average speed-based radius (R-max) of 139.8 (+/- 23.6) km, and mean sea surface height anomaly (SSHa) of 9.4 (+/- 4.0) cm. The mean observed maximum azimuthal velocity (V-max) was 0.27 (+/- 0.08) m/s, while the averaged Rossby number (Ro) value was 0.08 (+/- 0.04) and averaged kinetic energy (KE) was of 255.3 (+/- 154.8) cm(2)/s(2). NBC rings have larger dimensions, rotate faster, live less, and transfer more energy in boreal winter months. In contrast, those shed during boreal summer and early fall last longer, have smaller diameters and carry less energy. Besides, the analysis of ring merging pointed that the interaction between NBC rings generated a significantly increase in ring energy (52%), and velocity (22%). Finally, we observed the vertical anomalies temperature and salinity profiles, which indicated a thermocline deepening and sinking of coastal and tropical waters due to NBC rings downwelling. This study emphasizes the robustness and efficiency of AMEDA for studying rings in the ocean and further theorizes possible impacts of NBC ring on ocean physical and biogeochemical features in the Western Tropical North Atlantic.

TI  - Seasonal Variability of Temperature Fronts in the Black Sea from Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure and seasonal variability of temperature frontal zones and fronts in the Black Sea are studied on the basis of a modern high-resolution satellite data set. The distributions of the total temperature gradient allow us to distinguish the following frontal zones: the western frontal zone; the Turkish coastal frontal zone; the Anatolian upwelling frontal zone; the southeastern coastal frontal zone; northeastern, Crimea, and Kerch-Feodosia frontal zones; and the frontal zone of the deep part of the Black Sea. Large-scale fronts are identified within most frontal zones based on an analysis of distributions of meridional and zonal temperature gradients. It is shown that the combined effect of large-scale processes (seasonal warming and cooling of waters and their advection by the Rim Current) and regional factors (river discharge, coastline configuration, shelf width, development of upwelling, and formation of coastal eddies) produces significant spatiotemporal variability of the temperature field and, hence, frontal zones and fronts. It is ascertained that most fronts exist for several months. In the northern part of the sea, the fronts intensify mainly in winter due to an increase in the contrasts between warm Rim Current waters and colder coastal waters. The frontal zones near the southern coast of the sea intensify mainly in late spring-summer during the spring flood, the development of Anatolian upwelling, and active warming of waters in the eastern part of the sea.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to trace the transition to metamodernism as the dominant cultural logic of modern society. The article presents the development of the loft style and the artistic collage as examples of changes in modern visual practices. The authors demonstrate how the new cultural logic is reflected in the production of the space of an art object and urban environment generally. The article shows the similarity of the semiotics of loft design and the artistic collage, which reflects the emergence of a new cultural logic of metamodernism. The article presents the evolution of views on the state of contemporary culture in the framework of the concepts of postmodernism and metamodernism. The relevance of this study is associated with the formation of a new attitude to visuality in the metamodernism concept. The proposed approach demonstrates a new principle of working with the phenomenon of visualization, both in terms of detail and generalization. The authors explore the concept of loft style in the context of general trends in visual practices during the transition from the postmodern culture to the metamodern one. An analysis of the loft aesthetics makes it possible to see the development of postmodernism as a common worldview paradigm of the late twentieth century. In turn, changes in the loft-style technique become markers of the transition to metamodernism. The loft object demonstrates the layering of senses and meanings, historical eras and aesthetic preferences. The loft style reflects the influence of aesthetic, technical and communicative preferences on the formation of a specific men-environment paradigm. The comparison of the loft-style and collage practices allows concluding about the post-modern art space practice and its implementation in an urban concept. This appears as a single process of the postmodern paradigm development realized on a different scale. The loft and artistic collage techniques of the last quarter of the twentieth century served as the basis for the metamodernist technology for constructing the historicity (authenticity) of the environment. At the same time, an important moment in space is the entourage of authenticity, coupled with cutting-edge urban technology. Metamodernism understands the visual image as a phenomenon of consciousness, inscribed in the complex system of interactions, where physicality, sociality, psychology, etc. are present. Anthropological projections are conditions, not means for expressing meanings. The article proposes an original approach to the phenomenon of visualization: visual image is presented as a result of the formation of a complex semiotic system which reflects the experience of a multi-level spatial environment.

AB  - Background: Traditionally, breast cancer is staged using TNM criteria: tumor size (T), nodal status (N), and metastasis (M). The Oncotype DX assay provides a recurrence score (RS) based on genomics that predicts the likelihood of distant recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-)/lymph node-negative (LN-) tumors.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed themedical records of patients with ER+/HER2-/LN- breast cancer tumorswhowere evaluated between 2007 and 2017 with Oncotype DX RS. We compared the RS to tumor size, patient age, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and LN immunohistochemistry to assess for factors that may independently predict recurrence risk. We also compared tumor size to tumor grade.Results: The data set included 296 tumors: 248 ER+/PR-positive (PR+)/HER2- and 48 ER+/PR-negative (PR-)/HER2-. RS ranged from 0 to 66, patient age ranged from 33 to 77 years, and tumor size ranged from 1 to 65 mm. No significant correlation was found between age and RS (r=-0.073, P=0.208). PR- tumors had a significantly higher RS regardless of size (PR- mean RS 30.8 +/- 12.7; PR+ mean RS 16.3 +/- 7.3; t(53)=7.6, P<0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between tumor size and RS for all tumors (r=-0.028, P=0.635), and this finding remained true for the PR+ tumor subgroup (r=0.114, P=0.072). However, a significant negative correlation was seen between tumor size and RS in the PR- subgroup (r=-0.343, P=0.017). Further analysis to ensure that differences in tumor grade did not account for this correlation showed equal distribution of well differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated tumors with no significant correlation between tumor size and grade.Conclusion: Increasing tumor size may not be associated with increasing biological aggressiveness. Traditionally, smaller tumors are thought to be lower risk and larger tumors higher risk, with a tendency to use chemotherapy with large tumors. However, our data showed a negative correlation between tumor size and RS in the PR- subgroup. A tumor with PR negativity that reaches a large size without metastasizing may suggest a favorable tumor biology. These tumors may not receive as much benefit from chemotherapy as previously thought. Also, the higher RS seen in smaller PR- tumors may demonstrate PR- status as a predictor for higher risk of distant recurrence. We propose that all tumors meeting the ER+/PR-/LN- criteria, regardless of size, should be considered for genotyping, with the RS used to guide chemotherapy benefit.

TI  - DYNAMIC OF COASTAL INUNDATION IN JAKARTA BASED ON DATA MULTI-TEMPORAL SATELLITES USING WATER INDEX AND RADAR POLARIZATION
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining baseline data of remote sensing systems active and passive has many advantages in monitoring coastal inundation dynamically. It has advanced the surface water information gaps in coastal areas, especially areas covered by clouds and shadows. The main objective of this study was to assess the dynamics of coastal inundation in Jakarta based on multi-temporal data optics of Landsat 8 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel 1A. The method of this research used two water index algorithms. They are Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) based on spectral reflectance values and empirical formulas. The other method is using the coefficient backscattering of water from a single polarization of Vertical Verticals (VV) and Vertical Horizontal (VH). The study results show that the use of both satellite data baseline of 8, 9, 15, and 16 days is quite effective, applying inundation dynamics for 8-49 days. Based on the threshold value of MNDWI > 0.123 and the backscattering coefficient of -19dB are quite efficient to extract satellite data information. The empirical algorithms result in the feature of inundation, especially along the coastal dikes, reservoirs, mangrove ecosystems, and built-up lands. Satellite monitoring results show that the peak of inundation occurred on 30 May 2016 and was still visible on 15 June 2016. The combination of remote sensing methods is quite effective and efficient for monitoring inundation dynamically.

TI  - Drone data reveal heterogeneity in tundra greenness and phenology not captured by satellites
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data across scales are required to monitor ecosystem responses to rapid warming in the Arctic and to interpret tundra greening trends. Here, we tested the correspondence among satellite- and drone-derived seasonal change in tundra greenness to identify optimal spatial scales for vegetation monitoring on Qikiqtaruk-Herschel Island in the Yukon Territory, Canada. We combined time-series of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multispectral drone imagery and satellite data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and MODIS) with ground-based observations for two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found high cross-season correspondence in plot mean greenness (drone-satellite Spearman's rho 0.67-0.87) and pixel-by-pixel greenness (drone-satellite R-2 0.58-0.69) for eight one-hectare plots, with drones capturing lower NDVI values relative to the satellites. We identified a plateau in the spatial variation of tundra greenness at distances of around half a metre in the plots, suggesting that these grain sizes are optimal for monitoring such variation in the two most common vegetation types on the island. We further observed a notable loss of seasonal variation in the spatial heterogeneity of landscape greenness (46.2%-63.9%) when aggregating from ultra-fine-grain drone pixels (approx. 0.05 m) to the size of medium-grain satellite pixels (10-30 m). Finally, seasonal changes in drone-derived greenness were highly correlated with measurements of leaf-growth in the ground-validation plots (mean Spearman's rho 0.70). These findings indicate that multispectral drone measurements can capture temporal plant growth dynamics across tundra landscapes. Overall, our results demonstrate that novel technologies such as drone platforms and compact multispectral sensors allow us to study ecological systems at previously inaccessible scales and fill gaps in our understanding of tundra ecosystem processes. Capturing fine-scale variation across tundra landscapes will improve predictions of the ecological impacts and climate feedbacks of environmental change in the Arctic.

TI  - Disparities of Management of the Axilla in Women With Clinically Node Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In women with clinically node-negative breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy is the first step in axillary staging. A randomized trial published in 2013 concluded that patients with sentinel lymph node micrometastases (N1mi) do not benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We hypothesized that disparities exist in management of the axilla in node-negative patients.Methods: We included women aged >40 years with nonmetastatic, clinically node-negative breast cancer from 2014 to 2016 in the National Cancer Database. Women treated neoadjuvantly, with large tumors (cT4), or no tumor (cT0) were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression identified patient and facility characteristics associated with undergoing ALND as first axillary surgery and completion ALND in the setting of N1mi disease.Results: Of 273,951 patients, 22,898 (8%) underwent ALND first. These patients were more likely to be Hispanic (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.32), have Medicare (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24), be uninsured (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.53), have lower educational attainment (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.32), be treated at a community hospital (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.52, 1.74), or reside in the South (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.26). In the sentinel lymph node biopsy first group, 8,882 (4%) were classified as N1mi and 1,872 (21%) underwent subsequent ALND. These patients were more likely to be Hispanic (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.42) and have the lowest income (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.27).Conclusion: Disparities persist in implementation of evidence-based management of the axilla in women with clinically node-negative breast cancer.

TI  - Personalized surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis - using machine learning adapted to HCV status
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & Aims: Refining hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance programs requires improved individual risk prediction. Thus, we aimed to develop algorithms based on machine learning approaches to predict the risk of HCC more accurately in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, according to their virological status.Methods: Patients with compensated biopsy-proven HCV-related cirrhosis from the French ANRS CO12 CirVir cohort were included in a semi-annual HCC surveillance program. Three prognostic models for HCC occurrence were built, using (i) Fine-Gray regression as a benchmark, (ii) single decision tree (DT), and (iii) random survival forest for competing risks survival (RSF). Model performance was evaluated from C-indexes validated externally in the ANRS CO22 Hepather cohort (n = 668 enrolled between 08/2012-01/2014).Results: Out of 836 patients analyzed, 156 (19%) developed HCC and 434 (52%) achieved sustained virological response (SVR) (median follow-up 63 months). Fine-Gray regression models identified 6 independent predictors of HCC occurrence in patients before SVR (past excessive alcohol intake, genotype 1, elevated AFP and GGT, low platelet count and albuminemia) and 3 in patients after SVR (elevated AST, low platelet count and shorter prothrombin time). DT analysis confirmed these associations but revealed more complex interactions, yielding 8 patient groups with varying cancer risks and predictors depending on SVR achievement. On RSF analysis, the most important predictors of HCC varied by SVR status (non-SVR: platelet count, GGT, AFP and albuminemia; SVR: prothrombin time, ALT, age and platelet count). Externally validated C-indexes before/after SVR were 0.64/0.64 [Fine-Gray], 0.60/62 [DT] and 0.71/0.70 [RSF].Conclusions: Risk factors for hepatocarcinogenesis differ according to SVR status. Machine learning algorithms can refine HCC risk assessment by revealing complex interactions between cancer predictors. Such approaches could be used to develop more cost-effective tailored surveillance programs.Lay summary: Patients with HCV-related cirrhosis must be included in liver cancer surveillance programs, which rely on ultrasound examination every 6 months. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening is hampered by sensitivity issues, leading to late cancer diagnoses in a substantial number of patients. Refining surveillance periodicity and modality using more sophisticated imaging techniques such as MRI may only be cost-effective in patients with the highest HCC incidence. Herein, we demonstrate how machine learning algorithms (i.e. data-driven mathematical models to make predictions or decisions), can refine individualized risk prediction.

TI  - Evaluation of four classification algorithms of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images to identify forest cover in highly fragmented regions in Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of land use and forest cover and assessing their changes is essential in the design of strategies to manage and preserve the natural resources of a country, and remote sensing have been extensively used with this purpose. By comparing four classification algorithms and two types of satellite images, the objective of the research was to identify the type of algorithm and satellite image that allows higher global accuracy in the identification of forest cover in highly fragmented landscapes. The study included a treatment arrangement with three factors and six randomly selected blocks within the Huetar Norte Zone in Costa Rica. More accurate results were obtained for classifications based on Sentinel-2 images compared to Landsat-8 images. The best classification algorithms were Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine or Neural Networks, and they yield better results than Minimum Distance Classification. There was no interaction among image type and classification methods, therefore, Sentinel-2 images can be used with any of the three best algorithms, but the best result was the combination of Sentinel-2 and Support Vector Machine. An additional factor included in the study was the image acquisition date. There were significant differences among months during which the image was acquired and an interaction between the classification algorithm and this factor was detected. The best results correspond to images obtained in April, and the lower to September, month that corresponds with the period of higher rainfall in the region studied. The higher global accuracy identifying forest cover is obtained with Sentinel-2 images from the dry season in combination with Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network image classification methods.

TI  - Satellite-Based Analysis of Extreme Land Surface Temperatures and Diurnal Variability Across the Hottest Place on Earth
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding land-atmosphere interactions in extremely hot environment offers insights on how such interactions will change in a warmer world. For this reason, scientists from a wide range of fields, including hydrology, meteorology, ecology and geology, have been interested in identifying the hottest places on Earth. A study back in 2006 based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data identified the Lut Desert in Iran as the "thermal pole of the Earth." Since then, Lut Desert has been regarded as the hottest place on Earth with the record temperature of 70.7 degrees C observed in 2005. Using the latest MODIS-derived LST collection 6 which offers an improved LST estimates with a high spatial resolution (1 km), we investigate the hottest temperatures, as well as its diurnal variability in Lut Desert. The results show that Lut Desert is much hotter than previously thought with a record LST of 80.83 degrees C in 2018 (approximately 10 degrees C higher than previously reported LST) mainly due to improvements in the new LST estimations from space, and use of higher spatial resolution of the data. Further, our results show that Lut Desert has an incredible diurnal variability range, up to around 71 degrees C depending on the season.

TI  - Paroemias as Explication of Human Qualities in the English Language
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies human qualities and cultural features through a zoomorphic cultural code. The authors analyzed English paroemias, which are the most distinctive and culture-specific language system, which contributes to define the native speaker's worldview features. As a result of the analysis, the authors defined groups of paroemias in which the description of human qualities was found in paroemiological units and figurative content which are related to cultural and national features of the English ethnic group. A component analysis of denotative space of the English paroemias showed that the most relevant for the British are such zoomorphic images as: dog, sheep, cat, horse, ox. The cultural and linguistic specifics, based on paroemias studied, are implicit and serve to create the expressiveness and a figurative meaning and, therefore, are a part of the connotative macro-component. The study, presented here, consulted A. A. Khazan's English paroemiological dictionary "Russian-English-Latin dictionary of winged words and expressions" (Smolensk: Rusich, 2001), ethnolinguistic and linguocultural scientific works. The target of research is zoonymous proverbs and sayings in the English language. The research focuses on proverbs and sayings zoonyms, in the semantics of which there are cultural and linguistic components characterizing human qualities. The research methods include descriptive, statistic, transformational, distributive and componential analyzes.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in colorectal cancers with radioactive tracer; is it an efficient method?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: The sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), as most other regions, are prone to tumoral invasion. In colorectal cancers, they can help the higher levels of pathological examination techniques. Aims: We attempted to investigate the efficiency of the use of radioactive tracer in identifying SLNs in colorectal cancers using the same pathological technique. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional, single-center study was carried out from 2014 to august 2016 at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Subjects and Methods: The study population included 100 patients with colorectal cancers. We used a radioactive tracer to detect SLNs and to compare the number and involvement of SLNs and non-SLNs generally and in terms of the tumor site. For pathological study, we used the same conventional method in both the groups. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) with Chi-square and Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, ANOVA test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: SLNs were detected in 89 of 100 patients. All the remaining 11 patients had T4 lower rectal cancer and the injection was performed ex vivo. We noted ten cases of upstaging due to SLN mapping and nine cases of false negative. Thus, the sensitivity was found to be 43.75%at and the accuracy was 78.65%. Conclusions: We used the same traditional method in both the groups, and our sensitivity, accuracy and upstaging rate were fewer than similar studies. Our recommendation for further studies is to use intensive SLN biopsy method in both groups of SLNs and non-SLNs.

TI  - Achievements and challenges of lymphatic filariasis elimination in Sierra Leone
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryLymphatic filariasis or elephantiasis is targeted for elimination in Sierra Leone, with annual mass treatment with ivermectin and albendazole, and required coverage was achieved in all 12 districts annually. In 2017, transmission assessment survey (TAS) was conducted in eight districts to assess whether treatment can be stopped and pre-TAS was conducted in six other districts to assess whether TAS can be conducted. Eight TAS districts were surveyed as four evaluation units (EU), and a school-based survey was conducted in 1703-1926 children aged 6-7 years from 30 clusters per EU. Six pre-TAS districts were surveyed with one sentinel and one/two spot check sites per district and 300-350 persons aged >= 5 years were tested. All tests were using the Filariasis Test Strips with finger prick blood samples. There were 0-7 positive cases in each TAS EU respectively, all below the critical cut-off value, confirming that mass treatment was no longer needed in these eight districts, a significant progress towards LF elimination. One district had prevalence of <1% in two sites and qualified for TAS, while other five districts had sites with prevalence >2%, suggesting that mass treatment needs to continue. Repeated failure of pre-TAS poses great challenge to eliminate LF in Sierra Leone.YMB is the former NTDP manager and coordinated the MDAs with AC and MS. JBK designed and oversaw the early NTDP and baseline surveys. JP, MB designed and led the TAS, pre-TAS field work data collection. MB and VRS conducted the data analysis. VRS and MH reanalysed the coverage data. YZ produced the point prevalence map. MH drafted the manuscript. MH and YZ revised the manuscript. All authors reviewed and approved the final manuscript.BackgroundLymphatic filariasis (LF) is targeted for elimination in Sierra Leone. Epidemiological coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole had been reported >65% in all 12 districts annually. Eight districts qualified to implement transmission assessment survey (TAS) in 2013 but were deferred until 2017 due to the Ebola outbreak (2014-2016). In 2017, four districts qualified for conducting a repeat pre-TAS after completing three more rounds of MDA and the final two districts were also eligible to implement a pre-TAS.Methodology/Principal findingsFor TAS, eight districts were surveyed as four evaluation units (EU). A school-based survey was conducted in children aged 6-7 years from 30 clusters per EU. For pre-TAS, one sentinel and one spot check site per district (with 2 spot check sites in Bombali) were selected and 300-350 persons aged 5 years and above were selected. For both surveys, finger prick blood samples were tested using the Filariasis Test Strips (FTS).For TAS, 7,143 children aged 6-7 years were surveyed across four EUs, and positives were found in three EUs, all below the critical cut-off value for each EU. For the repeat pre-TAS/pre-TAS, 3,994 persons over five years of age were surveyed. The Western Area Urban had FTS prevalence of 0.7% in two sites and qualified for TAS, while other five districts had sites with antigenemia prevalence >2%: 9.1-25.9% in Bombali, 7.5-19.4% in Koinadugu, 6.1-2.9% in Kailahun, 1.3-2.3% in Kenema and 1.7% - 3.7% in Western Area Rural.Conclusions/SignificanceEight districts in Sierra Leone have successfully passed TAS1 and stopped MDA, with one more district qualified for conducting TAS1, a significant progress towards LF elimination. However, great challenges exist in eliminating LF from the whole country with repeated failure of pre-TAS in border districts. Effort needs to be intensified to achieve LF elimination.

TI  - A Simple Spatio-Temporal Data Fusion Method Based on Linear Regression Coefficient Compensation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing images are of great significance in the dynamic monitoring of the Earth's surface. However, due to cloud contamination and the hardware limitations of sensors, it is difficult to obtain image sequences with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Combining coarse resolution images, such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), with fine spatial resolution images, such as Landsat or Sentinel-2, has become a popular means to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient enhanced linear regression spatio-temporal fusion method (ELRFM), which uses fine spatial resolution images acquired at two reference dates to establish a linear regression model for each pixel and each band between the image reflectance and the acquisition date. The obtained regression coefficients are used to help allocate the residual error between the real coarse resolution image and the simulated coarse resolution image upscaled by the high spatial resolution result of the linear prediction. The developed method consists of four steps: (1) linear regression (LR), (2) residual calculation, (3) distribution of the residual and (4) singular value correction. The proposed method was tested in different areas and using different sensors. The results show that, compared to the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and the flexible spatio-temporal data fusion (FSDAF) method, the ELRFM performs better in capturing small feature changes at the fine image scale and has high prediction accuracy. For example, in the red band, the proposed method has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) (ELRFM: 0.0123 vs. STARFM: 0.0217 vs. FSDAF: 0.0224 vs. LR: 0.0221). Furthermore, the lightweight algorithm design and calculations based on the Google Earth Engine make the proposed method computationally less expensive than the STARFM and FSDAF.

TI  - Mapping natural resource collection areas from household survey data in Southern Africa
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - As conservation landscapes are threatened by global change, there is a growing need to understand relationships between human livelihoods and environmental processes. This often involves integrating multiple data sources capturing different scales of measurement. Participatory methods have emerged as a means to accomplish this, but are hampered by a wide range of challenges associated with data collection and translation. Here, we present a novel methodology for mapping human use of natural resources that overcomes many of the difficulties faced in participatory mapping. Based in the world's largest terrestrial transfrontier conservation area, we couple household surveys with in-situ fine-scale mapping to identify key resource areas that support local livelihoods. This allows for a spatially referenced human use 'footprint' that can be combined with remotely-sensed data measuring environmental impact. This methodology is applicable across contexts and has implications for landscape management and conservation.

TI  - Mining and Tailings Dam Detection in Satellite Imagery Using Deep Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the combination of free cloud computing, free open-source software, and deep learning methods to analyze a real, large-scale problem: the automatic country-wide identification and classification of surface mines and mining tailings dams in Brazil. Locations of officially registered mines and dams were obtained from the Brazilian government open data resource. Multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, obtained and processed at the Google Earth Engine platform, was used to train and test deep neural networks using the TensorFlow 2 application programming interface (API) and Google Colaboratory (Colab) platform. Fully convolutional neural networks were used in an innovative way to search for unregistered ore mines and tailing dams in large areas of the Brazilian territory. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by the discovery of 263 mines that do not have an official mining concession. This exploratory work highlights the potential of a set of new technologies, freely available, for the construction of low cost data science tools that have high social impact. At the same time, it discusses and seeks to suggest practical solutions for the complex and serious problem of illegal mining and the proliferation of tailings dams, which pose high risks to the population and the environment, especially in developing countries.

TI  - Validation of the 2018 FIGO Classification for Cervical Cancer: Lymphovascular Space Invasion Should Be Considered in IB1 Stage
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe purpose of modifying a tumor staging system is to incorporate already well-established prognostic factors, allowing one to stratify cases and leading to tailored treatment approaches. Although lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) has been described as an independent risk-factor of recurrence in early-stage cervical cancer and defined intermediate and high-risk cervical cancer according to the ESGO (European Society of Gynaecological Oncology) guidelines, this factor remains controversial and was not included in the last revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. The aim of the present study was to determine whether LVSI has an impact on the prognosis of IB1 patients according to 2018 FIGO classification through two French prospective multicentric cohorts. Our results highlighted that LVSI was associated with a significantly decreased 5-year DFS in IB1 2018 FIGO stage compared to negative LVSI. Particular attention should be paid to LVSI status in early-stage cervical cancer for a more precise risk assessment and we suggest that LVSI may be considered in the new 2018 FIGO classification.Background: The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) in IB1 stage of the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification for cervical cancer. Methods: A secondary analysis of two French prospective multicentric trials on Sentinel Lymph node biopsy for cervical cancer was performed. Patients with 2009 FIGO IB1 stage who underwent radical surgery between January 2005 and July 2012 from 28 French expert centers were included. The stage was modified retrospectively according to the new 2018 FIGO staging system. Results: According to the 2009 FIGO classification, 246 patients had IB1 disease stage and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up was 48 months (4-127). Twenty patients (8.1%) experienced a recurrence, and the 5-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) was 90.0%. Compared to 2018 IB1 staged patients, new IB2 had significantly decreased 5-year DFS, 78.6% vs. 92.9%, p = 0.006 whereas IIIC patients had similar 5-year DFS (91.7%, p = 0.95). In the subgroup of patients with FIGO 2018 IB1 stage, the presence of LVSI was associated with a significant decrease in DFS (82.5% vs. 95.8%, p = 0.04). Conclusions: LVSI is associated with decreased 5-year DFS in IB1 2018 FIGO stage and LVSI status should be considered in early-stage cervical cancer for a more precise risk assessment.

TI  - Monitoring land surface temperature in Bahir Dar city and its surrounding using Landsat images
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is the burning issue in the world since it affects climate and environment at local, regional and global level. Mainly it resulted from urbanization and its associated extreme Land -use and Land-cover (LULC) changes. Therefore, monitoring of LULC alteration is a significant component in examining of LST variation and applying sustainable mitigation measures. The research has the objec-tive to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns of LST and its variation with LULC composition in Bahir Dar city and its surrounding from 1987 to 2017 with fifteen-year intervals using Landsat images. Image pre-processing was done to retrieve NDVI, NDBI, LST and LULC, and urban-rural gradient analysis and LST Intensity (LSTI) were computed. As the result shows that urban areas of Bahir Dar city rapidly expanded since 1987. The mean LST values increased to 34.5 celcius in 1987 to 37.57 celcius in 2002 and decreased to 34.57 celcius in 2017. Paved surface and agricultural land exhibited higher LST values whereas waterbody and vegeta-tion experienced lower LST. The result also shows that LST has a positive relationship with NDBI (1987: R2 = 0.51; 2002: R2 = 0.48; and 2017: R2 = 0.4) and negative relationship with NDVI (1987: R2 = 0.24; 2002: R2 = 0.25; and 2017: R2 = 0.33). The LST increased towards sub-urban areas and LSTI was higher in the distance between 4 and 10 km. The results of this study are significant for urban planners to imple-ment sustainable LST mitigation strategies and create a conducive living environment in Bahir Dar city. & COPY; 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Application of Reflectance Ratios on High-Resolution Satellite Imagery to Remotely Identify Eucalypt Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scale and accessibility of passive global surveillance have rapidly increased over time. This provides an opportunity to calibrate the performance of models, algorithms, and reflectance ratios between remote-sensing devices. Here, we test the sensitivity and specificity of the Eucalypt chlorophyll-a reflectance ratio (ECARR) and Eucalypt chlorophyll-b reflectance ratio (ECBRR) to remotely identify eucalypt vegetation in Queensland, Australia. We compare the reflectance ratio values from Sentinel-2 and Planet imagery across four sites of known vegetation composition. All imagery was transformed to reflectance values, and Planet imagery was additionally scaled to harmonize across Planet scenes. ECARR can identify eucalypt vegetation remotely with high sensitivity but shows low specificity and is impacted by the density of the vegetation. ECBRR reflectance ratios show similar sensitivity and specificity when identifying eucalypt vegetation but with values an order of magnitude smaller than ECARR. We find that ECARR was better at identifying eucalypt vegetation in the Sentinel-2 imagery than Planet imagery. ECARR can serve as a general chlorophyll indicator but is not a specific index to identify Eucalyptus vegetation with certainty.

TI  - A synergy of linear model and wavelet analysis towards space-time characterization of aerosol optical depth (AOD) during pre-monsoon season (2007-2016) over Indian sub-continent
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The pre-monsoon aerosol concentration plays a significant role in modifying precipitation amount over the In-dian sub-continent. A large variety of aerosol from different sources produces a complex radiative and climate response through the interaction with the hydrometeorological parameters. In this study, we analyzed the spacetime dynamics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in relation to the meteorological and surface parameters over Indian sub-continent during pre-monsoon season from 2007 to 2016. The level-3 daily aerosol products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) were used. The IMD gridded rainfall and temperature, ECMWF derived RH and wind velocity, and GLADS derived soil moisture data were also used at daily time scale. For the space-time model, the Mann-Kendall trend test and a pixel-based multiple linear regression were used, while, wavelet transformation was used on these daily observations for analyzing periodicities of AOD. The time-series average shows moderate to high AOD (0.4-0.8), including a consistent positive anomaly in the Indo-Gangetic basin (IGP) in north India. A significant inter-annual variation is also observed both in MODIS and MISR datasets. The trend statistics shows an increasing trend of aerosol concentration in the eastern and southern India. The linear regression shows a variable response of AOD with changing magnitude of meteorological factors. However, a substantial spatial coverage of significantly decreased AOD is observed with increasing soil moisture content (beta <-0.04). The wavelet analysis manifests the abundances of 32-128 days of cycle with a periodic interjection of 8-32 days of cycle suggesting occurrence of fine and coarse mode aerosols events, respectively. The coherency of time series AOD and other covariates shows varying leading and lagging dynamics in these two principal periodicities. The findings, however, evidenced a notable difference in the space-time patterns of AOD in MODIS and MISR datasets. The analyzed AOD cycles are coincided with the Madden-Julian-Oscillation (MJO) that recurs every 30-60 days interval. The findings also support the theoretical proposition of elevated heat pump theory (EHP) driven by fine mode aerosols for occurring pre-monsoon and monsoon precipitation over the Indian sub-continent. The analyzed periodicity of AOD can provide useful insights in studying the short/long term variability of precipitation over polluted environments during the pre-monsoon season.

TI  - Estimating Plant Pasture Biomass and Quality from UAV Imaging across Queensland's Rangelands
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research was to test recent developments in the use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)/drones to map both pasture quantity as biomass yield and pasture quality as the proportions of key pasture nutrients, across a selected range of field sites throughout the rangelands of Queensland. Improved pasture management begins with an understanding of the state of the resource base, UAV based methods can potentially achieve this at improved spatial and temporal scales. This study developed machine learning based predictive models of both pasture measures. UAV-based structure from motion photogrammetry provided a measure of yield from overlapping high resolution visible colour imagery. Pasture nutrient composition was estimated from the spectral signatures of visible near infrared hyperspectral UAV sensing. An automated pasture height surface modelling technique was developed, tested and used along with field site measurements to predict further estimates across each field site. Both prior knowledge and automated predictive modelling techniques were employed to predict yield and nutrition. Pasture height surface modelling was assessed against field measurements using a rising plate meter, results reported correlation coefficients (R-2) ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 for both woodland and grassland field sites. Accuracy of the predictive modelling was determined from further field measurements of yield and on average indicated an error of 0.8 t ha(-1) in grasslands and 1.3 t ha(-1) in mixed woodlands across both modelling approaches. Correlation analyses between measures of pasture quality, acid detergent fibre and crude protein (ADF, CP), and spectral reflectance data indicated the visible red (651 nm) and red-edge (759 nm) regions were highly correlated (ADF R-2 = 0.9 and CP R-2 = 0.5 mean values). These findings agreed with previous studies linking specific absorption features with grass chemical composition. These results conclude that the practical application of such techniques, to efficiently and accurately map pasture yield and quality, is possible at the field site scale; however, further research is needed, in particular further field sampling of both yield and nutrient elements across such a diverse landscape, with the potential to scale up to a satellite platform for broader scale monitoring.

TI  - Hydro-physical properties of soil and pasture vegetation coverage under animal trampling
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil compaction and pasture degradation are often due to the pressure exerted by the animals' hooves. In this sense, this study aimed to verify possible changes in the soil and changes in the pasture vegetation coverage due to animal trampling. Thus, a study was carried out on a farm in the 'Agreste' region of Pernambuco, Brazil. Soil samples were collected before and after the grazing period, with 36 points regularly distributed in an area of 40 x 40 m managed under continuous grazing, with a stocking rate of 12 AU ha(-1). At each point, density, total porosity, humidity, and penetration resistance of the soil at a depth of 0-0.10 m, as well as hydraulic conductivity and organic matter in the soil surface, were determined. Before and after grazing, images from the Sentinel-2A satellite were also obtained to observe the response pattern of pasture vegetation over time using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Pasture Vegetation Coverage (PVC). The physical-hydric attributes of the soil were subjected to factor analysis. NDVI and PVC maps were evaluated for spatial variability. After the grazing period, there was a change in the attributes of the soil under study due to the animal trampling. Remote sensing (NDVI and PVC) highlighted patterns of variation, such as the reduction of pasture and possible areas of preference for the animals.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The works of F. M. Dostoevsky, representing one of the peaks of Russian and world literature, consistently attracts attention not only of literary critics, but also a range of specialists from other subjects in humanities. It appears that it may in no small way be explained by the fact that Dostoevsky was not only a writer, but also a thinker. Moreover, it is possible that as a thinker Dostoevsky exerted and continues to exert even more influence than as a writer, despite the conventions of such division. Dostoevsky's artistic and ideological synthesis and evolution reflected an epoch characterized by a combination of traditional and modernized principles. It is important to reconstruct the logic of Dostoevsky's ideological and worldview evolution, and to consider this issue in terms of the philosophical and worldview reference frame. A crucial link in the worldview' s evolution of Dostoevsky came to be a transition from early to mature writings, developed during Siberian period, i.e. serving his sentence in prison, in exile, and military service under the verdict of the court in the case of Mikhail Butashevich-Petrashevsky. This very period is chosen by the author as a subject of the paper' s research.

TI  - Irrigation Events Detection over Intensively Irrigated Grassland Plots Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Better management of water consumption and irrigation schedule in irrigated agriculture is essential in order to save water resources, especially at regional scales and under changing climatic conditions. In the context of water management, the aim of this study is to monitor irrigation activities by detecting the irrigation episodes at plot scale using the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) time series over intensively irrigated grassland plots located in the Crau plain of southeast France. The method consisted of assessing the newly developed irrigation detection model (IDM) at plot scale over the irrigated grassland plots. First, four S1-SAR time series acquired from four different S1-SAR acquisitions (different S1 orbits), each at six-day revisit time, were obtained over the study site. Next, the IDM was applied at each available SAR image from each S1-SAR series to obtain an irrigation indicator at each SAR image (no, low, medium, or high irrigation possibility). Then, the irrigation indicators obtained at each image from each S1-SAR time series (four series) were added and combined by threshold value criteria to determine the existence or absence of an irrigation event. Finally, the performance of the IDM for irrigation detection was assessed by comparing the in situ recorded irrigation events at each plot and the detected irrigation events. The results show that using only the VV polarization, 82.4% of the in situ registered irrigation events are correctly detected with an F_score value reaching 73.8%. Less accuracy is obtained using only the VH polarization, where 79.9% of the in situ irrigation events are correctly detected with an F_score of 72.2%. The combined use of the VV and VH polarization showed that 74.1% of the irrigation events are detected with a higher F_score value of 76.4%. The analysis of the undetected irrigation events revealed that, in the presence of very well-developed vegetation cover (normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) >= 0.8); higher uncertainty in irrigation detection is observed, where 80% of the undetected events correspond to an NDVI value greater than 0.8. The results also showed that small-sized plots encounter more false irrigation detections than large-sized plots certainly because the pixel spacing of S1 data (10 m x 10 m) is not adapted to small size plots. The obtained results prove the efficiency of the S1 C-band data and the IDM for detecting irrigation events at the plot scale, which would help in improving the irrigation water management at large scales especially with availability and global coverage of the S1 product.

TI  - Sentinel-1 soil moisture content and its uncertainty over sparsely vegetated fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) retrievals from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations do not exactly match with in situ references due to imperfect retrieval algorithms, and uncertainties in the model parameters, SAR observations and in situ references. Information on the uncertainty of SMC retrievals would contribute to their applicability. This paper presents a methodology for deriving the SMC retrieval uncertainty and decomposing this in its constituents. A Bayesian calibration framework was used for deriving the total uncertainty and the model parameter uncertainty. The methodology was demonstrated with the integral equation method (IEM) surface scattering model, which was employed for reproducing Sentinel-1 backscatter (sigma(0)) observations and the retrieval of SMC over four sparsely vegetated fields in the Netherlands. For two meadows the calibrated surface roughness parameter distributions are remarkably similar between the ascending and the descending Sentinel-1 orbits as well as between the two meadows, and yield consistent SMC retrievals for the calibration and validation periods (RMSDs of 0.076 m(3) m(-3) to 0.11 m(3) m(-3)). These results are promising for operational retrieval of SMC over meadows. In contrast, the surface roughness parameter distributions of two fallow maize fields differ significantly and the surface roughness conditions changing over time result in less consistent SMC retrievals (calibration RMSDs of 0.096 m(3) m(-3) and 0.13 m(3) m(-3) versus validation RMSDs of 0.26 m(3) m(-3)). The SMC retrieval uncertainty derived with the Bayesian calibration successfully reproduces the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references. The main uncertainty originates from the in situ references and the Sentinel-1 observations, whereas the contribution from the surface roughness parameters is relatively small. The presented research yields further insights into the surface roughness of agricultural fields and SMC retrieval uncertainties, and these insights can be used to guide SAR-based SMC product developments.

TI  - Single tuned algorithm to estimate the SPM concentration in a cascade reservoir system using OLI/L8 images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) affecting light propagation in the water column, which, in turn, affects primary production, is considered an important water quality indicator. Monitoring SPM in cascading reservoir system is of a particular challenge due to the widely differing optical properties. The Tiete River Cascade System (TRCS) is considered a representative case that comprises different water types with varying optical properties. At 1150 km long, the Tiete River crosses the State of Sao Paulo from East to West across a variety of land uses and land covers, which makes SPM monitoring of this system extremely challenging via traditional methods. This research aims to investigate the relationship between heterogeneous SPM configuration in the TRCS and the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) by identifying the most suitable empirical model to quantify a wide range of SPM concentrations. Empirical models based on single-band and band ratios were tuned which is then applied to OLI/Landsat-8 images to estimate the SPM concentrations. We tested three approaches to obtain the best fit to retrieve the SPM concentration: the first approach (i) the dataset from the first fieldwork of each reservoir was used do calibrate and the others fieldworks data were used do validate the algorithm; the second (ii) all data from a single reservoir were selected for calibration and the others for validation and the third (iii) approach we used methods for randomly divide the calibration and validation dataset. The results showed that only approach (iii) returned significant results. The best algorithm to estimate the SPM concentration was based on the band ratio B3/B2 (SPM = 10.34 x [561 nm/482 nm]-12.32; with an r = 0.65). This algorithm resulted in the lowest error on average (RMSE = 6.5 mg/L, nRMSE = 32.97% and MAPE = 47.05%). The highest errors in retrieve the SPM were observed for reservoirs with dominance of phytoplankton; in fact, considering the dataset from all reservoirs the correlation between SPM and Chl-a was 0.95, proving that there are influence from the Chl-a pigment on the signal which increases the error. Therefore, a method to reduce the influence of phytoplankton on the remote sensing reflectance should be developed in order to reduce the error in retrieve the SPM concentration. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - The Potential of ICESat-2 to Identify Carbon-Rich Peatlands in Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are one of the primary global storages for terrestrial organic carbon. Poor land management, drainage, and recurrent fires lead to the release of huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Accurate information about the extent of the peatlands and its 3D surface topography is crucial for assessing and quantifying this globally relevant carbon store. To identify the most carbon-rich peatlands-dome-shaped ombrogenous peat-by collecting GPS-based terrain data is almost impossible, as these peatlands are often located in remote areas, frequently flooded, and usually covered by dense tropical forest vegetation. The detection by airborne LiDAR or spaceborne remote sensing in Indonesia is costly and laborious. This study investigated the potential of the ICESat-2/ATLAS LiDAR satellite data to identify and map carbon-rich peatlands. The spaceborne ICESat-2 LiDAR data were compared and correlated with highly accurate field validated digital terrain models (DTM) generated from airborne LiDAR as well as the commercial global WorldDEM DTM dataset. Compared to the airborne DTM, the ICESat-2 LiDAR data produced an R-2 of 0.89 and an RMSE of 0.83 m. For the comparison with the WorldDEM DTM, the resulting R-2 lay at 0.94 and the RMSE at 0.86 m. We model the peat dome surface from individual peat hydrological units by performing ordinary kriging on ICESat-2 DTM-footprint data. These ICESat-2 based peatland models, compared to a WorldDEM DTM and airborne DTM, produced an R-2 of 0.78, 0.84, and 0.94 in Kalimantan and an R-2 of 0.69, 0.72, and 0.85 in Sumatra. The RMSE ranged from 0.68 m to 2.68 m. These results demonstrate the potential of ICESat-2 in assessing peat surface topography. Since ICESat-2 will collect more data worldwide in the years to come, it can be used to survey and map carbon-rich tropical peatlands globally and free of charge.

TI  - Groundwater potential zones identification using geoelectrical sounding and remote sensing in Wadi Touil plain, Northwestern Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wadi Touil plain is situated southwest of Tiaret city; it contains two important localities, Ksar Chellala (Reibell) and Zemalet El Amir Abdelkader (Taguine). This semi-arid region belongs to the western high plains and is characterized by scarce and irregular rainfall. The lack of surface water and the agricultural activities of this region increase the demand for groundwater. Several water boreholes were installed to meet the large water needs; however, these boreholes no longer cover the high demand for water due to the increase in population, increase in irrigated areas, and wear and tear on pumps. Therefore, in order to better define the catchment area and find new sites that meet the water quality and quantity requirements, a geoelectrical survey using the electrical resistivity method was carried out in the Wadi Touil large plain South of Tiaret to investigate the electrical characteristics of sub-surface layering and evaluate the aquifer potentials. Using the Schlumberger array, a total of 127 vertical electrical soundings were conducted along 16 profiles. The recorded data were interpreted quantitatively and qualitatively through the use of isoapparent resistivity maps, geoelectrical pseudosections analysis, and the established geoelectric sections. The results show the presence of three very promising levels; the surface aquifer formed by the Mio-plio-Quaternary terrain (rho = 55 Omega m), the Barremian-Albian-Aptian complex (rho = 300 Omega m), and the Jurassic aquifer (rho = 1200 Omega m). In this study, we determined the extent of these aquifers, their depth and their thickness. These results provide a better understanding of the geology and the deep geo-structure of the region. The remote sensing observations using Sentinel 2A images located the wet lands and provided visual evidence of the evolution of the irrigated areas over time. Finally, according to the study results, the most favorable sites for the establishment of water exploitation boreholes are proposed.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Variability and Drought on Surface Water Resources in Sub-Saharan Africa Using Remote Sensing: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate variability and recurrent droughts have caused remarkable strain on water resources in most regions across the globe, with the arid and semi-arid areas being the hardest hit. The impacts have been notable on surface water resources, which are already under threat from massive abstractions due to increased demand, as well as poor conservation and unsustainable land management practices. Drought and climate variability, as well as their associated impacts on water resources, have gained increased attention in recent decades as nations seek to enhance mitigation and adaptation mechanisms. Although the use of satellite technologies has, of late, gained prominence in generating timely and spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts across different regions, they are somewhat hampered by difficulties in detecting drought evolution due to its complex nature, varying scales, the magnitude of its occurrence, and inherent data gaps. Currently, a number of studies have been conducted to monitor and assess the impacts of climate variability and droughts on water resources in sub-Saharan Africa using different remotely sensed and in-situ datasets. This study therefore provides a detailed overview of the progress made in tracking droughts using remote sensing, including its relevance in monitoring climate variability and hydrological drought impacts on surface water resources in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper further discusses traditional and remote sensing methods of monitoring climate variability, hydrological drought, and water resources, tracking their application and key challenges, with a particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, characteristics and limitations of various remote sensors, as well as drought and surface water indices, namely, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Difference Vegetation (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI+5), Automated Water Extraction Index (shadow) (AWEI(sh)), and Automated Water Extraction Index (non-shadow) (AWEI(nsh)), and their relevance in climate variability and drought monitoring are discussed. Additionally, key scientific research strides and knowledge gaps for further investigations are highlighted. While progress has been made in advancing the application of remote sensing in water resources, this review indicates the need for further studies on assessing drought and climate variability impacts on water resources, especially in the context of climate change and increased water demand. The results from this study suggests that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data are likely to be best suited to monitor climate variability, hydrological drought, and surface water bodies, due to their availability at relatively low cost, impressive spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. The most effective drought and water indices are SPI, PDSI, NDVI, VCI, NDWI, MNDWI, MNDWI+5, AWEI(sh), and AWEI(nsh). Overall, the findings of this study emphasize the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in generating spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts on surface water resources.However, there is a need for future studies to consider spatial data integration techniques, radar data, precipitation, cloud computing, and machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve on understanding climate and drought impacts on water resources across various scales.

T2  - EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During the 2019 Hajj, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia implemented for the first time a health early warning system for rapid detection and response to health threats.Aims: This study aimed to describe the early warning findings at the Hajj to highlight the pattern of health risks and the potential benefits of the disease surveillance system.Methods: Using syndromic surveillance and event-based surveillance data, the health early warning system generated automated alarms for public health events, triggered alerts for rapid epidemiological investigations and facilitated the monitoring of health events.Results: During the deployment period (4 July-31 August 2019), a total of 121 automated alarms were generated, of which 2 events (heat-related illnesses and injuries/trauma) were confirmed by the response teams.Conclusion: The surveillance system potentially improved the timeliness and situational awareness for health events, including non-infectious threats. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, a health early warning system could enhance case detection and facilitate monitoring of the disease geographical spread and the effectiveness of control measures.

TI  - Spatial Scales of Sea Surface Salinity Subfootprint Variability in the SPURS Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subfootprint variability (SFV), or representativeness error, is variability within the footprint of a satellite that can impact validation by comparison of in situ and remote sensing data. This study seeks to determine the size of the sea surface salinity (SSS) SFV as a function of footprint size in two regions that were heavily sampled with in situ data. The Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Studies-1 (SPURS-1) experiment was conducted in the subtropical North Atlantic in the period 2012-2013, whereas the SPURS-2 study was conducted in the tropical eastern North Pacific in the period 2016-2017. SSS SFV was also computed using a high-resolution regional model based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). We computed SFV at footprint sizes ranging from 20 to 100 km for both regions. SFV is strongly seasonal, but for different reasons in the two regions. In the SPURS-1 region, the meso- and submesoscale variability seemed to control the size of the SFV. In the SPURS-2 region, the SFV is much larger than SPURS-1 and controlled by patchy rainfall.

TI  - Perspectives on the Structural Health Monitoring of Bridges by Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large infrastructures need continuous maintenance because of materials degradation due to atmospheric agents and their persistent use. This problem makes it imperative to carry out persistent monitoring of infrastructure health conditions in order to guarantee maximum safety at all times. The main issue of early warning infrastructure fault detection is that expensive in-situ distributed monitoring sensor networks have to be installed. On the contrary, the use of satellite data has made it possible to use immediate and low-cost techniques in recent years. In this regard, the potential of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar for the monitoring of critical infrastructures is demonstrated in geographically extended areas, even in the presence of clouds, and in really tough weather. A complete procedure for damage early-warning detection is designed, by using micro-motion (m-m) estimation of critical sites, based on modal proprieties analysis. Particularly, m-m is processed to extract modal features such as natural frequencies and mode shapes generated by vibrations of large infrastructures. Several study cases are here considered and the "Morandi" Bridge (Polcevera Viaduct) in Genoa (Italy) is analyzed in depth highlighting abnormal vibration modes during the period before the bridge collapsed.

TI  - Assessment of Heavy Metal Concentration in Tissues of Three Owl Species From Visakhapatnam, India.
T2  - Nature Environment and Pollution Technology
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of heavy metals into the environment through various natural and anthropogenic sources is inevitable due to their persistent nature. This study investigated the concentration of heavy metals lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and chromium (Cr) in liver, kidney, muscle and bones of three different species of owls namely Indian Eagle Owl (Bubo bengalensis), Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and Spotted Owlet (Athene brama) from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India. Given their sentinel role, birds can be used as suitable and reliable indicators in monitoring the quality of the environment. From the study, it was observed that Bubo bengalensis accumulated the highest concentration of metals followed by Athene brama and Tyto alba. On an average, the concentration of Zn (1.67[plus or minus]1.40 [mu]g/g) was higher than Pb (0.079[plus or minus]0.05 [mu]g/g) and Cr (0.99[plus or minus]1.11 [mu]g/g). Among all the species, Spotted Owlet (Athene brama) recorded the highest concentration of Zn in bone (3.98 [mu]g/g) whereas in the bone of Indian Eagle Owl (Bubo bengalensis) 2.44 [mu]g/g of chromium (Cr) was reported. Pearson's correlation of the data showed significant positive correlations in the absorption of metals by the tissues. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was applied to validate the results and check whether the groups originated from the same population. Additionally, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that Pb showed a strong relationship with both Zn and Cr and might be due to the differences of sources of these elements in the environment.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of suspended sediment concentrations in a shallow and turbid lagoon
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Patos Lagoon, located in the southernmost part of Brazil, is a shallow and turbid lagoon of enormous ecological and economical importance. The seasonal, annual, and interannual variability of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the lagoon was investigated in this study based on five years (2002-2006) of hydrodynamics + SSC simulations using the TELEMAC - 3D hydrodynamic model. The model was first calibrated and validated by comparing results with in situ current velocities, salinity, water levels, and SSC measurements, indicating a reasonable/good performance for the majority of the time. Modelling results were then combined with river discharge, wind, precipitation rates, and climate indices (El-Nino Southern Oscillation - ENSO) data to identify their influence on SSC throughout the lagoon. The relation between daily time series of SSC and river discharge was high (r approximate to 0.80), suggesting a strong correlation between these time series in the Patos Lagoon. SSC seasonal variability was also observed, with high SSC from winter to spring, and moderate to low SSC during summer and fall, indicating a relation with the river discharge pattern. On the interannual variability scale, the ENSO influence promoted high SSC values throughout the lagoon, mainly during El Nino years and near the tributaries mouth, while the opposite pattern was observed during La Nina years. Thus, the Patos Lagoon proved to be a dynamic system where SSC are mainly controlled by river discharges at longer timescales and modulated by the wind action at shorter timescales.

TI  - Application of Radar Polarimetry to Monitor Changes in Backscattering Mechanisms in Landslide Zones Using the Example of the Collapse of the Bureya River Bank
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Possibilities of using radar polarimetry methods for identifying landslide zones are analyzed. The transformation of the dominant mechanism of signal scattering by the reflecting surface was used as a key feature of landslide zones. The polarimetric data from the PALSAR-2 radar of the ALOS-2 satellite are processed using the Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier decompositions at four test sites selected in the region of the landslide caused by the collapse of the bank of the Bureya River. It is found that the results of decompositions are consistent with each other; however, in some areas there are significant differences due to the specific features of the basic model assumptions. It is shown that, before the descent of the landslide masses, three main mechanisms of radar signal scattering existed in the analyzed region: single surface, volumetric, and double scattering. After the collapse, this area was dominated by single scattering characteristic of the reflective surface with large-scale irregularities free of vegetation, due to which the landslide descent zone can be confidently recognized. The significant potential of using radar polarimetry for remote diagnostics of the consequences of landslide phenomena has been demonstrated.

TI  - Registering from Space the Features of Deep Wastewater Outfalls into Coastal Water Areas Due to Discharge Collector Breaks
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of comprehensive studies of anthropogenic impacts caused by deep water discharge into coastal waters near the city of Sevastopol using an experimental model of a ground-space monitoring system are presented. The nature of anthropogenic pollution of the investigated basin associated with an emergency rupture of the collector of the discharge device with a design capacity of 43 800 thousand m(3)/year (from 2014 to 2018) and the situation after the elimination of the accident in 2019 were assessed based on an analysis of space data. The features of optical anomalies associated with the discharge of wastewater into the marine environment in the region of the collector rupture are revealed, which are manifested in the changes in the normalized indices of sea-surface color recorded from space multispectral images of various resolutions, ranging from 1.25 to 1.45, while the background values are similar to 1. After the recovery of the collector rupture in 2019, the values of these indices were close to 1. The length of the zone where intense pollution appeared is similar to 3.0 km and its width is similar to 0.8 km; the center of the zone is at the place of the collector rupture. Based on remote sensing data, a positive effect has been demonstrated associated with the repair, which is recommended based on the results of space monitoring.

TI  - Monitoring Landslide Processes by Means of L-Band Radar Interferometric Observations: Using the Example of the Bureya River Bank Caving
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibilities of interferometric surveying using L-band PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 space radars on the ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 satellites for studying landslide processes are analyzed using the example of a catastrophic caving of similar to 18.5 million m(3) on the Bureya River in December 2018. The motions of the landslide surface are revealed and their integral amplitude is estimated at time intervals of up to 2 years. It is found that summer images are less informative due to a dramatic loss of coherence due to heavy rainfall; almost all winter pairs of images taken at low negative temperatures have high coherence due to the stability of the dielectric properties of wood vegetation and underlying soils. Based on the analysis of the dynamics of the development of the landslide process over a 10-year time interval, it is shown that soil displacements along the slope were small in 2006-2010 (1.6-1.9 cm/month); in 2015-2016, the displacements increased significantly (4.7-4.9 cm/month), and the maximum measured velocity of displacements was reached in the summer of 2016 (10.7 cm/month). It has been suggested that intensification of the landslide process occurred at the time the filling of the reservoir basin was completed in 2006-2009; the process was triggered by both the initial rise and seasonal fluctuations in water levels.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Multi-Year Wildfires and Emissions of Trace Gases and Aerosols in Russia Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis is performed of the annual and intraseasonal dynamics of wildfire areas and volumes of trace gas components (CO, CO2, CH4, NO, and NO2) and fine aerosols (PM2.5) caused by wildfires in Russia and its large regions over 19 years. The analysis is based on results from satellite monitoring, allowing for the effect anomalies in weather and climate have on the intensity of fires. It is shown that the average size of areas burned monthly in the European part of Russia fell by half in April, May, and September, and by a factor of four in July and August over the period 2011 to 2019, compared to the respective months in 2001-2010. A negative trend is observed for spring and autumn from 2010 to 2019 in the Siberian and Ural federal districts, along with a summer increase in fire areas. It is found that over 19 years, the dynamics of the burned areas is weakly defined for most months of the fire season in the Far Eastern Federal District. Extremely high volumes of emissions of different trace gases (including CO and CO2) and aerosols caused by wildfires were detected in the Siberian Federal District in 2003 and 2012.

TI  - Joint Analysis of Anomalies of Different Geophysical Fields, Recorded from Space before Strong Earthquakes in California
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results are presented from using satellite data to study anomalies of different geophysical fields due to the interaction of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere. The anomalies are mid- and short-term precursors of strong earthquakes in California that occurred on July 4 and 5, 2019 (M = 6.4 and M = 7.1). Precursory changes in the lithosphere are analyzed using lineament system characteristics obtained by processing satellite imagery (Terra/Aqua satellites and MODIS instrument), along with variations in the Earth's surface temperature (the Aqua satellite and the AIRS instrument). Fluctuations in the temperature of the near-surface atmospheric layer are studied to detect atmospheric anomalies during preparation of seismic events, as are fluctuations in the air temperature now at an altitude of 1000 hPa and changes in outgoing longwave radiation recorded by the AIRS instrument on the Aqua satellite. Variations in the ionospheric electron density in the F2-layer maximum are studied with GPS data to reveal ionospheric anomalies during the precursors and occurrence of earthquakes. Joint analysis of anomalies in different geophysical fields, identified via satellite monitoring, allow precursory changes in the lithosphere to be detected a month before strong earthquakes. Precursory changes in the atmosphere and ionosphere can be detected 3-6 days and 3-5 or 10 days before earthquakes, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring the State of the Landslide Zone on the Bureya River in 2018-2019 with Radar and Optical Satellite Images
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results are presented from monitoring the current state of the area of the landslide on the Bureya River in 2018-2019 using images from synthetic aperture radars and optical sensors of the Sentinel multisatellite system. Differential radar interferometry shows the stability of the landslide's surface in the first four months after the landslide and since the end of July 2019. The small-scale dynamics of the surface are revealed within the landslide circus. It is shown that interferometry cannot be used to observe large modifications of the shoreline, in contrast to optical images, where the effects of the collapse of shoreline fragments and shoreline flooding were clearly observed. Ongoing landslide activity within the landslide circus and area of shoreline collapse is detected using satellite images. Continuous monitoring of this and other dangerous landslide zones on the Bureya River is needed.

TI  - Forests and urban green areas as tools to address the challenges of sustainability in Latin American urban socio-ecological systems
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - One sustainability challenge is confronting the process of global urbanization considering wellbein g and environmental justice. Integrating different disciplines to describe and analyze the relationships of urban socio-ecological systems gives us usef u l empirical tools to formulate policies and programs in urban planning considering their spatial dimension. The objective of this study is to present a model that integrates and explains the socio-ecological urban relations of a Latin American city considering three high-level approaches: forestry, geography, and psychology. Thus, we defined fou r factors: a) urban forest and green areas; b) urban spatial segregation; c) perceived restoration; and d) subjective wellbeing. For these, we grouped 16 measured variables and collected them with three specific procedures: a) SPOT remote sensors and object-based classification of urban coverage; b) analysis of geospatial data with census information; and c) field surveys. We applied descriptive multivariate statistics and also proposed a structural equation model (SEM) that integrates a l l the variables and data. We found that the factor "urban green areas" had a direct positive relationship with the factors "urban spatial segregation" and "perceived restoration." We observed that urban green areas were meeting spaces between different socioeconomic categories, reducing segregation and multiplying opportunities for the psychological restoration of citizens. However, we found no evidence that green areas are related to subjective wellbeing. The model quantified the socio-ecological relationships produced by combining various factors of urban socio-ecological systems, suggesting the benefits of this method to generate knowledge towards planning and managing Latin American cities. Ou r results are encouraging in terms of environmental justice and wellbeing. In developing countries where forecasts indicate rising urban populations, the need to establish planning processes based on scientific information is vital to meet the challenges of sustainability in the twentyfirst century.

TI  - Contextualizing the 2019-2020 Kangaroo Island Bushfires: Quantifying Landscape-Level Influences on Past Severity and Recovery with Landsat and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019-2020 Kangaroo Island bushfires in South Australia burned almost half of the island. To understand how to avoid future severe 'mega-fires' and how vegetation may recover from 2019-2020, we can utilize information from the bulk of historical fires in an area. Landsat time-series of vegetation change provide this opportunity, but there has been little analysis of large numbers of fires to build a landscape-level understanding and quantify drivers in an Australian context. In this study, we built a yearly cloud-free surface reflectance normalized burn ratio (NBR) time-series (1988-2020) using all available summer Landsat images over Kangaroo Island. Data were collected in Google Earth Engine and fitted with LandTrendr. Burn severity and post-fire recovery were quantified for 47 fires, with a new recovery metric facilitating comparison where fire frequency is high. Variables representing the current burn, fire history, vegetation structure, and topography were related to severity and yearly recovery with random forest and bivariate analysis. Results show that the 2019-2020 bushfires were the most widespread and severe, followed by 2007-2008. Vegetation recovers quickly, with NBR stabilizing ten years post-fire on average. Severity is most influenced by fire frequency, vegetation capacity and land use with more severe burns in nature conservation areas with dense vegetation and a history of frequent fires. Influence on recovery varied with time since fire, with initial (year 1-3) faster recovery observed in areas with less surviving vegetation. Later (year 6-10) recovery was most influenced by a variable representing burn year and further investigation indicates that precipitation increases in later post-fire years likely facilitated faster recovery. The relative abundance of eucalypt woodlands also has a positive influence on recovery in middle and later years. These results provide valuable information to land managers on Kangaroo Island and in similar environments, who should consider adjusting practices to limit future mega-fire risk and potential ecosystem shifts if severe fires become more frequent with climate change.

TI  - Applications of Google Earth Engine in fluvial geomorphology for detecting river channel change
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Cloud-based computing, access to big geospatial data, and virtualization, whereby users are freed from computational hardware and data management logistics, could revolutionize remote sensing applications in fluvial geomorphology. Analysis of multitemporal, multispectral satellite imagery has provided fundamental geomorphic insight into the planimetric form and dynamics of large river systems, but information derived from these applications has largely been used to test existing concepts in fluvial geomorphology, rather than for generating new concepts or theories. Traditional approaches (i.e., desktop computing) have restricted the spatial scales and temporal resolutions of planimetric river channel change analyses. Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing platform for planetary-scale geospatial analyses, offers the opportunity to relieve these spatiotemporal restrictions. We summarize the big geospatial data flows available to fluvial geomorphologists within the GEE data catalog, focus on approaches to look beyond mapping wet channel extents and instead map the wider riverscape (i.e., water, sediment, vegetation) and its dynamics, and explore the unprecedented spatiotemporal scales over which GEE analyses can be applied. We share a demonstration workflow to extract active river channel masks from a section of the Cagayan River (Luzon, Philippines) then quantify centerline migration rates from multitemporal data. By enabling fluvial geomorphologists to take their algorithms to petabytes worth of data, GEE is transformative in enabling deterministic science at scales defined by the user and determined by the phenomena of interest. Equally as important, GEE offers a mechanism for promoting a cultural shift toward open science, through the democratization of access and sharing of reproducible code.This article is categorized under:Science of Water

TI  - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data for Savannah Land Cover Mapping: Optimising the Combination of Sensors and Seasons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannahs are heterogeneous environments with an important role in supporting biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services. Due to extensive land use/cover changes and subsequent land degradation, the provision of ecosystems services from savannahs has increasingly declined over recent years. Mapping the extent and the composition of savannah environments is challenging but essential in order to improve monitoring capabilities, prevent biodiversity loss and ensure the provision of ecosystem services. Here, we tested combinations of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data from three different seasons to optimise land cover mapping, focusing in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in Tanzania. The NCA has a bimodal rainfall pattern and is composed of a combination savannah and woodland landscapes. The best performing model achieved an overall accuracy of 86.3 +/- 1.5% and included a combination of Sentinel-1 and 2 from the dry and short-dry seasons. Our results show that the optical models outperform their radar counterparts, the combination of multisensor data improves the overall accuracy in all scenarios and this is particularly advantageous in single-season models. Regarding the effect of season, models that included the short-dry season outperform the dry and wet season models, as this season is able to provide cloud free data and is wet enough to allow for the distinction between woody and herbaceous vegetation. Additionally, the combination of more than one season is beneficial for the classification, specifically if it includes the dry or the short-dry season. Combining several seasons is, overall, more beneficial for single-sensor data; however, the accuracies varied with land cover. In summary, the combination of several seasons and sensors provides a more accurate classification, but the target vegetation types should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Investigating Sentinel 2 Multispectral Imagery Efficiency in Describing Spectral Response of Vineyards Covered with Plastic Sheets
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The protection of vineyards with overhead plastic covers is a technique largely applied in table grape growing. As with other crops, remote sensing of vegetation spectral reflectance is a useful tool for improving management even for table grape viticulture. The remote sensing of the spectral signals emitted by vegetation of covered vineyards is currently an open field of investigation, given the intrinsic nature of plastic sheets that can have a strong impact on the reflection from the underlying vegetation. Baring these premises in mind, the aim of the present work was to run preliminary tests on table grape vineyards covered with polyethylene sheets, using Copernicus Sentinel 2 (Level 2A product) free optical data, and compare their spectral response with that of similar uncovered vineyards to assess if a reliable spectral signal is detectable through the plastic cover. Vine phenology, air temperature and shoot growth, were monitored during the 2016 growing cycle. Twenty-four Copernicus Sentinel 2 (S2, Level 2A product) images were used to investigate if, in spite of plastic sheets, vine phenology can be similarly described with and without plastic covers. For this purpose, time series of S2 at-the-ground reflectance calibrated bands and correspondent normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, version two (MSAVI2) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) spectral indices were obtained and analyzed, comparing the responses of two covered vineyards with different plastic sheets in respect of two uncovered ones. Results demonstrated that no significant limitation (for both bands and spectral indices) was introduced by plastic sheets while monitoring spectral behavior of covered vineyards.

TI  - The impact of cloud masking on the climatology of sea surface temperature gradients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud masking is a critical step in the estimation of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from satellite observations. It can affect the validation statistics of SST on synoptic scales but also on long-term climatologies. One of the main challenges in cloud masking is the discrimination between clouds and ocean sharp fronts as both of these are associated with high spatial variability. In this study, we investigate the impact of cloud masking on the climatology of SST gradient magnitudes. Using night-time Level 2 SST derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua for almost the entire mission, i.e. 2003 to 2018 over the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SAO), we show that misclassification of sharp ocean thermal fronts as clouds leads to (1) significant underestimation of thermal frontal activity in monthly and longer-term climatologies and (2) different spatial distributions and temporal variability of SST gradient magnitudes.

TI  - Evaluation of Pre-Therapeutic Assessment in Endometrial Cancer Staging
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the concordance between the preoperative MRI and histology data with the final histopathological examination. Method: This is a retrospective observational study of 183 patients operated for endometrioid cancer between January 2009 and December 2019 in the surgical oncology department of the Lorraine Cancer Institute (ICL) in Vand oe uvre-les-Nancy. The patients included are all women operated on for endometrioid-type endometrial cancer over this period. The exclusion criteria are patients for whom the pre-therapy check-up does not include pelvic MRI and those who have not had first-line surgery. The final anatomopathological results were compared with preoperative imaging data and with endometrial biopsy data. Results: For the myometrial infiltration, the sensitivity of MRI was of 37% and the specificity of 54%. To detect nodal metastases, the sensitivity of MRI was of 21% and the specificity of 93%. We observed an under estimation of the FIGO classification (p = 0.001) with the MRI in 42.7% of cases (n = 76) and an overestimation in 24.2% of cases (n = 43). There was a concordance in 33.1% of cases (n = 59). We had a poor agreement between the MRI and final histopathological examination with an adjusted kappa (kappa) of 0.12 [95% IC (0.02; 0.24)]. There was a moderate concordance on the grade between the pretherapeutic biopsy and the final histopathological examination on excised tissue with an adjusted kappa of 0.52 [95% IC 0.42-0.62)]. Endometrial biopsy underestimated the tumor grade in 28.9% of cases (n = 50) (p < 0.001), overestimated the tumor grade in 6.9% of cases (n = 12) and we observed a concordance in 64.2% of cases (n = 111). Conclusion: The pre-operative assessment of endometrial cancer is inconsistent with the results obtained on final histopathological examination. A study with a systematic review should be done to assess the performance of MRI, only in expert centers, in order to consider a a specific care management for endometrial cancer patients: patients who have had an MRI in an outpatient center should have their imaging systematically reviewed, with the possibility of a new examination in case of incomplete sequences, by expert radiologists, and discussed in multidisciplinary concertation meeting in expert centers, before any therapeutic decision. The sentinel node biopsy must be used for low and intermediate risk endometrial cancer.

TI  - Linkages between Rainfed Cereal Production and Agricultural Drought through Remote Sensing Indices and a Land Data Assimilation System: A Case Study in Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Morocco, cereal production shows high interannual variability due to uncertain rainfall and recurrent drought periods. Considering the socioeconomic importance of cereal for the country, there is a serious need to characterize the impact of drought on cereal yields. In this study, drought is assessed through (1) indices derived from remote sensing data (the vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health ind ex (VHI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI) and soil water index for different soil layers (SWI)) and (2) key land surface variables (Land Area Index (LAI), soil moisture (SM) at different depths, soil evaporation and plant transpiration) from a Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) over 2000-2017. A lagged correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationships between the drought indices and cereal yield at monthly time scales. The VCI and LAI around the heading stage (March-April) are highly linked to yield for all provinces (R = 0.94 for the Khemisset province), while a high link for TCI occurs during the development stage in January-February (R = 0.83 for the Beni Mellal province). Interestingly, indices related to soil moisture in the superficial soil layer are correlated with yield earlier in the season around the emergence stage (December). The results demonstrate the clear added value of using an LDAS compared with using a remote sensing product alone, particularly concerning the soil moisture in the root-zone, considered a key variable for yield production, that is not directly observable from space. The time scale of integration is also discussed. By integrating the indices on the main phenological stages of wheat using a dynamic threshold approach instead of the monthly time scale, the correlation between indices and yield increased by up to 14%. In addition, the contributions of VCI and TCI to VHI were optimized by using yield anomalies as proxies for drought. This study opens perspectives for the development of drought early warning systems in Morocco and over North Africa, as well as for seasonal crop yield forecasting.

TI  - Driving of Outer Belt Electron Loss by Solar Wind Dynamic Pressure Structures: Analysis of Balloon and Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present observations of similar to 10-60 min solar wind dynamic pressure structures that drive large-scale coherent similar to 20-100 keV electron loss from the outer radiation belt. A combination of simultaneous satellite and Balloon Array for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) observations on 11-12 January 2014 shows a close association between the pressure structures and precipitation as inferred from BARREL X-rays. Specifically, the structures drive radial ExB transport of electrons up to 1 Earth radii, modulating the free electron energy available for low-frequency plasmaspheric hiss growth, and subsequent hiss-induced loss cone scattering. The dynamic pressure structures, originating near the Sun and commonly observed advecting with the solar wind, are thus able to switch on scattering loss of electrons by hiss over a large spatial scale. Our results provide a direct link between solar wind pressure fluctuations and modulation of electron loss from the outer radiation belt and may explain long-period modulations and large-scale coherence of X-rays commonly observed in the BARREL data set.Plain Language Summary The Earth's low-density magnetosphere is a region of enclosed magnetic field lines that contains energetic electrons ranging from eV to MeV energies. These populations can be greatly enhanced in response to solar driving. Following enhancements, energetic electron populations are depleted on timescales of hours to days by various processes. One important depletion process occurs when an electromagnetic plasma wave called plasmaspheric hiss, which exists within a high plasma density region called the plasmasphere and its (occasional) radial extension called the plume, scatters energetic electrons into the atmosphere. In this paper, we show that these hiss waves can be switched on by compressions of the magnetosphere which occur in response to similar to 1 hr long pressure structures in the solar wind. These structures originate at or near the Sun and are very common in the solar wind at 1 AU. The newly excited hiss waves scatter electrons into the atmosphere where they are observed on balloon-borne X-ray detectors. Our results suggest that magnetospheric models that predict the loss of electrons from hiss waves may be improved by consideration of solar wind pressure-driven dynamics.

TI  - Integrating In Situ and Ocean Color Data to Evaluate Ecological Quality under the Water Framework Directive
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims at evaluating the ecological status of European coastal water bodies (CWBs). This is a rather complex task and first requires the use of long-term databases to assess the effect of anthropogenic pressure on biological communities. An in situ dataset was assembled using concomitant biological, i.e., chlorophyll a (Chl a) and environmental data, covering the years from 1995 to 2014, to enable a comprehensive assessment of eutrophication in the Western Iberia Coast (WIC). Given the temporal gaps in the dataset, especially in terms of Chl a, satellite observations were used to complement it. Positive relationships between Chl a 90th percentile and nitrogen concentrations were obtained. The Land-Uses Simplified Index (LUSI), as a pressure indicator, showed no relationship with Chl a, except in Galicia, but it highlighted a higher continental pressure in the Portuguese CWBs in comparison with Galician waters. In general terms, the trophic index (TRIX) showed that none of the CWBs were in degraded conditions. Nevertheless, the relatively high TRIX and LUSI values obtained for the water body in front of Tagus estuary suggest that this area should be subject to continued monitoring. Results highlighted the usefulness of satellite data in water quality assessments and set the background levels for the implementation of operational monitoring based on satellite Chl a. In the future, low uncertainty and harmonized satellite products across countries should be provided. Moreover, the assessment of satellite-based eutrophication indicators should also include metrics on phytoplankton phenology and community structure.

TI  - Investigating the Potential of Radar Interferometry for Monitoring Rural Artisanal Cobalt Mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greater awareness of the serious human rights abuses associated with the extraction and trade of cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has applied increasing pressure for businesses to move towards more responsible and sustainable mineral sourcing. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities in rural and remote locations may provide heightened opportunities to conceal the alleged human rights violations associated with mining, such as: hazardous working conditions, health impacts, child labour, child trafficking, and debt bondage. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, teamed with high temporal frequency Sentinel-1 imagery, for monitoring ASM activity in rural locations of the "Copperbelt", the DRC. The results show that the ISBAS descriptive variables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were significantly different (p-value = <= 0.05) between mining and non-mining areas. Additionally, a significant difference was found for the ISBAS descriptive variables mean, standard deviation, and minimum between the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnels). As expected, a high level of subsidence (i.e., negative ISBAS pixel value) was a clear indicator of mine activity. Trial activity thresholds were set for the descriptive variables mean (-2.43 mm/yr) and minimum (-5.36 mm/yr) to explore an ISBAS approach to active mine identification. The study concluded that the ISBAS method has great potential as a monitoring tool for ASM, with the ability to separate mining and non-mining areas based on surface motion values, and further distinguish the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnel). Ground data collection and further development of ISBAS analysis needs to be made to fully understand the value of an ISBAS-based ASM monitoring system. In particular, surrounding the impact of seasonality relative to longer-term trends in ASM activity.

TI  - Effects of Wetland Restoration and Conservation Projects on Soil Carbon Sequestration in the Ningxia Basin of the Yellow River in China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term use of wetlands stresses wetland ecosystems and leads to degradation and C loss. This study explored an optimal remote sensing-multivariate linear regression model (RS-MLRM) for estimating wetland soil organic carbon (SOC) by using a combination of the measured SOC and above ground biomass (AGB) from 273 samples, textural features, spectral information, and a vegetation index calculated from Landsat-8 images using the Ningxia Basin of the Yellow River as the study area. To derive the optimal predictor model for SOC, these variables were regressed against the measured SOC. These were used to predict SOC and evaluate the contribution of wetland restoration and conservation projects to soil carbon sequestration and sinks on the Ningxia Basin of the Yellow River in early (2000 and 2005), intermediate (2010), and recent (2015) years. The results show that from 2000 to 2015, the project-induced contribution to C sequestration was 20.49 TC, with an annual sink of 1.37 TC. This accounted for 54.06% of the total wetland ecosystem C sequestration on the Ningxia Basin of the Yellow River. Moreover, there was a significant success of restoration and conservation projects regarding C sequestration. These restoration and conservation projects have substantially contributed to CO2 mitigation in the arid area.

TI  - DISPUTES ON THE UNIVERSE IN RUSSIA IN THE 17th CENTURY

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explores disputes, discussions, polemical and critical texts that arose in Russia in the 17th century and were related to the cosmological aspects of the worldview. The paper analyzes such episodes as the debate of Lavrentii Zizanii with editors Elias the hegumen of the Theophany Convent and Grigorii Onisimov, Evfimii Chudovskii's critical response to the Crown of Faith by Simeon Polotskii, Polotskii's critical review of the Mirror of Theology by Kirill Tranquillion-Stavrovetskii, and archpriest Avvakum's treatise An Acquisition and Collection about God and Creation, which contains a polemic with apocryphal elements of the worldview. The study demonstrates the shift in the emphasis of criticism of cosmological models and constructions from the problem of nomination to the question whether the superlunary world is measurable and cognizable. Another revealed tendency is the increased attention to the sources of information provided in the texts that are presented as doctrinal ones.

TI  - LEAF AREA INDEX RETRIEVAL OF URBAN VEGETATION BASED ON SENTINEL-2 DATA IN ZHONGSHAN, SOUTH CHINA
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator of vegetation growth and health monitoring. The free access of Sentinel-2 optical satellite data from European Space Agency (ESA) since June 2015 made it possible to determine dynamic monitoring of LAI in a large area and a short re-entry period, owing to its high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) and unique band combination. These features of Sentinel-2 may bring great application potential in urban forestry management and ecological environment monitoring. In case of Zhongshan city in Guangdong Province, based on Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) software and two scenes of Sentinel-2 data, LAI of the whole city, as well as specific areas, were retrieved and analyzed. The retrieval result was consistent with the ecological spatial pattern and the vegetation protection status in Zhongshan city, also highly consistent with the field LAI measurement in the forest in a reservoir. The result indicates that this method has good applicability and accuracy in urban LAI inversion.

TI  - Quantifying the Cloud Water Resource: Methods Based on Observational Diagnosis and Cloud Model Simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the concepts of cloud water resource (CWR) and related variables proposed in the first part of this study, this paper provides details of two methods to quantify the CWR. One is diagnostic quantification (CWR-DQ) based on satellite observations, precipitation products, and atmospheric reanalysis data; and the other is numerical quantification (CWR-NQ) based on a cloud resolving model developed at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS). The two methods are applied to quantify the CWR in April and August 2017 over North China, and the results are evaluated against all available observations. Main results are as follows. (1) For the CWR-DQ approach, reference cloud profiles are firstly derived based on the CloudSat/CALIPSO joint satellite observations for 2007-2010. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in 2000-2017 are then employed to produce three-dimensional cloud fields. The budget/balance equations of atmospheric water substance are lastly used, together with precipitation observations, to retrieve CWR and related variables. It is found that the distribution and vertical structure of clouds obtained by the diagnostic method are consistent with observations. (2) For the CWR-NQ approach, it assumes that the cloud resolving model is able to describe the cloud microphysical processes completely and precisely, from which four-dimensional distributions of atmospheric water vapor, hydrometeors, and wind fields can be obtained. The data are then employed to quantify the CWR and related terms/quantities. After one-month continuous integration, the mass of atmospheric water substance becomes conserved, and the tempospatial distributions of water vapor, hydrometeors/cloud water, and precipitation are consistent with observations. (3) Diagnostic values of the difference in the transition between hydrometeors and water vapor (C-vh - C-hv) and the surface evaporation (E-s) are well consistent with their numerical values. (4) Correlation and bias analyses show that the diagnostic CWR contributors are well correlated with observations, and match their numerical counterparts as well, indicating that the CWR-NQ and CWR-DQ methods are reasonable. (5) Underestimation of water vapor converted from hydrometeors (C-hv) is a shortcoming of the CWR-DQ method, which may be rectified by numerical quantification results or by use of advanced observations on higher spatiotemporal resolutions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake changes have great impacts on local and regional ecosystems and socioeconomic activities. To determine the recent changes in Hongze Lake, radar altimeter and Landsat data were used to examine the water level and area and estimate the water volume changes from 2003 to 2018. Generally, the annual water level results from radar altimeter data showed good agreement with in situ measurements (r(2) = 0.62, bias = -0.02 m, mean absolute error = 0.10 m and root mean square error = 0.12 m). Although the results show that the water level and water volume of Hongze Lake had no trends during the 16 years, the water area decreased significantly at a rate of 19.76 km(2) per year. Despite great fluctuations throughout 16 years, two shifts occurred in approximately 2007 and 2013. The water level, area and volume of Hongze Lake decreased from 2007 to 2012, but they all showed increasing trends after 2013. The interannual changes in the water level and volume of Hongze Lake were consistent with the changes in annual precipitation, while the change in area was mainly affected by human activities, especially land reclamation and aquaculture activities along the lakeshore. In addition, the intra-annual change in the water level was greatly affected by artificial activities such as irrigation and flood prevention.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variations in Drought with Remote Sensing from the Mongolian Plateau During 1982-2018
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mongolian Plateau is one of the regions most sensitive to climate change, the more obvious increase of temperature in 21st century here has been considered as one of the important causes of drought and desertification. It is very important to understand the multi-year variation and occurrence characteristics of drought in the Mongolian Plateau to explore the ecological environment and the response mechanism of surface materials to climate change. This study examines the spatio-temporal variations in drought and its frequency of occurrence in the Mongolian Plateau based on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (1982-1999) and the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (2000-2018) datasets; the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) was used as a drought evaluation index. The results indicate that drought was widespread across the Mongolian Plateau between 1982 and 2018, and aridification incremented in the 21st century. Between 1982 and 2018, an area of 164.38 x 10(4) km(2)/yr suffered from drought, accounting for approximately 55.28% of the total study area. An area of approximately 150.06 x 10(4) km(2) (51.43%) was subject to more than 160 droughts during 259 months of the growing seasons between 1982 and 2018. We observed variable frequencies of drought occurrence depending on land cover/land use types. Drought predominantly occurred in bare land and grassland, both of which accounting for approximately 79.47% of the total study area. These terrains were characterized by low vegetation and scarce precipitation, which led to frequent and extreme drought events. We also noted significant differences between the areal distribution of drought, drought frequency, and degree of drought depending on the seasons. In spring, droughts were widespread, occurred with a high frequency, and were severe; in autumn, they were localized, frequent, and severe; whereas, in summer, droughts were the most widespread and frequent, but less severe. The increase in temperature, decrease in precipitation, continuous depletion of snow cover, and intensification of human activities have resulted in a water deficit. More severe droughts and aridification have affected the distribution and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, causing changes in the composition and distribution of plants, animals, microorganisms, conversion between carbon sinks and carbon sources, and biodiversity. We conclude that regional drought events have to be accurately monitored, whereas their occurrence mechanisms need further exploration, taking into account nature, climate, society and other influencing factors.

T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological dynamics of vegetation is considered as an important biological indicator for understanding the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of vegetation phenology from time series of vegetation indices (IV), has provided a comprehensive overview of ecosystem dynamics. Iberian Peninsula is one of the regions with the greatest diversity of ecosystems in European continent. It is therefore an excellent study area for monitoring phenological dynamics of vegetation. The aim of this study is to analyse the spatial variability of the phenology of the vegetation of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands for the period 2001-2017. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series were generated from the surface reflectance product M0D09Q1 at a spatial resolution of 250 meters and with a composite period of 8 days. Atmospheric disturbances and noise were reduced using a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter. Different phenological metrics or phenometrics were extracted using a threshold-based method. Results showed the existence of a different behaviour between spring and autumn phenophases in the Atlantic and Mediterranean biogeographic regions. The Mediterranean mountainous areas showed a similar phenological behaviour to the Atlantic vegetation. Biogeographic regions showed an internal variability, which may be derived from the different behaviour of land covers (e.g., natural vegetation vs. crops).

TI  - Predictive factors of lymph node metastasis and effectiveness of intraoperative examination of sentinel lymph node in breast carcinoma: A retrospective Belgian study
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, several trials demonstrated the safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection in clinically NO patients with positive sentinel nodes in select subgroups. However, this fact is still troublesome to clarify to surgeons and clinicians, as they used to perform intraoperative examination of the sentinel node and axillary dissection for many years. Hence, we decided to review our practice. This is to firstly highlight the predictive factors of node metastasis and secondly, to evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative examination of the sentinel node.There were 406 total procedures. The rate of positive lymph nodes in the final diagnosis was 27%. Factors associated with metastasis were age, tumour size, TNM classification, tumour grade, vascular invasion, molecular classification and KI-67 index.The rate of reoperation was 6.2% in cases with final positive nodes, however, the complementary ALND was justified in only 2.7%. Forty-nine percent of SLN were examined during surgery (IOESLN), whereby the false negative rate was 11.8%. Sixty-three intraoperative examinations were necessary to prevent a second operation on a patient.We recommend changing the clinical management of the axilla, resulting in fewer ALNDs in selected cNO, SLN-positive patients. In keeping with recent large clinical trial (ACOSOG Z0011, AMAROS and OTOASOR) data, our results support that intraoperative exam in selected cNO, SLN-positive Belgian patients is no longer effective.

TI  - Satellite measurements of artificial light at night: aerosol effects
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of artificial light at night (ALAN) by satellite is very important for the analysis of new astronomical sites and for the long-term temporal evolution observation of the emission from the ground. The analysis of satellite data presents many advantages but also some critical points because of fluctuations in measurements. The main result of this paper is the discovery of a correlation between these fluctuations and the aerosol concentration combined with cloud cover and lunar cycles. In this work, we also present a mathematical empirical model for the light pollution propagation study in relation to the aerosol concentration detected by satellite. We apply this model to the astronomical site of Asiago (Ekar Observatory) providing a possible explanation for the temporal ALAN fluctuations detected by satellite. Finally, we validate the results with the ground collected data.

TI  - Predictive mapping of bryophyte richness patterns in boreal forests using species distribution models and remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bryophytes represent an essential component of global biodiversity and play a significant role in many ecosystems, including boreal forests. In Canadian boreal forests, industrial exploitation of natural resources threatens bryophyte species and the ecological processes and services they support. However, the consideration of bryophytes in conservation issues is limited by current knowledge gaps on their distribution and diversity patterns. This is mainly due to the ineffectiveness of traditional field surveys to acquire information over large areas. Using remote sensing data in combination with species distribution models (SDMs), we aim to predict and map diversity patterns (in terms of richness) of i) total bryophytes, and ii) bryophyte guilds (mosses, liverworts and sphagna) in 28,436 km(2) of boreal forests of Quebec (Canada). A bryophyte presence/absence database was used to develop four response variables: total bryophyte richness, moss richness, liverwort richness and sphagna richness. We pre-selected a group of 38 environmental predictors including climate, topography, soil moisture and drainage as well as vegetation. Then a final set of predictors was selected individually for each response variable through a two-step selection procedure. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to develop spatially explicit regression models and to generate predictive cartography at 30 m resolution for the study area. Predictive mapping-associated uncertainty statistics were provided. Our models explained a significant fraction of the variation in total bryophyte and guild level richness, both in the calibration (42 to 52%) and validation sets (38 to 48%), outperforming models from previous studies. Vegetation (mainly NDVI) and climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, and freeze-thaw events) consistently appeared among the most important predictors for all bryophyte groups modeled. However, guild-level models identified differences in important factors determining the richness of each of the guilds and, therefore, in their predicted richness patterns. For example, the predictor number of days > 30 degrees C was especially relevant for liverworts, while drainage class, topographic position index and PALSAR HH-polarized L-band were identified among the most important predictors for sphagna. These differences have important implications for management and conservation strategies for bryophytes. This study provides evidence of the potential of remote sensing for assessing and making predictions on bryophyte diversity across the landscape.

TI  - Statistical Analysis of Building Damage from the 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan and its Storm Surge in the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) hit the Philippines. It caused heavy loss of lives and extensive damages to buildings and infrastructure. When collapsed buildings are focused on, it is interesting to find that these buildings did not collapse for the same reasons after the landfall of the typhoon and storm surge. The objective of this study is to develop a statistical model for building damage due to Super Typhoon Haiyan and its storm surge. The data were collected in collaboration with Tanauan Municipality, the Philippines. The data for the inundation map were obtained by field surveys conducted on-site to determine the cause of the damages inferred from satellite data. The maximum wind speed was derived from the Holland parametric hurricane model based on the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) typhoon track data and the inundation depth of storm surge was calculated using the MIKE model. Multinomial logistic regression was used to develop a model to identify the significant factors influencing the damage to buildings. The result of this work is expected to be used to prepare urban plans for preventing damage from future storms.

TI  - Railway Infrastructure Classification and Instability Identification Using Sentinel-1 SAR and Laser Scanning Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques have been successfully applied for structural health monitoring of line-infrastructure such as railway. Limited by meter-level spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 satellite radar (SAR) imagery and meter-level geolocation precision, it is still challenging to (1) categorize radar scatterers (e.g., persistent scatterers (PS)) and associate radar scatterers with actual objects along railways, and (2) identify unstable railway segments using InSAR Line of Sight (LOS) deformation time series from a single viewing geometry. In response to this, (1) we assess and improve the 3-D geolocation quality of Sentinel-1 derived PS using a 2-step method for PS 3-D geolocation improvement aided by laser scanning data; after geolocation improvement, we step-wisely classify railway infrastructure into rails, embankments and surroundings; (2) we recognize unstable rail segments by utilizing the (localized) differential settlement of rails in the normal direction (near vertical) which is yielded from the LOS deformation decomposition. We tested and evaluated the methods using 170 Sentinel-1a/b ascending data acquired between January 2017 and December 2019, over the Betuwe freight train track, in the Netherlands. The results show that 98% PS were associated with real objects with a significance level of 25%, the PS settlement measurements were generally in line with the in-situ track survey Rail Infrastructure aLignment Acquisition (RILA) measurements, and the standard deviations of the PS settlement measurements varied slightly with an average value of 6.16 mm.

TI  - Review of antimicrobial resistance control strategies: low impact of prospective audit with feedback on bacterial antibiotic resistance within hospital settings
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundAntimicrobial stewardship constitutes an essential element of any concerted effort to tackle bacterial resistance, a rising public health threat both in community as well as hospital settings. The term comprises variable strategies which aim to optimise prescribing practices through either antibiotic restrictions or prospective audits of prescriptions with subsequent feedback to clinicians. Although highly debated, the actual effects of the latter on the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of hospital flora are uncertain. The present study aims to review and evaluate the literature concerning the impact of persuasive stewardship strategies on antimicrobial resistance within hospitals.Materials and methodsA literature review covering the period to 1st April 2020 was conducted using the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Global Health and CINAHL Plus databases.ResultsFifteen studies were retrieved, including twelve simple before-and-after, and three interrupted time-series studies. Audit frequency and compliance rates varied broadly. The rationale of treatment optimisation is not clear in most cases. Overall, surveillance of sentinel microorganisms through antibiograms indicates ambiguous results, with uncertainty as to whether the few successes are due to a causal effect, random incidence fluctuations, or confounding. The most informative approach targeted solely fluoroquinolones, reporting improvements in relevant Pseudomonas susceptibilities and MRSA, but without sufficient data on other effects of the strategy to assess its overall utility in clinical practice.ConclusionHigher standard research is needed to address the actual effects of persuasive stewardship strategies on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. At present, they seem inadequate to play a decisive role in bacterial resistance control within hospitals.

TI  - High-Precision Stand Age Data Facilitate the Estimation of Rubber Plantation Biomass: A Case Study of Hainan Island, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell.) plantations constitute one of the most important agro-ecosystems in the tropical region of China and Southeast Asia, playing an important role in the carbon budget there. Accurately obtaining their biomass over a large area is challenging because of difficulties in acquiring the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) through remote sensing and the problem of biomass saturation. The stand age, which is closely related to the forest biomass, was proposed for biomass estimation in this study. A stand age map at an annual scale for Hainan Island, which is the second largest natural rubber production base in China, was generated using all Landsat and Sentinel-2 (LS2) data (1987-2017). Scatter plots and the correlation coefficient method were used to explore the relationship (e.g., biomass saturation) between rubber biomass and different LS2-based variables. Subsequently, a regression model fitted with the stand age (R-2 = 0.96) and a Random Forest (RF) model parameterizing with LS2-based variables and/or the stand age were respectively employed to estimate rubber biomass for Hainan Island. The results show that rubber biomass was saturated around 65 Mg/ha with all LS2-based variables. The regression model estimated biomass accurately (R-2 = 0.79 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 14.00 Mg/ha) and eliminated the saturation problem significantly. In addition to LS2-based variables, adding a stand age parameter to the RF models was found to significantly improve the prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.82-0.96 and RMSE = 4.08-10.59 Mg/ha, modeling using samples of different biomass sizes). However, all RF models overestimated the biomass of young plantations and underestimated the biomass of old plantations. A hybrid model integrating the optimal results of RF and regression models reduced estimation bias and generated the best performance (R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 12.48 Mg/ha). The total rubber biomass of Hainan Island in 2017 was about 5.40 x 10(7) Mg. The northward and westward expansions after 2000 had great impact on the biomass distribution, leading to a higher biomass density for the inland coastal strip from south to northeast and a lower biomass density in the northern and western regions.

TI  - Characterization of MSS Channel Reflectance and Derived Spectral Indices for Building Consistent Landsat 1-5 Data Record
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 1-5 multispectral scanner system (MSS) collected records of land surface mainly during 1972-1992. Investigations on MSS have been relatively limited compared with the numerous investigations on its successors, such as Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+). The benefits of the Landsat program are not fully accomplished without the inclusion of MSS archives. Investigations on the Landsat 1-5 MSS channel reflectance characteristics wereperformed followed by derived vegetation spectral indices and the Tasseled Cap (TC) transformed features mainly using a collection of synthesized records. On average, the Landsat 4 MSS is generally comparable to the Landsat 5 MSS. The Landsat 1-3 MSSs show disagreement in channel reflectance compared with the Landsat 5 MSS, especially for the red channel (600-700 nm) and the near-infrared channel (700-800 nm). Meanwhile, the relative differences for vegetation spectral indices of the Landsat 3 MSS are mainly from -16% to -5% with the median about -11.5%, while those of the Landsat 2 MSS are mainly from -15% to -7%. Cross-validation tests and two case applications suggested that between-sensor consistency was improved generally through the transformation models generated by ordinary least-squares regression. To improve the consistency of the vegetation indices and the TC greenness, direct strategy employing respective transformation models was more effective than calculations based on the transformed channel reflectance. Considering the shortages of the Landsat MSS archives, further efforts are needed to improve its comparability with observations by other successive Landsat sensors.

TI  - Tea disease spot recognition based on image feature points extraction and matching
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: adaptation of tea disease spot recognition method based on image feature points extraction and matching, can achieve fast and accurate recognition of tea disease spot, and provide reference for remote sensing disease monitoring with plant protection UAV at low altitude. Methods: hyperspectral imaging technology and image processing technology are used to collect hyperspectral images of 4 kinds of samples, such as anthracnose, brown leaf spot disease, tea white star and healthy leaf, and the extracted spectral reflectance of sensitive waveband of interest region is regarded as spectral feature. Twice principal component analysis is performed to obtain the second principal component image after the second principal component analysis as the feature image. Computer processing technology and pattern recognition technology are utilized to analyze characteristic parameters of tea disease spot, like color, shape and texture. On the basis of the feature that tone of tea disease spot in HSI (hue-saturation-intensity) color space is different. H component image is employed to extract tea disease spot, so as to get the tea disease spot image. n total, 12 colors parameters, 11 shape parameters and 8 texture parameters of each disease spot region are extracted. 20 feature parameters of strong classification ability are selected using variance and principal component analysis method to form classification eigenvectors. 35 eigenvectors of tea non-disease spot and 35 eigenvectors of tea disease spot tea are randomly selected to compose the training set. Fischer discriminant function is utilized for accurate recognition of tea disease spot based on the training set. Results: information of disease spot of the leaves with different types of disease has obvious features in the PC2 image. The features of PC2 image is regarded as the feature image for disease spot extraction later. The segmentation effect of anthracnose and tea white star is better. Images of disease spot region of different types before and after segmentation are obtained. The correct recognition rate of tea disease test set is 90%, and the correct recognition rate of non-disease test set is 95%. Conclusion: the proposed method can accurately identify tea disease spot, and provide technical support for monitoring the disease of tea at low altitude.

TI  - Object-Oriented Open-Pit Mine Mapping Using Gaofen-2 Satellite Image and Convolutional Neural Network, for the Yuzhou City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our society's growing need for mineral resources brings with it the associated risk of degrading our natural environment as well as impacting on neighboring communities. To better manage this risk, especially for open-pit mine (OM) operations, new earth observation tools are required for more accurate baseline mapping and subsequent monitoring. The purpose of this paper is to propose an object-oriented open-pit mine mapping (OOMM) framework from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-spatial resolution satellite image (HSRSI), based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To better present the different land use categories (LUCs) in the OM area, a minimum heterogeneity criterion-based multi-scale segmentation method was used, while a mean area ratio method was applied to optimize the segmentation scale of each LUC. After image segmentation, three object-feature domains were obtained based on the GF-2 HSRSI: spectral, texture, and geometric features. Then, the gradient boosting decision tree and Pearson correlation coefficient were used as an object feature information reduction (FIR) method to recognize the distinguishing feature that describe open-pit mines (OMs). Finally, the CNN was used by combing the significant features to map the OM. In total, 105 OM sites were extracted from the interpretation of GF-2 HSRSIs and the boundary of each OM was validated by field work and used as inputs to evaluate the open-pit mine mapping (OMM) accuracy. The results revealed that: (1) the FIR tool made a positive impact on effective OMM; (2) by splitting the segmented objects into two groups, training and testing sets which are composed of 70% of the objects, and validation sets which are formed by the remaining 30% of the objects, then combing the selected feature subsets for training to achieve an overall accuracy (OA) of 90.13% and a Kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.88 of the whole datasets; (3) comparing the results of the state-of-the-art method, support vector machine (SVM), in OMM, the proposed framework outperformed SVM by more than 7.28% in OA, 8.64% in KC, 6.15% in producer accuracy of OM and by 9.31% in user accuracy of OM. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that OM information has been used through the integration of multiscale segmentation of HSRSI with the CNN to get OMM results. The proposed framework can not only provide reliable technical support for the scientific management and environmental monitoring of open pit mining areas, but also be of wide generality and be applicable to other kinds of land use mapping in mining areas using HSR images.

TI  - Impacts of Building Features on the Cooling Effect of Vegetation in Community-Based MicroClimate: Recognition, Measurement and Simulation from a Case Study of Beijing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the accumulation of heat, the urban environment and human health are threatened. Land surface cover has effects on the thermal environment; nevertheless, the effects of land surface features and spatial patterns remain poorly known in a community-based microclimate. This study quantified and verified the impacts of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on land surface temperature (LST) (K, the slope of the trend line of a linear regression between NDVI and LST) in different building density by using building outline and Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Comparing the cooling effect and distribution of vegetation showed that the vegetative cover had a cooling effect on LST, characterized by synchronous change, and building density had a significant impact on the cooling effect of vegetation. Through identification and simulation, it was found that the key factor is the wind speed between the buildings because, in different building densities, the wind speed was different, and studies had shown that when the building density was between 0.35 and 0.50, the wind speed between buildings was higher, resulting in a better cooling effect of vegetation. This conclusion has important reference significance for urban planning and mitigating the impact of the thermal environment on human health.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> with high-resolution 1-km AOD data and an improved machine learning model over Shenzhen, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or smaller (PM2.5) are closely related to the atmospheric environment and human activities but are often limited by ground-level in situ observations. Satellite remote sensing techniques have been widely used to estimate the PM2.5 concentration over large areas where ground-monitoring sites are unavailable. However, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) products usually feature a coarse resolution, which is insufficient for the estimation of the urban-scale PM2.5 concentration. We developed a new improved random forest (IRF) model based on machine learning and a newly released AOD product with a high resolution of 1-km, which could more effectively and accurately estimate the PM2.5 concentration over Shenzhen in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), China. Daily PM2.5 concentrations from 2016 to 2018 were estimated from ground-level PM2.5 and meteorological variable data. The popular linear regression model, geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model and random forest (RF) model without spatiotemporal information were employed for comparison and validation purposes through the 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach. The IRF model attained an overall R-2 value of 0.915 and a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 3.66 mu g m(-3). This suggests that the IRF model can estimate the urban PM2.5 concentration with a high spatial resolution at the daily, seasonal and annual scales, and the improved machine learning method is better than the linear model proposed by previous studies in terms of the estimation accuracy of the PM2.5 concentration. Generally, the IRF model coupled with AOD data with a 1-km resolution can significantly improve the calculation accuracy of the atmospheric PM2.5 concentration over coastal urban areas in the future.

TI  - Feature-Level Fusion between Gaofen-5 and Sentinel-1A Data for Tea Plantation Mapping
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate mapping of tea plantations is significant for government decision-making and environmental protection of tea-producing regions. Hyperspectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have recently been widely used in land cover classification, but effective integration of these data for tea plantation mapping requires further study. This study developed a new feature-level image fusion method called LPPSubFus that combines locality preserving projection and subspace fusion (SubFus) to map tea plantations. Based on hyperspectral and SAR data, we first extracted spectral indexes, textures, and backscattering information. Second, this study applied LPPSubFus to tea plantation mapping with different classification algorithms. Finally, we compared the performance of LPPSubFus, SubFus, and pixel-level image fusion in tea plantation mapping. Feature-level image fusion performed better than pixel-level image fusion. An improvement of about 3% was achieved using feature-level image fusion compared to hyperspectral data alone. Regarding feature-level image fusion, LPPSubFus improved the overall accuracy by more than 3% compared to SubFus. In particular, LPPSubFus using neural network algorithms achieved the highest overall accuracy (95%) and over 90% producer and user accuracy for tea plantations and forests. In addition, LPPSubFus was more compatible with different classification algorithms than SubFus. Based on these findings, it is concluded that LPPSubFus has better and more stable performance in tea plantation mapping than pixel-level image fusion and SubFus. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating hyperspectral and SAR data via LPPSubFus for mapping tea plantations. Our work offers a promising tea plantation mapping method and contributes to the understanding of hyperspectral and SAR data fusion.

TI  - Analysis of Methane Concentration Anomalies over Burned Areas of the Boreal and Arctic Zone of Eastern Siberia in 2018-2019 Using TROPOMI Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results are presented from a spatiotemporal analysis of dynamics of the methane concentrations over Yakutia in May-September 2018-2019, based on daily data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard on the Sentinel-5 satellite of the multi-satellite Copernicus environmental monitoring system (the European Union's Earth observation program) and other satellite instruments. Stable areas of increased methane concentrations are detected not only during wildfires but in postfire periods over the burned areas of earlier years, due probably to the intensification of permafrost thawing. Intraseasonal trends in the dynamics of the methane concentrations over burned-out and background areas are detected. Potential cause-effect relationship between the observed phenomena are analyzed. It is found that anomalous CH4 concentrations over newly burned areas exceed background values by 5-15 ppb in July-September 2018 and 2019 and 10-15 ppb over last year's burns from May to September.

TI  - Exploratory analysis of cooling effect of urban lakes on land surface temperature in Bucharest (Romania) using Landsat imagery
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the influence of the urban lakes from Bucharest (Romania) on the microclimate of their hinterland using satellite remote sensing products. The land surface temperature (LST) at 30 m spatial resolution was retrieved from Landsat TM and TIRS imagery referring to clear-sky conditions over the study area. The influence of the urban lakes on the LST was analysed for different land cover categories over 30 m-wide buffers placed between 0 and 300 m distance from the lake shorelines. The outputs reveal that the LST increases with the distance from the water for all the land cover categories, differentiated according to the urban landscape. Depending on the land cover, the mean LST increases with 1.0 degrees to 1.7 degrees C in the first 30 m around the lakes, and with 2.5 degrees to 5.0 degrees C in the first 300 m from the lake shoreline. This study highlights the potential of the high spatial resolution satellite imagery to produce accurate information for urban climate monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of the National Air Pollutant Emission Inventory (CAPSS 2016) and the Major Cause of Change in Republic of Korea
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, air pollutant emissions in the Republic of Korea were 795,044 metric tons (hereafter tons) of CO, 1,248,309 tons of NOx, 358,951 tons of SOx, 611,539 tons of TSP, 233,085 tons of PM10, 100,247 tons of PM2.5, 16,401 tons of BC, 1,024,029 tons of VOCs, and 301,301 tons of NH3. Including energy production, thirteen emission sources, which comprise the national air pollutant emission inventory, were classified by their characteristics into five sectors (Energy, Industry, Road, Non-road, and Everyday Activities and Other Emission Sources) to analyze their relative contributions to the national emissions. Specifically, their contributions by pollutant were as follows: NOx (11.0%), SOx (21.9%), PM2.5 (3.2%), VOCs (0.8%), NH3 (0.5%) from the energy sector; NOx (20.2%), SOx (59.7%), PM2.5 (42.1%), VOCs (24.3%), and NH3 (14.4%) from the industry sector; NOx (36.3%), SOx (0.1%), PM2.5 (9.7%), VOCs (4.6%), and NH3 (1.7%) from the road sector; NOx (24.8%), SOx (11.5%), PM2.5 (14.3%), VOCs (4.0%), and NH3 (0.04%) from the non-road sector; and NOx (7.6%), SOx (6.7%), PM2.5 (30.6%), VOCs (66.3%), and NH3 (83.4%) from the everyday activities and other emission sources sector. The data we calculate are used as official national emissions data for the establishment, implementation, and assessment of national atmospheric environment policy to improve air quality. As critical and necessary materials, the data are also utilized on a wide range of studies on policies such as customized regional particulate matter reduction measures. Thus, it is crucial to estimate highly reliable national emissions by enhancing the emissions factors and inventory and to establish a scientific emissions testing system by using air quality modeling and satellite data.

TI  - Fish fauna and characteristics of Carassius auratus population in the Boryeong Reservoir.
T2  - Hangug Hwangyeong Saengmul Haghoeji
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the fish fauna and characteristics of the Carassius auratus population in the Boryeong Reservoir in Chungcheongnam-do from October 2017 to June 2018. The collected fish were identified as 3,506 individuals of 15 species from a total of nine families. The dominant and subdominant species were H. nipponensis with 1,706 (48.6%) individuals and C. auratus with 1,021 (29.1%) individuals, respectively. The biomass of C. auratus (246,130 g), P. fulvidraco (50,610 g), C. cuvieri (14,730 g), S. asotus (11,560 g), and C. carpio (10,930 g) was analyzed. The results of the community analysis showed a dominant index value of 0.87 ([plus or minus]0.2), a diversity index value of 0.78 ([plus or minus]0.5), an evenness index value of 0.47 ([plus or minus]0.2), and a richness index value of 0.99 ([plus or minus]0.5). The length-weight analysis of C. auratus showed a regression coefficient b of 3.06, and a condition factor (K) of 0.0004 with a positive slope. The frequency distribution of the total length analysis of the C. auratus population inhabiting the Boryeong Reservoir showed a high distribution of lengths between 140-160 mm and a low distribution between 230-280 mm. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) was analyzed over the Boryeong Reservoir water surface from 2013 to 2014 using Landsat 8 channel data. The areas where the NDWI was decreased were located at the inflow site of Ungcheon Stream.

TI  - NOVEL PCR ASSAYS FOR THREE FUR MITES IN NATURALLY INFECTED MICE WITHOUT ANIMAL SACRIFICE
T2  - Taiwan Veterinary Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodent fur mite infestation is a persistent and intractable problem in laboratory rodent colonies, due to insensitive diagnostics, unrepresentative samples for testing and improper sentinel system. Myocoptes musculinus (COP), Myobia musculi (MOB) and Radfordia affinis (RDA) have been reported in laboratory mouse colonies. To improve the sensitivity and efficiency of fur mite detection, COP-specific PCR and MOB/RDA-specific PCR assays were developed to detect and differentiate these fur mites, with the existence of a rodent housekeeping gene. The COP-specific PCR and the MOB/RDA-specific PCR could specifically detect COP and MOB/RDA at as low as 10 copies, respectively. In comparison of the specific PCRs with traditional methods (pluck test, tape test and pelt exam) for fur mite diagnosis, 31 rodents and 17 cage environment samples were evaluated. In screening for the infestation status of various fur mites on individual animals, the specific PCR assays showed distinctly higher sensitivity and accuracy (100% and 100%) than those of the traditional methods (sensitivity: 25-80%, accuracy: 83.9-96.8%). Interestingly, by using cage wipe environmental samples, the specific PCR assays exhibited 100% sensitivity and accuracy in the fur mite detection and differentiation. The COP-specific and MOB/RDA-specific PCR assays developed in this study could be reliable alternatives for routine pathogen monitoring of laboratory mice and environments of animal facilities without animal sacrifice.

TI  - A Deep-Learning Model for Automated Detection of Intense Midlatitude Convection Using Geostationary Satellite Images
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense thunderstorms threaten life and property, impact aviation, and are a challenging forecast problem, particularly without precipitation-sensing radar data. Trained forecasters often look for features in geostationary satellite images such as rapid cloud growth, strong and persistent overshooting tops, U- or V-shaped patterns in storm-top temperature (and associated above-anvil CilTUS plumes), thermal couplets, intricate texturing in cloud albedo (e.g., "bubbling" cloud tops), cloud-top divergence, spatial and temporal trends in lightning, and other nuances to identify intense thunderstorms. In this paper, a machine-learning algorithm was employed to automatically learn and extract salient features and patterns in geostationary satellite data for the prediction of intense convection. Namely, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 0.64-mu m reflectance and 10.35-mu m brightness temperature from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and flash-extent density (FED) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) on board GOES-16. Using a training dataset consisting of over 220 000 human-labeled satellite images, the CNN learned pertinent features that are known to be associated with intense convection and skillfully discriminated between intense and ordinary convection. The CNN also learned a more nuanced feature associated with intense convection-strong infrared brightness temperature gradients near cloud edges in the vicinity of the main updraft. A successive-permutation test ranked the most important predictors as follows: 1) ABI 10.35-mu m brightness temperature, 2) ABI GLM flash-extent density, and 3) ABI 0.64-mu m reflectance. The CNN model can provide forecasters with quantitative information that often foreshadows the occurrence of severe weather, day or night, over the full range of instrument-scan modes.

TI  - PCR Detection of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in European Wild Rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) from Portugal
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife plays an important role in the epidemiological cycle of Toxoplasma gondii. The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) can be a source of infection to wild and domestic hosts, including human beings. Additionally, as an herbivorous animal, the European wild rabbit may also be a sentinel of environmental contamination with T. gondii and, consequently, an indicator of the potential transmission of this parasite. The purpose of the present work was to detect T. gondii DNA in European wild rabbit from central Portugal, as well as the possible implications for public health. Heart and diaphragm samples were obtained from 28 rabbits hunted in central Portugal. Nested PCR separately amplified the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the surface antigen 2 (SAG2) gene. T. gondii DNA was detected in 19 out of the 28 sampled animals, resulting in a prevalence of 67.9%. These results show that T. gondii infection occurs in European wild rabbit and therefore may pose a potential risk for humans if consumed as raw or undercooked meat. Measures should be taken in order to prevent infection by this zoonotic parasite and for the conservation of wildlife. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed by means of PCR on T. gondii in European wild rabbit meat samples.

TI  - Performance across WorldView-2 and RapidEye for reproducible seagrass mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing offers an effective remedy to challenges in ground-based and aerial mapping that have previously impeded quantitative assessments of global seagrass extent. Commercial satellite platforms offer fine spatial resolution, an important consideration in patchy seagrass ecosystems. Currently, no consistent protocol exists for image processing of commercial data, limiting reproducibility and comparison across space and time. Additionally, the radiometric performance of commercial satellite sensors has not been assessed against the dark and variable targets characteristic of coastal waters. This study compared data products derived from two commercial satellites: DigitalGlobe's WorldView-2 and Planet's RapidEye. A single scene from each platform was obtained at St. Joseph Bay in Florida, USA, corresponding to a November 2010 field campaign. A reproducible processing regime was developed to transform imagery from basic products, as delivered from each company, into analysis-ready data usable for various scientific applications. Satellite-derived surface reflectances were compared against field measurements. WorldView-2 imagery exhibited high disagreement in the coastal blue and blue spectral bands, chronically overpredicting. RapidEye exhibited better agreement than WorldView-2, but overpredicted slightly across all spectral bands. A deep convolutional neural network was used to classify imagery into deep water, land, submerged sand, seagrass, and intertidal classes. Classification results were compared to seagrass maps derived from photointerpreted aerial imagery. This study offers the first radiometric assessment of WorldView-2 and RapidEye over a coastal system, revealing inherent calibration issues in shorter wavelengths of WorldView-2. Both platforms demonstrated as much as 97% agreement with aerial estimates, despite differing resolutions. Thus, calibration issues in WorldView-2 did not appear to interfere with classifi-cation accuracy, but could be problematic if estimating biomass. The image processing routine developed here offers a reproducible workflow for WorldView-2 and RapidEye imagery, which was tested in two additional coastal systems. This approach may become platform independent as more sensors become available.

TI  - Comparison of Thermal Infrared-Derived Maps of Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Vegetation in Urban and Non-Urban Areas of Southern California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to understand the distribution of irrigated and non-irrigated vegetation in rapidly expanding urban areas that are experiencing climate-induced changes in water availability, such as Los Angeles, California. Mapping irrigated vegetation in Los Angeles is necessary for developing sustainable water use practices and accurately accounting for the megacity's carbon exchange and water balance changes. However, pre-existing maps of irrigated vegetation are largely limited to agricultural regions and are too coarse to resolve heterogeneous urban landscapes. Previous research suggests that irrigation has a strong cooling effect on vegetation, especially in semi-arid environments. The July 2018 launch of the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) offers an opportunity to test this hypothesis using retrieved land surface temperature (LST) data in complex, heterogeneous urban/non-urban environments. In this study, we leverage Landsat 8 optical imagery and 30 m sharpened afternoon summertime ECOSTRESS LST, then apply very high-resolution (0.6-10 m) vegetation fraction weighting to produce a map of irrigated and non-irrigated vegetation in Los Angeles. This classification was compared to other classifications using different combinations of sensors in order to offer a preliminary accuracy and uncertainty assessment. This approach verifies that ECOSTRESS LST data provides an accurate map (98.2% accuracy) of irrigated urban vegetation in southern California that has the potential to reduce uncertainties in regional carbon and hydrological cycle models.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimates at High Spatial and Temporal Resolutions from an Energy-Water Balance Model and Satellite Data in the Capitanata Irrigation Consortium
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of combining remotely sensed land surface temperature data (LST) and an energy-water balance model for improving evapotranspiration estimates over time distributed in space in the Capitanata irrigation consortium is analysed. The energy-water balance FEST-EWB model (flash flood event-based spatially distributed rainfall-runoff transformation-energy-water balance model) computes continuously in time and is distributed in space soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes solving for a land surface temperature that closes the energy-water balance equations. The comparison between modelled and observed LST was used to calibrate the model soil parametres with a newly developed pixel to pixel calibration procedure. The effects of the calibration procedure were analysed against ground measures of soil moisture and evapotranspiration. The FEST-EWB model was run at 30 m of spatial resolution for the period between 2013 and 2018. Absolute errors of 2.5 degrees C were obtained for LST estimates against satellite data; while RMSE around 0.06 and 40 Wm(-2) are found for ground measured soil moisture and latent heat flux, respectively.

TI  - Fires Represent an Important Source of Carbon Emissions in Mexico
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning, including fires, has been identified as the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles in the troposphere and one of the major drivers of global carbon (C) cycle, cloud properties, and climate. Most of the global C emissions happen in the Pantropic region. Modeling estimates suggest an increase in Mexican fire frequencies, intensity, and C emission to the atmosphere. However, no study has combined field and satellite data to estimate C emissions by fires for any tropical country. Here, we present an approach to estimate the spatiotemporal variability of fires and its total C emissions in Mexico with the associated climate that combines national fire inventories with remote sensing. We provide evidence that tropical ecosystems, particularly tropical forests at Yucatan Peninsula, Pacific Coast, and Gulf of Mexico, provide the largest C emissions with high fire densities. We found evidence to contrast the relationships of the interannual and intra-annual variability of C emissions with immediate and lagged climate effects such as El Nino and La Nina events. Data also indicate that C emissions from fires are up to 11 times higher than those from deforestation and account 19% of the total National CO2 emissions and 5% of the total Pantropical C emissions. Because fires are related to climate change, we encourage future studies to focus on climate fire feedbacks for implementing adequate climate mitigation strategies.

TI  - A short-term study of the fertility and embryonic development of <i>Tripneustes ventricosus</i> off the northwest coast of Puerto Rico
T2  - BIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea urchins are important sentinel species for marine biodiversity given that they help maintain coral reefs. The sea urchin species Tripneustes ventricosus is among the most abundant pantropical species, found around the world, including in the Caribbean. In Puerto Rico, T ventricosus live in the intertidal zones less than 30 m deep and showed rapid recovery, observed within 6 months, after Hurricane Maria. Despite their abundance and resilience, very little is known about their embryonic development or morphological characteristics that may shed light into their role in local coral reefs. The purpose of this project was to determine if T. ventricosus collected from a local beach could be used to study echinoid embryonic development. T. ventricosus proved to be easily collected and spawned using common laboratory techniques. Embryonic developmental timetables were similar to other known tropical sea urchin species. It is generally believed that T. ventricosus is important for the health of coral reefs in Puerto Rico, supporting the need for a more thorough understanding of the life cycle, spawning cycles and phylogeography of this species so important to coral reef survival in a changing environment.

TI  - Surface Energy Flux Estimation in Two Boreal Settings in Alaska Using a Thermal-Based Remote Sensing Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent Arctic warming has led to changes in the hydrological cycle. Circum-Arctic and circumboreal ecosystems are showing evidence of "greening" and "browning" due to temperature warming leading to shrub encroachment, tree mortality and deciduousness. Increases in latent heat flux from increased evapotranspiration rates associated with deciduous-dominated ecosystems may be significant, because deciduous vegetation has extremely high-water use and water storage capacity compared to coniferous and herbaceous plant species. Thus, the impact of vegetation change in boreal ecosystems on regional surface energy balance is a significant knowledge gap that must be addressed to better understand observed trends in water use/availability and tree mortality. To this end, output from a two-source energy balance model (TSEB) with modifications for high latitude boreal ecosystems was evaluated using flux tower measurements and Terra/Aqua MODIS remote sensing data collected over the two largest boreal forest types in Alaska (birch and black spruce). Data under clear and overcast days and from leaf-out to senescence from 2012 to 2016 were used for validation. Using flux tower observations and local model inputs, modifications to the model formulation for soil heat flux, net radiation partitioning, and canopy transpiration were required for the boreal forest. These improvements resulted in a mean absolute percent difference of around 23% for turbulent daytime fluxes when surface temperature from the flux towers was used, similar to errors reported in other studies conducted in warmer climates. Results when surface temperature from Terra/Aqua MODIS estimates were used as model input suggested that these model improvements are pertinent for regional scale applications. Vegetation indices and LAI time-series from the Terra/Aqua MODIS products were confirmed to be appropriate for energy flux estimation in the boreal forest to describe vegetation properties (LAI and green fraction) when field observations are not available. Model improvements for boreal settings identified in this study will be implemented operationally over North America to map surface energy fluxes at regional scales using long time series of remote sensing estimates as part of NOAA's GOES Evapotranspiration and Drought Information System.

TI  - Aboveground biomass corresponds strongly with drone-derived canopy height but weakly with greenness (NDVI) in a shrub tundra landscape
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic landscapes are changing rapidly in response to warming, but future predictions are hindered by difficulties in scaling ecological relationships from plots to biomes. Unmanned aerial systems (hereafter 'drones') are increasingly used to observe Arctic ecosystems over broader extents than can be measured using ground-based approaches and are facilitating the interpretation of coarse-grained remotely sensed data. However, more information is needed about how drone-acquired remote sensing observations correspond with ecosystem attributes such as aboveground biomass. Working across a willow shrub-dominated alluvial fan at a focal study site in the Canadian Arctic, we conducted peak growing season drone surveys with an RGB camera and a multispectral multi-camera array. We derived photogrammetric reconstructions of canopy height and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps along with in situ point-intercept measurements and aboveground vascular biomass harvests from 36, 0.25 m(2) plots. We found high correspondence between canopy height measured using in situ point-intercept methods compared to drone-photogrammetry (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.808), although the photogrammetry heights were positively biased by 0.14 m relative to point-intercept heights. Canopy height was strongly and linearly related to aboveground biomass, with similar coefficients of determination for point-intercept (R-2 = 0.92) and drone-based methods (R-2 = 0.90). NDVI was positively related to aboveground biomass, phytomass and leaf biomass. However, NDVI only explained a small proportion of the variance in biomass (R-2 between 0.14 and 0.23 for logged total biomass) and we found moss cover influenced the NDVI-phytomass relationship. Vascular plant biomass is challenging to infer from drone-derived NDVI, particularly in ecosystems where bryophytes cover a large proportion of the land surface. Our findings suggest caution with broadly attributing change in fine-grained NDVI to biomass differences across biologically and topographically complex tundra landscapes. By comparing structural, spectral and on-the-ground ecological measurements, we can improve understanding of tundra vegetation change as inferred from remote sensing.

TI  - Fire Activity in Mediterranean Forests (The Algerian Case)
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Algeria has high wildfire activity, albeit restricted to the northern coastal fringe. However, no study has investigated why fire is restricted to that area, and what combination of factors explains the occurrence of wildfires. Here, we describe the current fire regime of Northern Algeria from 2000 to 2019 and we correlate fire activity to a range of environmental and anthropic drivers. We found a strong north-south gradient in fire occurrence: it is maximal in the high-fueled (productive) oak forests of Northern Algeria with high annual rainfall amount, whereas it is fuel-limited in the South due to semi-arid conditions. We determined that fire is nearly absent where the bioclimate is subarid or arid, due to the steppic vegetation with summer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values below 0.35. Therefore, fire occupies a narrow niche in space (the humid and subhumid areas with high productivity) and in time as most fires occur in summer after the high rainfalls from fall to spring that promote fuel growth. Humans also play a role as fire hotspots are concentrated in croplands and in built-up areas with high human density and infrastructures mixed with shrublands and forests. We discuss how the ongoing climate changes and the desertification progressing towards the North of Algeria may finally restrict forests to a narrow fringe providing less and less ecological services to the Algerian people.

TI  - The urban greenness score: A satellite-based metric for multi-decadal characterization of urban land dynamics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Canada's urban areas have experienced extensive growth over the past quarter century; however, there has been no consistent, spatially explicit approach for quantifying the loss and gain of greenness in cities nationally. Herein, we developed a novel urban greenness score metric using greenness fractions from a multi-decadal time series (1984-2016) of spectrally unmixed annual Landsat satellite image composites to characterize final year (2016) greenness and its overall change for 18 major Canadian urban areas, summarized by census dis-semination area (DA). The applied validation procedure confirmed correlation coefficients (rho) ranging from 0.67 - 0.85 between reference and estimated greenness fractions, indicating that spectral unmixing is an appropriate method for extracting urban greenness from a time series of medium spatial resolution satellite imagery. Most DAs across Canada sustained a moderate (similar to 20 % - 40 %) or low (less than or similar to 20 %) level of greenness between 1984 and 2016, but overall there was a decreasing trend in greenness. Eastern urban areas maintained the most greenness over time, while urban areas in the Prairies had the greatest increase in greenness. Densely populated urban areas experienced the greatest loss in greenness (16 % of DAs); whereas, urban areas with a moderately-low density experienced the greatest increase (14 % of DAs). In agreement with previous studies, we found that greenness was negatively associated with urban infilling, with lower greenness levels typically found in urban cores, and greenness loss most often found in the urban periphery in conjunction with urban expansion. Methods presented in this analysis take advantage of the open and longstanding Landsat archive, as well as multiple spatial scales, including sub-pixel unmixing techniques, pixel level greenness faction data summarized for management units, and analysis conducted nationally. The developed urban greenness score provides a comprehensive framework to understand current urban greenness and relate it to its recent past, which supports long-term strategic planning, and can be transferred to other regions across spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Green Vegetation Cover Has Steadily Increased since Establishment of Community Forests in Western Chitwan, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Community forests have been established worldwide to sustainably manage forest ecosystem services while maintaining the livelihoods of local residents. The Chitwan National Park in Nepal is a world-renowned biodiversity hotspot, where community forests were consolidated in the park's buffer zone after 1993. These western Chitwan community forests stand as the frontiers of human-environment interactions, nurturing endangered large mammal species while providing significant natural resources for local residents. Nevertheless, no systematic forest cover assessment has been conducted for these forests since their establishment. In this study, we examined the green vegetation dynamics of these community forests for the years 1988-2018 using Landsat surface reflectance products. Combining an automatic water extraction index, spectral mixture analysis and the normalized difference fraction index (NDFI), we developed water masks and quantified the water-adjusted green vegetation fractions and NDFI values in the forests. Results showed that all forests have been continuously greening up since their establishment, and the average green vegetation cover of all forests increased from approximately 30% in 1988 to above 70% in 2018. With possible contributions from the invasion of exotic understory plant species, we credit community forestry programs for some of the green-up signals. Monitoring of forest vegetation dynamics is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of community forestry as well as developing sustainable forest management policies. Our research will provide positive feedbacks to local community forest committees and users.

TI  - Mapping understory invasive plant species with fi eld and remotely sensed data in Chitwan, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring invasive species distribution and prevalence is important, but direct field-based assessment is often impractical. In this paper, we introduce and validate a cost-effective method for mapping understory invasive plant species. We utilized Landsat imagery, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and a maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling framework to map the spatial extent of Mikania micrantha in Chitwan National Park, Nepal and community forests within its buffer zone. We developed a spectral library from reference and image sources and applied multiple endmember SMA (MESMA) to selected Landsat imagery. Incorporating the resultant green vegetation and shade fractions into Maxent, we mapped the distribution of understory M. micrantha in the study area, with training and testing Area under Curve (AUC) values around 0.80, and kappa around 0.55. In vegetated places, especially mature forests, an increase in green vegetation fraction and decrease in shade fraction was associated with higher likelihood of M. micrantha presence. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a model input further improved map accuracy (AUC around 0.95; kappa around 0.80). Elevation, a surrogate for distance to water in this case, proved to be the determining factor of M. micrantha's distribution in the study area. The combination of MESMA and Maxent can provide significant opportunities for understanding understory vege-tation distribution, and contribute to ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, and provision of sustainable ecosystem services in protected areas.

TI  - Mapping forest windthrows using high spatial resolution multispectral satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind disturbances represent the main source of damage in European forests, affecting them directly (wind-throws) or indirectly due to secondary damages (insect outbreaks and forest fires). The assessment of wind-throws damages is very important to establish adequate management plans and remote sensing can be very useful for this purpose. Many types of optical remote sensing data are available with different spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions, and many options are possible for data acquisition, i.e. immediately after the event or after a certain time. The objective of this study is to compare the windthrows mapping capabilities of two multispectral satellite constellations (i.e. Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) characterized by very different spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions, and to evaluate the impact of the acquisition conditions on the mapping results. The analysed area, with an extent of 732 km(2), is located in the Trentino-South Tyrol region (Italy) which was affected by the Vaia storm on the 27th-30th of October 2018, causing serious forest damages. The change vector analysis technique was used to detect the windthrows. For each data source, two pairs of images were considered: 1) preand postevent images acquired as close as possible to the event; 2) preand postevent images acquired at optimal conditions, i.e. at similar phenological state and similar illumination conditions. The results obtained with the two satellite constellations are very similar despite their different resolutions. Data acquired in optimal conditions allowed having the best detection rate (accuracy above 80 %), while data acquired just after the event showed many limitations. Improved spatial resolution (PlanetScope data) allows for a better delineation of the borders of the windthrow areas and of the detection of smaller windthrow patches.

TI  - Monitoring Land Surface Temperature Change with Landsat Images during Dry Seasons in Bac Binh, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming-induced climate change evolved to be one of the most important research topics in Earth System Sciences, where remote sensing-based methods have shown great potential for detecting spatial temperature changes. This study utilized a time series of Landsat images to investigate the Land Surface Temperature (LST) of dry seasons between 1989 and 2019 in the Bac Binh district, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam. Our study aims to monitor LST change, and its relationship to land-cover change during the last 30 years. The results for the study area show that the share of Green Vegetation coverage has decreased rapidly for the dry season in recent years. The area covered by vegetation shrank between 1989 and 2019 by 29.44%. Our findings show that the LST increase and decrease trend is clearly related to the change of the main land-cover classes, namely Bare Land and Green Vegetation. For the same period, we find an average increase of absolute mean LST of 0.03 degrees C per year for over thirty years across all land-cover classes. For the dry season in 2005, the LST was extraordinarily high and the area with a LST exceeding 40 degrees C covered 64.10% of the total area. We expect that methodological approach and the findings can be applied to study change in LST, land-cover, and can contribute to climate change monitoring and forecasting of impacts in comparable regions.

TI  - Application of an Index-Based Approach in Geospatial Techniques for the Mapping of Flood Hazard Areas: A Case of Cape Coast Metropolis in Ghana
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods remain one of the disasters that destroy properties, livelihoods, and in extreme situations, take lives. As a way of prevention, geospatial applications have been employed in many cities to map flood zones and predict floods. For a country such as Ghana, floods have been ranked as the second fatal disaster after epidemics leading to several kinds of research to resolve them. To date, the Cape Coast Metropolis (CCM) has received little attention in terms of research, though flood cases in the area continue to escalate. This study, therefore, examines the use of geospatial techniques as tools in addressing flood problems in the CCM of Ghana. From a Digital Elevation Model, hydrologic variables were generated using the ArcGIS software (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). The soil drainage classification for the study was generated from a downloaded African Soil Grid Drainage map, while other important factors that influenced flooding in the CCM were obtained from Landsat 8 imagery. Over 21% of the CCM was classified as high flood hazard zones with areas around the river Kakum estuary being flood hotspots. It is, therefore, recommended that the CCM Assembly fund dredging of streams/rivers and promote afforestation along river banks to reduce the risk of flooding within the metropolis.

TI  - Modelling landscape ecological assessments of land use and cover change scenarios. Application to the Bojnourd Metropolitan Area (NE Iran)
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the spatiotemporal dynamics of Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) and their socio-ecological consequences on the landscape is essential for understanding the relationships between social and natural phenomena, especially in metropolitan areas. All research into the effects of metropolitan land-cover dynamics on landscape ecology should include two basic parts: LUCC simulation and Landscape Ecological Assessment (LEA). This paper proposes a novel integrated LEA-LUCC model that includes Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Markov Chains (MC) and Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI) able to cope with the complex and nonlinear nature of metropolitan socio-ecological systems. Based on Landsat satellite images (1988, 1998, 2008, 2018) of the Bojnourd Metropolitan Area (NE Iran), and using MLPNN and MC to simulate LUCC (2028, 2038), we compare historical and future scenarios and assess their impact on ECI. Our research showed the potential of the tested models for recognizing spatiotemporal LUCC and the efficiency of remote sensing data in LUCC assessment, especially in regions lacking land-cover databases. As the outcome of the integrated models reveals, LUCC in the metropolis of Bojnourd could cause an important depression of landscape ecological functioning. The proposed LEA-LUCC model is a valuable tool for enhancing landscape sustainability in dynamic metropolitan areas and for predicting the effects of land-use planning. The LEA-LUCC model should help policy-makers and land-managers choose appropriate strategies in the socio-ecological transition of complex metropolitan systems.

TI  - Integrating an Expert System, GIS, and Satellite Remote Sensing to Evaluate Land Suitability for Sustainable Tea Production in Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land evaluation is important for assessing environmental limitations that inhibit higher yield and productivity in tea. The aim of this research was to determine the suitable lands for sustainable tea production in the northeastern part of Bangladesh using phenological datasets from remote sensing, geospatial datasets of soil-plant biophysical properties, and expert opinions. Sentinel-2 satellite images were processed to obtain layers for land use and land cover (LULC) as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) were used to generate the elevation layer. Other vector and raster layers of edaphic, climatic parameters, and vegetation indices were processed in ArcGIS 10.7.1(R) software. Finally, suitability classes were determined using weighted overlay of spatial analysis based on reclassified raster layers of all parameters along with the results from multicriteria analysis. The results of the study showed that only 41,460 hectares of land (3.37% of the total land) were in the highly suitable category. The proportions of moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and not suitable land categories for tea cultivation in the Sylhet Division were 9.01%, 49.87%, and 37.75%, respectively. Thirty-one tea estates were located in highly suitable areas, 79 in moderately suitable areas, 24 in marginally suitable areas, and only one in a not suitable area. Yield estimation was performed with the NDVI (R-2 = 0.69, 0.66, and 0.67) and the LAI (R-2 = 0.68, 0.65, and 0.63) for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. This research suggests that satellite remote sensing and GIS application with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) could be used by agricultural land use planners and land policy makers to select suitable lands for increasing tea production.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF AIR POLLUTION PARAMETERS USING COVARIANCE FUNCTION THEORY
T2  - ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING S-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA S
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyses the intensity changes of three pollution parameter vectors in space and time. The RGB raster pollution data of the Lithuanian territory used for the research were prepared according to the digital images of the Sentinel-2 Earth satellites. The numerical vectors of environmental pollution parameters CH4 (methane), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and for direct comparison O-2 (oxygen gas) were used for the calculations. The covariance function theory was used to perform the analysis of intensity changes in digital vectors. Estimates of the covariance functions of the numerical vectors of pollution parameters and O-2 or the auto-covariance functions of single vectors are calculated from random functions consisting of arrays of measurement parameters of all parameters vectors. Correlation between parameters vectors depends on the density of parameters and their structure. Estimates of covariance functions were calculated by changing the quantization interval on a time scale and using a compiled computer program using the Matlab procedure package. The probability dependence between the environmental pollution parameter vectors and trace gas of the territory in Lithuania and their change in time scale was determined.

TI  - Fatty acid compositions of four benthic species along the salinity gradient of a human impacted and mangrove dominated tropical estuary (Can Gio, Vietnam)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical estuaries are characterised by high spatial and temporal variability in the conditions they provide for living organisms, which in turn may affect their biochemical composition. Anthropogenic contaminants such as nutrients, antibiotics, pesticides and trace metals may also affect the biochemical composition of these coastal organisms, notably with regard to fatty acids (FA), of which optimal species-specific polyunsaturated FA ratios are required to maintain living species in healthy conditions. The objective of this study was to evidence changes in the FA profile of four ubiquist benthic species in relation to the salinity gradient of a human impacted and mangrove dominated tropical estuary (Can Gio, Southern Vietnam). Among the four benthic species studied, two exhibited spatial and seasonal changes in their FA composition: the varunid crab Metaplax elegans and the predatory mangrove murex snail Chicoreus capucinus. Proportions of the FA 16:1 omega 7, proportions of highly unsaturated FA and ratios of eicosapentanoic acid/arachidonic acid in the tissues of both species seemed related to upstream inputs. Different relative abundances of benthic microalgae affected both claw muscle and hepatopancreas FA composition of M. elegans, while the FA composition of C. capucinus shows that the influence of prey's diet might be transferred within trophic chains. Finally, some species, such as Nerita balteata and Metapenaeus ensis might have more adaptive capacities, because of their mobility, or because of their specific metabolic pathways, minimizing the potential impact of spatial and/or temporal changes in food resources quality. A starvation experiment involving N. balteata actually revealed the metabolic synthesis of non-methylene interrupted FA that may confer cell membranes a higher resistance to external stressors than common polyunsaturated FA. Our study highlights the future possibility of using the FA composition of sentinel organisms (i.e. feeding on specific food resources and/or especially subject to environmental stresses) as a bioindicator tool to assess mangrove ecosystems health.

AB  - On June 29 and 30, 2019, a mollusk inventory was carried out at various locations in the northeastern part of the province of Groningen, with an emphasis on mollusks that prefer brackish conditions. In the saltmarshes outside the dike, living specimens of Dwarf surf clam Mulinia lateralis, Dun sentinel Assiminea grayana and the saltmarsh slugs Alderia modesta and Limapontia depressa were found. Inland brackish waters yielded Conrad's false mussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata, Gulf wedge clam Rangia cuneata and Spire snail Ecrobia ventrosa. The discussion addresses, among others, the absence of the Lagoon cockle Cerastoderma glaucum, one of the most numerous species in the area, prior to its embankment. This species prefers shallow tidal river systems with a gradual fresh-salt water transition, an environment currently absent from the province of Groningen.

TI  - Apparent diffusion coefficient magnetic resonance imaging (ADC-MRI) in the axillary breast cancer lymph node metastasis detection: a narrative review
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence of axillary lymph nodes metastases in breast cancer is the most significant prognostic factor, with a great impact on morbidity, disease-related survival and management of ontological therapies; for this reason, adequate imaging evaluation is strictly necessary. Physical examination is not enough sensitive to assess breast cancer nodal status; axillary ultrasonography (US) is commonly used to detect suspected or occult nodal metastasis, providing exclusively morphological evaluation, with low sensitivity and positive predictive value. Currently, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary dissection are the milestone for the diagnostic assessment of axillary lymph node metastases, although its related morbidity. The impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of nodal metastases has been widely investigated, as it continues to represent the most promising imaging modality in the breast cancer management. In particular, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values represent additional reliable non-contrast sequences, able to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer MRI evaluation. Several studies largely demonstrated the usefulness of implementing DWI/ADC MRI in the characterization of breast lesions. Herein, in the light of our clinical experience, we perform a review of the literature regarding the diagnostic performance and accuracy of ADC value as potential pre-operative tool to define metastatic involvement of nodal structures in breast cancer patients. For the purpose of this review, PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS electronic databases were searched with different combinations of "axillary lymph node", "breast cancer", "MRUADC", "breast MRI" keywords. All original articles, reviews and metanalyses were included.

TI  - Parametric Models to Characterize the Phenology of the Lowveld Savanna at Skukuza, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mathematical models, such as the logistic curve, have been extensively used to model the temporal evolution of biological processes, though other similarly shaped functions could be (and sometimes have been) used for this purpose. Most previous studies focused on agricultural regions in the Northern Hemisphere and were based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This paper compares the capacity of four parametric double S-shaped models (Gaussian, Hyperbolic Tangent, Logistic, and Sine) to represent the seasonal phenology of an unmanaged, protected savanna biome in South Africa's Lowveld, using the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) generated by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer-High Resolution (MISR-HR) processing system on the basis of data originally collected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument since 24 February 2000. FAPAR time series are automatically split into successive vegetative seasons, and the models are inverted against those irregularly spaced data to provide a description of the seasonal fluctuations despite the presence of noise and missing values. The performance of these models is assessed by quantifying their ability to account for the variability of remote sensing data and to evaluate the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) of vegetation, as well as by evaluating their numerical efficiency. Simulated results retrieved from remote sensing are compared to GPP estimates derived from field measurements acquired at Skukuza's flux tower in the Kruger National Park, which has also been operational since 2000. Preliminary results indicate that (1) all four models considered can be adjusted to fit an FAPAR time series when the temporal distribution of the data is sufficiently dense in both the growing and the senescence phases of the vegetative season, (2) the Gaussian and especially the Sine models are more sensitive than the Hyperbolic Tangent and Logistic to the temporal distribution of FAPAR values during the vegetative season, and, in particular, to the presence of long temporal gaps in the observational data, and (3) the performance of these models to simulate the phenology of plants is generally quite sensitive to the presence of unexpectedly low FAPAR values during the peak period of activity and to the presence of long gaps in the observational data. Consequently, efforts to screen out outliers and to minimize those gaps, especially during the rainy season (vegetation's growth phase), would go a long way to improve the capacity of the models to adequately account for the evolution of the canopy cover and to better assess the relation between FAPAR and GPP.

TI  - Precipitation and aridity constraints from paleolakes on early Mars
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ancient climate of Mars remains an enigma despite the abundance of in situ and remote-sensing data revealing hydrological activity in the past. The crux of this debate-informed by geomorphic studies, chemical alteration observations, and numerical climate models-is the amount, distribution, and nature of surface water and precipitation (i.e., rain vs. snow). Here, we combined measurements of 96 openand closed-basin lakes with simple hydrological balances to constrain catchment-averaged precipitation, PT, integrated over a given runoff episode of indeterminate length during early Mars history. We included 13 systems containing both openand closed-basin lakes, providing fully bounded precipitation estimates (coupled systems). We show that, on average, P-T was greater than or similar to 4 m and less than or similar to 159 m; however, local precipitation was spatially variable and consistent with a complex, planetwide climate. Aridity indexes of open-basin lakes indicate some regions may have been at least as humid as semiarid terrestrial environments. Our results offer widely distributed, quantitative hydro climate constraints that can be used to test paleoclimate model scenarios, working toward bridging the gap between geological observations and climate theory for early Mars.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging compared to standard sentinel lymph node detection with blue dye in patients with vulvar cancer - a randomized controlled trial
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to assess the superiority of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid for the intraoperative visual detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) patients compared to standard SLN detection using Tc-99m-nanocolloid with blue dye.Methods. In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, VSCC patients underwent either the standard SLN procedure or with the hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. The primary endpoint was the percentage of fluorescent SLNs compared to blue SLNs. Secondary endpoints were successful SLN procedures, surgical outcomes and postoperative complications.Results. Forty-eight patients were randomized to the standard (n = 24) or fluorescence imaging group (n = 24) using ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. The percentage of blue SLNs was 65.3% compared to 92.5% fluorescent SLNs (p < 0.001). A successful SLN procedure was obtained in 92.1% of the groins in the standard group and 97.2% of the groins in the fluorescence imaging group (p = 0.33). Groups did not differ in surgical outcome, although more short-term postoperative complications were documented in the standard group (p = 0.041).Conclusions. Intraoperative visual detection of SLNs in patients with VSCC using ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid was superior compared to Tc-99m-nanocolloid and blue dye. The rate of successful SLN procedures between both groups was not significantly different. Fluorescence imaging has potential to be used routinely in the SLN procedure in VSCC patients to facilitate the search by direct visualization.

TI  - Sand Dune Dynamics Exploiting a Fully Automatic Method Using Satellite SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents an automatic procedure to quantify dune dynamics on isolated barchan dunes exploiting Synthetic Aperture RADAR satellite data. We use C-band datasets, allowing the multi-temporal analysis of dune dynamics in two study areas, one located between the Western Sahara and Mauritania and the second one located in the South Rayan dune field in Egypt. Our method uses an adaptive parametric thresholding algorithm and common geospatial operations. A quantitative dune dynamics analysis is also performed. We have measured dune migration rates of 2-6 m/year in the NNW-SSE direction and 11-20 m/year NNE-SSW for the South Rayan and West-Sahara dune fields, respectively. To validate our results, we have manually tracked several dunes per study area using Google Earth imagery. Results from both automatic and manual approaches are consistent. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the approach presented.

TI  - Applicability of sentinel lymph node biopsy in papillary thyroid cancer
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal surgical management of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) for T1-T2 tumors without pre or intmsurgical evidence of lymph node metastasis (cNO) remains controversial, since approximately 40% of patients have lymph node involvement (pN1) which becomes evident when a prophylactic lymphadenectonty (PL) is performed. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification with SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy imaging along with intmoperatory image techniques in early stages of PTC undergoing PL of central neck compartment (CNC).METHODS: A single-center, prospective consecutive study was designed for SLN mapping in patients with high suspicion of PTC (Bethesda V or VI) in early stage (eT1-2, eN0). Twenty-four patients underwent SLN identification with preoperative SPECT/CT and planar images (Tc-99m-nanocolloid albumin intratumoral injection). During surgery, SLN located in CNC was found by means of a gamma probe and portable gamma camera, and excised. Afterwards, CNC lymphadenectomy was performed in all cases without modifying the established protocol.RESULTS: SLNs were identified and accurately located in 23 (95.8%) patients. Nodal metastases (pN1) were confirmed in 9 (37.5%) patients, with one false negative case. The sensitivity was 88.9% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 93.3%, would have allowed to avoid PL in more than half of cases, a higher proportion than those found in other similar studies. No complications associated with the procedure were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that SLN biopsy by SPECT/CT along with intraoperatory image techniques is applicable in early stages of PTC (eT1-2, eN0), allowing to avoid unnecessary PL.

TI  - Hybrid Indocyanine Green-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-nanocolloid for Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography and Combined Radio- and Fluorescence-guided Sentinel Node Biopsy in Penile Cancer: Results of 740 Inguinal Basins Assessed at a Single Institution
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node (SN) biopsy in penile cancer (PeCa) is typically performed using Tc-99m-nanocolloid and blue dye. Recent reports suggested that the hybrid (radioactive and fluorescent) tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid may improve intraoperative optical SN identification.Objective: The current study aimed to confirm the reliability of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and to assess whether blue dye is still of added value.Design, setting, and participants: A total of 400 >= T1G2N0 PeCa patients were staged with SN biopsy at a single European centre. SNs were preoperatively identified with lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography. Intraoperatively, SNs were detected via gamma tracing, blue staining, and fluorescence imaging.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: All patients (n = 400, 740 groins) received ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Intraoperative SN identification rates were retrospectively evaluated. In those patients who received ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and blue dye (n = 266, 492 groins), SN visualisation rates were compared using the McNemar test.Results and limitations: In total, 740 groins were assessed. No tracer-related (allergic) reactions were reported. All preoperatively defined SNs (n = 1163) were localised intraoperatively. Of all excised SNs, 98% were detectable with gamma probe and 96% were visible with fluorescence imaging. In the analysis of the patients who received ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and blue dye, fluorescence imaging yielded a 39% higher SN detection rate than blue dye (95% confidence interval 36-43%, p < 0.001). Of the SNs that were tumour positive, 100% were intraoperatively visualised by fluorescence imaging, whereas merely 84% of the positive nodes stained blue.Conclusions: This study confirms that ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid is a reliable SN tracer for PeCa that significantly improves optical SN detection over blue dye.Patient summary: Hybrid indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid is a safe and reliable sentinel node (SN) tracer, as established in this large series of 400 penile cancer patients (740 groins). It enables accurate pre- and intraoperative SN identification and significantly improves SN detection rate compared with blue dye, without staining the surgical field or the need for an additional injection.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer: state of the art
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological neoplasm in developed countries. In literature, there are discordant data regarding the therapeutic value of systematic lymphadenectomy whereas the importance of lymph node status for determining prognosis and the need for adjuvant treatment is undoubted. Given the low risk of lymph-node metastases in the apparent early-stage disease and the significant surgical and postoperative risks when performing a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy, the surgical approach in these patients is controversial, ranging from no nodal evaluation to comprehensive pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy. The recent introduction of sentinel node mapping represents the mid-way between the execution and omission of node dissection in EC patients. Indeed, the sentinel node mapping has rapidly emerged as an alternative to complete lymphadenectomy to reduce morbidity. In the present review, we discuss the role of sentinel node mapping in the surgical management of EC evaluating all aspects of this procedure.

TI  - Evaluation of remotely sensed prediction and forecast models for <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> in the Chesapeake Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, an increase of gastrointestinal illness due to Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the consumption of raw shellfish has been reported in multiple regions around the United States. Studies mainly attribute this increase to rising sea surface temperatures and prolonged warm seasons in the mid-latitudes. Historically, temperature has been the main environmental determinant used to predict V. parahaemolyticus concentrations in shellfish and surface water. However, studies using in situ sampling campaigns have shown that additional water quality parameters can be useful in predicting the bacterium. While the time and cost of obtaining in situ samples throughout the Chesapeake Bay at regular time intervals can exceed available resources, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide predictions at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. This study uses satellite ocean color remote sensing and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the utility of remotely sensed information for Vibrio parahaemolyticus predictions in the Chesapeake Bay and whether additional remotely sensed information can improve predictions over conventional SST-based models. We find that the addition of remotely sensed salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a generally improves presence and abundance predictions compared to SST-only models. Models using remote sensing reflectances and SST also show potential for V. parahaemolyticus predictions, which could bypass the intermediary step of deriving water quality products from reflectances. Remotely sensed ocean color products and SST from one week prior to in situ V. parahaemolyticus measurements are evaluated and shown to be useful in bacterium predictions, which could provide lead-time for management decisions. The forecast models using ocean color products in addition to SST showed improvement over SST-only forecast models. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing can be a valuable tool to aid in higher resolution V. parahaemolyticus predictions and forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, particularly when multiple environmental predictors are employed. However, the complexities of using remotely sensed data for ecological modeling applications and evaluating model performance also highlight the need for more research in this area.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal variability of primary production in the Laptev Sea has been studied and its annual values have been determined using the data of a MODIS-Aqua scanner (mean for 2002-2018). Regional-specific algorithms of primary production and chlorophyll are used for this purpose for the first time. Two regions of the Laptev Sea-northwestern and southeastern-are distinguished on the basis of the primary production long-term averaged over many years. Seasonal variations in the primary production in the water column of the northwestern region are characterized by the maximum in June (245 mg C/m(2) per day). The maximal primary production in the southeastern region and over the entire area of the Laptev Sea (273-282 mg C/m(2) per day and 256-281 mg C/m(2) per day, respectively) is recorded from May to July. Daily and annual primary production in the southeastern region are 1.9 and 3 times higher, respectively, than in the northwestern region. The primary production mean for the Laptev Sea is 125 mg C/m(2) per day and the total annual primary production is 8 x 10(12) g C.

TI  - Synchronously Amplified Photoacoustic Image Recovery (SAPhIRe)
T2  - PHOTOACOUSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In molecular and cellular photoacoustic imaging with exogenous contrast agents, image contrast is plagued by background resulting from endogenous absorbers in tissue. By using optically modulatable nanoparticles, we develop ultra-sensitive photoacoustic imaging by rejecting endogenous background signals and drastically improving signal contrast through time-delayed pump-probe pulsed laser illumination. Gated by prior pump excitation, modulatable photoacoustic (mPA) signals are recovered from unmodulatable background through simple, real-time image processing to yield background-free photoacoustic signal recovery within tissue mimicking phantoms and from ex-vivo tissues. Inherently multimodal, the fluorescence and mPA sensitivity improvements demonstrate the promise of Synchronously Amplified Photoacoustic Image Recovery (SAPhIRe) for PA imaging in diagnosis and therapy.

TI  - Ongoing automated ground deformation monitoring of Domuyo - Laguna del Maule area (Argentina) using Sentinel-1 MSBAS time series: Methodology description and first observations for the period 2015-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Differential Interferometry (DInSAR) and its extensions to manage time series are nowadays well-known and mastered techniques to perform among others land-motion monitoring.We present here a fully automated monitoring service based on DInSAR and Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) methods. The automated processing chain named "InSAR automated Mass processing Toolbox for multidimensional Time series" (MasTer) is demonstrated with the peculiar case of the Laguna del Maule and Domuyo volcanoes, which are known to undergo significant inflation up to several cm or tens of cm per year.The here-described monitoring service is made of three components: an InSAR command line processor, the MSBAS processor and a number of shell scripts automatizing all tasks, from data downloading to updated displacement maps and time series. Thanks to the European Commission Copernicus Service, data are freely available every 12 or 6 days along each orbit, depending on ESA acquisition plan. Linear deformation rate maps and time series of vertical and East-West ground deformation computed by the MasTer tool are updated every 1-6 days on a web page, according to the 51 data availability. Interested user can request additional time series at coherent pixels that wouldn't be displayed on the web page and receive them by e-mail within a minute.Processing chain and preliminary observations at Domuyo and Laguna del Maule test site are presented and commented. The nearly 6 years long 2D time series of ground deformation allow highlighting recent changes in the well-known deformation at both volcanoes: Domuyo inflation stabilizes since beginning of 2019 while deformation at Laguna del Maule seems to gently accelerate since mid 2018. New deformation features are also identified, such as a 2 km wide 3 cm/yr circular subsidence at Laguna del Maule as well as a 2 cm/yr downward and 1 cm/yr eastward movement located to the East of Laguna Fea.

TI  - Tree Species Classification in Mixed Deciduous Forests Using Very High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on tree species composition is important for both the forest management and conservation sectors. In combination with machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery may provide an effective solution to reduce the need for labor-intensive and time-consuming field-based surveys. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of using multispectral WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery for the classification of three main tree species (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L., and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.) in a lowland, mixed deciduous forest in central Croatia. The pixel-based supervised classification was performed using two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, the contribution of gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features from WV-3 imagery in tree species classification was evaluated. Principal component analysis confirmed GLCM variance to be the most significant texture feature. Of the 373 visually interpreted reference polygons, 237 were used as training polygons and 136 were used as validation polygons. The validation results show relatively high overall accuracy (85%) for tree species classification based solely on WV-3 spectral characteristics and the RF classification approach. As expected, an improvement in classification accuracy was achieved by a combination of spectral and textural features. With the additional use of GLCM variance, the overall accuracy improved by 10% and 7% for RF and SVM classification approaches, respectively.

TI  - Axillary observation alone versus sentinel node biopsy: past, present and future perspectives
T2  - MINERVA CHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - The evolution of axillary surgery in breast cancer has led from complete axillary dissection (AD) to sentinel node biopsy (SNB). It has not stopped yet but continues with a progressive de-escalation of surgical procedures aiming at axillary conservation. In parallel, the meaning of axillary surgery has changed as well. Over time, the dual role of both a therapeutic and a staging procedure has decreased leaving room to other modalities to treat and stage breast cancer. Although, the gold standard for axillary staging in early breast cancer remains SNB, the idea that axillary surgery could be even omitted has been proposed. The concept of abandoning axillary surgery is revolutionary but not new. Historical literature provides interesting data on patients who did not receive any axillary treatment at all with no impact on their survival. Starting from this, several ongoing trials are working to demonstrate that in selected breast cancer cohorts the information deriving from axillary surgery is superfluous and "axillary observation" alone is as effective as SNB. Whilst surgery has been de-escalated to less invasive procedures, systemic treatment, radiotherapy, multigene assays and advanced imaging modalities have gained ground in the management of breast cancer. New research is expected to help select the subgroups of patients for whom axillary surgery is not necessary anymore. This is a qualitative review reporting the most relevant literature data from historical trials on the omission of axillary surgery to the most recent and ongoing ones.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance surveillance systems: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Epidemiological surveillance is one critical approach to estimate and fight the burden of antibiotic resistance (AR). Here we summarise the characteristics of surveillance systems devoted to the surveillance of AR worldwide and published in the literature.Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature available on PubMed from January 2007 to July 2019 (12.5 years). The keywords ('surveillance system' OR laboratory-based surveillance' OR 'syndromic surveillance' OR 'sentinel surveillance' OR 'integrated surveillance' OR 'population-based surveillance') AND ('antibiotic resistance' OR 'antimicrobial resistance') were used. This research was completed with AR monitoring systems available on websites.Results: We identified 71 AR surveillance systems described by 90 publications from 35 countries, including 64 (90.1%) national and 7 (9.9%) multinational surveillance systems. Two regions accounted for similar to 72% of systems: European region (37; 52.1%) and Region of the Americas (14; 19.7%). Fifty-three focused on AR surveillance in humans, 12 studied both humans and animals, and 6 focused only on animals. The two most common bacterial species reported were Staphylococcus aureus (42; 59.2%) and Escherichia coli (39; 54.9%). Of the 71 AR surveillance systems, 20 (28.2%) used prevalence as an indicator, 3 (4.2%) used incidence and 7 (9.9%) used both. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were monitored.Conclusions: Our results showed heterogeneous surveillance systems. A 'One Health' approach is needed to monitor AR, with reference to the WHO Global Action Plan. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - The Relationship Between Seismic and Aseismic Slip on the Philippine Fault on Leyte Island: Bayesian Modeling of Fault Slip and Geothermal Subsidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineating seismic and aseismic slip on faults allows the exploration of the complex relationship between these different modes of slip. Further, quantifying them helps in the assessment of seismogenic potential. We present a distributed slip model of the rate of aseismic slip along the Leyte island section of the Philippine Fault and make comparisons with the extent of seismic slip from the latest significant earthquakes in July 2017. We derived both coseismic and aseismic slip distributions from kinematic inversions of synthetic aperture radar interferometric (InSAR) observations using a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework. Velocity maps from stacking and time series analysis of ALOS interferograms spanning 4 years (2007-2011) show a step change in ground deformation right on the fault. Inverting for slip at depth reveals along-strike variations of aseismic slip rate over similar to 100 km. Aseismic slip on the surface reaches rates of more than 3 cm/yr, equivalent to the long-term slip rate (3.3 +/- 0.2 cm/yr). Over the same period, a 20-km segment in Tongonan appears to be locked. This segment ruptured in M-w 6.5 and M-w 5.8 earthquakes on 6 and 10 July 2017, respectively, as constrained by Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 InSAR data. Seismic slip appears to be restricted within the Tongonan segment, with up to 152 +/- 21 cm of left-lateral displacement. The slip budget and complementarity between the extents of interseismic and coseismic slip suggest that a seismogenic asperity exists in Tongonan. The presence of active hydrothermal systems and rate-strengthening materials provide physical conditions that can promote aseismic slip.

TI  - Optimizing Near Real-Time Detection of Deforestation on Tropical Rainforests Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early Warning Systems (EWS) for near real-time detection of deforestation are a fundamental component of public policies focusing on the reduction in forest biomass loss and associated CO2 emissions. Most of the operational EWS are based on optical data, which are severely limited by the cloud cover in tropical environments. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can help to overcome this observational gap. SAR measurements, however, can be altered by atmospheric effects on and variations in surface moisture. Different techniques of time series (TS) stabilization have been used to mitigate the instability of C-band SAR measurements. Here, we evaluate the performance of two different approaches to SAR TS stabilization, harmonic deseasonalization and spatial stabilization, as well as two deforestation detection techniques, Adaptive Linear Thresholding (ALT) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC). We set up a rigorous, Amazon-wide validation experiment using the Google Earth Engine platform to sample and process Sentinel-1A data of nearly 6000 locations in the whole Brazilian Amazonian basin, generating more than 8M processed samples. Half of those locations correspond to non-degraded forest areas, while the other half pertained to 2019 deforested areas. The detection results showed that the spatial stabilization algorithm improved the results of the MLC approach, reaching 94.36% global accuracy. The ALT detection algorithm performed better, reaching 95.91% global accuracy, regardless of the use of any stabilization method. The results of this experiment are being used to develop an operational EWS in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Prediction of topsoil properties at field-scale by using C-band SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing and validating digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques can facilitate precision agriculture im-plementation. This study generates and validates a technique for the spatial prediction of soil properties based on C-band radar data. To this end, (i) we focused on working at farm-field scale and conditions, a fact scarcely reported; (ii) we validated the usefulness of Random Forest regression (RF) to predict soil properties based on C-band radar data; (iii) we validated the prediction accuracy of C-band radar data according to the coverage condition (for example: crop or fallow); and (iv) we aimed to find spatial relationship between soil apparent electrical conductivity and C-band radar. The experiment was conducted on two agricultural fields in the southern Argentine Pampas. Fifty one Sentinel 1 Level-1 GRD (Grid) products of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) were processed. VH and VV polarizations and the dual polarization SAR vegetation index (DPSVI) were estimated. Soil information was obtained through regular-grid sample scheme and apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements. Soil properties predicted were: texture, effective soil depth, ECa at 0-0.3m depth and ECa at 0-0.9m depth. The effect of water, vegetation and soil on the depolarization from SAR backscattering was analyzed. Complementary, spatial predictions of all soil properties from ordinary cokriging and Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) were evaluated using six different soil sample sizes: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and the total of the grid sampling scheme. The results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of C-band SAR data for most of the soil properties evaluated varies considerably and is closely dependent on the coverage type and weather dynamics. The polarizations with high prediction accuracy of all soil properties showed low values of sigma(o)(VV) and sigma(o)(VH), while those with low prediction accuracy showed high values of sigma(o)(VV) and low values of sigma(o)(VH). The spatial patterns among maps of all soil properties using all samples and all sample sizes were similar. In conditions when summer crops demand large amount of water and there is soil water deficit backscattering showed higher prediction accuracy for most soil properties. During the fallow season, the prediction accuracy decreased and the spatial prediction accuracy was closely dependent on the number of validation samples. The findings of this study corroborates that DSM techniques at field scale can be achieved by using C-band SAR data. Extrapolation y applicability of this study to other areas remain to be tested.

TI  - Improving the Applicability of the SWAT Model to Simulate Flow and Nitrate Dynamics in a Flat Data-Scarce Agricultural Region in the Mediterranean
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the soil and hydrologic processes in agricultural watersheds are vital for reliable assessments of water quantity and quality to support integrated river basin management. However, deriving hydrology-relevant information is complicated in flat data-scarce agricultural watersheds due to constraints in watershed delineation, flat topography, poor natural drainage, and irregular irrigation schedules by human intervention. The study aimed to improve the applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate daily flow and NO3 concentrations in a flat data-scarce agricultural watershed in the Lower Seyhan Plain (LSP) in Turkey. Refined digitized stream networks, discharge data derived from fully equipped gauging stations, and satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM+, Aster GDEM, etc.) had to be integrated into the modeling process to improve the simulation quality. The model was calibrated using a 2-year (2011-2012) dataset of streamflow and NO3 using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) approach and validated from 2013 to 2018. Daily water yields were predicted with a reasonable simulation accuracy (E values ranging from 0.53 to 0.82 and percent bias (PBIAS) from 0 to +4.1). The results proved that integrating redefined stream networks to SWAT within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment increases the simulation capability of flow and nitrate dynamics efficiently. Automated delineation of these networks and sub-basins at low topographic transitions limits the SWAT accuracy.

TI  - Causes and consequences of seasonal changes in the water flow of the Sao Francisco river in the semiarid of Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the causes and consequences of changes in the water flow of the Sao Francisco River, on the border between the states of Sergipe and Alagoas, a Brazilian semiarid region. For this, we used images from the Landsat-8 satellite, OLI sensor, with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The results found in this study reveal two distinct behaviors in the study region of the Low Sao Francisco watershed, the first encompassing more homogeneous areas and with greater environmental preservation located in the West and the second encompassing heterogeneous areas with severe environmental degradation in the east of the study region. In general, due to the occurrence of exposed soil, thin vegetation, and regions of the high declivity, the basin has a high and very high degree of vulnerability in 73.8% of its land, with serious risks of desertification. According to the results of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), there was a drastic reduction in the surface area of water bodies along the Sao Francisco River channel, evidenced in the period from 2013 to 2018, with the expansion of sandbank areas in 17.7 km(2). Agricultural and livestock activity was configured as an important factor in increasing land vulnerability. The evidence in this study suggests that changes in land use and coverage induce increases in the sandbank areas within the river channel, even in periods of greater water volume, which causes the silting up of the Sao Francisco river bed in its low course.

TI  - A model of matter, mind, and consciousness
T2  - PHYSICS ESSAYS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article shows how string theory is able to model nonphysical particles and how three-dimensional string theory "branes" (parallel universes) could hold dark matter and dark energy. Introspective experience from scientifically oriented groups gives us some clues of how the mind and consciousness could be described. The resulting synthesis from science and direct introspection, for understanding mind and consciousness, are presented. It shows a cosmos with: (1) A parallel nonphysical universe containing dreams, thoughts, emotions, and memories. This universe, called the psychological universe, is probably based on dark matter; (2) A parallel nonphysical universe where intuitive nonphenomenal thinking takes place and where personality and worldview are stored. This universe is called the intuitive universe and is probably based on dark energy and seems to have quantum mechanical qualities. These two universes together make up the mind such as it is defined in this article; and (3) A third nonphysical universe filled with negative energy could make up consciousness. All four universes (including the physical universe) have different vacua, dimensions, and energy levels, so they are all around us but separated. I propose that biological beings consist of a physical body in the physical universe plus entangled bodies in the three nonphysical universes. Entanglement is established by signals going both ways between the different bodies. String theory shows how the interaction between branes/universes can take place. Such a worldview seems to match the requirements from string theory so that it becomes a theory that includes the physical universe and the mind (all kinds of positive energy), and the connection to consciousness. Consciousness itself is based on negative energy, according to mathematician Luigi Fantappie. The physical base for negative energy is still an open question. (C) 2020 Physics Essays Publication.

TI  - Surface Subsidence in Urbanized Coastal Areas: PSI Methods Based on Sentinel-1 for Ho Chi Minh City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, though at present flooding is merely a recurring nuisance, there is increasing concern that a combination of impending climate change and rapid urbanization will significantly exacerbate the situation. Given the significant measures taken in HCMC to reduce groundwater extraction and sea-level rise (SLR) inundation since the most recent subsidence studies, we aim to update and contribute to the subsidence information of HCMC with continuous temporal coverage from 2017 to 2019. In this study, we use Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) with Copernicus Sentinel-1 data and open source tools to determine current subsidence rates within the urban center of HCMC. Additionally, the scalability of this method and use of freely accessible data allows for continuous updating and monitoring of this high-vulnerability region. The observed average subsidence rates were 3.3 mm per year with a maximum local subsidence of 5.3 cm per year. These results largely align with findings of previous studies and reflect similar spatial distributed subsidence patterns. Inundation risk awareness is enhanced by not only continued improved subsidence analysis, but also incorporating latest advancements in Digital Elevation Model (DEM) accuracy. This study compares local differences between traditionally used AW3D30 DEM with the CoastalDEM. Our findings indicate that although we identify lower than previously accepted elevations in the urban core, that stabilization of subsidence is observed in this same region.

TI  - Exploring the Spatio-temporal pattern of regional heat island (RHI) in an urban agglomeration of secondary cities in Eastern India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - UHI is a global phenomenon that causes the variation in local environment. It often creates regional urban heat island (RHI). This study attempted to study these changes at regional level of English Bazar UA and its surroundings. Satellite images from 1990 to 2015 were used in this study. Four class of RHI were identified. Contribution of land use on RHI was quantified by Land contribution Index. To study the spatio-temporal patterns of RHI, nearest-neighbor ratio (NNR), Moran's Index, landscape matrices were computed. The study found (1) RHI is found in the main urban centre and also in its surroundings which forms agglomeration of RHI. (2) The result of NNR shows the value of NNR is increasing with the increase of RHI classes. The value for RHI class 2 RLST <= 4 is stable over time which is categorized as high-risk areas. (3) Landscape indices also indicate that RHI class with RLST >= 2 has the highest impact in the area. It occupies the largest patch index and largest patch size. Finally, this study suggests that areas with RLST 2 degrees C may be ideal for defining RHI in other agglomerations too. This study can also help the urban planner and provide significant thoughts into urban thermal environment study.

AB  - Vegetation cover plays a key role in reducing wind erosion and improving air quality in different parts of the world. However, little is known about the long-term period seasonal changes in vegetation anomalies and their effects on wind erosion in Iran. Therefore, in the current research, the seasonal changes in vegetation cover and the level of wind erosion activity across the country from 2000 to 2018 have been identified in detail using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index anomaly (NDVIA) and the dust concentration anomaly (DCA), respectively. Furthermore, the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were used to evaluate the variable trend changes. The bivariate correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between NDVIA and DCA in the spring, summer, autumn, winter, and growing season. The agricultural drought was further monitored for the season when the strongest correlation between vegetation changes and the activity of wind erosion events was observed. The NDVIA and DCA maps were spatially analyzed to identify areas affected by drought and wind erosion, respectively. Results indicated that across the whole country, the NDVIA increased significantly in the autumn and growing season (Z -0.25; P 0 have had a significant impact on dust produced by wind erosion in areas with DCA 0 (R =-0.5; P = 0.03). Spatially, these areas were mainly observed in the eastern half of Iran, areas that were most affected by the drought over the monitoring years. This work encourages us to use the NDVIA and DCA to evaluate the linkage between seasonal vegetation variations and wind erosion activity in arid and semi-arid regions. This study could also be useful for recognizing areas at risk of drought and wind erosion as well as for mitigating their adverse effects.

TI  - CNN-Based Tree Species Classification Using High Resolution RGB Image Data from Automated UAV Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the distribution of tree species are often requested by forest managers, inventory agencies, foresters as well as private and municipal forest owners. However, the automated detection of tree species based on passive remote sensing data from aerial surveys is still not sufficiently developed to achieve reliable results independent of the phenological stage, time of day, season, tree vitality and prevailing atmospheric conditions. Here, we introduce a novel tree species classification approach based on high resolution RGB image data gathered during automated UAV flights that overcomes these insufficiencies. For the classification task, a computationally lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. We show that with the chosen CNN model architecture, average classification accuracies of 92% can be reached independently of the illumination conditions and the phenological stages of four different tree species. We also show that a minimal ground sampling density of 1.6 cm/px is needed for the classification model to be able to make use of the spatial-structural information in the data. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach to derive spatially explicit tree species information, a gridded product is generated that yields an average classification accuracy of 88%.

TI  - Mast Cells as Regulators of Adaptive Immune Responses in Food Allergy
T2  - YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Mast cells are a critical first line of defense against endogenous and environmental threats. Their participation in innate immunity is well characterized; activation of toll like receptors as well as receptors for complement, adenosine, and a host of other ligands leads to mast cell release of preformed mediators contained within granules along with newly synthesized arachidonic acid metabolites, cytokines, and chemokines. These confer protective effects including the induction of mucus secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and activation of common itch and pain sensations, all of which act to promote expulsion of noxious agents. While their innate immune role as sentinel cells is well established, recent research has brought into focus their separate but also critical function in adaptive immunity particularly in the setting of IgE mediated food allergies. Crosslinking of FceR1, the high affinity receptor for IgE, when bound to IgE and antigen, triggers the release of the same factors and elicits the same physiologic responses that occur after activation by innate stimuli. Though IgE-activated mast cells are best known for their role in acute allergic reactions, including the most severe manifestation, anaphylaxis, accumulating evidence has suggested an immunoregulatory effect in T cell-mediated immunity, modulating the balance between type 2 immunity and tolerance. In this review, we outline how mast cells act as adjuvants for food antigen driven Th2 cell responses, while curtailing Treg function.

TI  - Nocturnal Surface Urban Heat Island over Greater Cairo: Spatial Morphology, Temporal Trends and Links to Land-Atmosphere Influences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the spatial and temporal characteristics of nighttime surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects over Greater Cairo: the largest metropolitan area in Africa. This study employed nighttime land surface temperature (LST) data at 1 km resolution from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua sensor for the period 2003-2019. We presented a new spatial anomaly algorithm, which allowed to define SUHI using the most anomalous hotspot and cold spot of LST for each time step over Greater Cairo between 2003 and 2019. Results demonstrate that although there is a significant increase in the spatial extent of SUHI over the past two decades, a significant decrease in the mean and maximum intensities of SUHI was noted. Moreover, we examined the dependency between SUHI characteristics and related factors that influence energy and heat fluxes between atmosphere and land in urban environments (e.g., surface albedo, vegetation cover, climate variability, and land cover/use changes). Results demonstrate that the decrease in the intensity of SUHI was mainly guided by a stronger warming in daytime and nighttime LST in the neighborhood of urban localities. This warming was accompanied by a decrease in surface albedo and diurnal temperature range (DTR) over these areas. Results of this study can provide guidance to local urban planners and decision-makers to adopt more effective mitigation strategies to diminish the negative impacts of urban warming on natural and human environments.

TI  - Spectral characterization of the Batuga granite pluton, South Eastern Desert, Egypt: influence of lithological and mineralogical variation on ASD Terraspec data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper concerns with potential utilization of Landsat-8 data combined with TerraSpec spectro-radiometer and field studies for mapping and discriminating the different granitic varieties of Batuga pluton in the South Eastern Desert of Egypt. Integrated data of band combination, principal component analysis (PCA), band rationing, fusion technique, and TerraSpec measurements substantially improve visual interpretation to differentiate between granite varieties as well as basalt dikes traversing the pluton. Compilation of field, petrographic, and spectral data enables to distinguish three varieties of granite, namely alkali feldspar granite, garnet-bearing leucogranite, and two-mica granite (monzogranite). False color composite (FCC) image PC1, PC3, and PC4 in R, G, and B, respectively, is successful to discriminate the western part of Batuga pluton as mica granite (monzogranite) but it failed to discriminate the other two granite types. On the other hand, the band ratio combination 6/7, 5/6, and 2/4 successfully used to discriminate the three varieties of granite. Also, the image fusion technique of false color composite (7, 5, & 2) and band ratio (6/7, 5/6, & 2/4) combinations with the high spatial resolution band 2 of Sentinel-2 is applied using the Gram-Schmidt method. Regarding with TerraSpec measurements, the alkali feldspar granite displays two absorption features around 1.4 and 2.25 mu m. Moreover, the garnet-bearing leucogranite shows four little absorption features at 1.4, 2.21, 2.25, and 2.33 mu m, while the mica granite shows low reflectance values throughout the VNIR and SWIR regions compared to the other two varieties, and low four absorption features at 1.4, 2.21, 2.25, and 2.33 mu m wavelengths. The basalt dikes show a low, nearly flat spectral profile in the VNIR and SWIR wavelength regions and small four absorption features also observed around the 0.65, 1.0, 1.2, and 2.32 mu m wavelengths. Data materialized in the paper suggests the usefulness of Landsat-8 and TerraSpec spectroradiometer data as a powerful combination to discriminate the granitic rocks and the traversing basalt dikes as well.

TI  - Mapping the chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations in hypereutrophic Krishnagiri Reservoir (India) using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager
T2  - Lakes & Reservoirs Research and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Krishnagiri Reservoir exhibits a hypereutrophic status and continuously receives external sediment and nutrient loads, in addition to its internal phosphorus loading, both affecting the reservoir water quality. Increased nutrient loading attributable to changing anthropogenic activities in the catchment area will further exacerbate the deteriorating trophic status. Temporal Satellite imageries can play a crucial role in the rapid assessment of the trophic status of the reservoir over a large spatial extent. The eutrophication status of freshwater systems is directly related to the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, which represents a major trophic state indicator by reflecting green and absorbing violet-blue and orange-red light of the solar energy spectrum. The present study was undertaken to map seasonal Chl-a concentration variations using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Multiple regression equations developed using reflectance in the Green, Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared 1 and 2 and Coastal bands (R-2 = .635) were found to be the best fit of the model in mapping the Chl-a concentration variations in Krishnagiri Reservoir. The derived regression model also can be used to determine the trophic state of the reservoir and can facilitate a more rapid assessment for developing management strategies for sustainable reservoir water quality management.

TI  - COVID-19: Impact analysis and recommendations for power sector operation
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand of electricity has been reduced significantly due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Governments around the world were compelled to reduce the business activity in response to minimize the threat of coronavirus. This ongoing situation due to COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle globally as people are mostly staying home and working from home if possible. Hence, there is a significant increase in residential load demand while there is a substantial decrease in commercial and industrial loads. This devastating situation creates new challenges in the technical and financial activities of the power sector and hence most of the utilities around the world initiated a disaster management plan to tackle this ongoing challenges/threats. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the global scenarios of power systems during COVID-19 along with the socio-economic and technical issues faced by the utilities. Then, this study further scrutinized the Indian power system as a case study and explored scenarios, issues and challenges currently being faced to manage the consumer load demand, including the actions taken by the utilities/power sector for the smooth operation of the power system. Finally, a set of recommendations are presented to support the government/ policymakers/utilities around the world not only to overcome the current crisis but also to overcome future unfore-seeable pandemic alike scenario.

TI  - Estimation of maize properties and differentiating moisture and nitrogen deficiency stress via ground - Based remotely sensed data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Moisture and nitrogen deficiency are major determinant factors for cereal production in arid and semi arid environments. The ability to detect stress in crops at an early stage is crucially important if significant reductions in yield are to be averted. In this context, remotely sensed data has the possibility of providing a rapid and accurate tool for site specific management in cereal crop production. This research examined the potential of hyperspectral and broad band remote sensing for predicting maize properties under nitrogen and moisture induced stress. Spectra were collected from drip irrigated maize subjected to various rates of irrigation regimes and nitrogen fertilization. 60 spectral vegetation indices were derived and examined to predict maize yield and other properties. Highly significant correlations between maize crop properties and various vegetation indices were noticed. RVI and NDVI were found to be sensitive to maize grain yield in both tested seasons. C-red (edge) demonstrated the strongest significant correlations with maize yield. The correlations with grain yield were found to be strongest at the flowering stage. Penalized linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) showed the possibility to distinguish moisture and nitrogen deficiency stress spectrally. The implications of this work for the use of satellite based remote sensing in arid zone precision agriculture are discussed.

TI  - Preventing Retained Surgical Items During Endovascular Procedures: Bridging the Gap Between Guidelines and Practice
T2  - AORN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A retained surgical item (RSI) can be a devastating and costly procedural complication. Although the current incidence of RSIs is unknown, perioperative personnel routinely perform surgical counts according to their facility's policies and procedures to prevent this sentinel event. The American College of Surgeons, The Joint Commission, and AORN emphasize the importance of communication and standardized protocols for the counting of surgical items. However, there is a lack of current evidence to support specific recommendations for the counting of items during endovascular procedures. After the occurrence of RSIs during endovascular procedures at our facility, we convened an interdisciplinary workgroup, conducted an analysis of root causes, reviewed the available literature, and revised the existing policy. This article reviews the available literature on RSIs, describes root causes, discusses recommendations from national organizations, and describes the process that we used to create the policy changes at our facility.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Global Surface Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics Using the SMAP Level 4 Carbon Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important metric of soil health and the terrestrial carbon balance. Short-term climate variations affect SOC through changes in temperature and moisture, which control vegetation growth and soil decomposition. We evaluated a satellite data-driven carbon model, operating under the NASA Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, as a means of monitoring global surface SOC dynamics. The SMAP Level 4 Carbon (L4C) product estimates a daily global carbon budget including surface (0- to 5-cm depth) SOC. We found that the L4C mean latitudinal SOC distribution is generally consistent with alternative assessments from static soil inventory records and dynamic global vegetation models (r >= 0.89). Within forest systems, based on inventory data, L4C SOC is most similar in magnitude to litterfall but is correlated with coarse woody debris ( r=0.86) and total SOC ( r=0.81). L4C SOC is sensitive to seasonal and annual climate variability, with mean residence times that range from 1.5 years in the wet tropics to 17 years in the cold tundra. Incorporating soil moisture retrievals from the SMAP L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiometer within the L4C algorithm provides enhanced soil moisture sensitivity under low-to-moderate vegetation cover ((-2) vegetation water content). The L-band soil moisture had the greatest impact on the L4C carbon budget in semiarid regions, which span almost 60% of the globe and account for substantial variability in the terrestrial carbon sink. The L4C operational product enables prognostic investigations into effects of recent climate trends and anomalies (e.g., droughts and pluvials) on shallow soil carbon dynamics.

AB  - This paper examines applications of artificial intelligence in socio-humanitarian studies conceptually. The world trend of the last decades is focused on the involvement of social media data for research interests, which allows one to solve tasks of monitoring, analysis, forecasting, and management in relation to parameters of network communication such as opinions, attitudes, emotions, and behavior patterns of communicants. In order to develop tools for network content analysis, we propose to utilize the method for relational-situational analysis that is based on the syntactic analysis approach by G.A. Zolotova and the concept of heterogeneous semantic networks proposed by G.S. Osipov. The proposed approach makes it possible to consider texts as the product of the author's speech-thinking activities, which allows applying the Russian psychological research background to study cognitive processes, personality, motivation, emotional states, and individual differences, as well as a basic mental entity, that is, a general worldview.

TI  - Estimation of Solar Resource Based on Meteorological and Geographical Data: Sonora State in Northwestern Territory of Mexico as Case Study
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A model developed at the University of Tomsk, Russia, for high latitudes (over 55 degrees N) is proposed and applied to the analysis and observation of the solar resource in the state of Sonora in the northwest of Mexico. This model utilizes satellite data and geographical coordinates as inputs. The objective of this research work is to provide a low-cost and reliable alternative to field meteorological stations and also to obtain a wide illustration of the distribution of solar power in the state to visualize opportunities for sustainable energy production and reduce its carbon footprint. The model is compared against real-time data from meteorological stations and satellite data, using statistical methods to scrutinize its accuracy at local latitudes (26-32 degrees N), where a satisfactory performance was observed. An annual geographical view of available solar radiation against maximum and minimum temperatures for all the state municipalities is provided to identify the photovoltaic electricity generation potential. The outcomes are proof that the model is economically viable and could be employed by local governments to plan solar harvesting strategies. The results are generated from an open source model that allows calculating the available solar radiation over specific land areas, and the application potential for future planning of solar energy projects is evident.

TI  - Flood mapping using hydraulic modeling and Sentinel-1 image: Case study of Medjerda Basin, northern Tunisia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In northwestern Tunisia, floods are the most widespread natural hazard. Indeed, this problem is posed seriously in the Medjerda basin. In fact, the plain of Jendouba - Bou Salem is the most affected area by this plague. It has the form of a shallows that collects runoff water and promotes flood extent and duration. So the main objective of this study is to determine the extent of the hydraulic hazard through the flood mapping of February 2015 event which has seriously affected the urban and peri-urban landscape of the plain. The hydraulic hazard extent mapping was determined through the HEC-RAS model. It's one of the most popular free hydraulic models developed by the Hydrological Engineers Center of the U.S. Army Corps. The new version (HEC-RAS v-5) is a two dimensional (2D) model based on the resolution of hydraulic Saint Venant which can simulate floodplain inundation, determine the water surface elevation and velocity distribution of floods. It allows modeling flow with permanent and non-permanent free surface by evaluating water flows and heights over the all sections of a river so it allows to integrate hydraulic works (bridge, dam ...). The result showed that this flood reached heights of more than six (6) meters in flooded areas.The result from the HEC-RAS model was validated using the Sentinel-1 radar image acquired on February 28th, 2015.The study shows the applicability and the capabilities of the 2D HEC-RAS version for flood studies.& COPY; 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Predictive modeling of desertification in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State, Nigeria
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines desertification in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State, Nigeria. Landsat TM 1990, Landsat ETM plus 2000 and Landsat 8 of 2015 with spatial resolutions of 15 and 30 m were used to compute quantitative area coverage via a supervised classification scheme in ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2. An accuracy assessment was undertaken to ascertain the accuracy level of the classification in which none of the images had an accuracy level of below 90% and a kappa coefficient of below 0.87. Cellular automata markov chain analysis model within IDRISI Kilimanjaro software was used to predict changes in desertification process up to year 2030. Results on classified satellite imageries showed a considerable decrease in vegetation and an increase in desertification. Between the years 1990 and 2000 (10 years) about 17.8% of the total study area was affected by desertification, that means approximately 1.8% of the area was affected yearly. However, between 2000 and 2015 the rate increased where more than 100% of the total land area was affected at the rate of 8.0% annually. Between 1990 and 2015, total land area affected by desertification amounted to 277.4 sqkm. Results on prediction indicated desertification increase from 450.84 sqkm in 2015 to 485.25 sqkm of the total land area to be engulfed by desertification by the year 2030.& COPY; 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - The COVID-19 Outbreak May Be Associated to a Reduced Level of Care for Breast Cancer. A Comparative Study with the Pre-COVID Era in an Italian Breast Unit
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound changes to healthcare systems as well as had deleterious repercussions on the care of cancer patients. In this comparative study, we sought to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical management of breast cancer in a breast unit in an Italian region with a low incidence of COVID-19 infection. Eighty-three patients were included, of whom 41 received surgery during the height of the pandemic (Group A, operated on between March and April 2020), and 42 during the same period of the year in 2019 (Group B). Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups with regard to age (p = 0.62), tumour size (p = 0.25), grade (p = 0.27), histology (p = 0.43), positive lymph node status (p = 0.35), and ER positive status (0.35). Waiting time for surgery was slightly longer in Group A (49.11 vs. 46.39 days, p = 0.38). Patients receiving immediate breast reconstruction were significantly less in Group A (p < 0.001). The use of sentinel node biopsy was similar in the two groups (p = 0.84). Hospital stay was longer in patients of Group B (p = 0.008). The use of regional nerve blocks was lower in Group A (p < 0.001). Patients operated on during the height of the pandemic were less likely to receive immediate reconstruction and regional nerve blocks during surgery. These features configure a situation of reduced level of care for patients with breast cancer. Efforts should be taken by the healthcare systems to maintain standard of care, even in case of a new peak in the coronavirus outbreak.

TI  - The 1999 super cyclone in Odisha, India: A systematic review of documented losses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate-related hazards accounted for over 90% of disasters over the past two decades and cause massive losses every year worldwide. In the face of the climate crisis, we are confronted with unprecedented challenges that require transformational change. The Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction set ambitious global goals and targets. Monitoring and reporting are fundamental towards their achievement. We are, thus, faced with an urgency to step up accountability efforts. India is one of the top ten countries by cumulative disaster losses, with the most intense recorded event being the 1999 Odisha super cyclone. Twenty years later, there is still no comprehensive documentation of the losses caused by the cyclone at the micro-level, nor an understanding of long-term post-disaster recovery patterns. To fill this gap, a systematic review has been conducted to gather evidence of recorded losses by type and their spatial distribution. Results show that satellite remote sensing has contributed to a finer and more localised estimation of losses compared to official records from 1999; that coastal and riverine districts are proven to be the worst impacted; and that we now have an understanding, albeit partial, of the non-physical impacts associated with the 1999 cyclone. This review provides the most comprehensive catalogue of documented losses induced by the 1999 super cyclone and is the best estimate of a baseline of impacts which can serve to investigate long-term recovery trends.

TI  - Comparison among the natural radioactivity levels, the radiogenic heat production, and the land surface temperature in arid environments: A case study of the El Gilf El Kiber area, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The El Gilf El Kiber area is one of the most promising areas for urban growth and reclamation projects in the southwest of Egypt. In the study area, the lithological units vary in age from Precambrian (mainly granite) to Quaternary (mainly sand sediments). The analysis of airborne magnetic and gamma-my spectrometry data was incorporated into that of the remote sensing data (Landsat-8). The integrated analysis was used to detect the Ethological distributions and to delineate the subsurface basement rocks that control the radioactivity in the study area. It was also used to determine the relationship between radiogenic heat production (RHP) and land surface temperature (LSI') that was retrieved from the Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. The output of the principal component analysis (PCA) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data is a false-color map (PC1, PC2, and PC3 as red, green, and blue, respectively) displaying the various lithological units in the study area. The LST map, calculated from Landsat-8 TIRS data, shows that the surface temperatures range from approximately 41 to 53 degrees C. The highest concentrations of eU, eTh, and K in the area were 25 ppm, 121 ppm, and 7.8%, respectively. The RHP values ranged from 1.1 mu W/m(3) to 15.1 mu W/m(3). These relatively high anomalies are associated with basement outcrops and the sedimentary rocks overlying shallow basement rocks. The total horizontal derivative (THD) of the magnetic data delineates the horizontal extension of the basement rocks. The Curie point depth (CPD), estimated from magnetic data, ranges from 35.5 km to 41.0 km. The results also exhibited geothermal gradients ranging from 16.10-degrees C/km to 14.14 degrees C/km, and heat flow ranges from 35.4 mW/m(2) to 40.8 mW/m(2). It was evident after comparing that the BHP and 1ST maps exhibited the same features as the gamma-ray spectrometric maps. Moreover, the areas around the basement rocks exhibited higher radioactivity, RHP, and temperature than the basement rocks themselves.

TI  - Modeling of CHAMP satellite data according to the 3D surface spline model of geomagnetic fields
T2  - APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface observations and CHAMP measurement data are employed to develop a three-dimensional surface spline (3DSS) model of mainland China. The magnetic field distribution at the satellite level is then demonstrated using the model obtained. The results of this model are compared and verified by deriving the corresponding two (2DTY) and three-dimensional (3DTY) Taylor polynomial models. Issues such as the removal of disruptive geomagnetic fields, the data gap between the surface and satellite levels, and boundary effects are carefully considered during modeling. We then focus on evaluating the modeling effect of the satellite data. Ten satellite points not involved in the modeling procedure are selected, and the residuals, absolute change rates, and RMSEs of these points are calculated. Results show that the distribution of the magnetic field determined by the 3DSS model is highly consistent with that obtained from the IGRF12 model. Expect for component Y, the absolute change rates of other components are less than 0.5%. Specifically, the RMSE of Y of 3DSS is nearly 60% lower than those of 3DTY and 2DTY; the RMSE of other components of the former are also over 90% lower than those of the latter. This finding implies that the 3DSS model has good performance for modeling satellite data and its results are reliable. Moreover, the modeling effect of 3DTY is better than that of 2DTY.

TI  - Elective Neck Dissection in T1N0M0 Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: When Is It Necessary?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Elective neck dissection (END) versus observation remains controversial for cT1N0M0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to determine whether neck dissection is indicated for cT1N0M0 OSCC versus observation when considering oral cavity subsites and depth of invasion (DOI) as predictors.Patients and Methods: A multicenter, ambispective cohort study of patients with cT1N0M0 OSCC treated at the University of Michigan and Beijing Stomatological Hospital from August 1998 to July 2017 with a follow-up end date of July 2019 was performed. Patients were excluded if follow-up was less than 2 years and no neck disease had occurred or if the final pathologic analysis resulted in upstaging to T2 using American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria, eighth edition. A total of 283 patients met the criteria. The main outcome parameter was the 2- year neck metastatic rate.Results: The total 2-year lymph node metastatic rate was 11.3%. Overall neck metastatic rates escalated consistently according to DOI: less than 2 mm, 2.1%; 2 to 3 mm, 9.4%; 3 to 4 mm, 15.2%; and 4 to 5 mm, 24.6%. On univariate Cox regression analysis, DOI greater than 3 mm, tumor grade, and perineural invasion were statistically significant indicators of 2-year neck metastasis. On multivariate analysis, only DOI and tumor grade remained. On multivariate analysis of 2-year survival, no factors were independent predictors. Our proposed treatment strategy for END based both on statistically significant results for DOI and on review of the rawdata using a 20% cutoff analysis showed cutoffs of 2mmfor the tongue (18.2%), 3mm for the floor of the mouth (40.0%) and upper gingiva (20%), and 4mmfor the lower gingiva (33.3%) and no cutoff for the hard palate (0.0%).Conclusions: The watch-and-wait approach remains a reasonable approach in selected patients with cT1N0M0 OSCC. Decision making for END in T1N0M0 patients should minimally consider tumor grade, DOI, and oral cavity subsite. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

TI  - Dynamics of mangrove forests in Shenzhen Bay in response to natural and anthropogenic factors from 1988 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in past decades owing to diverse environmental gradients and regional anthropogenic activities. Previous studies have mainly reported alarming mangrove loss. However, few studies have focused on the process of mangrove expansion, and its driving factors remain unclear. By integrating medium-resolution Landsat surface reflectance products and meteorological, hydrological and bathymetric data, the current study investigates the spatiotemporal changes of mangrove forests in Shenzhen Inner Bay (SZIB) of China over the past thirty years, and the relationship between mangrove changes and natural and anthropogenic factors was also identified. The results reveal that the area of mangrove forests in the SZIB increased at a rapid rate of 8.9 ha/yr despite sea level rise, reaching 527.1 ha in 2017. No statistically significant correlation between mangrove area and winter temperature and precipitation was found, whereas a significant positive correlation occurred between mangrove area and sea level rise, in contrast to the common consensus. Human activities affected the SZIB mangroves in two distinct ways. On the one hand, the area of mangrove deforestation occurred on 23.5 ha and 6.8 ha in the Futian and Mai Po reserves, respectively, with reforestation campaigns only compensating for 5.6 ha of the mangrove area lost in the Futian reserve. On the other hand, the reduced tidal prism due to the implementation of the Shenzhen Bay Land Reclamation Project (SZBLRP) resulted in significant deposition in the SZIB, which counterbalanced the negative effect of sea level rise, contributing to 209.9 ha of mangrove expansion by providing suitable accommodation space and accounting for 78.4% of the total mangrove gain. Moreover, the morphological adjustments in the SZIB caused by the Shenzhen River Regulation Project (SZRRP) also had a significant influence on the mangrove extent and distribution, with the mangrove expansion area of 22.7 ha being contributed by the SZRRP, accounting for 8.5% of the total mangrove expansion. The findings of the current study indicate that with the increased sediment supply and accretion rate induced by anthropogenic activities, mangrove forests with limited land retreat space can still expand in the face of sea level rise.

TI  - Assessment of land use and land cover changes and valuation of carbon stocks in the Sergipe semiarid region, Brazil: 1992-2030
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The semiarid region in the state of Sergipe, Brazil, approximately 11,000 km(2), has experienced high deforestation rates in the last decades, which ultimately contribute to global climatic changes. The valuation of ecosystem services of CO2 sequestration can support definition of environmental policies to decrease deforestation in that region. This study aimed to assess land use and land cover changes in the Sergipe semiarid region between 1992 and 2017 by applying remotely sensed data and technics; simulate the land use and land cover changes between 2017 and 2030 by applying a cellular automaton model, by assuming current land use trends (Business as Usual - BAU) as a reference scenario, and a more conservative scenario (Protected Forest - PF), in which was assumed an effective enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code established in 2012; simulate the carbon stocks by 2017 assuming the BAU and PF scenarios by 2030, and estimate the Carbon balance between the 2030 and 2017 scenarios; and estimate the economic valuation of carbon emission and sequestration by using the InVEST software. The results showed that agriculture (cropped lands) was main driver of the landscape changes in the study area, which increased 14% by 2017, a net increase of 1494.45 km(2). The results showed that the total Carbon emissions would reach 736,900 Mg CO2-eq by assuming the BAU scenario, which would increase the cost of opportunity up to US$ 17.7 million and a social carbon cost varying between US$ 10.3 and US$ 30.2 million. The restoration of the permanent preservation areas could contribute to increase Carbon sequestration up to 481,900 Mg CO2-eq by 2030, which is equivalent cost of US$ 11.6 million. The natural landscape in the Sergipe semiarid region was strongly affected by deforestation activities occurred between 1992 and 2017. It requires, therefore, effective actions to support and promote restoration of degraded areas. The forested areas within the Sergipe semiarid region were the most affected type of vegetation because of expansion of agricultural fields soil exposures (Exposed Land). Environmental assessments based on scenarios and economic valuations can provide crucial information to support policy and decision makers to improve strategies for environmental management and conservation.

TI  - Surface Motion Prediction and Mapping for Road Infrastructures Management by PS-InSAR Measurements and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a methodology for predicting and mapping surface motion beneath road pavement structures caused by environmental factors. Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) measurements, geospatial analyses, and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) are employed for achieving the purpose. Two single learners, i.e., Regression Tree (RT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and two ensemble learners, i.e., Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Random Forest (RF) are utilized for estimating the surface motion ratio in terms of mm/year over the Province of Pistoia (Tuscany Region, central Italy, 964 km(2)), in which strong subsidence phenomena have occurred. The interferometric process of 210 Sentinel-1 images from 2014 to 2019 allows exploiting the average displacements of 52,257 Persistent Scatterers as output targets to predict. A set of 29 environmental-related factors are preprocessed by SAGA-GIS, version 2.3.2, and ESRI ArcGIS, version 10.5, and employed as input features. Once the dataset has been prepared, three wrapper feature selection approaches (backward, forward, and bi-directional) are used for recognizing the set of most relevant features to be used in the modeling. A random splitting of the dataset in 70% and 30% is implemented to identify the training and test set. Through a Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) and a 10-Fold Cross-Validation (CV), the algorithms are trained and validated. Therefore, the Predictive Performance of MLAs is evaluated and compared by plotting the Taylor Diagram. Outcomes show that SVM and BRT are the most suitable algorithms; in the test phase, BRT has the highest Correlation Coefficient (0.96) and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (0.44 mm/year), while the SVM has the lowest difference between the standard deviation of its predictions (2.05 mm/year) and that of the reference samples (2.09 mm/year). Finally, algorithms are used for mapping surface motion over the study area. We propose three case studies on critical stretches of two-lane rural roads for evaluating the reliability of the procedure. Road authorities could consider the proposed methodology for their monitoring, management, and planning activities.

TI  - Association between red tide exposure and detection of corresponding neurotoxins in bottlenose dolphins from Texas waters during 2007-2017
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms produced by the phytoplankton species Karenia brevis and its associated neurotoxin, brevetoxin (PbTx), occur throughout the Gulf of Mexico and have had devastating impacts on co-occurring populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), an important marine sentinel species. The majority of documented impacts, however, are from the eastern Gulf of Mexico, with a critical lack of information on the degree and frequency of PbTx exposure in bottlenose dolphins from Texas coastal waters. This study documents PbTx exposure in Texas bottlenose dolphins between 2007 and 2017 and their association with co-occurring K. brevis blooms. PbTx was detected in 60% (n = 112) of the animals tested. Liver tissue samples had the highest frequency of detection (62%), followed by feces (41.4%) and gastric contents (30.4%). PbTx was not detected in urine or intestinal tissue. The concentration ranges of PbTx detected in feces (1.2-216, mean 38.4 ng/g), gastric contents (3.3-1016, mean 158 ng/g) and liver (0.6-52.4, mean 8.5 ng/g) samples were an order of magnitude less than values reported for Florida dolphins for the same sample types. The proportion of dolphins recovered within 4 weeks of a bloom that tested positive for PbTx ('Bloom' group; 75%) was significantly higher compared to those that were recovered 5-8 weeks after termination of a bloom ('Post-Bloom' group; 36%; p = 0.004). The proportion of PbTx-positive animals with no observed bloom association ('Baseline' group; 60%) was also significantly greater than the Post-Bloom group (p = 0.012). No significant difference in proportion of PbTx-positive animals was detected between Bloom and Baseline groups (p = 0.242). No significant differences in liver PbTx concentrations were observed between any pairwise combinations of the 3 exposure groups (p = 0.261). Overall, these findings suggest persistent PbTx exposure for many individuals in these populations, although the health impacts of such exposure are not known.

TI  - Top-Down Estimation of Particulate Matter Emissions from Extreme Tropical Peatland Fires Using Geostationary Satellite Fire Radiative Power Observations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme fires in the peatlands of South East (SE) Asia are arguably the world's greatest biomass burning events, resulting in some of the worst ambient air pollution ever recorded (PM10 > 3000 mu g.m(-3)). The worst of these fires coincide with El Nino related droughts, and include huge areas of smouldering combustion that can persist for months. However, areas of flaming surface vegetation combustion atop peat are also seen, and we show that the largest of these latter fires appear to be the most radiant and intensely smoke-emitting areas of combustion present in such extreme fire episodes. Fire emissions inventories and early warning of the air quality impacts of landscape fire are increasingly based on the fire radiative power (FRP) approach to fire emissions estimation, including for these SE Asia peatland fires. "Top-down" methods estimate total particulate matter emissions directly from FRP observations using so-called "smoke emission coefficients" [C-e; g.MJ(-1)], but currently no discrimination is made between fire types during such calculations. We show that for a subset of some of the most thermally radiant peatland fires seen during the 2015 El Nino, the most appropriate C-e is around a factor of three lower than currently assumed (similar to 16.8 +/- 1.6 g.MJ(-1) vs. 52.4 g.MJ(-1)). Analysis indicates that this difference stems from these highly radiant fires containing areas of substantial flaming combustion, which changes the amount of particulate matter emitted per unit of observable fire radiative heat release in comparison to more smouldering dominated events. We also show that even a single one of these most radiant fires is responsible for almost 10% of the overall particulate matter released during the 2015 fire event, highlighting the importance of this fire type to overall emission totals. Discriminating these different fires types in ways demonstrated herein should thus ultimately improve the accuracy of SE Asian fire emissions estimates derived using the FRP approach, and the air quality modelling which they support.

TI  - Wing size and parity as markers of cohort demography for potential <i>Anopheles</i> (Culicidae: Diptera) malaria vectors in the Republic of Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wing lengths of parous (P) and nulliparous (NP) PCR-identified female Anopheles belenrae, An. kleini, An. pullus, and An. sinensis were determined from weekly trap collections at Camp Humphreys (CH), Ganghwa Island (GH), and Warrior Base (WB), Republic of Korea (ROK) during Jun-Oct, 2009. Wing length was greatest at the beginning and end of the study period. Wing length of NPs tended to be less than that of Ps before the period of maximum greening (Jul-Aug) but greater thereafter. Larger specimens tended to be Ps, and weekly wing length of Ps appeared less variable than NPs, possibly due to selection. A bimodal wing length frequency distribution of An. sinensis suggested two forms comprising small- (<= 4.5 mm, SW) and large-winged females (>4.5 mm, LW). LW comprised the majority of peaks in abundance, however %SW, while still a minority, often increased during these times suggesting a density-dependent effect. At WB and GH, a two to three-week periodicity in %SW was obvious for An. sinensis and An. kleini. Analyses of weather station and satellite data showed that smaller-winged An. sinensis were associated with warmer, more humid, and greener times of the year. SW and LW specimens possibly result from agricultural practices that are common across large areas; regular synchronous peaks of SW and LW were observed from different sites. Peaks in SW Ps followed peaks in NPs in a 'ripple effect' one to two weeks apart, suggesting that wing length combined with parity could be used to follow the emergence and survival of mosquito cohorts.

TI  - Prevalence and management of sleep disorders in the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among Veterans treated at Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities increased significantly during fiscal years (FY) 2012 through 2018. Specifically, the prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) increased from 5.5% in FY2012 to 22.2% in FY2018, and the prevalence of insomnia diagnoses increased from 7.4% in FY2012 to 11.8% in FY2018. Consequently, Veterans' demand for sleep medicine services also increased significantly between FY2012-2018, with steady increases in the annual number of VA sleep clinic appointments during this period (<250,000 in FY 2012; >720,000 in FY2018). Common co-morbid conditions among Veterans diagnosed with sleep disorders include obesity, diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). To address this healthcare crisis, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) developed and/or implemented numerous innovations to improve the quality and accessibility of sleep care services for Veterans. These innovations include a TeleSleep Enterprise-Wide Initiative to improve rural Veterans' access to sleep care; telehealth applications such as the Remote Veteran Apnea Management Platform (REVAMP), Clinical Video Telehealth, and CBT-i Coach; increased use of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT); and programs for Veterans who experience sleep disorders associated with obesity, PTSD, TBI and other conditions.

TI  - Structural connectivity between the Paramos of Guacheneque and Los Cristales, Rabanal-Rio Bogota complex, Colombia
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural connectivity is a measure of the spatio-temporal changes that affect the movement of species between elements of the landscape and availability of habitat; these modifications that have been documented for high mountain ecosystems in Colombia (paramo and high Andean forest) and are caused by agricultural and other economic activities that affect their integrity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of the changes between plant cover (1987-2018) in the Guacheneque and Los Cristales paramos (Boyaca-Cundinamarca, Colombia). Images from Landsat 4 and 8 sensors were used. Pre and post-processing (supervised classification and field verification) were performed with ArcGIS and ERDAS. To estimate structural connectivity, metrics of landscape diversity, composition and configuration were calculated (Fragstats v4.2.1). Thematic reliability was 88%. Mosaic covering of pastures and crops (Mpc - 288 ha), dense grassland of firm ground (HdTf- 24 ha) and high open forest (Baa-165 ha), increased in 31 years, while dense bush (Ad) decreased 477 ha. The distance between tiles of Mpc and Ad increased (from 150.74 m to 170.70 m and from 196.96 m to 236.64 m respectively), and decreased for Baa (from 166.74 m to 159.27 m). Connectivity increased for Mpc and Baa, and decreased for Ad. The evaluated paramos make up a landscape with frequent and intensive land use, the effect of a long history of occupation of this territory. The dynamics of structural connectivity registered an increase in agricultural activities (paramo-grasslands transition). These have caused tensions and contradictions in the delimitation of paramos, a local loss of the natural area, a decrease in the average size of the tiles, and an increase in the perimeter /surface ratio distance between nuclei. The results corroborate the isolation and loss of habitat, the negative impacts on the biodiversity of the Rabanal-Rio Bogota paramos complex.

TI  - Long-Term Analysis of Wave Climate and Shoreline Change along the Gulf of California
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The last ten years have shown that Climate Change (CC) is a major global issue to attend to. The integration of its effects into coastal impact assessments and adaptation plans has gained great attention and interest, focused on avoiding or minimizing human lives and asset losses. Future scenarios of mean sea level rises and wave energy increase rates have then been computed, but downscaling still remains necessary to assess the possible local effects in small areas. In this context, the effects of CC on the wave climate in the Gulf of California (GC), Mexico, have received little attention, and no previous studies have tackled the long-term trend of wave climate at a regional scale. In this paper, the long-term trends of the wave height, wave period and wave energy in the GC were thus investigated, using the fifth-generation climate reanalysis dataset (ERA5). The long-term shoreline evolution was also examined from historical Landsat images, so as to identify erosional hotspots where intervention can be prioritized. The results indicate that both the mean and extreme wave regimes in the GC are getting more energetic and that two-thirds of the coast is suffering chronic erosion. A discrepancy between the trends of the wave period and wave height in some regions of the Gulf was also found. Finally, the importance of natural processes, human activity and CC in the shoreline change is highlighted, while addressing the need for future permanent field observations and studies in the GC.

TI  - The New Landsat Collection-2 Digital Elevation Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat Collection-2 distribution introduces a new global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for scene orthorectification. The new global DEM is a composite of the latest and most accurate freely available DEM sources and will include reprocessed Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data (called NASADEM), high-resolution stereo optical data (ArcticDEM), a new National Elevation Dataset (NED) and various publicly available national datasets including the Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) and DEMs for Sweden, Norway and Finland (SNF). The new DEM will be available world-wide with few exceptions. It is anticipated that the transition from the Collection-1 DEM at 3 arcsecond to the new DEM will be seamless because processing methods to maintain a seamless transition were employed, void filling techniques were used, where persistent gaps were found, and the pixel spacing is the same between the two collections. Improvements to the vertical accuracy were realized by differencing accuracies of other elevation datasets to the new DEM. The greatest improvement occurred where ArcticDEM data were used, where an improvement of 35 m was measured. By using theses improved vertical values in a line of sight algorithm, horizontal improvements were noted in some of the most mountainous regions over multiple 30-m Landsat pixels. This new DEM will be used to process all of the scenes from Landsat 1-8 in Collection-2 processing and will be made available to the public by the end of 2020.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Eyelid and Conjunctival Malignancy <i>A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology</i>
T2  - OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To determine the efficacy and safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the management of eyelid and conjunctival malignancy.Methods: A literature search was performed in August 2019 and January 2020 for articles published in English in the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. This search yielded 151 articles that were reviewed for relevancy, of which 27 were deemed to have met the inclusion criteria for this assessment. The data from these articles were abstracted and the articles were rated for strength of evidence by the panel methodologist.Results: All 27 studies were rated level III, and a total of 197 SLNBs were reported. Diagnoses included conjunctival and eyelid cutaneous melanoma (85 and 42 patients, respectively), sebaceous gland carcinoma (35 patients), squamous cell carcinoma (26 patients), Merkel cell carcinoma (6 patients), pigmented epithelioid melanocytoid tumor (1 patient), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (1 patient), and signet ring carcinoma (1 patient). Tracer was found in regional lymph nodes in 100% of patients in 21 of 27 articles and in 191 of 197 patients overall. The number of lymph nodes removed ranged from 1 to 16, with most ranging from 1 to 5. Tumor-positive lymph nodes were found in 33 of 197 patients (16.8%), prompting recommendations for adjuvant treatments. Survival data were reported for 16 of these patients, with follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 36 months (average, 12.7 months). Fourteen of 16 patients received adjuvant treatments. Nine were alive and well, 1 was alive with metastases, and 6 had died of metastatic disease (including 2 patients who declined additional treatment). Falsenegative SLNB results were reported in 5 articles involving 9 of 197 procedures (4.6%). Complications were documented in 7 of 27 articles and included transient facial nerve weakness, persistent blue dye staining of the conjunctiva, neck hematoma, and suture abscess.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a promising procedure in patients with eyelid and conjunctival malignancy, and it is useful in identifying sentinel lymph nodes. However, at present, insufficient evidence exists showing that SLNB improves patient outcomes and survival. Recognition of microscopic metastatic disease may prove beneficial in staging and guiding adjuvant therapy. (C) 2020 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology

TI  - Challenges Posed by Embryonic and Anatomical Factors in Systematic Lymphadenectomy for Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node involvement has been shown to be one of the most relevant prognostic factors in a variety of malignancies; this is also true of endometrial cancer. The determination of the lymph node status is crucial in order to establish the tumor stage, and to consider adjuvant treatment. A wide range of surgical staging practices are currently used for the treatment of endometrial cancer. The necessity and extent of lymph node dissection is an ongoing controversial issue in gynecological oncology. Lymph node surgery in endometrial cancer is technically challenging, and can be time consuming because of the topographic complexity of lymphatic drainage as such, and the fact that the lymph nodes are directly adjacent to both blood vessels and nerves. Therefore, profound and exact knowledge of the anatomy is essential. Sentinel lymph node mapping was recently introduced in surgical staging with the aim of reducing morbidity, whilst also obtaining useful prognostic information from a patient's lymph node status. The present review summarizes the current evidence on the role of lymph node surgery in endometrial cancer, focusing on the embryological, anatomical, and technical aspects.

TI  - Ants provide biological control on tropical organic farms influenced by local and landscape factors
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple predator species can provide effective biological control of pest insects if predators have complementary effects. This could be the case of predatory ants in species-rich assemblages, such as in the tropics. However, predator assemblages are structured by variation in local and landscape factors. Different spatial scales can affect species interaction and consequently the biological control provided. We investigated ant suppression of pest insects in organic vegetable crops, and the role of local and landscape factors on biological control. We used a sentinel prey assay to determine the effectiveness of ant biological control on 18 organic farms in the Brazilian Federal District. Ants and other predatory groups were sampled on farms to determine natural enemy assemblage composition. Ants were the group that most contributed to the predation rates, and the other predator groups complemented the predation rates exerted by ants. The predation of sentinel prey increased 3.07-fold when ants were present. These results varied with the farming management practices employed. The species richness and occurrence were positively related to the predation rates, indicating that ant species-rich assemblage may be more relevant than single species in providing biological control. The predation exerted by ants and other predators were benefited by the abundance of predators in the landscape. Tree cover and cropped area in the landscape reduced ant predation but increased the predation exerted by other predators, because most ant species we sampled usually occur in open habitats. In conclusion, species-rich assemblages play a central role in providing biological control, and biological control provided by ants and other predators depends on local habitat management and landscape composition and therefore is a scale dependent process.

TI  - Contrasting the Effects of Mortality Salience and Future Time Limitation on Goal Prioritization in Older andYounger Adults
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study aims at contrasting the effects of limited future time perspective and mortality salience on goal prioritization across adulthood. Socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) argues that people increasingly prioritize emotionally meaningful goals when they perceive future time as more limited. Terror management theory (TMT) suggests that mortality salience (i.e., the awareness of one's mortality) drives people to prioritize the goal of perpetuating own existence through affirming cultural worldview.Method: In this study, participants (N = 438) were randomly assigned to six conditions that primed (a) limited future time, (b) mortality salience, (c) death reflection, (d) both limited future time and mortality salience, (e) both limited future time, and death reflection, or (f) none.Results: Results showed that older adults allocated significantly more resources to emotionally close recipients who supported their cultural worldviews in conditions involving future time limitation and death reflection. They also allocated less resources to emotionally not close recipients who did not support their cultural worldviews in conditions involving future time limitation. Younger adults did not show these differences. Nor did mortality salience have any effect.Discussion: These results suggest that future time perspective and death reflection shift age-related goals more than mortality salience.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach for Mapping Forest Vegetation in Riparian Zones in an Atlantic Biome Environment Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian zones consist of important environmental regions, specifically to maintain the quality of water resources. Accurately mapping forest vegetation in riparian zones is an important issue, since it may provide information about numerous surface processes that occur in these areas. Recently, machine learning algorithms have gained attention as an innovative approach to extract information from remote sensing imagery, including to support the mapping task of vegetation areas. Nonetheless, studies related to machine learning application for forest vegetation mapping in the riparian zones exclusively is still limited. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for forest vegetation mapping in riparian zones based on machine learning models using orbital multispectral images. A total of 14 Sentinel-2 images registered throughout the year, covering a large riparian zone of a portion of a wide river in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, was adopted as the dataset. This area is mainly composed of the Atlantic Biome vegetation, and it is near to the last primary fragment of its biome, being an important region from the environmental planning point of view. We compared the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms like decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and normal Bayes (NB). We evaluated different dates and locations with all models. Our results demonstrated that the DT learner has, overall, the highest accuracy in this task. The DT algorithm also showed high accuracy when applied on different dates and in the riparian zone of another river. We conclude that the proposed approach is appropriated to accurately map forest vegetation in riparian zones, including temporal context.

TI  - Melanomacrophage centeres and diseases occurring in lesser-spotted catsharks, <i>Scyliorhinus</i> <i>canicula</i> (L.), from the southern Adriatic Sea - importance for monitoring
T2  - ACTA ADRIATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanomacrophages of fish are commonly explored as biomarkers of water pollution and are considered to be sensitive albeit non-specific health indicators in water ecosystems. Sharks as long living marine species are good sentinel species. This study presents morphometric data for splenic and hepatic melanomacrophages (MMC), and observed histopathology in ten lesser-spotted catsharks, Scyliorhinus canicula (L.), one of the most abundant shark species in the eastern Adriatic Sea. At necropsy, we collected random tissue samples from liver, brain, gallblader, pancreas, spleen, kidney, gills, entire digestive system, thyroid gland, rectal gland, entire urogenital (male samples) and genital system (female samples). Collected tissue samples were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Periodic Acid-Schiff, and Masson Trichrome for microscopic examinations and morphometry. There was a minimal number of histopathological lesions in the examined sharks, but morphometric values reported herein were three folds higher than in previous studies in free-ranging sharks. Studies on larger numbers of sharks are needed to elucidate the biological significance of our finding in the context of population decline of the lesser-spotted catshark.

TI  - Forest Cover Mapping Based on a Combination of Aerial Images and Sentinel-2 Satellite Data Compared to National Forest Inventory Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: This study developed the first remote sensing-based forest cover map of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, in a very high level of detail. Background and Objectives: As available global or pan-European forest maps have a low level of detail and the forest definition is not considered, administrative data are often oversimplified or out of date. Consequently, there is an important need for spatio-temporally explicit forest maps. The main objective of the present study was to generate a forest cover map of Baden-Wurttemberg, taking the German forest definition into account. Furthermore, we compared the results to NFI data; incongruences were categorized and quantified. Materials and Methods: We used a multisensory approach involving both aerial images and Sentinel-2 data. The applied methods are almost completely automated and therefore suitable for area-wide forest mapping. Results: According to our results, approximately 37.12% of the state is covered by forest, which agrees very well with the results of the NFI report (37.26% +/- 0.44%). We showed that the forest cover map could be derived by aerial images and Sentinel-2 data including various data acquisition conditions and settings. Comparisons between the forest cover map and 34,429 NFI plots resulted in a spatial agreement of 95.21% overall. We identified four reasons for incongruences: (a) edge effects at forest borders (2.08%), (b) different forest definitions since NFI does not specify minimum tree height (2.04%), (c) land cover does not match land use (0.66%) and (d) errors in the forest cover layer (0.01%). Conclusions: The introduced approach is a valuable technique for mapping forest cover in a high level of detail. The developed forest cover map is frequently updated and thus can be used for monitoring purposes and for assisting a wide range of forest science, biodiversity or climate change-related studies.

TI  - Stepwise modeling and the importance of internal variables validation to test model realism in a data scarce glacier basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Model realism is of vital importance in science of hydrology, in terms of realistic representation of hydrological processes and reliability of future prediction. Here, we employed a stepwise modeling approach that leverages flexible model structures and multi-source observations for robust streamflow simulation and internal variables validation with improved model realism. This framework is demonstrated in Yigong Zangbu River (YZR) basin, a data scarce glacier basin in the upper Brahmaputra River. We designed six experiments (Exp1-6) to use modeling as a tool to understand hydrological processes in this remote cold basin with extremely high altitude. In Exp1, we started with a distributed rainfall-runoff model (FLEXD) - representing the case that snow and glacier processes were ignored. Then, we stepwisely added snow and glacier processes into FLEXD, denoted as FLEXD-S (Exp2) and FLEXD-SG (Exp3), respectively, and such improvement of model structure led to significantly improved streamflow estimates. To explore the impact of different precipitation forcing on model performance, FLEXD-SG was driven by Theissen average (Exp3) and three individual stations' precipitation (Exp4-6). The model realism was tested by observed hydrograph, snow cover area (SCA) and glacier mass balance (GMB). Results showed that a robust and realistic hydrological modeling system was achieved in Exp6. In this modeling study, we learned that: 1) stepwise modeling is effective in investigating catchment behavior, and snow and glacier melting are the dominant hydrological processes in the YZR basin; 2) internal variables validation is beneficial to test model realism in data scarce basin; 3) the FLEXD-SG model calibrated by only one year hydrograph is sufficient to reproduce snow and glacier variations; 4) precipitation of a single station as forcing data could outperform Theissen average; 5) based on the well tested model configuration in Exp6, we analyzed simulated results, and reconstructed the long term hydrography (1961-2013), to support the potential competence for decision making on water resources management in practice. The proposed framework may significantly improve our skills in hydrological modeling over data-poor regions.

TI  - The Diversified Impacts of Urban Morphology on Land Surface Temperature among Urban Functional Zones
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Local warming induced by rapid urbanization has been threatening residents' health, raising significant concerns among urban planners. Local climate zone (LCZ), a widely accepted approach to reclassify the urban area, which is helpful to propose planning strategies for mitigating local warming, has been well documented in recent years. Based on the LCZ framework, many scholars have carried out diversified extensions in urban zoning research in recent years, in which urban functional zone (UFZ) is a typical perspective because it directly takes into account the impacts of human activities. UFZs, widely used in urban planning and management, were chosen as the basic unit of this study to explore the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between landscape composition, urban morphology, urban functions, and land surface temperature (LST). Global regression including ordinary least square regression (OLS) and random forest regression (RF) were used to model the landscape-LST correlations to screen indicators to participate in following spatial regression. The spatial regression including semi-parametric geographically weighted regression (SGWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) were applied to investigate the spatial heterogeneity in landscape-LST among different types of UFZ and within each UFZ. Urban two-dimensional (2D) morphology indicators including building density (BD); three-dimensional (3D) morphology indicators including building height (BH), building volume density (BVD), and sky view factor (SVF); and other indicators including albedo and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and impervious surface fraction (ISF) were used as potential landscape drivers for LST. The results show significant spatial heterogeneity in the Landscape-LST relationship across UFZs, but the spatial heterogeneity is not obvious within specific UFZs. The significant impact of urban morphology on LST was observed in six types of UFZs representing urban built up areas including Residential (R), Urban village (UV), Administration and Public Services (APS), Commercial and Business Facilities (CBF), Industrial and Manufacturing (IM), and Logistics and Warehouse (LW). Specifically, a significant correlation between urban 3D morphology indicators and LST in CBF was discovered. Based on the results, we propose different planning strategies to settle the local warming problems for each UFZ. In general, this research reveals UFZs to be an appropriate operational scale for analyzing LST on an urban scale.

TI  - Comprehensive Comparisons of State-of-the-Art Gridded Precipitation Estimates for Hydrological Applications over Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based precipitation estimates with high quality and spatial-temporal resolutions play a vital role in forcing global or regional meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural models, which are especially useful over large poorly gauged regions. In this study, we apply various statistical indicators to comprehensively analyze the quality and compare the performance of five newly released satellite and reanalysis precipitation products against China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA) rain gauge data, respectively, with 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees spatial resolution and two temporal scales (daily and hourly) over southern China from June to August in 2019. These include Precipitation Estimates from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS), European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5-Land), Fengyun-4 (FY-4A), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG). Results indicate that: (1) all five products overestimate the accumulated rainfall in the summer, with FY-4A being the most severe; additionally, FY-4A cannot capture the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of precipitation over southern China. (2) IMERG and GSMaP perform better than the other three datasets at both daily and hourly scales; IMERG correlates slightly better than GSMaP against CMPA data, while it performs worse than GSMaP in terms of probability of detection (POD). (3) ERA5-Land performs better than PERSIANN-CCS and FY-4A at daily scale but shows the worst correlation coefficient (CC), false alarm ratio (FAR), and equitable threat score (ETS) of all precipitation products at hourly scale. (4) The rankings of overall performance on precipitation estimations for this region are IMERG, GSMaP, ERA5-Land, PERSIANN-CCS, and FY-4A at daily scale; and IMERG, GSMaP, PERSIANN-CCS, FY-4A, and ERA5-Land at hourly scale. These findings will provide valuable feedback for improving the current satellite-based precipitation retrieval algorithms and also provide preliminary references for flood forecasting and natural disaster early warning.

TI  - Detecting Lineament System Anomalies during Strong 6.4 and 7.1 Earthquakes in California from Satellite Imagery
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing data, we study the changes in lineament systems during the preparation and process of strong earthquakes with \M = 7.1 and \M = 6.4 which occurred in California (United States) in July 2019. The series of satellite images shot from January 1, 2019, to August 12, 2019, and the data on seismic setting in the region are analyzed. The precursory changes are revealed in the lineament systems; these changes are expressed in rose diagrams of regional lineaments and in summarized length of local lineaments of different directions. An abrupt change in quantitative characteristics of rose diagrams of lineaments began to manifest on June 5, 2019 (i.e., a month before the earthquake of July 4 and 5, 2019). It is established that the maximum length of lineaments striking to the northwest and northeast (corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse strikes relative to the main regional structural features) was reported on June 30, 2019 (i.e., several days before the strong earthquakes).

TI  - Paramo Ecosystems in Ecuador's Southern Region: Conservation State and Restoration
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paramo is home to a significant proportion of global biodiversity and provides essential services for the development of life for millions of people in Ecuador. However, land use/land cover (LULC) changes threaten biodiversity and modify its functioning. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the conservation status of the herbaceous paramo (HP) ecosystem by analyzing its LULC in Ecuador's southern region. (2) to identify possible regions where the native paramo ecosystem is being restored. We analyzed Landsat 8 images using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Classifier Decision Tree (CDT) to achieve these objectives. The results show that the native herbaceous paramo (NHP) ecosystem is being transformed into an anthropogenic HP (AHP). The area covered by the NHP ecosystem (296,964 ha) has been reduced by 50% (149,834 ha). Nevertheless, we identified five regions where the NHP is upgrading. These regions are relevant for studying NHP regeneration in Ecuador's southern region, where soils are mostly andosols. The LU of the paramo, with cycles of exploitation, abandonment, and regeneration in a secondary paramo, is transforming the NHP ecosystem. These exploitation practices, global climate change, and lack of knowledge about the NHP ecosystem's regeneration and its soils' recovery threaten to substantially reduce the NHP area, its functionality, and its ecosystem services.

TI  - Equivalence Randomized Trial to Compare Treatment on the Basis of Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Neck Node Dissection in Operable T1-T2N0 Oral and Oropharyngeal Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSESentinel node (SN) biopsy is accurate in operable oral and oropharyngeal cT1-T2N0 cancer (OC), but, to our knowledge, the oncologic equivalence of SN biopsy and neck lymph node dissection (ND; standard treatment) has never been evaluated.METHODSIn this phase III multicenter trial, 307 patients with OC were randomly assigned to (1) the ND arm or (2) the SN arm (experimental arm: biopsy alone if negative, or followed by ND if positive, during primary tumor surgery). The primary outcome was neck node recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 2 years. Secondary outcomes were 5-year neck node RFS, 2- and 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). Other outcomes were hospital stay length, neck and shoulder morbidity, and number of physiotherapy prescriptions during the 2 years after surgery.RESULTSData on 279 patients (139 ND and 140 SN) could be analyzed. Neck node RFS was 89.6% (95% CI, 0.83% to 0.94%) at 2 years in the ND arm and 90.7% (95% CI, 0.84% to 0.95%) in the SN arm, confirming the equivalence with P < .01. The 5-year RFS and the 2- and 5-year DSS and OS were not significantly different between arms. The median hospital stay length was 8 days in the ND arm and 7 days in the SN arm (P < .01). The functional outcomes were significantly worse in the ND arm until 6 months after surgery.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrated the oncologic equivalence of the SN and ND approaches, with lower morbidity in the SN arm during the first 6 months after surgery, thus establishing SN as the standard of care in OC.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of land use and land cover change: a systematic model inter-comparison driven by integrated modelling techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, land use and land cover change (LULCC) is of utmost concern for global environmental change and sustainability. Among the portfolio of techniques, modelling is considered as the best approach to explore LULC dynamics. We have performed a model inter-comparison exercise (including hybrid and non-hybrid models) using multiple performance metrics to identify the best modelling approach for the subsequent projection of future LULC. The methodology is demonstrated on the Subarnarekha basin of Eastern India by utilizing the LANDSAT imagery of 1989, 1994, 2006, and 2011. Before LULC modelling, the cross-tabulation and trend-surface analyses were performed to identify dominant land transitions in post-classification maps. Temporal mapping results over 1989-2011 exhibited a drastic decrease in the area under dense forest (25.7% to 19.0%), a substantial increase in the area under scrubland (21.0% to 26.1%) and a nominal reduction in the coverage of the agricultural land (51.2% to 49.0%). Four integrated models namely Multilayer perceptron-Markov Model (MLP-MC), Logistic Regression-Markov Model (LR-MC), and two hybrid models, i.e. Multilayer perceptron-Cellular automata-Markov model (MLP-CA-MC) and Logistic Regression-Cellular automata-Markov model (LR-CA-MC) were tested for their suitability for predicting future LULC for the basin. Based on the multiple model validation techniques, the MLP-MC model performed the best. MLP-MC model subsequently used a non-stationary relationship between selected explanatory variables and LULC to predict the future LULC for 2020 and 2030. The MLP-MC model projected that relative to the level of 2011, agricultural land, dense forest, and barren land may decrease by 8.3, 28.2 and 23.5%, respectively, and scrubland, built-up area, and water bodies may increase by 22.5, 87.3 and 13.3%, respectively, by 2030. Our findings contradict the prevalent view regarding the nationwide intensification of agriculture over the Indian subcontinent but are consistent with the national decreasing trend in the dense forest. The study provides a transferable methodology for the systematic comparison of LULC models (including hybrid and non-hybrid) against multiple performance metrics. The outcomes of the study may help land-use planners, environmentalist, and policymakers in framing better policies and management .recommendations.

T2  - IMAGERIE DE LA FEMME
M3  - Review
AB  - The analysis of the skin of breasts is subject to great contextual variability, whether it is carcinological, infectious, inflammatory, linked to systemic diseases or dermatoses, etc. The radiologist's objective is not to miss a breast cancer knowing that a mammary cutaneous anomaly can be sentinel or the direct witness of a breast cancer. The reasons for radiological consultation guided by a mammary cutaneous anomaly are essentially inflammatory breasts, the causes of which are multiple: carcinomatous, infectious, primary or secondary inflammatory (postradiation, immunological, vascular, ruptured implant, etc.) and changes in the areola - nipple complex including Paget's disease, the only entity that requires an exhaustive imaging assessment.

TI  - Multistrategy ensemble regression for mapping of built-up density and height with Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we establish a workflow for estimation of built-up density and height based on multispectral Sentinel-2 data. To do so, we render the estimation of built-up density and height as a supervised learning problem. Given the rational level of measurement of those two target variables, the regression estimation problem is regarded as finding the mapping between an incoming vector, i.e., ubiquitously available features computed from Sentinel-2 data, and an observable output (i.e., training set), which is derived over spatially limited areas in an automated manner. As such, training sets are automatically generated from a joint exploitation of TanDEM-X mission elevation data and Sentinel-2 imagery, and, as an alternative, from cadastral sources. The training sets are used to regress the target variables for spatial processing units which correspond to urban neighborhood scales. From a methodological point of view, we introduce a novel ensemble regression approach, i.e., multistrategy ensemble regression (MSER), based on advanced machine learning-based regression algorithms including Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and Neural Network Regression. To establish a robust ensemble, those algorithms are learned with a modified version of the AdaBoost.RT algorithm. However, to reliably ensure diversity between single boosted regressors, we include a random feature subspace method in the procedure. In contrast to existing approaches, we selectively prune non-favorable regressors trained during the boosting procedure and calculate the final prediction by a weighted mean function on the residual models to ensure enhanced accuracy properties of predictions. Finally, outputs are concatenated into a single prediction with a decision fusion strategy. Experimental results are obtained from four test areas which cover the settlement areas of the four largest German cites, i.e., Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne. The results unambiguously underline the beneficial properties of the MSER approach, since all best predictions were obtained with a boosted regressor in conjunction with a decision fusion strategy in a comparative setup. The mean absolute errors of corresponding models vary between 3 and 16% and 1-5.4 m with respect to built-up density and height, respectively, depending on the validation strategy, size of the spatial processing units, and test area. Also in a domain adaptation setup (i.e., when learning a model over a source domain and applying it over a geographically different target domain) numerous predictions show comparable accuracy levels as predictions obtained within a source domain. This further underlines the viability to transfer a model and, thus, enable a substitution of the training data in the target domains.

T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological and ecological role of wetlands were growing significant. Based on Landsat satellite remote sensing data collected in the years of 1990, 2000 and 2014, and integrating GIS with analytical methods of landscape ecology, research on changes of land use/cover and landscape pattern of Zhalong wetland from 1990 to 2014 was conducted. Then, we analysed the effect of human activities and climate changes on land use/cover. The main conclusions were as follows: (1) Significant changes in land use/cover have taken place in Zhalong wetland during 1990-2014.Cultivated land, unused land and construction land increased continually, while the area of reed swamp, water swamp, grass land and water land decreased accordingly; (2) Landscape patch shape has be increasingly irregular and turned complexed, there was the tend of the growing diversification and homogenization of land use change and the growing complicate landscape pattern in Zhalong wetland; (3) There was a warm-dry climate trend from 1958 to 2014; (4) Human activities including population, construction, water land pollution and production have been threatening the wetland ecosystem. Those changes in Zhalong area were caused by nature and human activity. However, the human's contributions are great.

TI  - Detection of NO<sub>2</sub> pollution plumes from individual ships with the TROPOMI/S5P satellite sensor
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of tropospheric NO2 column measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument onboard the Copernicus Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite (TROPOMI/S5P) for an oceanic area in the central Mediterranean on 2 July 2018. The day and area were selected because of the stable and cloud-free weather conditions with low wind speeds throughout most of the area, while covering one of the busiest worldwide international shipping corridors. In addition, the area was affected by sunglint, i.e. sunlight that is directly reflected by the ocean surface waves to the satellite which greatly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the satellite observations. The satellite measurements reveal plume-like emission structures in tropospheric NO2 columns while automated identification signal (AIS) data of ship locations reveal a total of 185 ships in the area. Combined with information about wind speed and wind direction within 3 h prior to the TROPOMI/S5P overpass, the ship tracks can almost perfectly be aligned with the plume-like tropospheric NO2 structures. In addition, information about ship length and ship speed, combined with an analysis of ship tracks and ship position, reveal that nearly all emission plume-like tropospheric NO2 structures can be attributed to the largest ships, mostly container ships and crude oil tankers. Overall, our results show for the first time ever that NO2 emission plumes from ships can be detected and attributed to individual ships using satellite measurements, while also providing strong support for using satellite sunglint measurements.

TI  - Change Detection within Remotely Sensed Satellite Image Time Series via Spectral Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Jump or break detection within a non-stationary time series is a crucial and challenging problem in a broad range of applications including environmental monitoring. Remotely sensed time series are not only non-stationary and unequally spaced (irregularly sampled) but also noisy due to atmospheric effects, such as clouds, haze, and smoke. To address this challenge, a robust method of jump detection is proposed based on the Anti-Leakage Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (ALLSSA) along with an appropriate temporal segmentation. This method, namely, Jumps Upon Spectrum and Trend (JUST), can simultaneously search for trends and statistically significant spectral components of each time series segment to identify the potential jumps by considering appropriate weights associated with the time series. JUST is successfully applied to simulated vegetation time series with varying jump location and magnitude, the number of observations, seasonal component, and noises. Using a collection of simulated and real-world vegetation time series in southeastern Australia, it is shown that JUST performs better than Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) in identifying jumps within the trend component of time series with various types. Furthermore, JUST is applied to Landsat 8 composites for a forested region in California, U.S., to show its potential in characterizing spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. Therefore, JUST is recommended as a robust and alternative change detection method which can consider the observational uncertainties and does not require any interpolations and/or gap fillings.

M3  - Article
AB  - Pests and diseases can cause a variety of reactions in plants. In recent years, boxwood dieback has become one of the essential concerns of practitioners and natural resources managers in Iran. Dieback is one of the boxwood diseases whose symptoms include sudden and severe yellowing, browning, spotting, withering, or dying of leaves, stems, or the entire plant. To contain the dieback of boxwood spreadness, the early detection and disease distribution maps are required. Dieback of boxwood causes a range of changes in color, shape and leaf size to photosynthesis, transpiration. Through remote sensing techniques e.g. satellite image processing data, the variation of thermal and visual characteristics of the plant could be used to measure and illustrate the symptoms of the disease. In this study, five common vegetation indices, e.g. DVI, NDVI, SAVI, SR, and PHI, were extracted and calculated from Landsat 8 satellite image data from six regions in Gilan province, located in the northern part of Iran out of 150 maps over the 2014 - 2018 time period. It was turned out that among aforementioned indices, based upon the results of the models, SR and NDVI indices were more useful for disease spreadness, respectively. Our disease progression model fitting criteria showed that it this technique could be probably used to assess the extent of the affected areas and also the disease progress in investigated regions in the future.

TI  - Analysis of Drought Impact on Croplands from Global to Regional Scale: A Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the extreme climatic events that has a severe impact on crop production and food supply. Our main goal is to test the suitability of remote sensing-based indices to detect drought impacts on crop production from a global to regional scale. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) based imagery, spanning from 2001 to 2017 was used for this task. This includes the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and the evaporative stress index (ESI), which is based on the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration. These indices were used as indicators of drought-induced vegetation conditions for three main crops: maize, wheat, and soybean. The start and end of the growing season, as observed at 500 m resolution, were used to exclude the time steps that are outside of the growing season. Based on the three indicators, monthly standardized anomalies were estimated, which were used for both analyses of spatiotemporal patterns of drought and the relationship with yield anomalies. Anomalies in the ESI had higher correlations with maize and wheat yield anomalies than other indices, indicating that prolonged periods of low ESI during the growing season are highly correlated with reduced crop yields. All indices could identify past drought events, such as the drought in the USA in 2012, Eastern Africa in 2016-2017, and South Africa in 2015-2016. The results of this study highlight the potential of the use of moderate resolution remote sensing-based indicators combined with phenometrics for drought-induced crop impact monitoring. For several regions, droughts identified using the ESI and LST were more intense than the NDVI-based results. We showed that these indices are relevant for agricultural drought monitoring at both global and regional scales. They can be integrated into drought early warning systems, process-based crop models, as well as can be used for risk assessment and included in advanced decision-support frameworks.

TI  - The role of the sentinel lymph node in vulvar cancer
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this study was to update clinical practice applications and technical procedures regarding sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in vulvar cancer considering European experts' opinions from this field. Systematic data search performed using PubMed/medline database up to May 20, 2020. Focus was only for English language publications of original studies on SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer. Given the basis of published evidence and the consensus of European experts. this study provides an updated overview on clinical applications and technical procedures of SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer. In early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a negative sentinel node the groin recurrence rate is low, survival is excellent. and treatment-related morbidity is minimal. We advise that sentinel node dissection, performed by a quality-controlled multidisciplinary team, should be part of the standard treatment in selected patients with early-stage vulvar cancer.

TI  - How Well Can Persistent Contrails Be Predicted?
T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent contrails and contrail cirrus are responsible for a large part of aviation induced radiative forcing. A considerable fraction of their warming effect could be eliminated by diverting only a quite small fraction of flight paths, namely those that produce the highest individual radiative forcing (iRF). In order to make this a viable mitigation strategy it is necessary that aviation weather forecast is able to predict (i) when and where contrails are formed, (ii) which of these are persistent, and (iii) how large the iRF of those contrails would be. Here we study several data bases together with weather data in order to see whether such a forecast would currently be possible. It turns out that the formation of contrails can be predicted with some success, but there are problems to predict contrail persistence. The underlying reason for this is that while the temperature field is quite good in weather prediction and climate simulations with specified dynamics, this is not so for the relative humidity in general and for ice supersaturation in particular. However we find that the weather model shows the dynamical peculiarities that are expected for ice supersaturated regions where strong contrails are indeed found in satellite data. This justifies some hope that the prediction of strong contrails may be possible via general regression involving the dynamical state of the ambient atmosphere.

TI  - On the outstanding need for a long-term, multi-decadal, validated and quality assessed record of global burned area: Caution in the use of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term, multi-decadal, record of global burned area is needed to understand the interplay between human activity and climate change on fire occurrence and behavior. At present, the longest consistent satellite-based record has been provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites. A long-standing objective within the remote sensing community has been to compile a long-term record of pre-MODIS global fire activity using data acquired with the older Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The recent production and release of one such new data set - the AVHRR-based FireCCILT10 burned area product generated under the auspices of ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) warrants a fresh consideration of the practical issues confounding the use of AVHRR observations. Here we compare the new 36-year FireCCILT10 product with the AVHRR Long Term Data Record (LTDR) input data used to generate the data set. Despite its recent provenance, we found significant temporal artifacts in the first half, and in the last year, of the FireCCILT10 burned area record, that we show are associated with the orbit drift of the NOAA polar orbiting satellites on which the AVHRR sensor suite resides. Based on these findings, and having noted similar but previously unacknowledged artifacts in two older long-term AVHRR burned area products, we formulate several practical recommendations with respect to use of the FireCCILT10 data set and the development of future long-term AVHRR-based fire data sets. The paper findings reinforce the ongoing need for a long-term, multi-decadal, validated and quality assessed, record of global burned area.

TI  - Biological parameters of the egg parasitoid <i>Ooencyrtus gonoceri</i>
T2  - BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ooencyrtus gonoceri Viggiani (Hymenoptera Encyrtidae) is a poorly known egg parasitoid species with an apparently rare occurrence in the Mediterranean basin. It was originally identified in southern Italy emerging from Gonocerus acuteangulatus (Goeze) eggs and successively recorded also from Spain. Recently O. gonoceri emerged from sentinel egg batches of Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae) in central Italy. Due to the scanty data on this species, biological and demographic parameters of O. gonoceri were investigated under laboratory conditions on the alternative host Graphosoma italicum italicum (Muller) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae). Estimated fecundity was over 200 eggs/female and the mean progeny production per female was high (173.76 specimens). At the standard rearing condition (26 degrees C) the development time of both sexes was similar and adults emerged after two weeks. Moreover O. gonoceri females lived much longer than males and the host feeding behaviour resulted irrelevant for the parasitoid longevity. The main biological parameters of O. gonoceri were similar to those reported for other cogeneric species. However, this species appeared to be a very effective egg parasitoid if compared with Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev) reared on the same host.

TI  - On the Reliable Generation of 3D City Models from Open Data
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A 3D model communicates more effectively than a 2D model, hence the applications of 3D city models are rapidly gaining significance in urban studies. However, presently, there is a dearth of free of cost, high-resolution 3D city models available for use. This paper offers potential solutions to this problem by providing a globally replicable methodology to generate low-cost 3D city models from open source 2D building data in conjunction with open satellite-based elevation datasets. Two geographically and morphologically different case studies were used to develop and test this methodology: the Chinese city of Shanghai and the city of Nottingham in the UK. The method is based principally on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Advanced Land Observing SatelliteWorld 3D digital surface model (AW3D DSM) data and use GMTED 2010 DTM data for undulating terrain. Further enhancement of the resultant 3D model, though not compulsory, uses higher resolution elevation models that are not always open source, but if available can be used (i.e., airborne LiDAR generated DTM). Further we test and develop methods to improve the accuracy of the generated 3D models, employing a small subset of high resolution data that are not open source but can be purchased with a minimal budgets. Given these scenarios of data availability are globally applicable and time-efficient for 3D building generation (where 2D building footprints are available), our proposed methodology has the potential to accelerate the production of 3D city models, and thus to facilitate their dependent applications (e.g., disaster management) wherever commercial 3D city models are unavailable.

TI  - Essential Variables for Environmental Monitoring: What Are the Possible Contributions of Earth Observation Data Cubes?
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental sustainability is nowadays a major global issue that requires efficient and effective responses from governments. Essential variables (EV) have emerged in different scientific communities as a means to characterize and follow environmental changes through a set of measurements required to support policy evidence. To help track these changes, our planet has been under continuous observation from satellites since 1972. Currently, petabytes of satellite Earth observation (EO) data are freely available. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized because many big data challenges and complexity barriers hinder their effective use. Consequently, facilitating the production of EVs using the wealth of satellite EO data can be beneficial for environmental monitoring systems. In response to this issue, a comprehensive list of EVs that can take advantage of consistent time-series satellite data has been derived. In addition, a set of use-cases, using an Earth Observation Data Cube (EODC) to process large volumes of satellite data, have been implemented to demonstrate the practical applicability of EODC to produce EVs. The proposed approach has been successfully tested showing that EODC can facilitate the production of EVs at different scales and benefiting from the spatial and temporal dimension of satellite EO data for enhanced environmental monitoring.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Hyperspectral UV-Visible OMI and Broadband Meteorological Imager MODIS Data for a Merged Aerosol Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of optimal aerosol datasets by the synergistic use of hyperspectral ultraviolet (UV)-visible and broadband meteorological imager (MI) techniques was investigated. The Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 1B (L1B) was used as a proxy for hyperspectral UV-visible instrument data to which the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) aerosol algorithm was applied. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L1B and dark target aerosol Level 2 (L2) data were used with a broadband MI to take advantage of the consistent time gap between the MODIS and the OMI. First, the use of cloud mask information from the MI infrared (IR) channel was tested for synergy. High-spatial-resolution and IR channels of the MI helped mask cirrus and sub-pixel cloud contamination of GEMS aerosol, as clearly seen in aerosol optical depth (AOD) validation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. Second, dust aerosols were distinguished in the GEMS aerosol-type classification algorithm by calculating the total dust confidence index (TDCI) from MODIS L1B IR channels. Statistical analysis indicates that the Probability of Correct Detection (POCD) between the forward and inversion aerosol dust models (DS) was increased from 72% to 94% by use of the TDCI for GEMS aerosol-type classification, and updated aerosol types were then applied to the GEMS algorithm. Use of the TDCI for DS type classification in the GEMS retrieval procedure gave improved single-scattering albedo (SSA) values for absorbing fine pollution particles (BC) and DS aerosols. Aerosol layer height (ALH) retrieved from GEMS was compared with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data, which provides high-resolution vertical aerosol profile information. The CALIOP ALH was calculated from total attenuated backscatter data at 1064 nm, which is identical to the definition of GEMS ALH. Application of the TDCI value reduced the median bias of GEMS ALH data slightly. The GEMS ALH bias approximates zero, especially for GEMS AOD values of >similar to 0.4 and GEMS SSA values of <similar to 0.95. Finally, the AOD products from the GEMS algorithm and MI were used in aerosol merging with the maximum-likelihood estimation method, based on a weighting factor derived from the standard deviation of the original AOD products. With the advantage of the UV-visible channel in retrieving aerosol properties over bright surfaces, the combined AOD products demonstrated better spatial data availability than the original AOD products, with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, pixel-level error analysis of GEMS AOD data indicates improvement through MI synergy.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF VEGETATION INDICES FOR CLASSIFICATION OF POTENTIAL AREAS OF OCCURRENCE OF ATTALEA SPECIOSA MART. EX SPRENG
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The babacu is a palm tree that has multiple possibilities for use in industry, mainly in the cosmetics and biofuels sectors, in addition to being present in cooking and in the craft trade. The species is present in South America, and in Brazil it is quite common in States like Maranhao and Tocantins, places where traditional communities depend on extractive activity for their financial survival. Thus, there is a need for the identification and mapping of palm groves, improving and providing sustainable public policies with effective techniques for mapping this phytophysiognomy. The present research evaluated different vegetation indices in order to verify the most appropriate in the identification of babacu, through their respective biomass values. Babacu is characterized by colonizing deforested forest formations and the hypothesis analyzed is that it is possible to identify these formations using sensor data by TM/Landsat 7 image processing. For this, pixel samples of the scene in the municipality of Babaculandia - TO were analyzed, where there is a large presence of babacu, and the spectral bands are correlated to the different vegetation indices for three classes defined as Babacu, Cerrado and Pastagem. The NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) was the index that showed the best performance in babacu mapping, showing that the presence of Babacu converges more to the Pasture class than to the areas defined as Cerrado. This result confirms information present in the botanical literature and the initial hypothesis.

TI  - Abnormal Training Samples Detection Method Based on Median Absolute Deviation
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The supervised classification technology of remote sensing images is widely used in the field of information extraction and change detection, in which the selection of training samples is very important, and the quality of training samples directly determines the accuracy of classification. However, due to the limitation of conditions and human error, some impure or wrong training samples may be selected, resulting in a decrease in classification accuracy. In order to solve this problem, the median absolute deviation method is used to detect and eliminate impure and wrong training samples in the supervised classification of remote sensing images based on the spectral information of the image. The optical remote sensing image data obtained from Landsat-8 in some areas of Nanchang city is selected, the support vector machine is used to supervise and classify the two situations that contain abnormal training samples and eliminate abnormal training samples, and compare the classification results. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of removing abnormal training samples is significantly better than that of abnormal training samples.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Imagery for Mapping Irrigation Center Pivots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the number and size of irrigation center pivot systems (CPS) from remotely sensed data, using artificial intelligence (AI), is a potential information source for assessing agricultural water use. In this study, we identified two technical challenges in the neural-network-based classification: Firstly, an effective reduction of the feature space of the remote sensing data to shorten training times and increase classification accuracy is required. Secondly, the geographical transferability of the AI algorithms is a pressing issue if AI is to replace human mapping efforts one day. Therefore, we trained the semantic image segmentation algorithm U-NET on four spectral channels (U-NET SPECS) and the first three principal components (U-NET principal component analysis (PCA)) of ESA/Copernicus Sentinel-2 images on a study area in Texas, USA, and assessed the geographic transferability of the trained models to two other sites: the Duero basin, in Spain, and South Africa. U-NET SPECS outperformed U-NET PCA at all three study areas, with the highest f1-score at Texas (0.87, U-NET PCA: 0.83), and a value of 0.68 (U-NET PCA: 0.43) in South Africa. At the Duero, both models showed poor classification accuracy (f1-score U-NET PCA: 0.08; U-NET SPECS: 0.16) and segmentation quality, which was particularly evident in the incomplete representation of the center pivot geometries. In South Africa and at the Duero site, a high rate of false positive and false negative was observed, which made the model less useful, especially at the Duero test site. Thus, geographical invariance is not an inherent model property and seems to be mainly driven by the complexity of land-use pattern. We do not consider PCA a suited spectral dimensionality reduction measure in this. However, shorter training times and a more stable training process indicate promising prospects for reducing computational burdens. We therefore conclude that effective dimensionality reduction and geographic transferability are important prospects for further research towards the operational usage of deep learning algorithms, not only regarding the mapping of CPS.

TI  - The Byderhand Pioneer Project: A case study of the participatory dynamics in creating and accessibilising locative literature for persons with visual impairment
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Through the discussion of the Byderhand Pioneer Project as a case study, the article provides an overview of the practical implementation of participatory and interdisciplinary creative projects in the digital humanities. The end-product of the Byderhand Pioneer Project comprises three locative-literature installations accessible to persons with visual impairment, located in Worcester in the Western Cape. The project is a participatory practice based research project between researchers from the Creative Writing subject group at the North-West University and, among others, participants who are visually impaired. The project, which was undertaken on invitation by the school, may be regarded as an example of applied electronic literature studies (Ensslin 2019). It is unique in that the multimodal literary installations are accessible to persons with visual impairment, and also because persons with visual impairment played an integral role in the establishment of the project. This retrospective article, written from the perspectives of three researchers from different disciplines, presents an outline of the Byderhand Pioneer Project, focusing on the participatory dynamics required for creating and accessibilising digital locative literature. The article covers the contextualisation of the participatory approach; the establishment of project framework; the participatory dynamics that enabled the creation of a multisensory garden, as well as the creation of the digital literature and of the digital tools accessibilising such content; and, lastly, a reflection and conclusion regarding the project approach.The project was consciously grounded in a participatory worldview and research paradigm, which guided the execution of the project practice and the related research. Important points of departure included the concept of projects as basic units in digital humanities (Burdick et al. 2012), the participatory inquiry paradigm (Heron & Reason 1997), the practice based research approach, and participatory design. The principle of "nothing about us without us", which denotes that persons with disabilities must be integrally involved when projects or initiatives affect them directly (Rowland 2004), was accepted as the basis for the project. In the narrative on technology for the disabled, the project and approach would follow the idea of using everyday technology to ensure or improve accessibility, and to counter stigmatisation, as a human right (Mathiesen 2017; Perry 2015).Through exploratory discussions, meetings and site visits, relationships were built, and partners, collaborators and participants were identified; project possibilities were considered and expanded; and a project goal, objective and sub-projects were conceptualised and formulated. The aim of the overarching project for the researchers from the North-West University was to extend the accessibility of the existing Byderhand locative literature platform to enhance its accessibility to users and writers with visual impairment.For the school, the overarching collaborative aim was the creation of a multisensory garden on the school grounds. This involved the expertise, skills and input of various role players, which contributed to the organic development of the garden as a central purpose. Various partnerships were formed with an eye to the practical implementation of the garden project; specialist knowledge input from occupational and speech therapists, from orientation and mobility specialists, as well as music teachers, were obtained, and learners from the school were involved throughout.The cooperation in the production of the three multimodal literature installations can be understood as contributory participation (Rettberg 2011). The installations concern the Garden Verses, the Pioneer Stories and the Karoo Gardens Verses. The Garden Verses - a collection of multimodal poems and children's verses - are linked with the auditory offering in the multisensory garden. The collection was further expanded with the Pioneer Stories - stories and narrations about experiences at the school and in its surroundings, written by learners and former learners of the school. The Karoo Gardens Verses installation comprises a collection of poems for the proposed braille route in die Karoo Desert National Botanical Gardens. The Garden Verses and Karoo Gardens collections each contains 10 poems made available in different languages and presented through different media, and the Pioneer Stories collection consists of 27 contributions by participating authors with visual impairment.In line with the participatory nature of the project, a user-centred (Abras et al. 2004) and co-design approach was applied in designing a multimodal and multilevel interface through which the literature is disseminated. Persons with visual impairment were integral to the development of the accessible design solutions. These design solutions involve the combination of braille, QR codes and an accessible user interface that makes provision for sighted, low vision and blind users. The various texts and media were published on the database and installed in the school's multisensory garden and on the larger school grounds and were made available in a nearby coffee shop. The locative literature installations contribute to an enriched school environment, and the reception of the project has been predominantly positive. The evaluation phase involved various forms of observation, post-project reflection and the utilisation of various knowledge modalities.The success of the project can be attributed to the collaborative relationships between and contributions of a large variety of partners and individuals. The following aspects were identified as pivotal for the project's success: the context and purpose of the project; the use of existing networks and the establishment of new networks; interdisciplinary collaboration; versatility in approaches; the way in which local partners and participants provided links and acted as cultural guides; voluntary participation; inclusivity and accessibility as project guidelines; sustained dialogue and reflection; and the personality traits of the core team. Participation in the project raised the researchers' awareness of the needs of people with vision impairment, and of the need for greater inclusivity and accessibility of cultural products, especially as the latter need may find fulfilment through digital interface design and presentation of literature.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of Positional Accuracy When Using a Single Pixel for Thematic Accuracy Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary goal of thematic accuracy assessment is to measure the quality of land cover products and it has become an essential component in global or regional land cover mapping. However, there are many uncertainties introduced in the validation process which could propagate into the derived accuracy measures and therefore impact the decisions made with these maps. Choosing the appropriate reference data sample unit is one of the most important decisions in this process. The majority of researchers have used a single pixel as the assessment unit for thematic accuracy assessment, while others have claimed that a single pixel is not appropriate. The research reported here shows the results of a simulation analysis from the perspective of positional errors. Factors including landscape characteristics, the classification scheme, the spatial scale, and the labeling threshold were also examined. The thematic errors caused by positional errors were analyzed using the current level of geo-registration accuracy achieved by several global land cover mapping projects. The primary results demonstrate that using a single-pixel as an assessment unit introduces a significant amount of thematic error. In addition, the coarser the spatial scale, the greater the impact on positional errors as most pixels in the image become mixed. A classification scheme with more classes and a more heterogeneous landscape increased the positional effect. Using a higher labeling threshold decreased the positional impact but greatly increased the number of abandoned units in the sample. This research showed that remote sensing applications should not employ a single-pixel as an assessment unit in the thematic accuracy assessment.

TI  - The spatio-temporal soil moisture variation along the major tributaries of Zambezi River in the Mbire District, Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the TOPographic driven MODEL (TOPMODEL) in estimating soil moisture for Mbire district in Zimbabwe and validates these estimates with ground based gravimetric measurements baseded on fifty-four soil moisture sampling sites. Five atmospherically corrected MODIS images for the period 2013were processed and used to estimate evapotransiration. The result of the relative evaporation from the SEBS algorithm was multiplied by the average of the porosity and the field capacity to get the spatial and temporal soil moisture estimates. The TOPMODEL rainfall-runoff model whose land surface inputs were obtained from remote sensing was calibrated with runoff data for the period ranging 2008-2013. After successful calibration the model was used to to simulate spatial and temporal soil moisture estimates and compare with insitu-measured soil moisture from the fifty-two sampling sites. An upscaling procedure to improve the comparison between soil moisture retrieval point measurements, remote sensing and TOPMODEL outputs was accomplished by the use of geostatistical tools. Land suitability analysis for flood recession farming was performed using soil moisture maps, distance from stream network, vertical channel distance, and land use/ cover datasets. The model performance indicators for TOPMODEL simulations show an acceptable match with measured discharge, (NSE = 0.765 and 0.812 and PBIAS= -6.04 % and -10.5 % for Manyame and Angwa sub catchments respectively). Results show that the SEBS approach show spatial and temporal soil moisture variability across the Mbire district simulated. There is a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.796) between upscaled insitu-based soil moisture measurements and SEBS based techniques for the period of March to July 2013. The study further revealed that there is a fair relationship (R-2 = 0.60) between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and hydrological modelling (TOPMODEL) for the same period. TOPMODEL soil moisture increases towards the Angwa and Manyame river tributaries. Results also show that approximately 22800 ha of Mbire district has suitable to moderately suitable flood recession farming area. The study concludes that the use of geostatistical approaches, remote sensing and hydrologic models is promising in planning and management of soil moisture and water resources in data scarce and water limited environments.

TI  - Impact of urban morphology and landscape characteristics on spatiotemporal heterogeneity of land surface temperature
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban microclimates have undergone extreme changes against the current backdrop of global warming and rapid urbanization. Although several studies on the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of land surface temperatures (LSTs) have been reported, only a few of them describe the key factors and specific spatial relationships that affect LSTs from time series. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the spatial heterogeneity of LST from multiple time series and analyze its relationship with various influencing factors. A case study of the Ganjingzi District (GJZ) of Dalian City, China, was performed, with multi-source data and spatial analysis methods being jointly used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of multi temporal LSTs. The results indicate the following: (i) the GJZ LSTs gradually increased, with the average increase being 0.55 degrees C; (ii) there was a strong and positive correlation among the spatial distribution of LSTs, and the Moran's I value for global spatial autocorrelation exceeded 0.85; and (iii) the fitting degree between the LST and various factors (Adjust-R-2) for the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was better than that for the ordinary least squares approach. NDBI and LST are highly correlated and have good spatial stability. From the spatial distribution of Local-R-2, it can be seen that with the expansion of urban space, the influence of urban areas on LSTs increases. Therefore, reasonable planning of urban land is of great significance for mitigating heat islands.

TI  - Evaluation of Sustainable Regional Development Combining Remote Sensing Data and Ecological Constraints: A Case Study of Chaohu Basin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The maintenance of sustainable development in light of climate change is presenting society with a serious challenge. This study analyzes the spatial environment and its coupled relationship with socio-economic and food security in the Chaohu Lake Basin in central Anhui Province, China. Previous studies have shown that this study area has good environmental conditions. However, the ecological security, economic development, and food security in the Chaohu Lake Basin was generally poor and poorly coordinated in 2018, especially in the center of local cities and surrounding areas. Nevertheless, many towns are in a well-organized state, meaning sustainable and coordinated regional development can be achieved through resource optimization. Generally, the economic conditions in the Chaohu Lake Basin should be improved in a way that ensures that the environment is not significantly degraded. The main functional zoning requirements of the counties' land management planning designate most of the counties as parts of ecological conservation areas. The present study provides monitoring of important basin ecosystems and serves as a guide to future sustainable regional development by providing directions and paths to follow; it can also provide a reference for eco-functional zoning that is applicable to various natural basins worldwide.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, FY-4A/GIIRS data assimilation directly uses the cloud detection results of the multi-channel scanning imaging radiometer (AGRI). All channels in the cloud contaminated field of view are eliminated, and some available channel information is lost. In order to obtain these available channel information, based on the cloud detection principle given by McNally, using GIIRS observations and RTTOV simulation results of clear sky, combined with GIIRS sensitivity and other radiation characteristics, an autonomous GIIRS cloud detection method is proposed. The results show that the cloud detection results of GIIRS and AGRI are in good agreement. When there are fine clouds or broken clouds in the field of view of GIIRS, there is a certain difference between the two; using the obtained cloud top height, the available channels in the field of cloud pollution can be obtained, The channel utilization rate increased by 13.76%. This cloud detection method provides an important reference for GIIRS data assimilation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration in the Northern Yellow Sea based on remote sensing data
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of chlorophyll a in the sea surface has obvious spatial variation and dynamic development characteristics. Analyzing the long-term variation trend of chlorophyll a concentration is of great significance for understanding the development of marine primary productivity and ecological monitoring. Northern Yellow Sea is China's important fishing grounds with rich fishery resources. To investigate the overall ecosystem stability, this paper uses the multi-source satellite fusion data provided by Hermes and the Mann Kendall trend test method to analyze the characteristics of interannual and seasonal changes and evolution of the Chl-a concentration in the Northern Yellow Sea in 1998-2019. The correlation of their dynamic changes with related environmental factors are analyzed. It was found that the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a in the Northern Yellow Sea is regional and had significant seasonal changes. The concentration of coastal waters is higher than that of deep-sea waters, and the oceanic estuary of the Liaodong Peninsula has a high value center, which is related to land source input. Except for the weak upward trend in the waters around the West Korea Bay, all the other waters showed a down. ward trend, especially significant in the coastal waters, suggesting the stronger growth potential of phytoplankton in the waters around the West Korea Bay. The influencing factors of Chl-a concentration in the Northern Yellow Sea are complex and regional strong. Chl-a concentration is strongly correlated with environmental factors only in some months, and different factors have relatively dominant correlation in different season. Related environmental factors will affect the distribution and change of Chl-a to some extent. In terms of time, PAR and Chl-a had a relatively strong negative correlation in September. In terms of space, photosynthetic effective radiation has a greater impact on Chl-a concentration than SST and SSW. In winter, the southern waters of Liaodong Peninsula have a relatively strong positive correlation with SSW. In summer, there is a relatively strong negative correlation with SST in the west of the sea. The decrease of coastal runoff input may be the reason for the decrease of Chl-a near shore.

TI  - Impact of high-speed rail on urban economic development: An observation from the Beijing-Guangzhou line based on night-time light images
T2  - SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-speed rail (HSR) of China has developed and expanded rapidly and made great achievements in the past twenty years. The ongoing HSR plan is expected to have a significant impact on the urban economy and spatial structure in China. However, relevant data-driven research is still lacking. Traditional data collection approaches such as field surveys are costly to assure the accuracy of materials. In this study, a new remote sensing perspective of night-time light (NTL) was adopted to observe the long-term impact of the HSR on cities along the rail. More specifically, we investigated the impact of the Beijing-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway (BGHSR) on urban economic development by using night-time light data from 2002 to 2018. Such a line connects the capital (located in the north of China) and southern China and lies on the most important geographic axis of the country. Our results find that the construction of BGHSR line has a considerable positive impact on economies of first-tier cities (e.g., Beijing and Guangzhou) and new-first-tier cities (e.g., Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Changsha), but also hurt some second-tier and third-tier cities such as Baoding and Handan. Generally, the spatial economic pattern of cities along the BGHSR line has been rapidly reshaped with the change of the transportation system. Each city needs to reconsider its role and value in the coming regionalization process to adapt to the national strategy.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing of Wetlands in Semi-Arid and Arid Areas: A Review on Applications, Challenges and Possible Future Research Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands are ranked as very diverse ecosystems, covering about 4-6% of the global land surface. They occupy the transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial environments, and share characteristics of both zones. Wetlands play critical roles in the hydrological cycle, sustaining livelihoods and aquatic life, and biodiversity. Poor management of wetlands results in the loss of critical ecosystems goods and services. Globally, wetlands are degrading at a fast rate due to global environmental change and anthropogenic activities. This requires holistic monitoring, assessment, and management of wetlands to prevent further degradation and losses. Remote-sensing data offer an opportunity to assess changes in the status of wetlands including their spatial coverage. So far, a number of studies have been conducted using remotely sensed data to assess and monitor wetland status in semi-arid and arid regions. A literature search shows a significant increase in the number of papers published during the 2000-2020 period, with most of these studies being in semi-arid regions in Australia and China, and few in the sub-Saharan Africa. This paper reviews progress made in the use of remote sensing in detecting and monitoring of the semi-arid and arid wetlands, and focuses particularly on new insights in detection and monitoring of wetlands using freely available multispectral sensors. The paper firstly describes important characteristics of wetlands in semi-arid and arid regions that require monitoring in order to improve their management. Secondly, the use of freely available multispectral imagery for compiling wetland inventories is reviewed. Thirdly, the challenges of using freely available multispectral imagery in mapping and monitoring wetlands dynamics like inundation, vegetation cover and extent, are examined. Lastly, algorithms for image classification as well as challenges associated with their uses and possible future research are summarised. However, there are concerns regarding whether the spatial and temporal resolutions of some of the remote-sensing data enable accurate monitoring of wetlands of varying sizes. Furthermore, it was noted that there were challenges associated with the both spatial and spectral resolutions of data used when mapping and monitoring wetlands. However, advancements in remote-sensing and data analytics provides new opportunities for further research on wetland monitoring and assessment across various scales.

TI  - The Center for Regional and Tribal Child Welfare Studies: Systems change through a relational Anishinaabe worldview
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic overrepresentation of Indigenous families in North American governmental child welfare systems remains one of the most pressing and neglected issues facing Tribal Nations, child welfare policymakers and practitioners today. This paper is the third in a series of three papers (Authors) presenting an ethnographic study of the Center for Regional and Tribal Child Welfare Studies in the Department of Social Work, University of Minnesota - Duluth. The current paper focuses on the perspectives of the Center's staff and allies, which is grounded in an Anishinaabe worldview, on the process of systems change in child welfare. It draws upon indepth, semi-structured interviews with 13 participants with diverse roles and extended relationships with the Center. Participants provided knowledge and wisdom on how to create and sustain trusting, collaborative relationships within sovereign Tribal Nations, county and state child welfare systems. They described how Center staff members are then able to create bridges (mesosystems) across Indigenous communities and child welfare systems with the trust built within each of those systems. These mesosystems are sustained over time through continued opportunities for engagement and collaboration. These processes are illustrated through several case exemplars of change affected by the Center, tribes and their collaborators: state legislation to strengthen ICWA, implementation of statewide continuing education for child welfare professionals, and an innovative ICWA court. The primary barrier to system change noted by participants is structural racism. Advice for those motivated to support systems change includes establishing close links with Indigenous communities.

TI  - Extended blood group profiles for Malays, Chinese, and Indians in Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HUMAN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Blood group antigens are immunogenic polymorphic molecules presented on the surface of RBCs. This study aimed to determine extended blood group profiles (ABO, Rhesus, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, Cartwright, Dombrock, Colton, Lutheran, and Vel) in Malays, Chinese, and Indians in Peninsular Malaysia. Results Here, ABO Type O, DCCee, MNs, and Fy (a+b-) were the most frequent major blood group phenotypes in all three ethnic groups. Other minor blood group systems distributed differently across these ethnic groups, except for the Kell, Lutheran, Cartwright, and Vel blood group systems, where only K-k+, Lu (8+14), Yt (a+b-), and Vel (+) phenotypes were observed. Exact tests of population differentiation generally showed no significant differences between Malays included in the present study vs. other ethnically similar datasets from previous surveys. However, many significant differences were recorded in comparison between blood group datasets from ethnically unrelated populations (Malays vs. Chinese vs. Indians) especially for Rhesus, Kidd, and Duffy blood group systems. A Principal component analysis (PCA) plot showed that population groups from the Peninsular Malaysia map closely together as compared with population groups from other geographical regions. Conclusions Overall, our present study has successfully provided an extended blood group profiles for Malays, Chinese, and Indians in Peninsular Malaysia. These new blood group datasets can be used as guidelines for donor recruitment and as reference standards for studying diseases associated with blood group systems.

TI  - Impacts of land use changes and climate variability on transboundary Hirmand River using SWAT
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many river basins are facing a reduction of flows which might be attributed to changes in climate and human activities. This issue is very important in transboundary river basins, where already existing conflicts about shared water resources between riparian countries can easily escalate. The decrease of streamflow in the transboundary Hirmand (Helmand) River is one of the main challenges for water resources management in Iran and Afghanistan. This research aims to quantify the causes of this problem which has a direct impact on the dryness of the Hamoun wetlands being an international Ramsar site. To achieve this, the land use changes in the Middle Helmand Basin (MHB) in Afghanistan were evaluated for three time periods between 1990 and 2011 using remote sensing data and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) Model for understanding watershed response to environmental changes. It was concluded that the total irrigated area in the region has increased from 103,000 ha in 1990 to 122,000 ha in 2001 and 167,000 ha in 2011 (62% increase). According to the results, the average annual discharge when adapting the land use during the simulations was 4,787 million cubic meters (MCM)/year and while employing the land use of 1990 from the beginning of the simulations, the average annual discharge was 5,133 MCM/year. Therefore, the agricultural developments in the Helmand basin decreased the discharge with about 346 MCM/year accompanying an increase of 64,000 ha in an irrigated area in MHB after 1990. Notably, the impact of land use change increases significantly for more recent periods and causes a reduction of 810 MCM in annual streamflow for the MHB. The amount of water depletion (i.e. actual evapotranspiration) per hectare has increased from 5,690 in 1985 to 7,320 m(3) in 2012. The applied methodology of this study is useful to cope with such a data scarcity region. It can help quantify the impact of land use change on the region and formulates strategies that can improve the situation between Iran and Afghanistan.

T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the role of ancient and medieval Turkic written monuments in the study of modern Turkic languages. Being the sources of history, complex form of social life and institution, administrative and social hyerarchy, religion, and worldview of the Turkic peoples, they also give a possibility to trace the formation of the Turkic languages, their phonetic, lexical and grammatical systems. This study is based on descriptive, historical comparison, and comparative analysis methods. The methodology is a logical and philosophical theory applied to the historical development of language facts and addresses to the works of prominent turkologists in this aspect. For example, the history of agglutinative words system in Turkic languages, vowel prolongation and their types in Turkish phonetics, the problems arising in the learning of modern Turkish language vocabulary, the differentiation of syncretic affixes and adverbs.

TI  - GeoSentinel: past, present and future
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rationale for review: In response to increased concerns about emerging infectious diseases, GeoSentinel, the Global Surveillance Network of the International Society of Travel Medicine in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was established in 1995 in order to serve as a global provider-based emerging infections sentinel network, conduct surveillance for travel-related infections and communicate and assist global public health responses. This review summarizes the history, past achievements and future directions of the GeoSentinel Network.Key findings: Funded by the US CDC in 1996, GeoSentinel has grown from a group of eight US-based travel and tropical medicine centers to a global network, which currently consists of 68 sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel has provided important contributions that have enhanced the ability to use destination-specific differences to guide diagnosis and treatment of returning travelers, migrants and refugees. During the last two decades, GeoSentinel has identified a number of sentinel infectious disease events including previously unrecognized outbreaks and occurrence of diseases in locations thought not to harbor certain infectious agents. GeoSentinel has also provided useful insight into illnesses affecting different traveling populations such as migrants, business travelers and students, while characterizing in greater detail the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, leishmaniasis and Zika virus disease.Conclusions: Surveillance of travel-and migration-related infectious diseases has been the main focus of GeoSentinel for the last 25 years. However, GeoSentinel is now evolving into a network that will conduct both research and surveillance. The large number of participating sites and excellent geographic coverage for identification of both common and illnesses in individuals who have traversed international borders uniquely position GeoSentinel to make important contributions of travel-related infectious diseases in the years to come.

TI  - Environmental sensitivity of flash flood hazard using geospatial techniques
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood has been increasing in the Khartoum area, Sudan due to geographical conditions and climatic change as heavy rainfall and high temperature, therefore the present work tried to estimate the sensitivity of flash flood. The present work proposes an advanced technique of flood sensitivity mapping using the method of analytical hierarchy process. Ten factors as elevation, slope, distance from the network, land use, density of the drainage, flow accumulation, surface roughness, stream power index, topographic wetness index and curvature of the topography were digitized and then contributed in the mapping of Flash flood. Remote sensing data were integrated with analytical hierarchy process to determine the flood sensitive area in Sudan. The model was applied and completed as the consistency ratio was mostly reasonable (<0.1). Based on the proposed model, about 75.56 Km(2) (12.26 %), 156.14 Km(2) (25.33%), 169.89 Km(2) (27.56 %), 141.40 Km(2) (22.94 %) and 73.50 Km(2) (11.92 %); were classified as no susceptible, low susceptible, high susceptible, moderate susceptible and very highly susceptible to flooding. The present study showed a high variation in flood sensitivity due to climatic change and geographic condition. This index can be modified and applied in areas of the same characteristics of climatic conditions as one of the main recommendation in the study area. The study showed that poor infrastructure and lack of preparedness were the main causes of the disaster of flood in Sudan. This study merely demonstrated the critical analysis of geospatial mapping in proper mitigating, sustainable development and great monitoring the negative effects of flooding along the Khartoum region to reduce hazards of flood.

TI  - Mapping Burn Extent of Large Wildland Fires from Satellite Imagery Using Machine Learning Trained from Localized Hyperspatial Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires burn 4-10 million acres annually across the United States and wildland fire related damages and suppression costs have exceeded $13 billion for a single year. High-intensity wildfires contribute to post-fire erosion, degraded wildlife habitat, and loss of timber resources. Accurate and temporally adequate assessment of the effects of wildland fire on the environment is critical to improving the of wildland fire as a tool for restoring ecosystem resilience. Sensor miniaturization and small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) provide affordable, on-demand monitoring of wildland fire effects at a much finer spatial resolution than is possible with satellite imagery. The use of sUAS would allow researchers to obtain data with more detail at a much lower initial cost. Unfortunately, current regulatory and technical constraints prohibit the acquisition of imagery using sUAS for the entire extent of large fires. This research examined the use of sUAS imagery to train and validate burn severity and extent mapping of large wildland fires from various satellite images. Despite the lower resolution of the satellite image, the research utilized the advantages of satellite imagery such as global coverage, low cost, temporal stability, and spectral extent while leveraging the higher resolution of hyperspatial sUAS imagery for training and validating the mapping analytics.

TI  - Geological mapping of the Central Cairo-Suez District of Egypt, using space-borne optical and radar dataset
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Cairo-Suez District (CCSD) has a special urban extension, particularly the fast growth of the new Cairo and New Administration Capital of Egypt (NACE). Accurate discrimination of the lithology and surface and near-surface structures will be a valuable contribution to the geotechnical characterization of the foundation rocks and geohazards. The present work utilizes remote sensing datasets; including Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) scenes, Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data and highresolution images of Google Earth accompanied with field work to update the geological map and highlighting the information on the spatial lithological distribution and the faulting history of the CCSD. Radar data is utilized to make use of its penetration capabilities to image the possible near-surface structures and rock contacts. The PALSAR-2 data improved the surface and shallow structural imaging around Gebel Oweibed and in other selected subsets. The NW-striking shear faults in Quaternary sediments were recognized for the first time. Their recent activation has been proved by the recent seismic events. The False Color Composites (FCC), Band ratios (BR), Decorrelation Stretch (DS) image processing techniques have been successfully applied to differentiate between sandstones, shales, marls, carbonates, basalts, and gravels which represent eight lithological units of Middle Eocene to Quaternary time. The results were enhanced and mapped by supervised classification with accuracy assessment exceeding 88%. Integration of remote sensing data, previous mapping, and field check resulted in a more accurate mapping of the study area with new important modifications.& COPY; 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Establishing a National Molecular Surveillance Program for the Detection of <it>Plasmodium falciparum</it> Markers of Resistance to Antimalarial Drugs in Haiti
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chloroquine remains the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Haiti, and until recently, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was the second-line treatment. A few studies have reported the presence of molecular markers for resistance in Plasmodium falciparum parasites, and in vivo therapeutic efficacy studies (TESs) have been limited. Recognizing the history of antimalarial resistance around the globe and the challenges of implementing TESs in low-endemic areas, the Ministry of Health established a surveillance program to detect molecular markers of antimalarial resistance in Haiti. Sentinel sites were purposefully selected in each of Haiti's 10 administrative departments; an 11th site was selected in Grand'Anse, the department with the highest number of reported cases. Factors considered for site selection included the number of malaria cases identified, observed skills of laboratory technicians conducting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), stock and storage conditions of RDTs, accuracy of data reporting to the national surveillance system, and motivation to participate. Epidemiologic data from 2,437 patients who tested positive for malaria from March 2016 to December 2018 and consented to provide samples for molecular sequencing are presented here. Of these, 936 (38.4%) patients reported self-treatment with any medication since the onset of their illness before diagnosis; overall, 69 (2.8%) patients reported taking an antimalarial. Ten patients (0.4%) reported travel away from their home for at least one night in the month before diagnosis. Establishing a molecular surveillance program for antimalarial drug resistance proved practical and feasible in a resource-limited setting and will provide the evidence needed to make informed treatment policy decisions at the national level.

TI  - Linking an agro-meteorological model and a water cloud model for estimating soil water content over wheat fields
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought has great impact on crop yields. Soil water content can directly reflect the degree of agricultural drought. The Water Cloud Model (WCM) is a vegetation contribution model which has been widely used in soil water content retrieval over vegetated areas. However, when optical remote sensing images are absent or are of a poor quality due to cloud cover and haze, the WCM parameters, describing the characteristics of vegetation layer, are hard to obtain. In order to effectively retrieve the soil water content over wheat fields, an agro-meteorological model, Simple Algorithm For Yield estimate (SAFY) model, was introduced to simulate the daily values of the WCM parameters during the whole winter wheat growth stages. Firstly, the leaf area index (LAI), retrieved from two Sentinel-2 (high-resolution optical) satellite images, was used to calibrate the parameters of the SAFY model in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China. The calibrated SAFY model was applied to simulate daily LAI. Then, Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient, average ground measured soil water content from a depth of 0-12 cm and the simulated LAI were used to calibrate the WCM parameters to retrieve soil water content. In a final step, the soil water content retrieval results were validated at rain-fed and irrigated sampling sites, respectively. The SAFY model simulates the LAI of the Sentinel-1 sensing dates and uses it as an accurate vegetation description parameter for the WCM, which effectively solves the problem that the vegetation description parameter in the WCM cannot accurately describe the surface vegetation state at the time of radar satellite passing territory due to the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in the study area cannot be acquired on the same day, and thus improving the accuracy of the WCM soil water content retrieval. For all sampling sites, the soil water content retrieval results have a satisfactory overall accuracy, and the soil water content retrieval results from rain-fed sampling sites have better accuracy than those from irrigated sampling sites. The soil water content retrieval results at the harvesting stage of winter wheat have the best accuracy among the three field experiments (R-2 = 0.66; RMSE = 2.24%), followed by the tillering stage (R-2 = 0.56; RMSE = 2.56%) and jointing stage (R-2 = 0.36; RMSE = 2.74%). These results indicated that the combination of SAFY model and WCM can effectively retrieve the soil water content at different growth stages of winter wheat in the absence of optical remotely sensed images, and can provide significant benefit for soil water content retrieval over agricultural fields at the regional scale.

TI  - Soil Moisture Mapping Based on Multi-Source Fusion of Optical, Near-Infrared, Thermal Infrared, and Digital Elevation Model Data via the Bayesian Maximum Entropy Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a combined approach wherein the optical, near-infrared, and thermal infrared data from the Landsat 8 satellite and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) global digital elevation model (GDEM) data are fused for soil moisture mapping under sparse sampling conditions, based on the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) framework. The study was conducted in three stages. First, based on the maximum entropy principle of the information theory, a Lagrange multiplier was introduced to construct general knowledge, representing prior knowledge. Second, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to extract three principal components from the multi-source data mentioned above, and an innovative and operable discrete probability method based on a fuzzy probability matrix was used to approximate the probability relationship. Thereafter, soft data were generated on the basis of the weight coefficients and coordinates of the soft data points. Finally, by combining the general knowledge with the prior information, hard data (HD), and soft data (SD), we completed the soil moisture mapping based on the Bayesian conditioning rule. To verify the feasibility of the combined approach, the ordinary kriging (OK) method was taken as a comparison. The results confirmed the superiority of the soil moisture map obtained using the BME framework. The map revealed more detailed information, and the accuracies of the quantitative indicators were higher compared with that for the OK method (the root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.0423 cm(3)/cm(3), mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.0399 cm(3)/cm(3), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = 0.7846), while largely overcoming the overestimation issue in the range of low values and the underestimation issue in the range of high values. The proposed approach effectively fused inexpensive and easily available multi-source data with uncertainties and obtained a satisfactory mapping accuracy, thus demonstrating the potential of the BME framework for soil moisture mapping using multi-source data.

TI  - Lake Phenology of Freeze-Thaw Cycles Using Random Forest: A Case Study of Qinghai Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake phenology is essential for understanding the lake freeze-thaw cycle effects on terrestrial hydrological processes. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has the most extensive ice reserve outside of the Arctic and Antarctic poles and is a sensitive indicator of global climate changes. Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in the QTP, plays a critical role in climate change. The freeze-thaw cycles of lakes were studied using daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data ranging from 2000-2018 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Surface water/ice area, coverage, critical dates, surface water, and ice cover duration were extracted. Random forest (RF) was applied with a classifier accuracy of 0.9965 and a validation accuracy of 0.8072. Compared with six common water indexes (tasseled cap wetness (TCW), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), automated water extraction index (AWEI), water index 2015 (WI2015) and multiband water index (MBWI)) and ice threshold value methods, the critical freeze-up start (FUS), freeze-up end (FUE), break-up start (BUS), and break-up end (BUE) dates were extracted by RF and validated by visual interpretation. The results showed an R-2 of 0.99, RMSE of 3.81 days, FUS and BUS overestimations of 2.50 days, and FUE and BUE underestimations of 0.85 days. RF performed well for lake freeze-thaw cycles. From 2000 to 2018, the FUS and FUE dates were delayed by 11.21 and 8.21 days, respectively, and the BUS and BUE dates were 8.59 and 1.26 days early, respectively. Two novel key indicators, namely date of the first negative land surface temperature (DFNLST) and date of the first positive land surface temperature (DFPLST), were proposed to comprehensively delineate lake phenology: DFNLST was approximately 37 days before FUS, and DFPLST was approximately 20 days before BUS, revealing that the first negative and first positive land surface temperatures occur increasingly earlier.

TI  - Remote sensing of NO emission from light-duty diesel vehicle
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Motor vehicle emission remote sensing technology has achieved good application results in the field of gasoline vehicle emissions monitoring, but it is still immature in testing NOx and other gaseous emissions from diesel vehicles due to the large deviation of the tested results. In this paper, a conversion calculation method for remote sensing test data of diesel vehicle emissions is established. Based on the relative concentration ratios of various gaseous components in the exhaust plume of diesel vehicle and the excessive air coefficient of diesel engine under the test condition, the concentrations of various gaseous components emitted from diesel vehicle are obtained. The remote sensing results of NO and other gaseous emissions from the diesel vehicle under the conditions of idling and constant speeds are close to the tested results by PEMS verifying the correctness and feasibility of the conversion calculation method for remote sensing data of diesel vehicle emissions.

TI  - Predictors of subsequent injury at work: findings from a prospective cohort of injured workers in New Zealand
T2  - OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesPeople who have experienced a work-related injury can experience further work injuries over time. This study examines predictors of subsequent work-related injuries over 24 months among a cohort of injured workers.MethodsParticipants were those recruited to the earlier Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS) who had a work-related injury (the 'sentinel' injury). Data from POIS participant interviews were combined with administrative data from the Accident Compensation Corporation (New Zealand's no-fault universal injury insurer) and hospital discharge data. Modified Poisson regression modelling was used to examine whether presentinel injury sociodemographic and health, sentinel injury or presentinel injury work-related factors predicted subsequent work-related injuries.ResultsOver a third of participants (37%) had at least one subsequent work-related injury in 24 months. Factors associated with an increased risk of work-related subsequent injury included being in a job involving carrying or moving heavy loads more than half the time compared with those in jobs that never involved such tasks (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.01), having an inadequate household income compared with those with an adequate household income (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02 1.74) and being aged 50-64 years compared with those aged 30-49 years (RR 1.25, 95% 1.00 to 1.57).ConclusionSubsequent work-related injuries occur frequently, and presenting with a work-related injury indicates a potentially important intervention point for subsequent injury prevention. While the strength of associations were not strong, factors identified in this study that showed an increased risk of subsequent work-related injuries may provide a useful focus for injury prevention or rehabilitation attention.

TI  - Exploring climate change impacts during first half of the 21st century on flow regime of the transboundary Kabul River in the Hindukush region
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In transboundary river basins, climate change is being considered as a concern of higher degree than it is in other parts of the world. The Kabul River Basin, a sub-basin of the Indus River system shared by Pakistan and Afghanistan, is no exception. High level of sensitivity of its flow to temperature makes it imperative to analyse climate change impacts on the flow regime of this important river for efficient water resources management on both sides of the border. The snowmelt runoff model integrated with remote sensing snow cover product MODIS was selected to simulate daily discharges. Future projections were generated for two selected time slices, 2011-2030 (near future) and 2031-2050 (far future), based on output of an ensemble of four GCMs' RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Analysis shows a significant temperature increase under both scenarios in the near and far future at a high-altitude region of the basin which mostly receives snowfall that is also found increasing over time. Consequently, it causes a change in the flow regime and more frequent and heavier flooding events, thus calling for a joint strategy of the two riparian countries to mitigate the anticipated impacts in the basin for safety of people and overall prosperity.

The marshes of Iraq have been subjected to intentional desiccation and desertification several times. Detecting the water content of major Iraqi marshlands is the main scope of this study. Satellite imagery can be employed to assemble the data required for water, vegetation and dry area evaluation in marshlands. The assessment was performed using the adaptive technology of supervised classification that depends on the shade of each object's colour. Several types of Landsat satellite, MSS, TM, ETMthorn and OLI/TIRS and 64 satellite images were used to fulfil the objective. Results show that the classification of visual variations is the most suitable economical approach to detecting various environmental changes amongst the common methods. The 48 years in the marshes of Iraq (1972-2020) can be represented in two main stages. The increasing tendency in the second stage is nearly double the decreasing tendency in the first stage. The surface area in the first stage deteriorated dramatically until it reached the lowest level of approximately 432 km(2) in 2000 due to water encroachment and desiccation. Then, the area started to increase over time to approximately 4335 km(2) in the second stage towards the year 2020, except for sudden declines in 2015 and 2018. The average water surface for the first and second stages were 1877 and 2012 km(2), respectively.

TI  - Deep Learning for Detecting and Classifying Ocean Objects: Application of YoloV3 for Iceberg-Ship Discrimination
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) plays a remarkable role in ocean surveillance, with capabilities of detecting oil spills, icebergs, and marine traffic both at daytime and at night, regardless of clouds and extreme weather conditions. The detection of ocean objects using SAR relies on well-established methods, mostly adaptive thresholding algorithms. In most waters, the dominant ocean objects are ships, whereas in arctic waters the vast majority of objects are icebergs drifting in the ocean and can be mistaken for ships in terms of navigation and ocean surveillance. Since these objects can look very much alike in SAR images, the determination of what objects actually are still relies on manual detection and human interpretation. With the increasing interest in the arctic regions for marine transportation, it is crucial to develop novel approaches for automatic monitoring of the traffic in these waters with satellite data. Hence, this study aims at proposing a deep learning model based on YoloV3 for discriminating icebergs and ships, which could be used for mapping ocean objects ahead of a journey. Using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 data, we pilot-tested our approach on a case study in Greenland. Our findings reveal that our approach is capable of training a deep learning model with reliable detection accuracy. Our methodical approach along with the choice of data and classifiers can be of great importance to climate change researchers, shipping industries and biodiversity analysts. The main difficulties were faced in the creation of training data in the Arctic waters and we concluded that future work must focus on issues regarding training data.

TI  - Comparing earth observation and inundation models to map flood hazards
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global flood models (GFMs) and earth observation (EO) play a crucial role in characterising flooding, especially in data-sparse, under-resourced regions of the world. However, validation studies are often limited to a handful of historic events and do not directly assess the ability of these products to simulate flood hazard-the probability that flooding will occur in a given location. As a result, it is difficult for stakeholders to decipher the ability of either models or observations to identify flood hazard and make decisions to mitigate for flooding. Here, we leverage flood observations from 20 years of MODIS data to compare the recorded flooding with what would be expected given the hazard simulated by a GFM. We devise an approach, Flood Expectation Per Pixel, and apply it across four large basins in Africa-Congo, Niger, Nile and Volta representing a variety of biomes. We estimate the uncertainty of EO to capture flood events due to burned areas, cloud cover and vegetation, incorporating uncertainty estimates when comparing to modelled hazard. We found that at lower return periods (RPs) (<20 years), the EO data records less flooding than the GFM, suggesting GFMs overpredict frequent flooding. For RPs between 50 and 100 years, GFM and EO data show greater consistency given the uncertainties we consider. For large RPs (100 years) the EO observations show more flooding than expected given the GFM data, potentially due to data errors and non-fluvial flooding, however there are too few observations to draw significant conclusions at these RPs. The EO record indicates that the GFM can differentiate between flood RPs. We find EO and GFM complement each other and thus should be used in tandem to inform strategies to mitigate floods across the hazard spectrum from frequent to extreme flood events.

T2  - Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The patient was a 79-year-old woman with a left breast mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic mass with a diameter of 10*8 cm and an ulcer in the upper outer quadrant and the nipple-areola region of the left breast. Intracystic carcinoma was thus suspected. A mass with a diameter of 1 cm was found in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Needle biopsy revealed that a cystic mass in the left breast was diagnosed as a malignant phyllodes tumor. A mass in the right breast was diagnosed as Luminal A breast cancer. The clinical tumor stage was T1N0M0. Computed tomography showed no enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes. In the left breast, mastectomy was performed with extensive skin excision above the tumor. In the right breast, partial mastectomy was performed with sentinel lymph node biopsy. On postoperative pathological examination, the diagnosis of left breast tumor was triple-negative spindle-cell carcinoma. The pathological tumor stage was diagnosed as T4bNxM0. Taking into consideration treatment according to breast cancer stage and age, we selected 4 courses of weekly-paclitaxel, endocrine therapy, irradiation to the left chest wall, and irradiation to the residual right breast. The preoperative diagnosis was malignant phyllodes tumor. The postoperative diagnosis was switched from malignant phyllodes tumor to spindle-cell carcinoma. It was therefore difficult to determine the presence or absence of additional resection and postoperative treatment regimens. Even though the preoperative diagnosis was a malignant phyllodes tumor, surgical procedures such as sentinel lymph-node biopsy should be considered, taking into account the possibility of breast cancer.

TI  - Room for improvement: A review and evaluation of 24 soil thermal conductivity parameterization schemes commonly used in land-surface, hydrological, and soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Effective thermal conductivity of soils (lambda(eff)) is a critical parameter for agriculture, environment science, and engineering. Functions to estimate lambda(eff) from readily available soil properties, known as soil thermal conductivity (STC) schemes, are needed by land-surface models (LSMs), hydrological models, and soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models to study the land surface energy balance, heat flux, and soil thermal regime under various climates and geographic regions. The selection of a STC scheme can result in large differences in temperature estimates in LSMs, sometimes masking the effects of climate change. Therefore, accurate selection of a STC scheme is critically important to LSM estimates. Although a number of STC schemes have been incorporated in various LSMs, no study has systematically evaluated their performance. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to review and evaluate STC schemes employed by LSMs by comparing (1) predicted and measured STCs and (2) modelled land surface temperature (LST) using the Community Land Model at three selected sites and the corresponding LST data from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS). In total, 24 STC schemes were collated from 38 mainstream LSMs, SVAT, and hydrological models. They were divided into three categories based on model types: one physically-based scheme, eight linear/non-linear regression schemes, and 13 normalized schemes. We also include two schemes that express STC as a function of matric potential (psi, hereafter referred as lambda(eff), (psi) schemes). The first three types of STC schemes were evaluated with a large compiled dataset consisting of 439 unfrozen and frozen measurements of lambda(eff) from 16 soils. The lambda(eff) (psi) schemes were evaluated with simultaneously measured lambda(eff) (psi) from eight soils from two separate or independent studies. Results showed that none of the STC schemes could be used to accurately predict lambda(eff) for all soil types. STC scheme performance largely depended on the size (number of samples) and characteristics (e.g., soil types) of the data used for comparison. Some STC schemes work well on certain types of soils, but care should be taken for larger scale applications. LSM simulated LST for 24 STC schemes varied when compared with MODIS LST. In general, the STC schemes performed better in medium- and coarse-textured soils than in fine-textured soils. However, large discrepancies were observed on the estimated LST using different STC schemes for medium and coarse-textured soils. We recommend that LSM modelers be mindful of the inherent bias in STC schemes on the surface temperature estimates and hence overall model predictions. Orchestrated efforts are urgently needed on the part of the soil science, hydrology, and climatology communities to develop a more extensive and systematic lambda(eff) database for development and evaluation of improved STC schemes for wider and more accurate applications.

TI  - Development and evaluation of regional SST regression algorithms for FY-3C/VIRR data in the western north pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been one of the most main methods to acquire the sea surface temperature (SST). In this study, the new regional algorithms to estimate SST in the western north Pacific are developed using the data from the visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR) aboard the Chinese FengYun-3 C (FY-3 C) meteorological satellite. The new regional algorithms are based on the nonlinear SST (NLSST) and triple window NLSST (TNLSST), and improve the accuracy of SST by adding atmospheric correction terms to the original forms of NLSST and TNLSST. For discriminating the original algorithms, the new regional algorithms are named as corrected NLSST (CNLSST) and corrected TNLSST (CTNLSST), respectively. The regional SST algorithms are evaluated with in-situ data in the western north Pacific. Compared with NLSST, CNLSST reduces the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 0.0259 degrees C and 0.6376 degrees C to 0.0162 degrees C and 0.6185 degrees C at daytime, and from -0.0348 degrees C and 0.6365 degrees C to -0.0291 degrees C and 0.6036 degrees C at night. Also, with comparison to TNLSST, CTNLSST reduces the bias and RMSE from -0.0822 degrees C and 0.5691 degrees C to -0.0550 degrees C and 0.5424 degrees C.

TI  - Brazil's Amazon Soy Moratorium reduced deforestation
T2  - NATURE FOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2004 and 2012, multiple policies contributed to one of the great conservation successes of the twenty-first century-an 84% decrease in the rate of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring.Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.

TI  - Hungarian adaptation and launch of the 2019 ARIA care pathways of allergic rhinitis in Hungary
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of allergic patients is increasing all over the world, also in Hungary. Delivering effective and cost-effective health care is essential for all health care systems. ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) aims to improve the care of patients who suffer from allergic rhinitis by setting up guidelines and updating them. Development of ICPs (integrated care pathways) can play an essential role in attaining this goal. Our aim is to make ICP-s developed by ARIA available also in Hungary, as is already the case in other countries of the European Union (EU). Together with other international initiatives, ARIA has worked out digitally-enabled ICPs to support care in allergic rhinitis and comorbid asthma. ICPs are based on new-generation guidelines using RWE (real-world evidence) from chamber studies and mobile technology. The MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK) algorithm - based on visual analogue scale - was digitalized to support pharmacotherapy, and was refined by using RWE. ARIA was the first to develop ICPs for allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in 2019. Based on MASK data, patients did not follow guidelines and their adherence to treatment was poor. Patients would modify their treatments, depending on the disease control. The effect of fluticasone propionate-azelastine combination is superior to intranasal corticosteroids which are superior to oral H-1-antihistamines. Electronic diaries obtained from cell phones and other 'mobile health' (mHealth) devices help select patients for AIT. The ARIA algorithm for AR was found appropriate and no change is necessary. These guidelines will inform ICPs and will be included in the DG Sante digitally-enabled, person-centred care system. AIT is an effective treatment for allergic diseases caused by inhaled allergens. Its use should, however, be restricted to carefully selected patients.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Drought and Impact on Vegetation in North and West Africa Based on Multi-Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the significant impacts of drought on vegetation is crucial to understand its dynamics and interrelationships with precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature. In North and West Africa regions, the effects of drought on vegetation have not been clearly stated. Therefore, the present study aims to bring out the drought fluctuations within various types of Land Cover (LC) (Grasslands, Croplands, Savannas, and Forest) in North and West Africa regions. The drought characteristics were evaluated by analyzing the monthly Self-Calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) in different timescale from 2002 to 2018. Then, the frequency of droughts was examined over the same period. The results have revealed two groups of years (dry years and normal years), based on drought intensity. The selected years were used to compare the shifting between vegetation and desert. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), and the Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) were also used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of drought and to determine which LC class was more vulnerable to drought risk. Our results revealed that Grasslands and Croplands in the West region, and Grasslands, Croplands, and Savannas in the North region are more sensitive to drought. A higher correlation was observed among the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Soil Moisture (SM). Our findings suggested that NDVI, TRMM, and SM are more suitable for monitoring drought over the study area and have a reliable accuracy (R-2 > 0.70) concerning drought prediction. The outcomes of the current research could, explicitly, contribute progressively towards improving specific drought mitigation strategies and disaster risk reduction at regional and national levels.

TI  - Molecular analysis of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer using one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA): Does not lead to overtreatment in the current era of de-escalating axillary management
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: OSNA is a molecular technique for sentinel lymph node (SN) analysis in breast cancer. Compared to histology, OSNA may yield more (micro)metastases and thereby result in more axillary lymph node dissections or radiotherapy. We investigated whether axillary treatments increase when using OSNA, applying current guidelines for de-escalating axillary management.Methods: All patients treated for cT1-3N0 breast cancer in our hospital between December 2013 and February 2016 were included. In 148 prospectively included patients (January 2015-February 2016), SN's were examined with OSNA. In a retrospective cohort of 123 patients (December 2013-December 2014), SN's were examined with conventional histology. Outcomes were: number of macro and micrometastases, amount of patients receiving axillary dissection or irradiation, number of patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Pearson Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: 230 SN's from 123 patients were examined with conventional histology. 229 SN's from 148 patients were evaluated with OSNA. Amount of macrometastases was equal between groups (histology 17.9% versus OSNA 16.2%, p = 0.715). We found significantly more micrometastases when using OSNA (histology 11.4% versus OSNA 25.0%, p = 0.004). Total number of axillary lymph node dissections was comparable in both groups (histology 12.2%, OSNA 12.2%, p = 0.993), as well as number of axillary radiations (histology 8.9%, OSNA 11.5%, p = 0.493). Also, the number of patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy was similar between conventional histology and OSNA (histology 53.7% versus OSNA 58.1%, p = 0.462).Conclusion: OSNA analysis for SN in breast cancer is a highly sensitive technique, detecting more micrometastases than standard histology. When applying current guidelines, OSNA analysis does not lead to overtreatment with more axillary dissections or irradiation.

TI  - Initial Assessment of the COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Neutral Atmosphere Data Quality in NESDIS/STAR Using In Situ and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A COSMIC-1/FORMOSAT-3 (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-1 and Formosa Satellite Mission 3) follow-on mission, COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7, had been successfully launched into low-inclination orbits on 25 June 2019. COSMIC-2 has a significantly increased Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) compared to other Radio Occultation (RO) missions. This study summarized the initial assessment of COSMIC-2 data quality conducted by the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR). We use validated data from other RO missions to quantify the stability of COSMIC-2. In addition, we use the Vaisala RS41 radiosonde observations to assess the accuracy and uncertainty of the COSMIC-2 neutral atmospheric profiles. RS41 is currently the most accurate radiosonde observation system. The COSMIC-2 SNR ranges from 200 v/v to about 2800 v/v. To see if the high SNR COSMIC-2 signals lead to better retrieval results, we separate the COSMIC-2-RS41 comparisons into different SNR groups (i.e., 0-500 v/v group, 500-1000 v/v group, 1000-1500 v/v group, 1500-2000 v/v group, and >2000 v/v group). In general, the COSMIC-2 data quality in terms of stability, precision, accuracy, and uncertainty of the accuracy is very compatible with those from COSMIC-1. Results show that the mean COSMIC-2-RS41 water vapor difference from surface to 5 km altitude for each SNR groups are equal to -1.34 g/kg (0-500 v/v), -1.17 g/kg (500-1000 v/v), -1.33 g/kg (1000-1500 v/v), -0.93 g/kg (1500-2000 v/v), and -1.52 g/kg (>2000 v/v). Except for the >2000 v/v group, the high SNR measurements from COSMIC-2 seem to improve the mean water vapor difference for the higher SNR group slightly (especially for the 1500-2000 v/v group) comparing with those from lower SNR groups.

TI  - Malaria Exposure in Ann Township, Myanmar, as a Function of Land Cover and Land Use: Combining Satellite Earth Observations and Field Surveys
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite progress toward malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion, challenges remain owing to the emergence of drug resistance and the persistence of focal transmission reservoirs. Malaria transmission foci in Myanmar are heterogeneous and complex, and many remaining infections are clinically silent, rendering them invisible to routine monitoring. The goal of this research is to define criteria for easy-to-implement methodologies, not reliant on routine monitoring, that can increase the efficiency of targeted malaria elimination strategies. Studies have shown relationships between malaria risk and land cover and land use (LCLU), which can be mapped using remote sensing methodologies. Here we aim to explain malaria risk as a function of LCLU for five rural villages in Myanmar's Rakhine State. Malaria prevalence and incidence data were analyzed through logistic regression with a land use survey of similar to 1,000 participants and a 30-m land cover map. Malaria prevalence per village ranged from 5% to 20% with the overwhelming majority of cases being subclinical. Villages with high forest cover were associated with increased risk of malaria, even for villagers who did not report visits to forests. Villagers living near croplands experienced decreased malaria risk unless they were directly engaged in farm work. Finally, land cover change (specifically, natural forest loss) appeared to be a substantial contributor to malaria risk in the region, although this was not confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Overall, this study demonstrates that remotely sensed data contextualized with field survey data can be used to inform critical targeting strategies in support of malaria elimination.

TI  - Wetland Hydroperiod Change Along the Upper Columbia River Floodplain, Canada, 1984 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing air temperatures and changing hydrological conditions in the mountainous Kootenay Region of British Columbia, Canada are expected to affect floodplain wetland extent and function along the Columbia River. The objective of this study was to determine the seasonally inundated hydroperiod for a floodplain section (28.66 km(2)) of the Upper Columbia River wetlands complex using time series satellite image observations and binary open water mask extraction. A mid pixel resolution (30 m) optical satellite image time series of 61 clear sky scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors were used to map temporal variations in floodplain open water wetland extent during the April to October hydrologically active season from 1984 to 2019 (35 years). The hydroperiod from the first 31 scenes (T1: 18 years) was compared to the second 30 (T2: 16 years) to identify changes in the permanent and seasonal open water bodies. The seasonal variation in open water extent and duration was similar across the two time periods but the permanent water body extent diminished by similar to 16% (or similar to 3.5% of the floodplain). A simple linear model (r(2) = 0.87) was established to predict floodplain open water extent as a function of river discharge downstream of the case study area. Four years of Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data from 1992 to 1995 (12 scenes) were examined to evaluate the feasibility of extending the hydroperiod record back to 1972 using lower resolution (60 m) archive data. While the MSS hydroperiod produced a similar pattern of open water area to duration to the TM/OLI hydroperiod, small open water features were omitted or expanded due to the lower resolution. While MSS could potentially extend the TM/OLI hydroperiod record, this was not performed as the loss of features like the river channel diminished its value for change detection purposes. Radarsat 2 scenes from 2015 to 2019 were examined to evaluate the feasibility of continued mountain valley hydroperiod monitoring using higher spatial and temporal resolution sensors like the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM). From the available horizontal transmit/receive (HH) single polarization sample set (8 scenes), the hydroperiod pattern of open water extent to duration was similar to the longer Landsat time series and possessed greater feature detail, but it was significantly reduced in seasonal inundation area due to the systematic omission of open water areas containing emergent vegetation. However, accepting that differences exist in sensor-based hydroperiod attributes, the higher temporal resolution of RCM will be suited to mountain floodplain inundation monitoring and open water hydroperiod analysis.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of the 2020 Iowa Derecho on Corn and Soybean Fields Using Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 10 August 2020, a series of intense and fast-moving windstorms known as a derecho caused widespread damage across Iowa's (the top US corn-producing state) agricultural regions. This severe weather event bent and flattened crops over approximately one-third of the state. Immediate evaluation of the disaster's impact on agricultural lands, including maps of crop damage, was critical to enabling a rapid response by government agencies, insurance companies, and the agricultural supply chain. Given the very large area impacted by the disaster, satellite imagery stands out as the most efficient means of estimating the disaster impact. In this study, we used time-series of Sentinel-1 data to detect the impacted fields. We developed an in-season crop type map using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data to assess the impact on important commodity crops. We intersected a SAR-based damage map with an in-season crop type map to create damaged area maps for corn and soybean fields. In total, we identified 2.59 million acres as damaged by the derecho, consisting of 1.99 million acres of corn and 0.6 million acres of soybean fields. Also, we categorized the impacted fields to three classes of mild impacts, medium impacts and high impacts. In total, 1.087 million acres of corn and 0.206 million acres of soybean were categorized as high impacted fields.

TI  - USRT: A Solar Radiative Transfer Model Dedicated to Estimating Urban 3D Surface Reflectance
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban 3D surface reflectance is a critical parameter for the modeling of surface biophysical processes. It is of great significance to enhance the accuracy of reflectance in urban areas. Based on the urban solar radiative transfer (USRT) model, this study presents a methodology for estimating urban reflectance using the sky view factor (SVF) derived from airborne LiDAR data. Then, the USRT model was used to retrieve urban 3D surface reflectance from Landsat 8 data over the typical area of Beijing. The reflectance from USRT model was compared with the estimated value obtained from the model without considering the impact of morphological characteristics of the urban underlying surface (flat model). The results showed that the urban sample reflectance estimated by the USRT model was close to the sample reflectance of the suburban underlying surface which was less affected by morphological characteristics. The research summaries are as follows: (1) The definite physical meaning is presented in the USRT model, and can be applied to estimate the physical parameters of the urban underlying surface. (2) The reflectance from the USRT model is slightly larger than the reflectance derived from the flat model, which indicates that the accuracy of urban 3D surface reflectance is improved by the USRT model. (3) The effects of the SVF and building reflectance are di fferent. The SVF presents a strong sensitivity to the estimation of the urban 3D surface reflectance, and the variations of building reflectance setting have little impact on urban reflectance, which is characterized by low sensitivity. Generally, the methodology of estimating urban reflectance proposed in this study can better clarify the impact mechanism of urban geometry on the radiative transfer processes and further promote the application and development of urban quantitative remote sensing.

TI  - Annual Forest Disturbance Detection Using Time Series Landsat 8 OLI Data
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Using Improved Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm to detect the annual forest disturbance in subtropical area of south China. [Method] Annual cloud-free images of the study area in growing season were composited using multi-time series Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing data from 2013 to 2019, then the Integrated Forest Z-score (IFZ) was extracted automatically by identifying the potential forest pixels and combining with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the occurring time of forest disturbance was determined through observing the changes of IFZ in time series, and the specific contents of forest change were analyzed further. [Result] The results obtained at Gaofeng Forest Farm of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region showed that the detection accuracy of the forest disturbance areas by combining IFZ with NDVI was improved to 79.2% from 67.2%. [Conclusion] The forest disturbance detection method of IFZ combining with NDVI can not only increase the error detection but also reduce the missed detection rate of the VCT method. It optimizes the problem of high missed detection rate in rapidly change areas and characterizes the spatial and temporal pattern of the forest areas in Gaofeng Forest Farm more accurately.

TI  - Detecting regional GPP variations with statistically downscaled solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) based on GOME-2 and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is associated with vegetation canopy photosynthesis and is potentially used to retrieve Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). However, the coarse resolutions of the currently available SIF satellite data limit their applications. To expand the applicability of the SIF dataset, a framework was developed to disaggregate the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) SIF dataset, which was based on statistical relationships between SIF and remotely sensed measurements of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(PAR)), the soil moisture index and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The statistical relationships were established within a zone ofnx npixels (n is an element of[1, 25]) with a moving window technique. The regression function established withinnx npixels with the smallest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and highest coefficient of determination (R-2) was selected for downscaling regression. Compared with the fixed window technique (n= 5) and theglobal regression model, the moving window technique presented low residuals and highR(2)values. Validated with flux-tower eddy covariance measurements, the GPP retrieved within the downscaled SIF data shows the potential to improve vegetation GPP prediction, and the downscaled SIF could trace the seasonal phenology of evergreen forests.

TI  - Satellite identification of atmospheric-surface-subsurface urban heat islands under clear sky
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is a major topic in the study of urban climates. However, comprehensive research on the atmospheric UHI (UHIAtm), surface UHI (UHISurf), and subsurface UHI (UHISub) simultaneously has yet not been reported. Using the MODIS land surface temperature and atmospheric profile data during the 2010-2016 period, we investigated the diurnal, seasonal, and vertical variations of UHIAtm, UHISurf, and UHISub in Beijing. The major findings include but are not limited to the following: As the altitude increases from 1000 hPa (near the surface) to 700 hPa (similar to 3 km), the daytime UHIAtm intensity in summer decreases piecewise linearly with a rapid decline above 850 hPa (similar to 1.5 km), while in spring and autumn it decreases after a slight increase in the lower atmosphere. The nighttime UHIAtm intensity decreases approximately linearly in all seasons with a rapid (gra-dual) decline in winter (summer). As the depth increases from the surface to similar to 0.2 m, the daytime intensity from UHISurf to UHISub decreases in summer but increases in the other seasons, while the nighttime trends are opposite to the daytime ones. The diurnal (seasonal) variation of UHISub intensity converges to the daily (annual) mean as the depth reaches similar to 0.5 m (10 m). These new findings have theoretical and practical implications for in-depth understanding of the urban thermal environment from the boundary layer to the subsurface.

TI  - Regional Characteristics of Cloud Radiative Effects before and after the South China Sea Summer Monsoon Onset
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) onset is characterized by rapid thermodynamical changes in the atmosphere that are critical to regional weather and climate processes. So far, few studies have focused on the changes in the associated cloud and radiative features. This study investigates spatiotemporal characteristics of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) cloud radiative effects (CREs) before and after the SCSSM onset over the South China Sea (SCS) and South China (SC), based on the 2001-2016 Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) satellite data and ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Before the SCSSM onset, strong net CRE (NCRE) dominated by its cooling shortwave component occurs over SC, while descending motion and weak NCRE prevail over the SCS. In the SCSSM onset pentad, convection, high clouds, and longwave and shortwave CREs (LWCRE and SWCRE) abruptly increase over the southern and central SCS, and their high-value centers subsequently move northeastward and are strongly affected by the western Pacific subtropical high. The strong offset between LWCRE and SWCRE enables the NCRE intensity (TOA radiation budget) to be quite small (large) between the SCS and the western North Pacific after the SCSSM onset. In contrast, low-middle-level clouds and strong cooling SWCRE remain over SC after the SCSSM onset, but the increasing high clouds and LWCRE weaken (intensify) the regional NCRE (TOA radiation budget) intensity. These marked latitudinal differences in CREs between the SCS and SC primarily arise from their respective dominant cloud types and circulation conditions, which manifest the differences between the tropical SCSSM and subtropical East Asian monsoon processes. The results indicate that regional cloud fractions and CREs before and after the SCSSM onset are strongly modulated by quickly changed large-scale circulation over the East Asian monsoon regions, and the spatiotemporal variation of CREs is a response to the monsoonal circulation adjustment to a large extent.

TI  - The spectrum of pathological diagnoses in non-sentinel axillary lymph node biopsy: A single institution's experience
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although axillary lymphadenopathy is a common clinical encounter, systemic evaluation of non-sentinel lymph node biopsy is sparse. We reviewed our institution's 15-year experience to delineate the spectrum of diagnoses in non-sentinel axillary lymph nodes. 1165 non-sentinel axillary lymph node biopsies were retrieved and the diagnosis and relevant clinical information was reviewed. This spectrum of diagnoses was further stratified by gender, age, and oncologic history. The spectrum of diagnoses included: breast carcinoma (27.6%), lymphoma (29.2%), melanoma (3.5%), other carcinoma (2.9%), sarcoma (0.4%), and benign changes (36.3%). The most common diagnoses in men were lymphoma (61.8%) and benign changes (23.6%); while in women they were benign change (41.2%), breast carcinoma (37.8%) and lymphoma (16.7%). Besides benign changes, lymphoma and breast carcinoma were most common in women younger and older than 30 years, respectively. In patients with a history of malignancy, the most common diagnoses were metastasis from the known tumor and benign change; while in patients with a negative oncologic history and female patients without a history of breast cancer, the diagnosis was generally either lymphoma or benign change. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma was rare but may be mistaken as metastatic carcinoma thus a high index of suspicion is warranted. Thus through retrospective review of a large cohort of non-sentinel axillary lymph node biopsies, we described the spectrum of pathological entities based on the gender, age, and clinical history, which could provide valuable information for further work-up of axillary lymph node biopsy.

TI  - A Quantile Approach for Retrieving the "Core Urban-Suburban-Rural" (USR) Structure Based on Nighttime Light
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on the "core urban-suburban-rural" (USR) spatial structure in a metropolitan region is significant for both the scientific and policy-making communities. However, USR is usually considered as a single land use type, such as an impervious area, rather than three combined subcategories in remote-sensing image retrieval, especially for suburban areas, which obscures the details of the urbanization process. In this paper, we propose a quantile approach to retrieve the structure of USR based on stable nighttime light (NTL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) and apply it in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ) of China from 1995 to 2013. The key parameters of the NTL threshold, which is the maximum change point of the NTL intensity at the USR boundary, used to retrieve the three subcategories of USR are automatically defined based on the quantile approach with three iterations. Then, the overall accuracy and consistency of the retrieval results are evaluated using the corresponding visual interpretation map from Landsat images with a 30 m resolution. Moreover, the influence of parameter uncertainty is compared by introducing the human settlement index (HSI). According to the time-series analysis of USR retrieval in this study, the JJJ experienced rapid urbanization from 1995 to 2013, with the core urban area expanding by 7098 km(2) (average increase of 2.7 times), the suburban area expanding by 12,690 km(2) (average increase of 2.8 times), and the rural area increasing by 4986 km(2) (average increase of 0.38 times). The USR results retrieved based on the approach agree well with the validation of the visual interpretation map, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.904 and a kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.650 at the city level. The USR result with the HSI as the input shows that NTL is more suitable for USR structure retrieval as the NTL shows less uncertainty compared with other parameters such as the vegetation index (VI). This study proposes an improved quantile approach for USR mapping from NTL images on a regional scale, which will provide a useful method for urbanization dynamics analysis.

AB  - Background and Objectives Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) did not improve melanoma-specific survival for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma in the second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II). We assessed surgeons' awareness of MSLT-II and its impact on CLND recommendations.Methods An anonymous online cross-sectional survey of the Society of Surgical Oncology membership evaluated surgeon thresholds in offering CLND using patient scenarios and clinicopathologic characteristics ranking.Results Of the 2881 e-mails delivered, 146 surgeons (5.1%) completed all seven scenarios. Most (129 of 131, 98%) were aware of MSLT-II and 125 (95%) found it practice-changing. Specifically, 52% (65 of 125) always, 40% usually, 6% rarely, and 3% never offered CLND before MSLT-II. Meanwhile, 4% always, 9% usually, 78% rarely, and 8% never offer CLND now, after MSLT-II (p < .0001). The most important clinicopathologic factors in determining CLND recommendations were extracapsular extension, number of positive SLN, and SLN tumor deposit size, while primary tumor mitotic index and nodal basin location were the least important. Surgical oncology fellowship training, melanoma patient volume, and academic center practice also influenced CLND recommendations.Conclusions Most surgeon respondents are aware of MSLT-II, but its application in practice varies according to several clinicopathologic and surgeon factors.

TI  - Parameter Optimization for Uncertainty Reduction and Simulation Improvement of Hydrological Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modeling has experienced rapid development and played a significant role in water resource management in recent decades. However, modeling uncertainties, which are propagated throughout model runs, may affect the credibility of simulation results and mislead management decisions. Therefore, analyzing and reducing uncertainty is of significant importance in providing greater confidence in hydrological simulations. To reduce and quantify parameter uncertainty, in this study, we attempted to introduce additional remotely sensed data (such as evapotranspiration (ET)) into a common parameter estimation procedure that uses observed streamflow only. We undertook a case study of an application of the Soil Water Assessment Tool in the Guijiang River Basin (GRB) in China. We also compared the effects of different combinations of parameter estimation algorithms (e.g., Sequential Uncertainty Fitting version 2, particle swarm optimization) on reduction in parameter uncertainty and improvement in modeling precision improvement. The results indicated that combining Sequential Uncertainty Fitting version 2 (SUFI-2) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) can substantially reduce the modeling uncertainty (reduction in the R-factor from 0.9 to 0.1) in terms of the convergence of parameter ranges and the aggregation of parameters, in addition to iterative optimization. Furthermore, the combined approaches ensured the rationality of the parameters' physical meanings and reduced the complexity of the model calibration procedure. We also found the simulation accuracy of ET improved substantially after adding remotely sensed ET data. The parameter ranges and optimal parameter sets obtained by multi-objective calibration (using streamflow plus ET) were more reasonable and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) improved more rapidly using multiple objectives, indicating a more efficient parameter optimization procedure. Overall, the selected combined approach with multiple objectives can help reduce modeling uncertainty and attain a reliable hydrological simulation. The presented procedure can be applied to any hydrological model.

TI  - Environmental land-cover classification for integrated watershed studies: Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thematic maps developed from remote sensing data are extremely useful for designing intensive field studies, particularly for large areas that are logistically challenging to access. The integrated watershed studies at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut, rely heavily on land cover for establishing sampling locations regardless of the type of research being conducted (e.g., permafrost degradation, greenhouse gas exchange, surface water chemistry, etc.). Here, we present an environmental land-cover classification of the CBAWO that was developed through an iterative process employing parametric and non-parametric classification algorithms applied to WorldView-2 satellite data and topographic variables. The support vector machine classification of eight-band WorldView-2 spectral data and a topographic wetness index produced the highest classification accuracy for eight land-cover classes (overall classification accuracy: 90.7%; Kappa coefficient (k): 0.89). This analysis also provided a more precise classification scheme, particularly in the context of the relationship between vegetation type and moisture regime. The environmental land-cover classification derived will better inform future integrated studies of the watershed and allow for upscaling of site-level characteristics to the watershed-scale using the updated vegetation classes.

TI  - Small-scale surface mining of gold placers: Detection, mapping, and temporal analysis through the use of free satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Informal small-scale mining is spread in many countries and provides livelihood to numerous families in rural areas yet often with devastating social and environmental impacts. The alluvial gold mining process in Colombia, also known as placer mining, involves excavations using heavy machinery and creates large footprints of bare soil and mining ponds. The very dynamic nature of this extractive activity and its spread in rural and remote areas make its mapping and monitoring very challenging. The use of freely available satellite data of the Copernicus programme provides great new possibilities to study these activities and provides stakeholders integrated data to better understand the spatial and temporal extent of the activities and mitigate affected areas. The objective of this work is to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 data to identify mining areas and to understand the dynamics in landcover change over a study area located at the border of the municipalities of El Bagre and Zaragoza in Bajo Cauca, Colombia. The study utilizes a classification approach followed by post-processing using field knowledge on a set of images from 2016 to 2019. Sequential pattern mining of classified images shows the likelihood of certain annual and seasonal changes in mining-impacted landcover and in the natural vegetation. The results show a slight reduction in the detected mining areas from 2016 to 2019. On the other hand, there are more mining activities in the dry season than in the wet season. Excavated areas of bare soil have a 50% chance to remain in excavation over the considered period or they transition to non-vegetated areas or mining ponds. Vegetation loss due to the extractive activities corresponds to about 35% while recovered vegetated areas are 7% of the total excavated areas in June 2019. An analysis of abandoned sites using NDVI shows that it takes a much longer period than the one considered in this paper for potential natural recovery of vegetation. Finally, the work was disseminated among stakeholders and the public on MapX (https://mapx.org), an online open platform for mapping and visualizing geospatial data on natural resources. It is a pilot study the will be the basis of the analysis of more regions in the department of Antioquia.

TI  - Narrow band based and broadband derived vegetation indices using Sentinel-2 Imagery to estimate vegetation biomass
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest's ecosystem is one of the most important carbon sink of the terrestrial ecosystem. Remote sensing technology provides robust techniques to estimate biomass and solve challenges in forest resource assessment. The present study explored the potential of Sentinel-2 bands to estimate biomass and comparatively analyzed of red-edge band based and broadband derived vegetation indices. Broadband indices include normalized difference vegetation index, modified simple ratio and atmospherically resistant VI. Whereas, red-edge band indices include two red-edge normalized difference vegetation index and sentinel-2 red-edge position. Results showed that red-edge band derived spectral indices have performed better than the Broadband indices. The coefficient of correlation for normalized difference vegetation index, modified simple ratio and atmospherically resistant-VI was 0.51, 0.44 and 0.31 respectively, On the other hand, red-edge band indices showed higher correlation of R-2 0.62, 0.64 and 0.55, respectively. Similarly, in stepwise regression red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (using band 6) was selected in final model (as overall R-2 of the model was 0.60) while all other indices were removed because they have non-significant relationship with the biomass. Accuracy assessment shown the red-edge index has highest R2 (0.64) and least error of (31.29 t/ha) and therefore the study concluded that narrowband indices performed better to estimate biomass and thus final model contained only red-edge index to predict biomass over the study area. The study suggests that more in-depth research should be conducted to explore further properties of red-edge indices for vegetation parameters prediction. (c) 2020 GJESM. All rights reserved.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results are presented from research aimed at detecting natural seepage and oil seeps in the seas of Russia using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Real-time and archived data from such modern SAR-equipped satellites as Envisat, Radarsat-1/2, Sentinel-1A/1B, are indispensable material in searching, detecting, and studying natural oil seepage by observing oil slicks floating on the sea surface. They are used to detect oil seeps and natural petroleum hydrocarbon flows in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Barents Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. Using SAR imagery and the geoinformation (GIS) approach as well as bathymetric data and additional geological and geophysical information, oil seeps can be detected from space, their real position on the sea bottom determined, and additional information about the activity, frequency and volume of oil emissions obtained. As a result, regional oil and gas potential can be confirmed. This methodical approach can be used to search and detect similar phenomena in the seas worldwide, and the detection of new hydrocarbon sources using satellite images once again confirms its efficiency.

TI  - Spatial Resource Management in LEO Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems are known to have complicated spatial resource management. The problem occurs because of the impossibility to realize fully digital beamforming since its hardware implementation consumes too much power of the on-board battery. On another hand, analog beamforming can not provide enough system coverage in realistic user distribution scenarios. In this paper, we justify the choice of the hybrid multi-beamforming structure for some realistic user distributions. Such a structure guarantees enough coverage with minimal power consumption. For this structure, we propose a new spatial resource allocation intended to minimize handovers and to simplify the calculation of the time user spends inside each satellite beam spot. Numerical results with real system parameters are provided to confirm feasibility.

TI  - Structural Control of Gold Mineralization of the Central Part of the Malouralsky Volcano-Plutonic Belt (the Polar Urals), Based on an Analysis of Multispectral Images from the Landsat 8 Spacecraft
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The central part of the Malouralsky volcanic-plutonic belt, which includes the Manyukuyu-Vorchatinsky ore cluster, is analyzed using multispectral imagery from the Landsat-8 Earth remote sounding satellite with the aim of identifying gold deposits and compared with the Toupugol-Khanmeishor ore region. Similar features in the geological structure and location of deposits and ore deposits in the system of morphological structures are found that should help to develop predictive and prospecting indicators (geological and morphological) of gold mineralization. Three structures are distinguished via analysis of satellite images: the monogenic Novogodnenskaya structure (the Toupugol-Khanmeishorsky ore region) formed under the influence of one main geological process and morphostructures Nos. 1 and 2 (the central part of the Malouralsky volcanic-plutonic belt). These two structures are larger and more complex, with long multistage development. Magmatic chambers are located at depths of similar to 12 and similar to 16 km, respectively, for morphostructures Nos. 1 and 2; their root (focal) parts extended southward and then southwestward, respectively, during magmatic development. Prospecting for hydrothermal gold mineralization at the north of the eastern slope of the Polar Urals should be done at the periphery of the centers of large complex morphostructures with long and multistage development with signs of telescoping. Mineralization should be localized in areas of concentration of northwestern and/or northwestern lineaments and in regional fault zones that can be hundreds of kilometers long.

TI  - Carbon Emissions from Oil Palm Induced Forest and Peatland Conversion in Sabah and Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The palm oil industry is one of the major producers of vegetable oil in the tropics. Palm oil is used extensively for the manufacture of a wide variety of products and its production is increasing by around 9% every year, prompted largely by the expanding biofuel markets. The rise in annual demand for biofuels and vegetable oil from importer countries has caused a dramatic increase in the conversion of forests and peatlands into oil palm plantations in Malaysia. This study assessed the area of forests and peatlands converted into oil palm plantations from 1990 to 2018 in the states of Sarawak and Sabah, Malaysia, and estimated the resulting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. To do so, we analyzed multitemporal 30-m resolution Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images using a hybrid method that combined automatic image processing and manual analyses. We found that over the 28-year period, forest cover declined by 12.6% and 16.3%, and the peatland area declined by 20.5% and 19.1% in Sarawak and Sabah, respectively. In 2018, we found that these changes resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.01577 and 0.00086 Gt CO2-C yr(-1), as compared to an annual forest CO2 uptake of 0.26464 and 0.15007 Gt CO2-C yr(-1), in Sarawak and Sabah, respectively. Our assessment highlights that carbon impacts extend beyond lost standing stocks, and result in substantial direct emissions from the oil palm plantations themselves, with 2018 oil palm plantations in our study area emitting up to 4% of CO2 uptake by remaining forests. Limiting future climate change impacts requires enhanced economic incentives for land uses that neither convert standing forests nor result in substantial CO2 emissions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The objective of this study is to examine racial differences in receipt of low-value surgical care and time to surgery (TTS) among women receiving treatment at high-volume hospitals.Methods Stage I-III non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) breast cancer patients were identified in the National Cancer Database. Low-value care included (1) sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) among T1N0 patients age >= 70 with hormone receptor-positive cancers, (2) axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, and (3) contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) with unilateral cancer. TTS was days from biopsy to surgery. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the groups.Results Compared to NHWs, NHBs had lower rates of SLNB among women age >= 70 with small hormone-positive cancers (NHB 58.5% vs. NHW 62.2% p < .001) and CPM (NHB 26.3% vs. NHW 36%; p < .001). ALND rates for patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 criteria were similar between both groups (p = .13). The odds of surgery >60 days were higher among NHBs (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.64-1.91; NHW ref).Conclusions NHBs treated at high-volume hospitals have higher rates of surgical delay but are less likely to undergo low-value surgical procedures compared to NHW women.

TI  - The Benefits and Pitfalls of Using Satellite Data for Causal Inference
T2  - REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been growing interest in using satellite data in environmental economics research. This is because satellite data are available for any region across the globe, provide frequent data over time, are becoming available at lower cost, and are becoming easier to process. While satellite data have the potential to be a powerful resource, these data have their own sources of biases and error, which could lead to biased inference, even if analyses are otherwise well-identified. This article discusses the potential benefits and pitfalls of using satellite data for causal inference, focusing on the more technical aspects of using satellite data. In particular, I discuss why it is critical for researchers to understand the error distribution of a given satellite data product and how these errors may result in biased inference. I provide examples of some common types of error, including nonrandom misclassification, saturation effects, atmospheric effects, and cloud cover. If researchers recognize and account for these potential errors and biases, satellite data can be a powerful resource, allowing for large-scale analyses that would otherwise not be possible.

TI  - A Comparison of Two Machine Learning Classification Methods for Remote Sensing Predictive Modeling of the Forest Fire in the North-Eastern Siberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of forest fires in Yakutia is not as well studied as in other countries. Two methods of machine learning classifications were implemented to determine the risk of fire: MaxENT and random forest. The initial materials to define fire risk factors were satellite images and their products of various spatial and spectral resolution (Landsat TM, Modis TERRA, GMTED2010, VIIRS), vector data (OSM), and bioclimatic variables (WORLDCLIM). The results of the research showed a strong human influence on the risk in this region, despite the low population density. Anthropogenic factors showed a high correlation with the occurrence of wildfires, more than climatic or topographical factors. Other factors affect the risk of fires at the macroscale and microscale, which should be considered when modeling. The random forest method showed better results in the macroscale, however, the maximum entropy model was better in the microscale. The exclusion of variables that do not show a high correlation, does not always improve the modeling results. The random forest presence prediction model is a more accurate method and significantly reduces the risk territory. The reverse is the method of maximum entropy, which is not as accurate and classifies very large areas as endangered. Further study of this topic requires a clearer and conceptually developed approach to the application of remote sensing data. Therefore, this work makes sense to lay the foundations of the future, which is a completely automated fire risk assessment application in the Republic of Sakha. The results can be used in fire prophylactics and planning fire prevention. In the future, to determine the risk well, it is necessary to combine the obtained maps with the seasonal risk determined using indices (for example, the Nesterov index 1949) and the periodic dynamics of forest fires, which Isaev and Utkin studied in 1963. Such actions can help to build an application, with which it will be possible to determine the risk of wildfire and the spread of fire during extreme events.

TI  - A New Model of Consolation
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a new model of consolation that identifies five key themes: (1) an appeal to the inner strength of the consoland; (2) the regulation of emotion; (3) the attempt to preserve, re-write, and perfect the life of the deceased or, more generally, a person undergoing a radical psycho-social transition; (4) a 'healing' worldview, in which death has a legitimate place; and (5) reconnection with the community at the different levels of, for instance, family, society and humanity. The study is based on the Western tradition of written consolations. It partially confirms-and also supersedes-earlier studies of consolation based on different methods and smaller ranges of material. The article explores the applicability of the framework beyond the consolatory tradition by analyzing two versions of the Roman Catholic rite of anointing the sick. It argues for the heuristic usefulness of the model in the field of ritual studies, both by demonstrating the limitations of prevalent typologies of ritual and by suggesting a fresh look at ritual efficacy.

TI  - Analysis of Tidal Channel Variations Using High Spatial Resolution Multispectral Satellite Image in Sihwa Reclaimed Land, South Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The tidal channel is a coastal sedimentary terrain that plays the most important role in the formation and development of tidal flats, and is considered a very important index for understanding and distribution of tidal flat sedimentation/erosion terrain. The purpose of this study is to understand the changes in tidal channels by a period after the opening of the floodgate of the seawall in the reclaimed land of Sihwa Lake using KOMPSAT high-resolution multispectral satellite image data and to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of high-resolution satellite images. KOMPSAT 2 and 3 images were used for extraction of the tidal channels' lineaments in 2009, 2014, and 2019 and were applied to supervised classification method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Artificial Neural Net (ANN), Matched Filtering (MF), and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and band ratio techniques using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and MF/SAM. For verification, a numerical map of the National Geographic Information Service and Landsat 7 ETM+ image data were utilized. As a result, KOMPSAT data showed great agreement with the verification data compared to the Landsat 7 images for detecting a direction and distribution pattern of the tidal channels. However, it has been confirmed that there will be limitations in identifying the distribution of tidal channels' density and providing meaningful information related to the development of the sedimentary process. This research is expected to present the possibility of utilizing KOMPSAT image-based high-resolution remote exploration as a way of responding to domestic intertidal environmental issues, and to be used as basic research for providing multi-platform-image-based convergent thematic maps and topics.

Earth observations have been available for use in weather and other models to support decision making since the late 1970s, with the launch of the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer and the Landsat sensors. Despite early recognition of the potential for satellite remote sensing to transform farm-level decision making, information from satellite data is still not widely used by farmers day to day except in highly mechanized precision agricultural systems that represent a very small minority of farmers globally.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in high-risk endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: In the staging of endometrial cancer (EC), the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for high-risk EC is still unclear.Methods: Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and hill-text articles for inclusion and assessed study quality. English studies published in PubiVled, Embase, and Cochrane Library before 20th SEP, 2019 were retrieved to perform a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis which evaluate the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of SIN mapping in high-risk EC. Statistical analysis was conducted using statal4.0 software.Results: A total of 12 studies were included, including 758 high-risk EC patients. The detection rate of SLN mapping was 84.8% (95% CI, 79.9-89.6%). The pooled bilateral detection rate was 67.0% (95% CI, 56.8-77.3%). The pooled para-aortic detection rate was 8.4% (95% CI, 1.8-14.9%). The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI, 79-92%), and the pooled specificity was 98% (95% CI, 96-99%). Pooled negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.7% (95% CI, 96.4-99.1%), AUC =0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-0.099).Conclusions: SLN mapping still has a high detection rate and diagnostic accuracy in high-risk EC. SLN mapping is a reliable alternative to systematic lymph node dissection, but its prognostic effect on high-risk EC is yet to be further studied and verified by large sample studies.

At the same time, the correlation between the AOD product and the air quality index (AQI) is analyzed to explore the indication function for air pollution. The spatial distribution data of MCD19A2 AOD and the measured data of aerosol robotic network (AERONET) in the BTH region from 2014 to 2018 are obtained for validation, and the two types of data are processed by space-time transformation to achieve accurate matching. Validation results show that MCD19A2 products have achieved higher accuracy and stability in the BTH region. It's correlation coefficient, root mean square error, mean absolute error, and within expected errors are 0. 9504, 0.1243, 0. 0863, and 82. 26%, respectively. Based on AOD results at different scales, correlation analysis performed with AQI data suggests higher correlation, which indicates that the MCD19A2 data has a direct indication of air pollution. This study can provide some references for the research of aerosol characteristics and air quality monitoring.

TI  - Estimating the Growing Stem Volume of Coniferous Plantations Based on Random Forest Using an Optimized Variable Selection Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growing stem volume (GSV) reflects the richness of forest resources as well as the quality of forest ecosystems. Remote sensing technology enables robust and efficient GSV estimation as it greatly reduces the survey time and cost while facilitating periodic monitoring. Given its red edge bands and a short revisit time period, Sentinel-2 images were selected for the GSV estimation in Wangyedian forest farm, Inner Mongolia, China. The variable combination was shown to significantly affect the accuracy of the estimation model. After extracting spectral variables, texture features, and topographic factors, a stepwise random forest (SRF) method was proposed to select variable combinations and establish random forest regressions (RFR) for GSV estimation. The linear stepwise regression (LSR), Boruta, Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), and random forest (RF) methods were then used as references for comparison with the proposed SRF for selection of predictors and GSV estimation. Combined with the observed GSV data and the Sentinel-2 images, the distributions of GSV were generated by the RFR models with the variable combinations determined by the LSR, RF, Boruta, VSURF, and SRF. The results show that the texture features of Sentinel-2's red edge bands can significantly improve the accuracy of GSV estimation. The SRF method can effectively select the optimal variable combination, and the SRF-based model results in the highest estimation accuracy with the decreases of relative root mean square error by 16.4%, 14.4%, 16.3%, and 10.6% compared with those from the LSR-, RF-, Boruta-, and VSURF-based models, respectively. The GSV distribution generated by the SRF-based model matched that of the field observations well. The results of this study are expected to provide a reference for GSV estimation of coniferous plantations.

TI  - AutoRSISC: Automatic design of neural architecture for remote sensing image scene classification
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image scene classification (RSISC) is one of the bases of visual question answering for remote sensing data (RSVQA). In the conventional deep learning based solutions of RSISC, domain experts have to manually design the neural architecture, which is costly in both time and manpower. In this paper, AutoRSISC, a high resolution remote sensing image scene classification method based on neural architecture search (NAS) is proposed. AutoRSISC algorithm samples the neural architecture in a certain proportion to reduce the redundancy in the search space which is based on the continuous relaxation of the neural architecture representation. Edge normalization is introduced to make architecture search more efficient. The conventional deep learning approaches take days or more just to manually design the appropriate neural architecture according to the current data set. The experimental results show that our method saves time and manpower compared with the existing manually designed RSISC methods. Our AutoRSISC algorithm took 7.6 h from the automatic design of the most appropriate neural architecture to the end of all experiments according to the UCM data set, and the classification accuracy rate of the final test set reached 97.85%. And our AutoRSISC algorithm took 101.7 h from the automatic design of the most appropriate neural architecture to the end of all experiments according to the NWPU45 data set, and the classification accuracy rate of the final test set reached 94.66%.

TI  - Evaluation of passive microwave melt detection methods on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves using time series of Sentinel-1 SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave datasets have been used to quantify the extent and duration of surface melt in Greenland and Antarctica from 1978 on with daily and near-daily intervals. These results have important implications for climate analysis and may help evaluate ice shelf stability. However, the accuracy of passive microwave methods used to detect melt is difficult to quantify, especially on the Antarctic Peninsula. Here four different melt de-tection methods are employed, including a new formulation of a statistical analysis of brightness temperature time series using a K-means clustering algorithm. Strikingly, two of the most widely used passive microwave melt detection methods are found to vary by 48% mean days of melt per year across six different locations on the Larsen C, Wilkins, and George VI Ice Shelves. In the absence of ground truth observations, time series of Sentinel 1 SAR observations from 2016 on provide a comparison dataset. In topographically flat regions where surface melt is spatially uniform, the passive microwave melt detection method based on a K-means analysis and the cross-polarization gradient ratio method demonstrate the highest agreement and correlation with active radar melt detection methods. One issue which has plagued passive microwave analysis is its coarse spatial resolution. High resolution SAR images are able to demonstrate and quantify the spatial variability of melt within individual passive microwave pixels. Melt is shown to be suitably uniform in space for passive microwave applications at the study sites on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves, but not so in other regions of the Antarctic Peninsula. Spatial heterogeneity of surface melt on the sub-pixel scale is often related to varying surface topography.

CP  - Global Symposium on Soil Erosion (GSER)
CL  - Food & Agr Org United Nat, Rome, ITALY
AB  - Tillage practices on sloping ground often result in unsustainable soil losses impairing soil functions such as crop productivity, water and nutrients storage, and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. A sloping olive grove (10%) was planted in shallow gypsiferous soils in 2004. It was managed by minimum tillage; the most frequent management practice in central Spain. The consequences of erosion were studied in soil samples (at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depths) by analyzing SOC, available water and gypsum content, and by detecting spectral signatures using an ASD FieldSpecPro (R) VIS/NIR-spectroradiometer. The Brightness index (BI), Shape index (FI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were derived from the ASD spectral signatures and from remote sensing (Sentinel-2 image) data. The development of these young olive trees was estimated from the measured diameter of the trunks (17 +/- 18 cm diameter). In 20-30 cm of the soil, the carbon stock (38 +/- 18 Mg ha(-1)) as well as the available water content (12 +/- 6%) was scarce, affecting the productivity of the olive grove. The above-mentioned indices obtained from the laboratory samples and the pixels of the Sentinel-2 image were significantly (p < 0.01) correlated, with a correlation coefficient of around 0.4. The BI was related to the gypsum content and the slope of the plot. The FI was related to the carbon and water contents. The NDVI derived from the satellite image identified the influence of soil degradation on the trees and the carbon content. The spatial-temporal changes of the indices might help in tracking soil changes over time.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has passed its first peak in Europe.AimTo describe the mortality in England and its association with SARS-CoV-2 status and other demographic and risk factors.Design and settingCross-sectional analyses of people with known SARS-CoV-2 status in the Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre [RSC] sentinel network.MethodPseudonytnised, coded clinical data were uploaded from volunteer general practice members of this nationally representative network (n= 4413734). All-cause mortality was compared with notional rates for 2019, using a relative survival mode( reporting relative hazard ratios (RHR). and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) analysis was conducted for those with known SARS-CoV-2 status (n= 56628. 1.3%) including multiple imputation and inverse probability analysis, and a complete cases sensitivity analysis.ResultsMortality peaked in week 16. People living in households of >= 9 had a fivefold increase in relative mortality PHR = 5.1, 95% CI = 4.87 to 5.31, P<0.0001). The OHs of mortality were 8.9 (95% CI = 6.7 to 11.8.P<0.0001) and 9.7 (95% CI = 7.1 to 13.2, P<0.0001) for virologically and clinically diagnosed cases respectively, using people with negative tests as reference. The adjusted mortality for the virotogicatly confirmed group was 18.1%195% CI = 17.6 to 18.71. Male sex, population density, black ethnicity (compared to whitel, and people with long-term conditions, including learning disability IOR =1.96, 95% CI =1.22 to 3.18. P= 0.00561 had higher odds of mortality.ConclusionThe first SARS-CoV-2 peak in England has been associated with excess mortality. Planning for subsequent peaks needs to better manage risk in males, those of black ethnicity, older people, people with learning disabilities, and people who live in multi-occupancy dwellings.

TI  - VROHI: Visibility Recovery for Outdoor Hazy Image in Scattering Media
T2  - IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Additive haze model (AHM), due to its high simplicity, has a potential to increase the efficiency of the restoration procedure of images degraded by scattering media. However, AHM is designed for hazy remote sensing data and is not suitable to be used on outdoor images. In this paper, according to the low-frequency feature (LFC) of haze, AHM is modified via gamma correction technique to make it suitable for modeling outdoor images. Benefitting from the modified AHM (MAHM), a simple yet effective method called VROHI is proposed to enhance the visibility of an outdoor hazy image. In specific, a low complexity LFC extraction method is designed by utilizing characteristic of the discrete cosine transform. Subsequently, by constructing the linear function of unknown parameters and imposing the saturation prior on MAHM, the image dehazing problem can be derived into a global optimization function. Experiments reveal that the proposed VROHI is superior to the other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both the processing efficiency and recovery quality.

TI  - Resolution-Dependent Perspectives on Caribbean Hydro-Climate Change
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface winds around the mountainous Caribbean islands contribute to orographic lifting and thermal diurnal rainfall that requires mesoscale analysis. Here, a new perspective is presented via high-resolution satellite and reanalysis products. Singular value decomposition is applied to 5 km cold-cloud duration satellite data to understand the leading mode of seasonal hydro-climate variability and its regional controls. The spatial loadings reflect wet islands in a dry marine climate, while temporal amplitude is modulated by the large-scale zonal circulation. When summer-time trade winds weaken, daytime confluence around Caribbean islands enlarges, gathering and lifting more moisture. In addition to the static geographic forcing, transient easterly waves impart the majority of marine rainfall between June and September. Higher resolution products capture the thermal orographic effect and reveal upward trends in island rainfall and soil moisture over the satellite era, while lower resolution products miss this effect. The climate of mountainous Caribbean islands is trending toward increased runoff and soil moisture.

TI  - Sand transport in the northeastern Caribbean characterized by wind-wave-current data
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand transport around the northeastern Caribbean Virgin Islands (VI) is studied using global data-assimilation products and satellite measurements; with a focus on seasonal and event characteristics in the period 2002-2019. A review of applied research and a local statistical analysis indicate that currents accompanied by waves and wind mixing are capable of scouring near-shore sand bars.VI area (18.4-18.6N, 65.5-64.5W) time series analysis offer insights on the processes underlying suspended sediment concentrations estimated by 5 km resolution MODIS and VIIRS satellite red-band radiance. The winter season peak in turbidity derives from trade wind-driven waves and currents that reach critical thresholds to mobilize and transport the coarse sands. Instead of wave height, wave steepness and mixed layer depth are applied as coefficients to HYCOM3 near-surface currents, to create a multi-variate sand transport index. Statistical regression shows that a strengthened North Atlantic anticyclone and associated winter trade winds in the VI archipelago results in surface cooling and a deep mixed layer, making steep waves and westward currents more effective in sand transport.The leading case of satellite red-band radiance followed many months after the passage of tropical cyclones in September 2017. A sustained spell of intense trade winds in February 2018 induced 3 m waves of 3% steepness and near-surface currents up to 0.5 m/s. Rapid sea level oscillations >0.05 m suggest that long-period waves joined local wind-waves to mobilize coarse sands within a mixed layer >50 m deep. The plume of sand exhibited composite VIIRS red-band radiance of 0.1 W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1); supplying coarse light-colored sands to downstream Caribbean islands.This study has universal application to near-shore sand transport by demonstrating the use of a high-resolution multi-variate index from freely available global data-assimilation products. Given rising sea levels, beach erosion and limited field data, such an index is an essential tool in coastal management.

TI  - Vicarious Methodologies to Assess and Improve the Quality of the Optical Remote Sensing Images: A Critical Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past decade, number of optical Earth-observing satellites performing remote sensing has increased substantially, dramatically increasing the capability to monitor the Earth. The quantity of remote sensing satellite increase is primarily driven by improved technology, miniaturization of components, reduced manufacturing, and launch cost. These satellites often lack on-board calibrators that a large satellite utilizes to ensure high quality (radiometric, geometric, spatial quality, etc.) scientific measurement. To address this issue, this work presents "best" vicarious image quality assessment and improvement techniques for those kinds of optical satellites which lack an on-board calibration system. In this article, image quality categories have been explored, and essential quality parameters (absolute and relative calibration, aliasing, etc.) have been identified. For each of the parameters, appropriate characterization methods are identified along with their specifications or requirements. In cases of multiple methods, recommendations have been made based-on the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Furthermore, processing steps have been presented, including examples. Essentially, this paper provides a comprehensive study of the criteria that need to be assessed to evaluate remote sensing satellite data quality, and the best vicarious methodologies to evaluate identified quality parameters such as coherent noise and ground sample distance.

TI  - Small Multispectral UAV Sensor and Its Image Fusion Capability in Cultural Heritage Applications
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - For many decades the multispectral images of the earth's surface and its objects were taken from multispectral sensors placed on satellites. In recent years, the technological evolution produced similar sensors (much smaller in size and weight) which can be placed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), thereby allowing the collection of higher spatial resolution multispectral images. In this paper, Parrot's small Multispectral (MS) camera Sequoia+ is used, and its images are evaluated at two archaeological sites, on the Byzantine wall (ground application) of Thessaloniki city (Greece) and on a mosaic floor (aerial application) at the archaeological site of Dion (Greece). The camera receives RGB and MS images simultaneously, a fact which does not allow image fusion to be performed, as in the standard utilization procedure of Panchromatic (PAN) and MS image of satellite passive systems. In this direction, that is, utilizing the image fusion processes of satellite PAN and MS images, this paper demonstrates that with proper digital processing the images (RGB and MS) of small MS cameras can lead to a fused image with a high spatial resolution, which retains a large percentage of the spectral information of the original MS image. The high percentage of spectral fidelity of the fused images makes it possible to perform high-precision digital measurements in archaeological sites such as the accurate digital separation of the objects, area measurements and retrieval of information not so visible with common RGB sensors via the MS and RGB data of small MS sensors.

TI  - The metaphorical naming of selected dreaded diseases and medical conditions in Igbo language and thought
T2  - TOPICS IN LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), which forms the theoretical anchor of this study, expresses the role of language and cognition in construing and communicating human experiences. CMT posits that metaphor in discourse is shaped by the ideological orientation and cultural worldview of the speaker or group. Previous studies on Igbo language and culture have used insights from linguistics, anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, religious studies among others to show how the group expresses its social and cultural experiences, but none, to the best of the present researcher's knowledge, has used the CMT approach to study the group's construal of dreaded diseases and medical conditions in its environment. Working within the tenets of CMT therefore, this study shows how the group uses metaphors to express ideation and tenor in relation to some dreaded diseases and conditions. The study reveals that the Igbo use different conceptual metaphors such as container, journey, leaf, natural/physical force, heavy burden, etc. to frame their understanding of some dreaded diseases and conditions. The diseases and conditions are named/classified according to the narratives around them; the effects of the disease on the skin of the sufferer; the visual impression of the disease on the distant other; the effects of the disease on the mind/brain of the sufferer; the physical effects of the disease on the body of the sufferer; and the assumed causes/sources of the disease. Descriptive and analytical approaches are used in the discussion of primary data. The language the Igbo of Southeastern Nigeria use to express their understanding of their natural world and social relations is chiefly metaphorical, and the names they ascribe to diseases and medical conditions emanate from their understanding of their cultural and social orientations, bodily actions and experiences.

TI  - Deep Metric Learning Based on Scalable Neighborhood Components for Remote Sensing Scene Characterization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the semantic understanding of remote sensing (RS) scenes has been significantly improved based on their prominent feature encoding capabilities. While many existing deep-learning models focus on designing different architectures, only a few works in the RS field have focused on investigating the performance of the learned feature embeddings and the associated metric space. In particular, two main loss functions have been exploited: the contrastive and the triplet loss. However, the straightforward application of these techniques to RS images may not be optimal in order to capture their neighborhood structures in the metric space due to the insufficient sampling of image pairs or triplets during the training stage and to the inherent semantic complexity of remotely sensed data. To solve these problems, we propose a new deep metric learning approach, which overcomes the limitation on the class discrimination by means of two different components: 1) scalable neighborhood component analysis (SNCA) that aims at discovering the neighborhood structure in the metric space and 2) the cross-entropy loss that aims at preserving the class discrimination capability based on the learned class prototypes. Moreover, in order to preserve feature consistency among all the minibatches during training, a novel optimization mechanism based on momentum update is introduced for minimizing the proposed loss. An extensive experimental comparison (using several state-of-the-art models and two different benchmark data sets) has been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method from different perspectives, including: 1) classification; 2) clustering; and 3) image retrieval. The related codes of this article will be made publicly available for reproducible research by the community.

TI  - Modeling the spatial pattern of sediment flow in lower Hugli estuary, West Bengal, India by quantifying suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and depth conditions using geoinformatics
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) information on the coastal waters is necessary for understanding and management of the estuarine environment. It serves as an indicator of coastal erosion and deposition. It is challenging fora macro-tidal estuary like the Hugli with a complex hydrodynamic condition and depth variations to estimate suspended sediment concentration by field observations only. In the present study, we estimated suspended sediment concentration at different depths of the lower Hugli estuary in the post-monsoon season by using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Since SSC is highest in the monsoon months, the image of October 22, 2019 was selected, which was the earliest available cloud-free data. Furthermore, about forty water samples were collected from different depths on the same date and time of the satellite pass for ground truth verification and data calibration. An empirical multivariate regression algorithm was used to demarcate the SSC zones in the image and correlate them with depth variations. MIKE-21 hydrodynamic model was also used to assess the spatial pattern of sediment flow in the Hugli river estuary. Remote sensing and GIS have proved to be a useful framework to es-timate the SSC of any water column's surface layer to overcome the limitation posed by the field measurements alone.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Leaf Area Index Using Meteorological Data: Assessment of Heuristic Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important structural feature of our ecosystem as it affects energy, carbon, and water exchanges between the land surface and overlying atmosphere. Global scale LAI datasets have been obtained by regression, heuristic data driven, and radiative transfer models using remotely sensed land surface reflectance data. However, the estimation of LAI from remotely sensed data is limited only to clear sky conditions. Also, it is problematic to estimate LAI in forests by using conventional remote sensing image analysis of multi-spectral data. Due to the above-mentioned shortcomings of estimating LAI from remotely sensed data, this study obtained LAI from meteorological data using the Gene Expression Programming (GEP) technique. The new approach was tested in different forest sites with broad-leaf and needle-leaf trees in USA. The results showed that the GEP technique can accurately estimate LAI from meteorological data in different forest sites.

TI  - Ground Displacement in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran, Revealed by L-band and C-band InSAR Analyses
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran, as a semi-arid and arid country, has a water challenge in the recent decades and underground water extraction has been increased because of improper developments in the agricultural sector. Thus, detection and measurement of ground subsidence in major plains is of great importance for hazard mitigation purposes. In this study, we carried out a time series small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis of 15 L-band PALSAR-2 images acquired from ascending orbits of the ALOS-2 satellite between 2015 and 2020 to investigate long-term ground displacements in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. We found that two major parts of the study area (Tabriz and Shabestar plains) are subsiding, where the mean and maximum vertical subsidence rates are -10 and -98 mm/year, respectively. The results revealed that the visible subsidence patterns in the study area are associated with either anthropogenic activities (e.g., underground water usage) or presence of compressible soils along the Tabriz-Shabestar and Tabriz-Azarshahr railways. This implies that infrastructure such as railways and roads is vulnerable if progressive ground subsidence takes over the whole area. The SBAS results deduced from L-band PALSAR-2 data were validated with field observations and compared with C-band Sentinel-1 results for the same period. The C-band Sentinel-1 results showed good agreement with the L-band PALSAR-2 dataset, in which the mean and maximum vertical subsidence rates are -13 and -120 mm/year, respectively. For better visualization of the results, the SBAS InSAR velocity map was down-sampled and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on similar to 3600 randomly selected time series of the study area, and the results are presented by two principal components (PC1 and PC2).

TI  - Ethnoarchaeological Approach to the Cult of Ram in Traditional Kazakh Culture
T2  - BELLETEN
M3  - Article
AB  - The cult of the sheep/ram plays an important role in the life and ethos of the Kazakhs and many Turkic tribes as a totem animal. Numerous sculptural images of the ram depicted in the old Kazakh tombstones (qoitas, goshgartas) and clay ram figurines were found in archeological excavations. The ram images in the rock engravings (petroglyphs) indicate its roots related to the ancient religions. Some of the handles in ancient pottery were zoomorphic in shape, and especially in the form of ram head. The cult of sheep/ram was connected with the specific conditions of life, traditions, husbandry of ancient tribes as Sakha, Kangli, and Medieval Oghuz and Kipchak. The cultic significance of the sheep/ram is explained by its sacredness related to the idea of human soul, and to moments of transformation. This cult has close connection with the tradition of nature worship in the pre-Islamic people of the ancient East. The sheep/ram served not only as a sacrificial animal, but also a talisman for Turkic people. There were interesting Kazakh and Turkic customs, superstitions and legends connected with the miraculous peculiarities of some bones of domestic animals. The images of the sheep/ram in the form of a horn (qoshqartnuyiz) symbolize wealth and fertility.

TI  - Monitoring of Sugarcane Harvest in Brazil Based on Optical and SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The algorithms for determining sugarcane harvest dates are proposed; the algorithms allow the ability to monitor large areas and are based on the publicly available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite data. Algorithm 1 uses the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series derived from Sentinel-2 data. Sharp and continuous decrease in the NDVI values is the main sign of sugarcane harvest. The NDVI time series allows the ability to determine most harvest dates. The best estimates of the sugarcane areas harvested per month have been obtained from March to August 2018 when cloudy pixel percentage is less than 45% of the image area. Algorithm 2 of the harvest monitoring uses the coherence time series derived from Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) images and optical satellite data. Low coherence, demonstrating sharp growth upon the harvest completion, corresponds to the harvest period. The NDVI time series trends were used to refine the algorithm. It is supposed that the descending NDVI trend corresponds to harvest. The algorithms were used to identify the harvest dates and calculate the harvested areas of the reference sample of 574 sugarcane parcels with a total area of 3745 ha in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The harvested areas identified by visual interpretation coincide with the optical-data algorithm (algorithm 1) by 97%; the coincidence with the algorithm based on SAR and optical data (algorithm 2) is 90%. The main practical applications of the algorithms are harvest monitoring and identification of the harvested fields to estimate the harvested area.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A case of successful local treatment for metachronous oligometastases to the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes in a postmenopausal woman with breast cancer is presented. A 44-year-old woman underwent partial mastectomy and left axillary lymph node dissection for right breast cancer. Thirteen years and 3 months after the operation, she was referred to our hospital for a right lung mass detected by mass screening and diagnosed with a metastatic lung tumor from left breast cancer following CT-guided biopsy. She was simultaneously diagnosed with right breast cancer, and pulmonary metastasectomy, right partial mastectomy, and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Two years after the second operation, follow-up CT showed a swollen lymph node at the pre-tracheal space, and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. The mediastinal lymph node metastasis showed no change in size for 2 years and 7 months with fulvestrant therapy, and no other metastases were found. Proton beam therapy of 60 GyE in 30 fractions was administered to the metastatic lymph node. Substantial tumor shrinkage with no severe toxicity was observed, and to date, the patient has remained disease-free. More cases need to be studied to investigate the appropriate strategy for local therapy in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer.

TI  - A compact filtered x-ray diode array spectrometer for the National Ignition Facility: SENTINEL
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel is a 16-channel, filtered x-ray diode array spectrometer that has been developed to measure similar to 1 keV-20 keV x-ray emission generated by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser. Unlike the large, fixed-port versions of this diagnostic that currently exist on the NIF (known as Dante), Sentinel is a Diagnostic Instrument Manipulator compatible such that it can be fielded along the polar or equatorial lines-of-sight-an essential new capability for characterizing the often anisotropic x-ray emission from laser-driven sources. We present the diagnostic design along with preliminary diode calibrations and performance results. The novel, small-form-factor x-ray diode design allows for greater than or similar to 5x-25x increased channel areal density over that of Dante, simultaneously enabling improved diagnostic robustness and fidelity of spectral reconstructions. While the Sentinel diagnostic is anticipated to improve line-of-sight spectral characterization of x-ray sources for a wide variety of programs on the NIF, the compact and portable design is also attractive to small- and mid-scale facilities with limited diagnostic real estate.

TI  - Tracing Real-Time Transnational Hydrologic Sensitivity and Crop Irrigation in the Upper Rhine Area over the Exceptional Drought Episode 2018-2020 Using Open Source Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and regional land-use and landcover change (LUCC) impact the ecosystem of the Upper Rhine Area (URA) and transform large parts of the landscape into strongly irrigated agricultural cropland. The increase of long-term drought periods and the trend towards low summer precipitation totals trigger an increase in groundwater scarcity and amplify the negative effects of extensive irrigation purposes and freshwater consumption in a hydrologically sensitive region in Central Europe. This article presents qualitative transnational open source remote sensing temporal series of vegetation indices (NDVI) and groundwater level development to tracing near real-time vegetation change and socio-ecological feedbacks during periods of climate extremes in the Upper Rhine Area (2018-2020). Increased freshwater consumption caused a dramatic drop in groundwater availability, which eventually led to a strong degradation of the vegetation canopy and caused governmental regulations in July 2020. Assessing vegetation growth behavior and linking groundwater reactions in the URA through open source satellite data contributes to a rapidly accessible understanding of the ecosystem's feedbacks on the local to the transnational scale and further enables risk management and eco-political regulations in current and future decision-making processes.

TI  - Optimizing DXA to Assess Skeletal Health: Key Concepts for Clinicians
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: The diagnosis of osteoporosis and assessment of fracture risk prior to a sentinel fracture was transformed by the widespread clinical use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for the assessment of bone mineral density (BMD).Evidence Acquisition: This review is based on a collection of primary and review literature gathered from a PubMed search of "dual energy X-ray absorptiometry," "trabecular bone score:" and "atypical femur fracture" among other keywords. PubMed searches were supplemented by the authors' prior knowledge of the subject.Evidence Synthesis: While uncertainty exists for some aspects of osteoporosis care, patient and clinician familiarity with BMD assessment for screening and monitoring is firmly established. Beyond BMD, lateral spine images obtained with DXA can diagnose osteoporosis and refine fracture risk through the detection of unrecognized vertebral fractures. In addition, analysis of DXA lumbar spine images can reflect changes in trabecular bone microarchitecture, a component of bone "quality" that predicts risk of fracture independent of BMD. Finally, monitoring of bone health by DXA may be extended to include assessment of the femoral cortices for rare but serious adverse effects associated with antiresorptive therapies.Conclusions: Increasing technologic sophistication requires additional consideration for how DXA imaging is performed, interpreted and applied to patient care. As with any test, clinicians must be familiar with DXA performance, pitfalls in analysis, and interpretation within each clinical context in which DXA is applied. With this perspective, care providers will be well positioned to contribute to continuous improvement of DXA performance and, in turn, quality of osteoporosis care.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oak forests of Zagros mountainous ridge, provide important ecosystem services that play a major role in local communities' survival. Nearly all communities in the vicinity of these valuable forested areas are dependent on the ecosystem services from different views like water, fuel, and husbandry. Different factors like human activities, miss management, climate change, Oak roller moth population outbreak threat these valuable ecosystems survival and sustaining. To document the effect of these factors on the canopy covers change during recent years, we used ASTER satellite data and NDVI algorithm to document Kamfirouze oak forests canopy cover changes. Our analysis indicates that in spite of an increase in planted lands (29.35%) in recent decades, the total area of these forests decreased by 15.1 percent and bare lands area has been decreased by up to 7.5% as well. Decreasing trend of the forest canopy cover can be related to the land-use change as the most important factor as well as other factors like illegal timber consumption in the area. The overall finding of this project confirms a more than 10 percent decrease in recent years.

T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on time series analysis of land use and land cover (LULC) characteristics and its relationships with urban heat island (UHI) intensity in Bangkok Metropolitan area. The study is aimed at examining impact of LULC changes on the greenness and land surface temperature (LST) as well as the relationship of LST, LULC and Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We consider the heat intensity, hot spot zones, and land use characteristics related hotspot areas. LULC classification based on satellite images taken by Landsat data in summer dates of 1991, 1997, 2005 and 2016, were classified into four LULC types: built up area; vegetation area; barren land; and surface water. UHI was studied by deriving LST based satellite images method using the thermal band of Landsat satellite in the same periods as of LULC classification. The results show that the built up area was approximately 30% in 1991, then, it was sharply increasing to approximately 55% of the total area in 2016. The changing trends of LST tend to be increasing while the value of NDVI with dense vegetation meaning tend to be declining over the study period. The significant negative correlation between LST and NDVI implied that the lower biomass can higher LST. UHI intensity was also continually rising from 11.91 degrees C in 1991 to 16.21 degrees C in 2016 leading to nearly 5 degrees C increase in Bangkok. High density of buildings, no vegetation areas and large area of concrete pavement are the most significant related to the hot spot areas.

TI  - Exploring the potential of Sentinel-2A satellite data for aboveground biomass estimation in fragmented Himalayan subtropical pine forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2A satellite having embedded advantage of red edge spectral bands offers multispectral imageries with improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions as compared to the other contemporary satellites providing medium resolution data. Our study was aimed at exploring the potential of Sentinel-2A imagery to estimate Above Ground Biomass (AGB) of Subtropical Pine Forest in Pakistan administered Kashmir. We developed an AGB predictive model using field inventory and Sentinel 2A based spectral and textural parameters along with topographic features derived from ALOS Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Field inventory data was collected from 108 randomly distributed plots (0.l ha each) across the study area. The stepwise linear regression method was employed to investigate the potential relationship between field data and corresponding satellite data. Biomass and carbon mapping of the study area was carried out through established AGB estimation model with R (0.86), R-2 (0.74), adjusted R-2 (0.72) and RMSE value of 33 t/ha. Our results showed that first order textures (mean, standard deviation and variance) significantly contributed in AGB predictive modeling while only one spectral band ratio made contribution from spectral domain. Our study leads to the conclusion that Sentinel-2A optical data is a potential source for AGB estimation in subtropical pine forest of the area of interest with added benefit of its free of cost availability, higher quality data and long-term continuity that can be utilized for biomass carbon distribution mapping in the resource constraint study area for sustainable forest management.

T2  - Metamorphosis
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial photography provides historic record of features at the time the photograph was captured, and can assist with exploring changes in the habitat of threatened species. The host-plant of the Critically Endangered, endemic Pennington's Protea butterfly Capys penningtoni, the Common Sugarbush Protea caffra Meisn. subsp. caffra, is a resprouter after fire which eventually dies if burnt too frequently. Six sites (Marwaqa Nature Reserve, Impendle Nature Reserve, Clairmont Mountain Nature Reserve, Lotheni Nature Reserve, Lot 93 1821 near Mkhomazi River (Nxamalala Traditional Council) and Mt Le Sueur) where the butterfly species had been previously recorded were selected to estimate the number of adult P. caffra subsp. caffra trees present using aerial photographs (2009). Protea trees in the vicinity of the C. penningtoni butterfly collection sites were point-digitised off aerial photographs. Polygons were digitised around coverages of protea trees using a distance of 50 m between trees to determine the outer margin of each coverage. The imagery data were ground-truthed by verifying the location and identities of P. caffra subsp. caffra trees at each site, using a sample of the total number of digitised trees. The ground-truthing enabled the separation of P. caffra subsp. caffra trees from Silver Protea Protea roupelliae trees, and the separation of P. caffra subsp. caffra trees with overlapping canopies. Contemporary presence of P. caffra subsp. caffra trees in relation to presence in 2009 was determined. Fire frequency data for each site was obtained via landsatlook viewer (USGS). We found that the protea savanna at most of the sampled sites was burnt about once every year between July and September. This project indicated the potential utility of aerial photographs and aerial imagery for the purposes of assessing the status of P. caffra subsp. caffra and H. axyridis in the habitat of the Critically Endangered and endemic C. penningtoni and for directing the placement of sampling plots in the field.

TI  - Validation of Surface Reflectance Product of KOMPSAT-3A Image Data: Application of RadCalNet Baotou (BTCN) Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Experiments for validation of surface reflectance produced by Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT-3A) were conducted using Chinese Baotou (BTCN) data among four sites of the Radical Calibration Network (RadCalNet), a portal that provides spectrophotometric reflectance measurements. The atmosphere reflectance and surface reflectance products were generated using an extension program of an open-source Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), which was redesigned and implemented to extract those reflectance products in batches. Three image data sets of 2016, 2017, and 2018 were taken into account of the two sensor model variability, ver. 1.4 released in 2017 and ver. 1.5 in 2019, such as gain and offset applied to the absolute atmospheric correction. The results of applying these sensor model variables showed that the reflectance products by ver. 1.4 were relatively well-matched with RadCalNet BTCN data, compared to ones by ver. 1.5. On the other hand, the reflectance products obtained from the Landsat-8 by the USGS LaSRC algorithm and Sentinel-2B images using the SNAP Sen2Cor program were used to quantitatively verify the differences in those of KOMPSAT-3A. Based on the RadCalNet BTCN data, the differences between the surface reflectance of KOMPSAT-3A image were shown to be highly consistent with B band as -0.031 to 0.034, G band as -0.001 to 0.055, R band as -0.072 to 0.037, and NIR band as -0.060 to 0.022. The surface reflectance of KOMPSAT-3A also indicated the accuracy level for further applications, compared to those of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2B images. The results of this study are meaningful in confirming the applicability of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) to the surface reflectance on high-resolution satellites.

TI  - A Validation Experiment of the Reflectance Products of KOMPSAT-3A Based on RadCalNet Data and Its Applicability to Vegetation Indexing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance products obtained through the absolute atmospheric correction of multispectral satellite images are useful for precise scientific applications. For broader applications, the reflectance products computed using high-resolution images need to be validated with field measurement data. This study dealt with 2.2-m resolution Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT)-3A images with four multispectral bands, which were used to obtain top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance products. The open-source Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) extension was used to generate these products. Next, these were subsequently validated by considering three sites (i.e., Railroad Valley Playa, NV, USA (RVUS), Baotou, China (BTCN), and La Crau, France (LCFR)) in RadCalNet, as well as a calibration and validation portal for remote sensing. We conducted the validations comparing satellite image-based reflectance products and field measurement reflectance based on data sets acquired at different times. The experimental results showed that the overall trend of validation accuracy of KOPSAT-3A was well fitted in all the RadCalNet sites and that the accuracy remained quite constant. Reflectance bands showing the minimum and maximum differences between the sets of experimental data are presented in this paper. The vegetation indices (i.e., the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) and the structure insensitive pigment index (SIPI)) and three TOC reflectance bands obtained from KOMPSAT-3A were computed as a case study and used to achieve a detailed vegetation interpretation; finally, the correspondent results were compared with those obtained from Landsat-8 images (downloaded from the Google Earth Engine (GEE)). The validation and the application scheme presented in this study can be potentially applied to the generation of analysis ready data from high-resolution satellite sensor images.

TI  - Development of a Multiple Linear Regression Model for Meteorological Drought Index Estimation Based on Landsat Satellite Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate polarization due to global warming has increased the intensity of drought in some regions, and the need for drought estimation studies to help minimize damage is increasing. In this study, we constructed remote sensing and climate data for Boryeong, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea, and developed a model for drought index estimation by classifying data characteristics and applying multiple linear regression analysis. The drought indices estimated in this study include four types of standardized precipitation indices (SPI1, SPI3, SPI6, and SPI9) used as meteorological drought indices and calculated through cumulative precipitation. We then applied statistical analysis to the developed model and assessed its ability as a drought index estimation tool using remote sensing data. Our results showed that its adj.R-2 value, achieved using cumulative precipitation for one month, was very low (approximately 0.003), while for the SPI3, SPI6, and SPI9 models, the adj.R-2 values were significantly higher than the other models at 0.67, 0.64, and 0.56, respectively, when the same data were used.

TI  - A Comparison between the Reference Evapotranspiration Products for Croplands in Korea: Case Study of 2016-2019
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is a concept that includes the evaporation from soil and the transpiration from the plant leaf. It is an essential factor for monitoring water balance, drought, crop growth, and climate change. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) corresponds to the consumption of water from the land surface and the necessary amount of water for the land surface. Because the AET is derived from multiplying the crop coefficient by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), an accurate calculation of the ET0 is required for the AET. To date, many efforts have been made for gridded ET0 to provide multiple products now. This study presents a comparison between the ET0 products such as FAO56-PM, LDAPS, PKNU-NMSC, and MODIS to find out which one is more suitable for the local-scale hydrological and agricultural applications in Korea, where the heterogeneity of the land surface is critical. In the experiment for the period between 2016 and 2019, the daily and 8-day products were compared with the in-situ observations by KMA. The analyses according to the station, year, month, and time-series showed that the PKNU-NMSC product with a successful optimization for Korea was superior to the others, yielding stable accuracy irrespective of space and time. Also, this paper showed the intrinsic characteristics of the FAO56-PM, LDAPS, and MODIS ET0 products that could be informative for other researchers.

TI  - Derivation of Radiometric Calibration Coefficients for KOMPSAT-3A Mid-wave Infrared Data Using a Radiative Transfer Model: An Exploratory Example
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to convert the Digital Number (DN) measured from Earth observing satellites into the physical parameter of radiance when deriving the geophysical parameter such as surface temperature in the satellite data processing. The purpose of this study is to update the DN center dot Radiance equation established from lab measurements, using the KOMPSAT-3A mid-wave infrared data and the MODTRAN radiative transfer model. Results of this study show that the improved DN center dot Radiance equation allows us to produce the realistic values of radiance. We expect in the forthcoming study that the radiances calculated as such should be more quantitatively validated with the use of relevant in-situ measurements and a radiative transfer model.

TI  - Estimating Net Irrigation Across the North China Plain Through Dual Modeling of Evapotranspiration
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is the greatest human interference with the terrestrial water cycle. Detailed knowledge on irrigation is required to better manage water resources and to increase water use efficiency (WUE). This study applies a framework to quantify net irrigation at monthly timescale at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) providing high spatial and temporal detail for regional water resources management. The study is conducted in the Haihe River Basin (HRB) in China encompassing the North China Plain (NCP), a global hot spot of groundwater depletion. Net irrigation is estimated based on the systematic evapotranspiration (ET) residuals between a remote sensing-based model and a hydrologic model that does not include an irrigation scheme. The results suggest an average annual net irrigation of 126 mm yr(-1) (15.2 km(3) yr(-1)) for NCP and 108 mm yr(-1) (18.6 km(3) yr(-1)) for HRB. It is found that net irrigation can be estimated with higher fidelity for winter crops than for summer crops. The simulated water balance for NCP is evaluated with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, and the net irrigation estimates can close the water balance gap. Annual winter wheat classifications reveal an increasing crop area with a trend of 2,200 km(2) yr(-1). This trend is not accompanied by a likewise increasing trend in irrigation water use, which suggests an increased WUE in the NCP, which is further supported by net primary productivity data. The proposed framework has potential to be transferred to other regions and support decision makers to support sustainable water management.

TI  - Monitoring and Predicting Spatio-Temporal Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Zaria City, Nigeria, through an Integrated Cellular Automata and Markov Chain Model (CA-Markov)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land use/land cover (LULC) change dynamics plays a crucial role in formulating strategies and policies for the effective planning and sustainable development of rapidly growing cities. Therefore, this study sought to integrate the cellular automata and Markov chain model using remotely sensed data and geographical information system (GIS) techniques to monitor, map, and detect the spatio-temporal LULC change in Zaria city, Nigeria. Multi-temporal satellite images of 1990, 2005, and 2020 were pre-processed, geo-referenced, and mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification to examine the city's historical land cover (1990-2020). Subsequently, an integrated cellular automata (CA)-Markov model was utilized to model, validate, and simulate the future LULC scenario using the land change modeler (LCM) of IDRISI-TerrSet software. The change detection results revealed an expansion in built-up areas and vegetation of 65.88% and 28.95%, respectively, resulting in barren land losing 63.06% over the last three decades. The predicted LULC maps of 2035 and 2050 indicate that these patterns of barren land changing into built-up areas and vegetation will continue over the next 30 years due to urban growth, reforestation, and development of agricultural activities. These results establish past and future LULC trends and provide crucial data useful for planning and sustainable land use management.

TI  - How to effectively use long-term remotely sensed data to analyze the process of tree and shrub encroachment into open protected wetlands.
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Succession caused by agricultural land abandonment is one of the most serious threats to the biodiversity of non forest ecosystems in Europe. The aim of the study conducted in the Biebrza National Park (NE Poland) was to develop a remote sensing method to analyze the process of tree and shrub encroachment into the open peatland area of the Lower Biebrza Basin of 245 km2. The study covered a period of 50 years, from 1966 to 2015. Tree and shrub coverage was analyzed independently on the basis of airborne imagery acquired in 1966, 1980, 1997, 2006, 2010 and hyperspectral and ALS data from 2015.The method used, which consisted in assigning the area covered by trees and shrubs to permanent reference areas in a grid of squares enabled us to analyze the succession process by integrating various types of airborne data retrieved from various sensors with different geometric, radiometric and spectral resolutions. Owing to this, the process of succession could be characterized on the map by illustrating the spatial distribution of tree and shrub area and the dynamics and directions of their changes in time, and quantitatively by calculating the area of trees and shrubs as well as the dynamics, pace and directions of its change over time. It will be possible to integrate the results of the analysis of archived data with those acquired in the future, which will contribute to even wider use of remote sensing in succession process monitoring. The findings suggest that in the study period the area covered by trees and shrubs increased by 3020 ha, and the open areas decreased from 75.78% of the study area in 1966 to 63.31% in 2015. During the last study period (2010-2015) encroachment of trees and shrubs was inhibited to the rate of 2.7 ha/year as a result of the conservation program being implemented in the Lower Biebrza Basin.

TI  - Urban land use efficiency in Ethiopia: An assessment of urban land use sustainability in Addis Ababa
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia, since 1993, urban land lease policy has been in place to facilitate land transfer for residential, commercial and industrial purposes. As a result, many cities, including Addis Ababa, have witnessed enormous boundary expansion mainly through farmland conversion. Over the past two decades, though Addis Ababa experienced rapid spatial boundary expansion, very little is known about urban land use efficiency (ULUE) of the city. This paper analysed ULUE using remote sensing data. Emphasis was given to the assessment of spatiotemporal land use changes since 2004. Satellite imagery analysis was done using ArcGIS software. Besides, quantitative and qualitative data from secondary sources were studied. Moreover, field observation was conducted. Research findings showed that in almost all expansion frontiers (Bole and Akaki-Kaliti sub-cities) there is a prevalence of urban land use inefficiencies, i.e. pervasive practices of land hoarding and land use fragmentation. Urban sprawl is rampant with a significant part of the land transferred being left vacant or underutilised for years. The problem of ULUE in the country could be mainly attributed to institutional weaknesses, i.e. urban land lease policy gaps, particularly, in areas of lease policy implementation. To improve land productivity, limit eviction and ensure sustainable urban growth, the city should emphasise on improving ULUE. This study highlighted that a mere policy formulation is not enough to ensure efficient urban land use. To achieve land lease policy goals, strengthening institutions, working towards improving institutional functionality, is what policy makers should focus on.

AB  - Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel regimen is the first choice for the initial treatment of HER2-positive recurrent breast cancer. However, docetaxel causes many adverse events. A 48-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for a left breast tumor and was diagnosed with left breast cancer(T1N0M0, Stage Ⅰ, Luminal A). We performed a breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by irradiation of the remaining parts of the mammary gland and adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen. Three and a half years after the first surgery, she underwent local resection due to chest wall recurrence of breast cancer. The recurrent tumor was HER2-positive, and we administered fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide( FEC)and paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. Liver metastases were confirmed on completion of cycle 11 of trastuzumab administration, and the regimen was changed to pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel. A partial response was seen following this regimen. The next line of treatment was the administration of 5 cycles of T-DM1, which resulted in stabilizing the disease. The liver metastases progressed, and the regimen was changed to pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus eribulin. Partial response was seen following this regimen for liver metastases without serious adverse events(20 cycles).

TI  - Ongoing clinical trials on axillary management
T2  - MINERVA CHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Within the last 50 years the management of patients with breast cancer has changed dramatically with a significant de-escalation of the role and magnitude of surgery, both for the management of the primary tumor and for the management of the axilla. In the management of the axilla of patients with early stage breast cancer (EBC) and clinically uninvolved axilla (cN0), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was gradually replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) saving more than 60-70% of patients from an unnecessary dissection. Further studies confirmed that isolated tumor cells or micrometastases found on the SLN had no further benefit from ALND sparing even more patients from an unnecessary ALND. Eventually, the Z0011 and other studies showed that even patients with 1-2 positive SLN can be spared from ALND provided they fulfill certain criteria. Still though there were many flaws in these studies and further research was necessary to generalize the results of these studies to a wider target group. Meanwhile, there is a clear view that many low risk patients if they have their axilla evaluated via US and are not found to have suspicious nodes, it is highly unlikely to have involved axilla. This let to studies evaluating the non-surgical management of the axilla. Finally, in the post neoadjuvant setting 3 randomized controlled trials showed that under certain circumstances SLNB can be done after the NAC even in patients who initially had involved axilla and was converted to clinically uninvolved (cN1.cN0).EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register as well as National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.Gov database have been consulted up to May 2020.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We studied and described the ongoing trials on patients not undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and we discussed the eligibility criteria, the comparison arms and the expected outcomes. We further examined the ongoing trials on patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the same manner.CONCLUSIONS: Although we have covered a long way in the journey of eliminating axillary surgery, there are still lots of questions to be answered and trials to be conducted. We anticipate the results of the ongoing trials to provide the necessary evidence to safely de-escalate more the axillary surgery, both in the non-neoadjuvant as well as in the neoadjuvant setting, hoping that in the not so far future the axillary surgery will eventually perish.

AB  - The pattern recognition of a forest surface from remote sensing data (both airborne hyperspectral data and WorldView-2 multichannel satellite data of high spatial resolution) is investigated. Calculations have been performed using both the method developed earlier by the authors and the standard statistical approach. For three fragments of the forest surface, the range of changes in the accuracy of recognition calculations has been estimated for both airborne and satellite data, depending on the use of different databases developed for the recognition system. Some features of the pattern recognition of the underlying surface are discussed on the basis of both hyperspectral airborne data and multichannel satellite data of high spatial resolution.

TI  - The dynamics of poor urban areas - analyzing morphologic transformations across the globe using Earth observation data
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban environment is in constant motion, mostly through construction but also through destruction of urban elements. While formal development is a process with long planning periods and thus the built landscape appears static, informal or spontaneous settlements seem to be subject to high dynamics in their ever unfinished urban form. However, the dynamics and morphological characteristics of physical transformation in such settlements of urban poverty have been hardly empirically studied on a global scale or temporal consistent foundation. This paper aims at filling this gap by using Earth observation data to provide a temporal analysis of builtup transformation over a period of similar to 7 years in 16 documented manifestations of urban poverty. This work applies visual image interpretation using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with in-situand Google Street View images to derive 3D city models. We measure physical spatial structures through six spatial morphologic variables number of buildings, size, height, orientation, heterogeneity and density. Our temporal assessment reveals interas well intra-urban differences and we find different, yet generally high morphologic dynamic across study sites. This is expressed in manifold ways: from demolished and reconstructed areas to such where changes appeared within the given structures. Geographically, we find advanced dynamics among our sample specifically in areas of the global south. At the same time, we observe a high spatial variability of morphological transformations within the studied areas. Despite partly high morphologic dynamics, spatial patterns of building alignments, streets and open spaces remain predominantly constant.

TI  - Lava Discharge Rate of Sinabung Volcano Obtained from Modis Hot Spot Data
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To find out the long term data of Sinabung magma discharge rate and how long a series of eruption will be ended, time series of the volume of magma discharge is required. The dominant eruption product is pyroclastic flow that begins with the growth of the lava dome, so it is important to determine the volume of the lava dome over time. The method of determining the volume of magma issued is carried out by using hotspot data to resolve the problem of prevented visual observations and ground measurements. 'the heat and volume flux data expressed within a long period for a better view of variations in the Sinabung volcanic activity are based on thermal satellite data. Related lava dome volume and seismic data are also displayed to be compared with the heat and volume flux data. The numbers of thermally anomalous pixels and sum of radiance for all detected pixels at Sinabung during an overpass in the period of 2014 to 2018 have a downward trend. The discharge rates in the period of January 2014 to April 2015, Mei 2015 to March 2016, April 2016 to March 2017, and June 2017 to February 2018 arc 0.86 m(3)/sec, 0.59 m(3)/sec, 0.36 m(3)/ sec, and 0.25 m(3)/sec, respectively. Assuming no new intrusion or deformation rate changes, the lava discharge will be in the lowest rate in the early 2020s.

TI  - A New Retrieval of Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence in Water from Ocean Colour Measurements Applied on OLCI L-1b and L-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is greatly beneficial to studies of marine phytoplankton biomass, physiology, and composition, and is required for user applications and services. Customarily phytoplankton chlorophyll fluorescence is determined from satellite measurements through a fluorescence line-height algorithm using three bands around 680 nm. We propose here a modified retrieval, making use of all available bands in the relevant wavelength range, with the goal to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm in optically complex waters. For the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), we quantify a Fluorescence Peak Height by fitting a Gaussian function and related terms to the top-of-atmosphere reflectance bands between 650 and 750 nm. This algorithm retrieves, what we call Fluorescence Peak Height by fitting a Gaussian function upon other terms to top-of-atmosphere reflectance bands between 650 and 750 nm. This approach is applicable to Level-1 and Level-2 data. We find a good correlation of the retrieved fluorescence product to global in-situ chlorophyll measurements, as well as a consistent relation between chlorophyll concentration and fluorescence from radiative transfer modelling and OLCI/in-situ comparison. Evidence suggests, the algorithm is applicable to complex waters without needing an atmospheric correction and vicarious calibration, and features an inherent correction of small spectral shifts, as required for OLCI measurements.

TI  - Regional Level Data Server for Fire Hazard Evaluation and Fuel Treatments Planning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Both fire risk assessment and management of wildfire prevention strategies require different sources of data to represent the complex geospatial interaction that exists between environmental variables in the most accurate way possible. In this sense, geospatial analysis tools and remote sensing data offer new opportunities for estimating fire risk and optimizing wildfire prevention planning. Herein, we presented a conceptual design of a server that contained most variables required for predicting fire behavior at a regional level. For that purpose, an innovative and elaborated fuel modelling process and parameterization of all needed environmental and climatic variables were implemented in order to enable to more precisely define fuel characteristics and potential fire behaviors under different meteorological scenarios. The server, open to be used by scientists and technicians, is expected to be the steppingstone for an integrated tool to support decision-making regarding prevention and management of forest fires in Catalonia.

TI  - Algorithm for the Atmospheric Correction of Shortwave Channels of the MSU-MR Radiometer of the Meteor-M No. 2 Satellite
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of atmospheric correction for shortwave channels of a multispectral low-resolution scanning radiometer onboard the Meteor-M No. 2 satellite is considered. The existing atmospheric correction algorithms are analyzed. An atmospheric correction algorithm is developed based on special lookup tables (LUTs) generated by the authors. The LUTs contain information about the reflectance of the radiometer channels for different atmospheric conditions and observation geometry. The results of atmospheric correction have been validated for the first channel of the radiometer. The validation showed a high correlation with the reference reflectance taken from the Surface Albedo Validation Sites EUMETSAT portal. The algorithm has been additionally validated with the data from the first channel of the AVHRR radiometer onboard the MetOp-A satellite. The correlation between the reference values and the results of atmospheric correction are comparable for both radiometers.

TI  - Analysis of the Informativity of Big Satellite Precision-Farming Data Processing for Correcting Large-Scale Soil Maps
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale soil maps produced by research institutes for land management (GIPROZEM) are the main source of soil information on arable land in Russia. These maps date back to the 1960s-1990s. During the time that has passed since the last round of soil surveys, the development of precision farming has greatly increased the requirements for the accuracy of the maps. At present, archival soil maps require correction (verification, updating, detailing, and unification). It is suggested that the maps of stable intrafield heterogeneity (SIFH) of soil fertility based on the analysis of big remote sensing data can find application in modern agriculture. Such maps are created within the framework of the general concept of big data analysis, including big geodata and big agricultural data as its components. Comparative analysis of archival soil maps and the SIFH map for the territory of southern Russia attests to the great potential of SIFH maps for soil mapping. Missing soil polygons have been detected, the location of existing soil polygons has been refined, new soil units not marked on archival soil maps have been identified, and a plan for additional soil surveys within the framework of the data-driven geography concept has been worked out. The accuracy of the soil map has been improved to be applicable to state-of-the-art farming systems, including precision farming. A new source of information on the spatial heterogeneity of the soil cover and its fertility has appeared.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography for detection of cutaneous angiosarcoma of the scalp: A case report
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare neoplasm. One important predictor of recurrence is the resection margin; however, identifying the tissue area containing malignant cells is difficult. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) has been used to identify superficial malignancies, including malignant tumors in the liver and sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. ICG-FA is also used to identify and define the resection margin of cutaneous angiosarcomas. However, there are currently only a few reports on the application of ICG-FA for detecting cutaneous angiosarcomas. We report a case of cutaneous angiosarcoma in the scalp in which one lesion, located in the parietal scalp, showed high fluorescence intensity corresponding exactly with the lesion was defined by physical examination, whereas the malignant area of the second lesion, located in the occipital scalp, was revealed more accurately by ICG-FA than by physical examination. Further, the second lesion was the first case diagnosed as angiosarcoma by the limited-area biopsy for a high-intensity area of ICG-FA. By determining where ICG is located within cutaneous angiosarcomas and quantitating the ICG intensity level corresponding to the malignant area, ICG-FA could be a promising tool for identifying cutaneous angiosarcomas.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers the best-known tools for linguistic and statistical analysis of text corpora and introduces the RSA machine, which is a novel text analysis tool for socio-humanitarian research. The machine architecture and developing tools of the RSA machine are described. The results of a pilot study of texts using the RSA machine are presented. The pilot study of the capabilities of the new tool was carried out on the basis of 142 essay texts written on the theme "I. Others. World." The performed correlation analysis revealed some relations between extracted texts attributes detected using the RSA machine (e.g. the frequency of predicate types and syntaxeme types) and psychodiagnostic research data, in particular, that on the level of aggressiveness. A scheme for interpreting predicate analysis data is proposed, which allows us to describe the specifics of speech-cognitive activity and worldview depending on the group and personal characteristics of the authors of the texts.

TI  - Agricultural crop discrimination in a heterogeneous low-mountain range region based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type information such as its location and spatial distribution is relevant for agricultural planning and decision making about food sustainability and security. This information can be obtained through the analysis of images obtained through optical satellite remote sensing. Activities such as accurate discrimination of crops require dense time-series of satellite data which can capture the diverse crop phenology. However, given the presence of clouds at important periods of crops' development, the required time-series is impossible to obtain from just one optical satellite sensor. The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project by NASA provides fused data from both Operational Land Imager and Multispectral Instrument optical sensors of Landsat and Sentinel systems respectively. The present study used a multi-temporal HLS data and a target-oriented cross-validation (TOV) modelling approach with random forest algorithm to discriminate 13 crop types. 15 phenological metrics derived from time-series HLS data, together with 48 spectral and 2 topographic information were used as predictors in the model. A forward feature selection (FFS) procedure of the TOV was used to improve the classification model. 16 predictors comprising of spectral, phenological and topographic information were selected as useful for the crop discrimination. An independent accuracy assessment of the final model based on the selected predictors by the FFS procedure resulted in an overall accuracy of 76%. While most of the crop classes, achieved higher producer's and user's accuracies (>80%), the discrimination accuracies of potato, summer oat and winter triticale were comparatively low (<60%). Based on the outcome of the FFS, three models consisting of different predictor combinations, were further developed to ascertain the contribution of the predictors. A comparison of the models showed that the addition of phenological metrics increased the discrimination performance of the model as a whole and for cereals in particular. However, the inclusion of the topographic information did not have any significant effect on the overall model performance. Therefore, future crop type discrimination research in areas with similar terrain characteristics like Northern Hesse should reconsider the use of topographic predictors. Overall, our findings depict that the TOV modelling approach based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor data is promising for effective, accurate and practical crop type discrimination.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Symposium on Flame Retardants
CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - Fecal matter is a useful noninvasive/nondestructive media for evaluating contaminants in wildlife, as residues therein have been observed to correlate with body burdens. Conservation detection doghandler teams can be used to optimize the acquisition of fecal samples. To build on previous work, sentinel-species' (i.e. mink (Mustela vison) and otter (Lontra canadensis)) fecal matter was opportunistically located by a detection dog team along the tri-river system of Missoula, Montana, USA. Sediments were also collected. Samples were used to develop an analytical method from fecal matter to determine habitat exposure to the brominated flame-retardants (BFRs): polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), 2-ethylhexyl 2, 3, 4, 5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB), di (2-ethylhexyl)-2, 3, 4, 5-tetrabromophthalate (BEH-TEBP) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE). Sediments contained PBDEs (BDE-99 and BDE-209) and EH-TBB at detection rates of 67%, 33% and 67%, respectively. BDE-99, -209 and EH-TBB were also detected in mink and otter feces, at rates of 81%, 25% and 81%, respectively; plus BEH-TEBP at 13%. BFR levels correlated positively with human population density except along the lower Bitterroot River, where BDE-209 sediment and feces levels exceeded other sites by several orders of magnitude. Fecal matter body burden estimates indicated marginal PBDE exposure. However, exposure to their replacements, EH-TBB and BEH-TEBP, were at levels that may adversely affect healthy Mustelidae populations. Proof-of-concept was achieved; validation results were within established standards for the development of analytical methods. The established application of conservation dog-handler teams to facilitate the collection of fecal matter for BFR analysis represents a valuable, but currently underutilized environmental monitoring tool.

TI  - The epidemiology of seasonal influenza after the 2009 influenza pandemic in Africa: a systematic review
T2  - AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Influenza infection is a serious public health problem that causes an estimated 3 to 5 million cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide every year. The epidemiology of influenza is well-documented in high-and middle-income countries, however minimal effort had been made to understand the epidemiology, burden and seasonality of influenza in Africa. This study aims to assess the state of knowledge of seasonal influenza epidemiology in Africa and identify potential data gaps for policy formulation following the 2009 pandemic.Method: We reviewed articles from Africa published into four databases namely: MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Scientific Research Publishing from 2010 to 2019.Results: We screened titles and abstracts of 2070 studies of which 311 were selected for full content evaluation and 199 studies were considered. Selected articles varied substantially on the basis of the topics they addressed covering the field of influenza surveillance (n=80); influenza risk factors and co-morbidities (n=15); influenza burden (n=37); influenza vaccination (n=40); influenza and other respiratory pathogens (n=22) and influenza diagnosis (n=5).Conclusion: Significant progress has been made since the last pandemic in understanding the influenza epidemiology in Africa. However, efforts still remain for most countries to have sufficient data to allow countries to prioritize strategies for influenza prevention and control.

TI  - Land surface temperature and land cover dynamics. A study related to Sardinia, Italy
T2  - TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at analyzing analogies and differences between the spatial relations regarding land surface temperature (LST) and land covers in May and August 2019. Land cover data are drawn from the most updated spatial datasets available from Copernicus, while LST is retrieved from Landsat 8 satellite images made available by the U.S. Geological Survey. The methodology couples GIS spatial analysis and regression analysis; the latter is used to implement spatial inferential analysis as regards LST. Moreover, on the basis of a "what if" assessment, the impact of future afforestation, as regards rural areas, is detected with respect to decrease in LST, building on the outcomes of the model which relates LST to land cover types. The Sardinian region is taken as case study because its climate homogeneity and its self-containment allow for a pretty straightforward identification of the regional boundaries. The correlation between the spatial distribution of LST and land cover reveals, in the two time periods, that urbanization and the spatial dynamics of heating phenomena are closely connected. The methodology can be easily implemented in other regional contexts, and comparison of analogies and differences are quite effective and useful in identifying stylized facts and policy implications.

TI  - Understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982-2014
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comment on "Pre-Collapse Space Geodetic Observations of Critical Infrastructure: The Morandi Bridge, Genoa, Italy" by Milillo et al. (2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - We present in this comment a Multi-Temporal SAR Interferometry (MT-InSAR) analysis showing that the results published by Milillo et al. (2019) in the Remote Sensing Journal, presenting the evidence of space geodetic observations relevant to displacements occurring before the collapse of the Morandi Bridge, happened in Genova (Italy) on the 14 August 2018, are questionable. In particular, we focus on the InSAR results obtained by Milillo et al. (2019) by processing the 3 m x 3 m resolution COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) data collected from ascending and descending orbits on the area of interest. These results, thanks to the high spatial resolution and the short revisit time characterizing this multi-orbit SAR dataset, represent the cornerstone of their analysis. The main findings of their study allow Milillo et al. to conclude that the InSAR processing of this COSMO-SkyMed dataset reveals the increased deformation magnitude over time of points located near the strands of the deck next to the collapsed pier, between 12 March 2017 and August 2018. In this comment, we show the results obtained by the IREA-CNR SAR team after processing the same ascending and descending CSK dataset, but by using two alternative and independent processing techniques: the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) and the Advanced Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) approaches, respectively. Our analysis shows that, although both the SBAS and the TomoSAR analyses allow achieving denser coherent pixel maps relevant to the Morandi bridge, nothing of the pre-collapse large displacements reported in Milillo et al. (2019) appears in our results, leading us to deeply disagree with the findings of their InSAR analysis.

TI  - Identification of "Growth" and "Shrinkage" Pattern and Planning Strategies for Shrinking Cities Based on a Spatial Perspective of the Pearl River Delta Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are two opposing trends in urban development: one is the exponential growth of cities and the other is shrinking cities," which are characterized by a decrease in number of residents. Since the 2008 financial crisis, there have been great changes in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), where growing and shrinking areas coexist. In this paper, we analyze cities' growth and shrinkage in respect of urban construction and economic vitality in the PRD in spatial term. Thus, we define land use changes in urban construction to characterize growth by using Landsat Thematic Mapper data on urban built-up areas of the PRD region in 2000, 2009, and 2013; and we characterize economic activities for vitality by using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System nighttime light data in various years after time continuous correction and vegetation correction, in combination with population data. Four different types of space are identified in this region, namely continuous growth, transformational growth, stationary, and shrinkage. This paper provides policy recommendations and planning strategies for the future development of shrinking cities in China. Shrinkage is considered to be only a short-term stage in the urbanization process faced by most cities in China and abroad. Technological progress and industrial transformation are likely to be critical factors affecting the direction of urban development, where cities can resume growth from shrinkage by revitalizing manufacturing industry and economic activities through education, innovation, and technology.

TI  - Terrain Mapping of LandSat8 Images using MNF and Classifying Soil Properties using Ensemble Modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional technique for determining the soil texture and other soil properties is performed in laboratory which is a time consuming task. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are deployed to classify the soil texture and its properties without any intervention of laboratory equipment using the satellite images recorded by Landsat 8. These images are used to extract the terrain properties of the region which is integrated with weather data for the specific region and the vegetation index which are the major factors affecting the soil condition. A major aim of this paper is to design a robust technique for extracting, transforming Landsat images to numerical data and pre-processing the data for classifying the soil property. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) is utilized to segregate and remove noise from the Landsat images for subsequent processing. A significant amount of noise is present in the raw data which affects the accuracy of the analysis. Terrain features are extracted after noise removal from the MNF transformed images and merged with the weather data, and vegetation index for a period of time and then classified using voting classifier of the ensemble modeling or analysis of the soil texture of the region. The voting is performed by integrating the results of logistic regression, support vector machine and decision tree. With this study, the consolidated dependence of the soil texture on the environmental factors is analyzed and a cross validation accuracy of 94.44% is obtained.

TI  - The Use of Mini-Drifters in Coastal Current Measurements Conducted Concurrently with Satellite Imaging
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of field measurements of coastal currents using Lagrangian mini-drifters are presented. The drifter experiments were conducted concurrently with satellite imaging using Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, and Sentinel-3 OLCI sensors. It is shown that the use of an inexpensive and simple-to-manufacture device such as a mini-drifter allows one to obtain operational information about the parameters of coastal currents. In experiments conducted in April-May 2019 in the northeastern part of the Black Sea, it was possible to estimate the velocity of coastal currents and determine the minimum distance that the Black Sea Rim Current approached the coast. The trajectories of mini-drifters have revealed the manifestations of inertial oscillations whose spatial characteristics are almost impossible to measure in any other way. The influence of the vortex structures detected in visible satellite images on the distribution of mini-drifters is estimated.

TI  - Cellular and molecular complementary immune stress markers for the model species <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to combine cellular and molecular analyses for better detail the effects of various stresses on a sentinel species of freshwater invertebrate. For this purpose, the hemocytes of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, were exposed to different stresses at two different intensities, high or low: chemical (cadmium and ionomycin), physical (ultraviolet B), or biological ones (Cryptosporidium parvum and Toxoplasma gondii). After exposure, flow cytometry and droplet digital PCR analyses were performed on the same pools of hemocytes. Several responses related to necrosis, apoptosis, phagocytosis, production of nitric oxide and expression level of several genes related to the antioxidant, detoxification and immune systems were evaluated. Results showed that hemocyte integrity was compromised by both chemical and physical stress, and cellular markers of phagocytosis reacted to ionomycin and protozoa. While cadmium induced oxidative stress and necrosis, ionomycin tends to modulate the immune response of hemocytes. Although both biological stresses led to a similar immune response, C. parvum oocysts induced more effects than T. gondii, notably through the expression of effector caspases gene and an increase in hemocyte necrosis. This suggests different management of the two protozoa by the cell. This work provides new knowledge of biomarkers in the zebra mussel, at both cellular and molecular levels, and contributes to elucidate the mechanisms of action of different kinds of stress in this species.

TI  - Determining the Concentration of Suspended Sediment in the Lower Day River (Northern Vietnam) Using MSI Sentinel 2 High Spatial Resolution Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of suspended sediment is an important parameter in assessing the quality of surface waters. Many studies have shown that reflectance from remote sensing data is strongly related to the concentration of suspended sediment. Results are presented from determining the concentration of suspended sediment in the surface water of Day River in northern Vietnam using Sentinel 2 multispectral images with a spatial resolution of 10 meters. The reflectance of the water's surface, calculated on the basis of the visible and near-infrared channels of the Sentinel 2 image, are compared to in situ data. Regression models are developed on the basis of relationship between the reflectance and the concentration of suspended sediment. The best linear equation among the models is chosen to quantitatively assess the pollution of surface water in this river basin. The results can be used to monitor, evaluate, and manage the quality of surface water.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy and Clinical Impact of Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling in Endometrial Cancer at High Risk of Recurrence: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose. To assess the value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling in high risk endometrial cancer according to the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO classification. Methods. We performed a comprehensive search on PubMed for clinical trials evaluating SLN sampling in patients with high risk endometrial cancer: stage I endometrioid, grade 3, with at least 50% myometrial invasion, regardless of lymphovascular space invasion status; or stage II; or node-negative stage III endometrioid, no residual disease; or non-endometrioid (serous or clear cell or undifferentiated carcinoma, or carcinosarcoma). All patients underwent SLN sampling followed by pelvic with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Results. We included 17 original studies concerning 1322 women. Mean detection rates were 89% for unilateral and 68% for bilateral. Pooled sensitivity was 88.5% (95%CI: 81.2-93.2%), negative predictive value was 96.0% (95%CI: 93.1-97.7%), and false negative rate was 11.5% (95%CI: 6.8; 18.8%). We noted heterogeneity in SLN techniques between studies, concerning the tracer and its detection, the injection site, the number of injections, and the surgical approach. Finally, we found a correlation between the number of patients included and the SLN sampling performances. Discussion. This meta-analysis estimated the SLN sampling performances in high risk endometrial cancer patients. Data from the literature show the feasibility, the safety, the limits, and the impact on surgical de-escalation of this technique. In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis that SLN sampling could be a valuable technique to diagnose lymph node involvement for patients with high risk endometrial cancer in replacement of conventional lymphadenectomy. Consequently, randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Complications and outcomes following inguinal lymphadenectomy for malignant melanoma in an Asian population.
T2  - Korean journal of clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Purpose: Melanoma is a potentially fatal cutaneous malignancy and regional lymph node (LN) metastases are the most important predictors of mortality. This study aimed to analyze clinical features and risk factors of complications associated with inguinal LN dissection (LND) to establish treatment protocols.Methods: This single-center retrospective study (2000 to 2018) consisted of patients who underwent inguinal area sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) or LND due to malignant melanoma. Risk factors and outcomes were analyzed.Results: One hundred patients underwent SLNB alone (n=67; patients with negative SLNB), complete LND (CLND) after positive SLNB (n=19), or radical LND without SLNB (n=14). Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates among these groups were 87.3%, 57.4%, and 61.9%, and 59.0%, 22.7%, and 28.1%, respectively. The complication rate in the SLNB alone group was lower than the other groups (22.4% vs. 47.4% and 35.7%, respectively; P=0.048). Seroma was the most common complication in the SLNB alone group (15.0%); lymphedema was most common in the CLND after SLNB group (21.1%). Multivariate analysis of risk factors for postoperative complications found the hazard ratio for body mass index >28 kg/m2 was 4.376 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.243-15.401; P=0.022). The hazard ratio for LND (including CLND after SLNB and radical LND without SLNB) was 3.263 (95% CI, 1.248-8.529; P=0.016).Conclusion: Inguinal LND is a higher risk procedure compared to SLNB and other sites for postoperative complications, irrespective of meticulous surgical techniques. More studies are needed to establish treatment protocols (e.g., observation vs. CLND after a positive SLNB result) and the risks and benefits in Asian populations.

TI  - The roles of cultural worldview and authenticity in tourists' decision-making process in a heritage tourism destination using a model of goal-directed behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF DESTINATION MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although cultural worldview and authenticity have been suggested to be important concepts, little research has been conducted to explore their roles in the decision-making process for visiting heritage destinations. Thus, this study developed a theoretical framework using an extended model of goal-directed behavior (MGB) to determine whether cultural worldview and authenticity play important roles in understanding the decision-making process. An onsite survey was conducted for tourists (n = 323) who visited Hankok (traditional Korean house) village. Results revealed that both cultural worldview and authenticity influence tourists' decision-making process using MGB with authenticity having a greater impact on the process than cultural worldview. Results also revealed that both cultural worldview and authenticity are indirectly related to desire and behavioral intention. Desire was also found to play an important mediating role between antecedents of MGB and behavioral intention. It is believed the results provide important theoretical and managerial implications related to heritage tourists' decision-making process.

TI  - Increased mast cell density is associated with decreased fibrosis in human atrial tissue
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fibrotic remodelling of the atria is poorly understood and can be regulated by myocardial immune cell populations after injury. Mast cells are resident immune sentinel cells present in the heart that respond to tissue damage and have been linked to fibrosis in other settings. The role of cardiac mast cells in fibrotic remodelling in response to human myocardial injury is controversial. In this study, we sought to determine the association between mast cells, atrial fibrosis, and outcomes in a heterogeneous population of cardiac surgical patients, including a substantial proportion of coronary artery bypass grafting patients. Atrial appendage from patients was assessed for collagen and mast cell density by histology and by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) for mast cell associated transcripts. Clinical variables and outcomes were also followed. Mast cells were detected in human atrial tissue at varying densities. Histological and ddPCR assessment of mast cells in atrial tissue were closely correlated. Patients with high mast cell density had less fibrosis and lower severity of heart failure classification or incidence mortality than patients with low mast cell content. Analysis of a homogeneous population of coronary artery bypass graft patients yielded similar observations. Therefore, evidence from this study suggests that increased atrial mast cell populations are associated with decreased clinical cardiac fibrotic remodelling and improved outcomes, in cardiac surgery patients.

TI  - The abundance and diversity of grasshopper communities in relation to elevation and land use in Malang, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological factors include interactions of the community members with numerous biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, light intensity, and seasonality show an altitudinal gradient. Most grasshopper species play a role as herbivores and are a good source of protein for other animals such as amphibians, small reptiles, birds, and small mammals. This study aimed to analyze variations in the abundance, richness, and diversity of grasshopper species along an altitudinal gradient. This research was conducted in five locations in Malang District, East Java, Indonesia, namely Bantur, Sumber Pujung Lawang, Pujon, and Poncokusumo. Grasshopper sampling was carried out by the sweeping method using an insect net. Sweepings were carried out on four plots with each plot size of 2 x 10 m<sup>2</sup>. Sampling was conducted four times from June to August 2020. The data were analyzed using the Shannon Wiener index (diversity analysis) and the Bray-Curtis index. The differences between locations were tested by one-way analysis of variance. Land use was analyzed by ArcGIS, using Landsat imagery 8. The abundance of grasshoppers had a significant negative correlation with elevation. That correlation was positive to species richness and diversity of grasshoppers. That with species diversity was significant, while that with species richness was not significant. The greatest abundance of the grasshopper was found in the middle elevation in Lawang (19.39 [plus or minus] 2.12). In contrast, the highest species richness and diversity were found in the highest elevation in Poncokusumo (richness = 15.75 [plus or minus] 1.60 and H '= 2.58 [plus or minus] 0.11). Land use variation was not significant on abundance, species, richness, and diversity of grasshoppers. Interestingly, the high similarity of the grasshopper compositions in low elevation habitats was detected, indicating that land use in the low land area was remarkable. The abundance of grasshopper had a significant positive correlation with temperature but negatively correlated with humidity. There was no significant correlation among species richness, species diversity with temperature and humidity.

TI  - Assessing Worldview-3 multispectral imaging abilities to map the tree diversity in semi-arid parklands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid parkland agrosystems are strongly sensitive to climate change and anthropic pressure. In the context of sustainability research, trees are considered critical for various ecosystem services covering environment quality as well as food security and health. But their actual ecological impact on both cropland and natural vegetation is not well understood yet, and collecting spatial and structural information around agroforestry systems is becoming an important issue. Tree mapping in semi-arid parklands could be one of these prerequisites. While for obtaining an exhaustive inventory of individual trees and for analysing their spatial distribution, remote sensing is the ideal tool. However, it has been noted that depending on the spatial resolution and sensor spectral characteristics, tree species cannot be distinguished clearly, even in the sparsely vegetated semi-arid ecosystems of West Africa. Thus, this work focuses on assessing the capabilities of Worldview-3 imagery, acquired in 8 spectral bands, to detect, delineate, and identify certain key tree species in the Faidherbia albida parkland in Bambey, Senegal, based on a ground-truth database corresponding to 5000 trees. The tree crowns are delineated through NDVI thresholding and consecutive filtering to provide object-based radiometric signatures, radiometric indices, and textural information. A factorial discriminant analysis is then performed, which indicates that only four out of the seven most abundant species in the study area can be discriminated: "Faidherbia albida"," Azadirachta indica", "Balanites aegyptiaca" and "Tamarindus indica". Next, random forest and support vector machine classifiers are employed to identify the optimal combination of classifier parameters to discriminate these classes with a high accuracy, robustness, and stability. The linear support vector machine with cost = 1 and gamma = 0.01 provides the optimal results with a global accuracy of 88 % and kappa of 0.71. This classifier is applied to the whole study area to map all the trees with crowns larger than 2 m, sorted in four identified species and a fifth common group of unidentified species. This map thus enables analysing the variability in tree density and the spatial distribution of different species. Such information can afterwards be correlated to the ecological functioning of the parkland and local practices, and offers promising opportunities to help future sustainability initiatives in different socio-ecological contexts.

T2  - CURRENT TRANSPLANTATION REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review Skin provides a window into the health of an individual. Using transplanted skin as a monitor can provide a powerful tool for surveillance of rejection in a transplant. The purpose of this review is to provide relevant background to the role of skin in vascularized transplantation medicine. Recent Findings Discrete populations of T memory cells provide distributed immune protection in skin, and cycle between skin, lymph nodes, and blood. Skin-resident T-REG cells proliferate in response to inflammation and contribute to long-term VCA survival in small animal models. Early clinical studies show sentinel flap rejection to correlate well with facial VCA skin rejection, and abdominal wall rejection demonstrates concordance with visceral rejection, but further studies are required. This review focuses on the immunology of skin, skin rejection in vascularized composite allografts, and the recent advances in monitoring the health of transplanted tissues using distant "sentinel" flaps.

TI  - From town to town: Predicting the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds using NDVI
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity mapping in urban areas is imperative for their conservation. Remote sensors produce environmental information, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation cover in urban areas. NDVI can be used to predict the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic bird diversity in urban areas. Moreover, a predictive model constructed in one city can be used to predict the bird diversity in other cities. The objectives of this study were: 1) to construct and evaluate predictive models between NDVI and taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds in Mar del Plata city, Argentina; and 2) to extrapolate these models to two other cities in the region: Balcarce and Miramar. Generalized additive models were applied to relate bird diversity variations to NDVI. In Mar del Plata, the taxonomic and functional diversity increased with increasing NDVI values, and the predictive models explained 64-81% of the taxonomic and functional diversity variation. The models correctly predicted taxonomic and functional diversity values in additional transects not included in the models, although they had a low predictive power of phylogenetic diversity. The models constructed in Mar del Plata adequately predicted the spatial variation of species diversity (Shannon index) in Balcarce and Miramar, the spatial variation of species richness in Balcarce, and the variation of functional diversity in Miramar. Our analysis revealed that a predictive model of bird diversity based on NDVI patterns created in one city can also depict the expected species diversity in other cities, being a time-saving and cost-effective method to create a tool for urban biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Estimating rice paddy areas in China using multi-temporal cloud-free normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) imagery based on change detection
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial pattern of rice paddies is an essential parameter used for studies of greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural resource management, and environmental monitoring. On large spatial scales, previous studies have usually mapped rice paddies using a single vegetation index product based on a traditional classification method, or a combined analysis of various vegetation and water indices derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. However, different indices increase the computational cost and constrain the satellite data sources, and traditional classification methods (e.g., maximum likelihood classification) may be time-consuming and difficult to carry out over a large area like China. In this study, we designed an auto-thresholding and single vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI))-based procedure to estimate the spatial distribution of rice paddies in China. The MOD09Q1 product, which was available at MODIS's highest spatial resolution (250 m), was taken as the input source. An auto-threshold function was also introduced into the change detection process to distinguish rice paddies from other croplands. Our MODIS-derived maps were validated with ground surveys and then compared with China national statistical data of rice paddy areas. The results indicated that the best classification result was achieved for plain regions, and that the accuracy declined for hilly regions, where the complex landscape could lead to an underestimation of the rice paddy area. A comparison between the modeled results and other analyses using 500-m MODIS data suggests that rice paddies may be identified routinely using a single vegetation index with finer resolution on large spatial scales.

TI  - Changes in grassland cover and in its spatial heterogeneity indicate degradation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid grassland ecosystems undergo degradation because of increasing environmental and human pressures. Degraded grasslands show vegetation cover reduction and soil-patch development, leading to grassland fragmentation and changes in spatial heterogeneity. Understanding grassland degradation that involves soil-patch development remains a challenge over large areas with limited accessibility such as the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We hypothesized that vegetation cover, its spatial heterogeneity and changes thereof over time retrieved from satellite data can indicate grassland development and degradation levels. To test the hypothesis, we studied these indicators from 2000 to 2016 and related them to previously described degradation levels on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) in 2004. We further use these indicators to map the new grassland development and degradation levels in 2016.We found that lower vegetation cover does not always indicate a more severe degradation; instead, higher spatial heterogeneity is a better correlate of degradation. Combined temporal changes in grassland cover and its spatial heterogeneity are related to the literature-defined degradation levels. We found that grassland areas on the eastern QTP have moved into new degradation stages from 2000 to 2016 using changes in grassland cover and its spatial heterogeneity as indicators. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for grassland cover declined over time in the literature-defined degraded areas but increased in the desert areas from 2000 to 2016. Spatial heterogeneity generally increased across different degradation levels from 2000 to 2016; however, this increase was less pronounced in severely degraded and slightly deserted areas. Our newly defined degradation levels in 2016 included degradation, desertification, and improving levels. Across our study area, 63% of all areas were classified as degraded and 2% were at risk of desertification. The remaining areas (35%) classified as improving and re-growing occurred in higher-elevation or previously severely degraded grassland. Our study demonstrates that a combination of changes in grassland cover and in its spatial heterogeneity can indicate grassland degradation levels and serve as an early-warning signal for desertification threats.

TI  - Effects of Land Cover Changes on Net Primary Productivity in the Terrestrial Ecosystems of China from 2001 to 2012
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2001-2012 MODIS MCD12Q1 land cover data and MOD17A3 NPP data were used to calculate changes in land cover in China and annual changes in net primary productivity (NPP) during a 12-year period and to quantitatively analyze the effects of land cover change on the NPP of China's terrestrial ecosystems. The results revealed that during the study period, no changes in land cover type occurred in 7447.31 thousand km(2) of China, while the area of vegetation cover increased by 160.97 thousand km(2) in the rest of the country. Forest cover increased to 20.91%, which was mainly due to the conversion of large areas of savanna (345.19 thousand km(2)) and cropland (178.96 thousand km(2)) to forest. During the 12-year study period, the annual mean NPP of China was 2.70 PgC and increased by 0.25 PgC, from 2.50 to 2.75 PgC. Of this change, 0.21 PgC occurred in areas where there was no land cover change, while 0.04 PgC occurred in areas where there was land cover change. The contributions of forest and cropland to NPP exhibited increasing trends, while the contributions of shrubland and grassland to NPP decreased. Among these land cover types, the contributions of forest and cropland to the national NPP were the greatest, accounting for 40.97% and 27.95%, respectively, of the annual total NPP. There was no significant correlation between changes in forest area and changes in total annual NPP (R-2 < 0.1), while the correlation coefficient for changes in cropland area and total annual NPP was 0.48. Additionally, the area of cropland converted to other land cover types was negatively correlated with the changes in NPP, and the loss of cropland caused a reduction in the national NPP.

TI  - An Approach to High-Resolution Rice Paddy Mapping Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 SAR Data in the Mun River Basin, Thailand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate regional rice paddy monitoring plays a significant role in maintaining the sustainable rice production, food security, and agricultural development. This study proposes an operational automatic approach to mapping rice paddies using time-series SAR data. The proposed method integrates time-series Sentinel-1 data, auxiliary data of global surface water, and rice phenological characteristics with Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. A total of 402 Sentinel-1 scenes from 2017 were used for mapping rice paddies extent in the Mun River basin. First, the calculated minimum and maximum values of the backscattering coefficient of permanent water (a classification type within global surface water data) in a year was used as the threshold range for extracting the potential extent. Then, three rice phenological characteristics were extracted based on the time-series curve of each pixel, namely the date of the beginning of the season (DBS), date of maximum backscatter during the peak growing season (DMP), and length of the vegetative stage (LVS). After setting a threshold for each phenological parameter, the final rice paddy extent was identified. Rice paddy map produced in this study was highly accurate and agreed well with field plot data and rice map products from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The results had a total accuracy of 89.52% and an F1 score of 0.91, showing that the spatiotemporal pattern of extracted rice cover was consistent with ground truth samples in the Mun River basin. This approach could be expanded to other rice-growing regions at the national scale, or even the entire Indochina Peninsula and Southeast Asia.

TI  - Digital Elevation Models for topographic characterisation and flood flow modelling along low-gradient, terminal dryland rivers: A comparison of spaceborne datasets for the Rio Colorado, Bolivia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many dryland rivers are terminal systems, with small channels undergoing prominent downstream size reductions before ending on channelless floodplains, in wetlands, or at playa margins. Spaceborne Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) provide potential for assessing subtle topographic and hydrodynamic changes in these low-gradient, low-relief settings, but challenges are posed by limitations in vertical and horizontal accuracy. This study evaluates the use of different spaceborne DEMs for topographic characterisation and flood flow modelling of the low-gradient ( < 0.0006 m m(-1)) Rio Colorado terminal system, Bolivia. A comparison between DEM and field dGPS elevation data (1290 measurement points) reveals that the TanDEM-X DEM 12 m (TDX-12 m) has a RMSE of 0.47 m, far less than those of other frequently used spacebome DEMs such as ALOS RTC (4.58 m) and SRTM (6.02 m). For hydrodynamic modelling, TDX-12 m data were smoothed (adaptive filter and feature-preserving DEM smoothing) and upscaled. The smoothed TDX-12 m data were mosaiced with a dGPS data-derived river path, surveyed along a reach (mean width < 30 m) with a prominent downstream size decrease. The methods enabled effective de-noising of the TDX-12 m data (RMSE 0.29 m) and resulted in a high linear regression correlation coefficient (0.75). HEC-RAS 2D modelling reveals that in the selected reach, overbank flooding starts in the downstream part when discharge is < 18 m(3)/s, with flow initially spreading through crevasse channels and levee topographic lows. As discharge increases, flow spreads farther across the floodplain, ultimately forming connected floodplain flow in distal topographic lows. Satellite imagery and a derived water index indicate the same floodplain flow patterns as the modelling (critical success index 0.77). Wider use of DEMs based on TDX-12 m data for topographic characterization and flood flow modelling along relatively small, low-gradient terminal dryland rivers will result in many scientific and applied benefits.

TI  - Evaluation of the version 5.0 global land surface satellite (GLASS) leaf area index product derived from MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index (LAI) product is one of the most widely used global LAI products in the scientific community. The latest (version 5) GLASS LAI product has been generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the quality of the version 5 GLASS LAI product. The GLASS LAI product was compared with the latest MODIS LAI product (MCD15A2 H, Collection 6) and the second version of Geoland2 (GEOV2) LAI product to evaluate their temporal and spatial discrepancies. A direct validation was conducted to compare these LAI products to the LAI values derived from the high-resolution reference maps from the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI) and Implementing Multi-Scale Agricultural Indicators Exploiting Sentinels (IMAGINES) sites. The results show that the GLASS and GEOV2 LAI products have great spatial integrity. However, the MODIS LAI product contains many missing pixels in tropical areas. These LAI products follow fairly consistent seasonal characteristics. The spatial discrepancies of these LAI products mainly exist in forest areas, especially evergreen broadleaf forests where the GLASS LAI values are generally lower than the GEOV2 LAI values by approximately 1.0 LAI units and lower than the MODIS LAI values by 0.5 to 1.0 LAI units. The spatial distribution of these LAI products has slight discrepancies in savannahs, broadleaf crops, grasses/cereal crops and shrubs. The GLASS and GEOV2 LAI products capture a complete and reasonable temporal profile, contrasting with the MODIS LAI product, which shows dramatic fluctuations, particularly during the growing seasons. These LAI products show similar temporal trajectories and interannual variations for all biome types except evergreen broadleaf forests. The direct validation shows that the accuracy of the GLASS LAI product is better than the accuracy of the MODIS and GEOV2 LAI products. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the GLASS, MODIS and GEOV2 LAI products versus the LAI values derived from the high-resolution reference maps are 0.68, 0.47 and 0.55, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of these products are 0.86, 1.22 and 1.21, respectively.

TI  - Mapping Changing Population Distribution on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau since 2000 with Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing and Point-of-Interest Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced developments have been achieved in urban human population estimation, however, there is still a considerable research gap for the mapping of remote rural populations. In this study, based on demographic data at the town-level, multi-temporal high-resolution remote sensing data, and local population-sensitive point-of-interest (POI) data, we tailored a random forest-based dasymetric approach to map population distribution on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) for 2000, 2010, and 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1000 m. We then analyzed the temporal and spatial change of this distribution. The results showed that the QTP has a sparse population distribution overall; in large areas of the northern QTP, the population density is zero, accounting for about 14% of the total area of the QTP. About half of the QTP showed a rapid increase in population density between 2000 and 2016, mainly located in the eastern and southern parts of Qinghai Province and the central-eastern parts of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Regarding the relative importance of variables in explaining population density, the variables "Distance to Temples" is the most important, followed by "Density of Villages" and "Elevation". Furthermore, our new products exhibited higher accuracy compared with five recently released gridded population density datasets, namely WorldPop, Gridded Population of the World version 4, and three national gridded population datasets for China. Both the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for our products were about half of those of the compared products except for WorldPop. This study provides a reference for using fine-scale demographic count and local population-sensitive POIs to model changing population distribution in remote rural areas.

TI  - Ensemble-based deep learning for estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> over California with multisource big data including wildfire smoke
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Estimating PM2.5 concentrations and their prediction uncertainties at a high spatiotemporal resolution is important for air pollution health effect studies. This is particularly challenging for California, which has high variability in natural (e.g, wildfires, dust) and anthropogenic emissions, meteorology, topography (e.g. desert surfaces, mountains, snow cover) and land use.Methods: Using ensemble-based deep learning with big data fused from multiple sources we developed a PM2.5 prediction model with uncertainty estimates at a high spatial (1 km x 1 km) and temporal (weekly) resolution for a 10-year time span (2008-2017). We leveraged autoencoder-based full residual deep networks to model complex nonlinear interrelationships among PM2.5 emission, transport and dispersion factors and other influential features. These included remote sensing data (MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD), normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface), MERRA-2 GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) output, wildfire smoke plume dispersion, meteorology, land cover, traffic, elevation, and spatiotemporal trends (geo-coordinates, temporal basis functions, time index). As one of the primary predictors of interest with substantial missing data in California related to bright surfaces, cloud cover and other known interferences, missing MAIAC AOD observations were imputed and adjusted for relative humidity and vertical distribution. Wildfire smoke contribution to PM2.5 was also calculated through HYSPLIT dispersion modeling of smoke emissions derived from MODIS fire radiative power using the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 model.Results: Ensemble deep learning to predict PM2.5 achieved an overall mean training RMSE of 1.54 mu g/m3 (R2: 0.94) and test RMSE of 2.29 mu g/m(3) (R-2: 0.87). The top predictors included M2GMI carbon monoxide mixing ratio in the bottom layer, temporal basis functions, spatial location, air temperature, MAIAC AOD, and PM2.5 sea salt mass concentration. In an independent test using three long-term AQS sites and one short-term non-AQS site, our model achieved a high correlation (>0.8) and a low RMSE (<3 mu g/m(3)). Statewide predictions indicated that our model can capture the spatial distribution and temporal peaks in wildfire-related PM2.5. The coefficient of variation indicated highest uncertainty over deciduous and mixed forests and open water land covers.Conclusion: Our method can be generalized to other regions, including those having a mix of major urban areas, deserts, intensive smoke events, snow cover and complex terrains, where PM2.5 has previously been challenging to predict. Prediction uncertainty estimates can also inform further model development and measurement error evaluations in exposure and health studies.

TI  - Mapping Land Use from High Resolution Satellite Images by Exploiting the Spatial Arrangement of Land Cover Objects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information regarding the arrangement of land cover objects plays an important role in distinguishing the land use types at land parcel or local neighborhood levels. This study investigates the use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in order to characterize spatial arrangement features for land use classification from high resolution remote sensing images, with particular interest in comparing land use classifications between different graph-based methods and between different remote sensing images. We examine three kinds of graph-based methods, i.e., feature engineering, graph kernels, and GCNs. Based upon the extracted arrangement features and features regarding the spatial composition of land cover objects, we formulated ten land use classifications. We tested those on two different remote sensing images, which were acquired from GaoFen-2 (with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m) and ZiYuan-3 (of 2.5 m) satellites in 2020 on Fuzhou City, China. Our results showed that land use classifications that are based on the arrangement features derived from GCNs achieved the highest classification accuracy than using graph kernels and handcrafted graph features for both images. We also found that the contribution to separating land use types by arrangement features varies between GaoFen-2 and ZiYuan-3 images, due to the difference in the spatial resolution. This study offers a set of approaches for effectively mapping land use types from (very) high resolution satellite images.

TI  - Exploring suitable topographical factor conditions for vegetation growth in Wanhuigou catchment on the Loess Plateau, China: A new perspective for ecological protection and restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological degradation has become an important constraint to global socio-economic development. Therefore, ecological protection and restoration has received increasing attention. The important goal and the most direct effect of ecological protection and restoration are the vegetation restoration, which emphasizes the maximum or minimum range of NDVI of different vegetation types under specific terrain conditions. Based on the data of NDVI and topographic factors in a stable ecosystem, this paper comprehensively used descriptive statistics, multiple regression with interaction terms and threshold regression to analyze the spatial distribution of vegetation and its relationship with elevation, slope and aspect in the Wanhuigou catchment on the Loess Plateau. It showed that the NDVI values were high in the northwest and low in the southeast, and were generally consistent with the distribution of elevation. The change of NDVI with the slope was large, but the change with the aspect was not obvious. Meanwhile, the effect of elevation on NDVI would be limited by slope, but would not be affected by aspect; the positive effect of slope on NDVI would also be limited by the elevation and aspect. In addition, the influence of topographic factors on NDVI was non-linear, i.e. there was a threshold effect and different types of vegetation require different topographic factor conditions. Therefore, by rationally arranging the growth areas of different types of vegetation in accordance with the laws of topographic factor conditions, ecological protection and restoration could be more targeted to help build a stable ecosystem in areas with severe soil erosion such as the Wanhuigou catchment.

TI  - Uncertainties Analysis of Collapse Susceptibility Prediction Based on Remote Sensing and GIS: Influences of Different Data-Based Models and Connections between Collapses and Environmental Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the uncertainties of a collapse susceptibility prediction (CSP) under the coupled conditions of different data-based models and different connection methods between collapses and environmental factors, An'yuan County in China with 108 collapses is used as the study case, and 11 environmental factors are acquired by data analysis of Landsat TM 8 and high-resolution aerial images, using a hydrological and topographical spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in ArcGIS 10.2 software. Accordingly, 20 coupled conditions are proposed for CSP with five different connection methods (Probability Statistics (PSs), Frequency Ratio (FR), Information Value (IV), Index of Entropy (IOE) and Weight of Evidence (WOE)) and four data-based models (Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), C5.0 Decision Tree (C5.0 DT) and Random Forest (RF)). Finally, the CSP uncertainties are assessed using the area under receiver operation curve (AUC), mean value, standard deviation and significance test, respectively. Results show that: (1) the WOE-based models have the highest AUC accuracy, lowest mean values and average rank, and a relatively large standard deviation; the mean values and average rank of all the FR-, IV- and IOE-based models are relatively large with low standard deviations; meanwhile, the AUC accuracies of FR-, IV- and IOE-based models are consistent but higher than those of the PS-based model. Hence, the WOE exhibits a greater spatial correlation performance than the other four methods. (2) Among all the data-based models, the RF model has the highest AUC accuracy, lowest mean value and mean rank, and a relatively large standard deviation. The CSP performance of the RF model is followed by the C5.0 DT, MLR and AHP models, respectively. (3) Under the coupled conditions, the WOE-RF model has the highest AUC accuracy, a relatively low mean value and average rank, and a high standard deviation. The PS-AHP model is opposite to the WOE-RF model. (4) In addition, the coupled models show slightly better CSP performances than those of the single data-based models not considering connect methods. The CSP performance of the other models falls somewhere in between. It is concluded that the WOE-RF is the most appropriate coupled condition for CSP than the other models.

TI  - Monitoring and Landscape Dynamic Analysis of Alpine Wetland Area Based on Multiple Algorithms: A Case Study of Zoige Plateau
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of the wetland ecosystem, alpine wetland is not only one of the most important ecological water conservation areas in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, but is also an effective regulator of the local climate. In this study, using three machine learning algorithms to extract wetland, we employ the landscape ecological index to quantitatively analyze the evolution of landscape patterns and grey correlation to analyze the driving factors of Zoige wetland landscape pattern change from 1995 to 2020. The following results were obtained. (1) The random forest algorithm (RF) performs best when dealing with high-dimensional data, and the accuracy of the decision tree algorithm (DT) is better. The performance of the RF and DT is better than that of the support vector machine algorithm. (2) The alpine wetland in the study area was degraded from 1995 to 2015, whereas wetland area began to increase after 2015. (3) The results of landscape analysis show the decrease in wetland area from 1995 to 2005 was mainly due to the fragmentation of larger patches into many small patches and loss of the original small patches, while the 2005 to 2015 decrease was caused by the loss of many middle patches and the decrease in large patches from the edge to the middle. The 2015 to 2020 increase is due to an increase in the number of smaller patches and recovery of original wetland area. (4) The grey correlation degree further shows that precipitation and evaporation are the main factors leading to the change in the landscape pattern of Zoige alpine wetland. The results are of great significance to the long-term monitoring of the Zoige wetland ecosystem.

TI  - An Assessment of the Hydrological Trends Using Synergistic Approaches of Remote Sensing and Model Evaluations over Global Arid and Semi-Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands cover about 40% of the world's land area and support two billion people, most of them living in developing countries that are at risk due to land degradation. Over the last few decades, there has been warming, with an escalation of drought and rapid population growth. This will further intensify the risk of desertification, which will seriously affect the local ecological environment, food security and people's lives. The goal of this research is to analyze the hydrological and land cover characteristics and variability over global arid and semi-arid regions over the last decade (2010-2019) using an integrative approach of remotely sensed and physical process-based numerical modeling (e.g., Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) models) data. Interaction between hydrological and ecological indicators including precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface soil moisture and vegetation indices are presented in the global four types of arid and semi-arid areas. The trends followed by precipitation, evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture over the decade are also mapped using harmonic analysis. This study also shows that some hotspots in these global drylands, which exhibit different processes of land cover change, demonstrate strong coherency with noted groundwater variations. Various types of statistical measures are computed using the satellite and model derived values over global arid and semi-arid regions. Comparisons between satellite- (NASA-USDA Surface Soil Moisture and MODIS Evapotranspiration data) and model (FLDAS and GLDAS)-derived values over arid regions (BSh, BSk, BWh and BWk) have shown the over and underestimation with low accuracy. Moreover, general consistency is apparent in most of the regions between GLDAS and FLDAS model, while a strong discrepancy is also observed in some regions, especially appearing in the Nile Basin downstream hyper-arid region. Data-driven modelling approaches are thus used to enhance the models' performance in this region, which shows improved results in multiple statistical measures ((RMSE), bias (psi), the mean absolute percentage difference (vertical bar psi vertical bar)) and the linear regression coefficients (i.e., slope, intercept, and coefficient of determination (R-2)).

TI  - Identification and preservation of stained non-sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the first lymph nodes that receive lymphatic drainage from the breast. However, all stained lymph nodes are dissected as SLNs during surgery. The present study aimed to identify and preserve the stained non-SLNs and evaluate the safety during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer. SLNB was performed with a methylene blue and indocyanine green double-tracer technique. The first lymph node, which was connected with lymphatic vessels from the breast, was designated as the true SLN. The lymph node that was directly connected with the output lymphatic duct of the SLN was defined as post-SLN (poSLN), whereas the stained poSLN was designated as non-SLN. Both the stained SLN and non-SLN were sent to the pathological department for definitive diagnosis. The present study demonstrated that intraoperative dissection of the lymphatic network could distinguish true SLNs and stained non-SLNs. The number of stained lymph nodes was time-dependent. Not all stained lymph nodes were real SLNs, whereas the poSLNs would be stained if the staining time interval was inappropriate. The data indicated that the poSLNs were negative for metastasis when the SLNs were negative for metastasis. Stained lymph nodes may contain non-SLNs in addition to SLNs. Resection of all stained lymph nodes is not recommended. To reduce the morbidity due to SLNB complications, the identification and preservation of stained non-SLNs during SLNB is feasible and warrants further study in the era of precision medicine.

TI  - Extending the stochastic radiative transfer theory to simulate BRF over forests with heterogeneous distribution of damaged foliage inside of tree crowns
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Within-crown heterogeneity exists in multiple vegetation scenes including forest stands with heterogeneous distribution of damaged foliage. The existing radiative transfer approaches implement the within-crown het-erogeneity either using complicated three-dimensional (3D) scenes with excessive amounts of parameters, or simplifying the scenes to homogeneous cases by averaging canopy optical properties. In order to ascertain the optical response to within-crown heterogeneity both efficiently and accurately, we proposed a method for simulating bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) of forests infected by pests based on the stochastic radiative transfer (SRT) theory. Each damaged tree crown was classified into one of the three types: top-only damage, bottom-only damage and random damage. The statistical properties of such canopy structures were described with extended definitions of the stochastic moments of the SRT model, including the probabilities of finding different foliage classes and the conditional pair-correlation functions between healthy and damaged foliage. Field measurements and remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over infected Yunnan Pine (Pinus yunnanensis) forests, and simulations of two 3D models were utilized to evaluate the performance. Results showed that the extended SRT agreed well with 3D models and field measurements, which means it has the capability to model BRF over forests with heterogeneous foliage within crowns based on one-dimensional (1D) theory. The extended SRT provides a framework to analyze the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to the distribution of damaged foliage with the variation of other key scene factors. For the three types of damaged tree crowns, the thresholds of detectable optical changes were quite different, in which 20% for top-only damage, 80% for bottom-only damage and 50% for random damage. The uncertainties caused by other scene factors were also considered. The extended SRT is promising for crown vertical profile specification, forest damage quantitative inversion, and other applications with coupling models.

TI  - Topology-Enhanced Urban Road Extraction via a Geographic Feature-Enhanced Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban road extraction has wide applications in public transportation systems and unmanned vehicle navigation. The high-resolution remote sensing images contain background clutter and the roads have large appearance differences and complex connectivities, which makes it a very challenging task for road extraction. In this article, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model for road area extraction from remote sensing images. Road features are learned from three levels, which can remove the distraction of the background and enhance feature representation. A direction-aware attention block is introduced to the deep learning model for keeping road topologies. We compare our method on public remote sensing data sets with other related methods. The experimental results show the superiority of our method in terms of road extraction and connectivity preservation.

TI  - Tree-Species Identification of Multisource Remote-Sensing Data using Improved 3D-CNN
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming to address the low identification accuracy of remote-sensing tree species of forests with a complex canopy and high density, a three-dimensional convolution neural network (3D-CNN) that can extract the stereoscopic features of hyper-dimensional data is introduced herein, and it can identify remote-sensing images. Furthermore, it is improved through residual network (ResNet) to build a 31) residual convolution neural network (3D-RCNN) to reduce the influence of degradation phenomenon and the inaccuracy caused by network depth. The sample set is constructed by combining GF-5 hyperspectral data (GF-5 AHIS)and GF-6 high spatial resolution data (GF-6 PMS), supplemented by forest resource data and field survey data. Then, a tree species recognition model is constructed based on the concept of 3D-RCNN. The experimental results show that compared with traditional 3D-CNN, the proposed 3D-RCNN increases the model network's density from 12 layers to 18 layers, which can deepen the network structure and alleviate network degradation. By combining GF-5 AHIS and GF-6 PMS, 3D-RCNN can effectively identify northern subtropical forest species, providing better recognition accuracy (91. 72%) than traditional 3D-CNN (85.65%) and support vector machine algorithm (85.22%).

TI  - Accurate cloud detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery by weakly supervised deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover is a common and inevitable phenomenon that often hinders the usability of optical remote sensing (RS) image data and further interferes with continuous cartography based on RS image interpretation. In the literature, the off-the-shelf cloud detection methods either require various hand-crafted features or utilize data -driven features using deep networks. Overall, deep networks achieve much better performance than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. However, the current deep networks used for cloud detection depend on massive pixel-level annotation labels, which require a great deal of manual annotation labor. To reduce the labor needed for annotating the pixel-level labels, this paper proposes a weakly supervised deep learning-based cloud detection (WDCD) method using block-level labels indicating only the presence or the absence of cloud in one RS image block. In the training phase, a new global convolutional pooling (GCP) operation is proposed to enhance the ability of the feature map to represent useful information (e.g., spatial variance). In the testing phase, the trained deep networks are modified to generate the cloud activation map (CAM) via the local pooling pruning (LPP) strategy, which prunes the local pooling layers of the deep networks that are trained in the training phase to improve the quality (e.g., spatial resolution) of CAM. One large RS image is cropped into multiple overlapping blocks by a sliding window, and then the CAM of each block is generated by the modified deep networks. Based on the correspondence between the image blocks and CAMs, multiple corresponding CAMs are collected to mosaic the CAM of the large image. By segmenting the CAM using a statistical threshold against a clear-sky surface, the pixel-level cloud mask of the testing image can be obtained. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed WDCD method, we collected a new global dataset, for which the training dataset contains over 200,000 RS image blocks with block-level labels from 622 large GaoFen-1 images from all over the world; the validation dataset contains 5 large GaoFen-1 images with pixel-level annotation labels, and the testing dataset contains 25 large GaoFen-1 and ZiYuan-3 images with pixel-level annotation labels. Even under the extremely weak supervision, our proposed WDCD method could achieve excellent cloud detection performance with an overall accuracy (OA) as high as 96.66%. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed WDCD method obviously outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The collected datasets have been made publicly available online (https://github.com/weichenrs/WDCD).

TI  - Urban Riverway Extraction from High-Resolution SAR Image Based on Blocking Segmentation and Discontinuity Connection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban riverway extraction method is proposed for high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, the original image is partitioned into overlapping sub-image blocks, in which the sub-image blocks that do not cover riverways are regarded as background. Sub-image blocks covering riverways are then filtered using the iterative adaptive speckle reduction anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) that introduces the relative signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR). The filtered images are segmented quickly by the Sauvola algorithm, and the false riverway fragments are removed by the area and aspect ratio of the connected component in the segmentation results. Using the minimum convex hull of each riverway segment as the connection object, the seeds are automatically determined by the difference between adjacent pyramid layers, and the sub-image block riverway extraction result is used as the bottom layer. The discontinuity connection between river segments is achieved by multi-layer region growth. Finally, the processed sub-image blocks are stitched to get the riverway extraction results for the entire image. To verify the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach, high-resolution SAR imagery obtained by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite was used in the assessment. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively and completely extract complex urban riverways from high-resolution SAR images.

TI  - Relationships between Temporal and Spatial Changes in Lakes and Climate Change in the Saline-Alkali Concentrated Distribution Area in the Southwest of Songnen Plain, Northeast China, from 1985 to 2015
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwest of Songnen Plain, Northeast China, has an arid climate and is a typical concentrated distribution area of saline-alkali soil. The terrain here is low-lying, with many small, shallow lakes that are vulnerable to climate change. This paper used Landsat satellite remote sensing images of this area from 1985 to 2015 to perform interpretation of lake water bodies, to classify the lakes according to their areas, and to analyze the spatial dynamic characteristics of lakes in different areas. During the 30 years from 1985 to 2015, the number of lakes in the study area decreased by 71, and the total lake area decreased by 266.85 km(2). The decrease was more serious in the east and northeast, and the appearance and disappearance of lakes was drastic. The Mann-Kendall test method was used to analyze trends in meteorological factors (annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and annual evaporation) in the study area and perform mutation tests. Through correlation analysis and multiple generalized linear model analysis, the response relationship between lake change and climate change was quantified. The results showed that the average temperature in the area is rising, and the annual precipitation and evaporation are declining. Temperature and precipitation mainly affected lakes of less than 1 km(2), with a contribution rate of 31.2% and 39.4%, and evaporation had a certain correlation to the total lake area in the study area, with a contribution rate of 60.2%. Small lakes are susceptible to climatic factors, while large lakes, which are mostly used as water sources, may be influenced more by human factors. This is the problem and challenge to be uncovered in this article. This research will help to improve our understanding of lake evolution and climate change response in saline-alkali areas and provide scientific basis for research into lakes' (reservoirs') sustainable development and protection.

TI  - Fusion of High- and Medium-Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Imagery and GlobeLand30 Products for the Automated Detection of Intra-Urban Surface Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intra-urban surface water (IUSW) is an indispensable resource for urban living. Accurately acquiring and updating the distributions of IUSW resources is significant for human settlement environments and urban ecosystem services. High-resolution optical remote sensing data are used widely in the detailed monitoring of IUSW because of their characteristics of high resolution, large width, and high frequency. The lack of spectral information in high-resolution remote sensing data, however, has led to the IUSW misclassification problem, which is difficult to fully solve by relying only on spatial features. In addition, with an increasing abundance of water products, it is equally important to explore methods for using water products to further enhance the automatic acquisition of IUSW. In this study, we developed an automated urban surface-water area extraction method (AUSWAEM) to obtain accurate IUSW by fusing GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, and GlobeLand30 products. First, we derived morphological large-area/small-area water indices to increase the salience of IUSW features. Then, we applied an adaptive segmentation model based on the GlobeLand30 product to obtain the initial results of IUSW. Finally, we constructed a decision-level fusion model based on expert knowledge to eliminate the problem of misclassification resulting from insufficient information from high-resolution remote sensing spectra and obtained the final IUSW results. We used a three-case study in China (i.e., Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) to validate this method based on remotely sensed images, such as those from GF-1 and Landsat-8 OLI. We performed a comparative analysis of the results from the proposed method and the results from the normalized differential water index, with average kappa coefficients of 0.91 and 0.55, respectively, which indicated that the AUSWAEM improved the average kappa coefficient by 0.36 and obtained accurate spatial patterns of IUSW. Furthermore, the AUSWAEM displayed more stable and robust performance under different environmental conditions. Therefore, the AUSWAEM is a promising technique for extracting IUSW with more accurate and automated detection performance.

TI  - Woody vegetation cover, height and biomass at 25-m resolution across Australia derived from multiple site, airborne and satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed spatial information on the presence and properties of woody vegetation serves many purposes, in-cluding carbon accounting, environmental reporting and land management. Here, we investigated whether machine learning can be used to combine multiple spatial observations and training data to estimate woody vegetation canopy cover fraction ('cover'), vegetation height ('height') and woody above-ground biomass dry matter ('biomass') at 25-m resolution across the Australian continent, where possible on an annual basis. We trained a Random Forest algorithm on cover and height estimates derived from airborne LiDAR over 11 regions and inventory-based biomass estimates for many thousands of plots across Australia. As predictors, we used annual geomedian Landsat surface reflectance, ALOS/PALSAR L-band radar backscatter mosaics, spatial vegetation structure data derived primarily from ICESat/GLAS satellite altimetry, and spatial climate data. Cross validation experiments were undertaken to optimize the selection of predictors and the configuration of the algorithm. The resulting estimation errors were 0.07 for cover, 3.4 m for height, and 80 t dry matter ha-1 for biomass. A large fraction (89-94 %) of the observed variance was explained in each case. Priorities for future research include validation of the LiDAR-derived cover training data and the use of new satellite vegetation height data from the GEDI mission. Annual cover mapping for 2000-2018 provided detailed insight in woody vegetation dynamics. Continentally, woody vegetation change was primarily driven by water availability and its effect on bushfire and mortality, particularly in the drier interior. Changes in woody vegetation made a substantial contribution to Australia's total carbon emissions since 2000. Whether these ecosystems will recover biomass in future remains to be seen, given the persistent pressures of climate change and land use.

TI  - Validation of Copernicus Sea Level Altimetry Products in the Baltic Sea and Estonian Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-mission satellite altimetry (e.g., ERS, Envisat, TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason) data have enabled a synoptic-scale view of ocean variations in past decades. Since 2016, the Sentinel-3 mission has provided better spatial and temporal sampling compared to its predecessors. The Sentinel-3 Ku/C Radar Altimeter (SRAL) is one of the synthetic aperture radar altimeters (SAR Altimeter) which is more precise for coastal and lake observations. The article studies the performance of the Sentinel-3 Level-2 sea level altimetry products in the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea and on two lakes of Estonia. The Sentinel-3 data were compared with (i) collocated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ship measurements, (ii) the Estonian geoid model (EST-GEOID2017) together with sea-level anomaly corrections from the tide gauges, and (iii) collocated buoy measurements. The comparisons were carried out along seven Sentinel-3A/B tracks across the Baltic Sea and Estonian lakes in 2019. In addition, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Level-3 sea-level products and the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) reanalysis outcomes were compared with measurements from Estonia's 21 tide gauges and the buoy deployed offshore. Our results showed that the uncertainty of the Sentinel-3 Level-2 altimetry product was below decimetre level for the seacoast and the selected lakes of Estonia. Results from CMEMS Level-3 altimetry products showed a correlation of 0.83 (RMSE 0.18 m) and 0.91 (RMSE 0.27 m) when compared against the tide gauge measurements and the NEMO model, respectively. The overall performance of the altimetry products was very good, except in the immediate vicinity of the coastline and for the lakes, where the accuracy was nearly three times lower than for the open sea, but still acceptably good.

TI  - Deduction of a meteorological phenology indicator from reconstructed MODIS LST imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is a valuable attribute of vegetation to assess the biological impacts from climate change. A challenge of phenological research is to obtain information on both high temporal resolution and fine spatial scale observations. Here, we constructed an air temperature map based on temporal merging and spatial interpolation algorithms to overcome the cloud-related problem from the MODIS LST product. Then, we derived the accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) from the constructed mean air temperature map to use as a meteorological indicator. Further, we verified the indicator with the seasonal mean air temperature and the green-up date of aQuercus mongolicaforest determined from the field-based measurements. The AGDD threshold for eachQ. mongolicaforest when the first leaf has unfolded was detected from the EXG trajectory extracted from digital camera images. A comparison between meteorological and MODIS-derived AGDD showed good agreement between them. There was also high consistency between DoYs extracted from AGDD and EVI based on curvatureKforQ. mongolicaforests of 30 sampling sites throughout South Korea. The results prove that microclimatic factors such as elevation, waterbody, and land-use intensity were faithfully reflected in the reconstructed images. Therefore, the results of this study could be applied effectively in areas where microclimatic variation is very severe and for monitoring phenology of undergrowth, which is difficult to detect from reflectance imaging.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence method for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objective: Breast biopsy and analysis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) accurately predict tumor status in the affected basin and help in avoiding unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection, which is associated with remarkable morbidity risk. Blue dye and radioisotope are the most widely used mapping agents, but non-radioactive tracers of comparable accuracy warrant further investigation. This study aimed to investigate utilization of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence in sentinel node localization compared with blue dye and to assess the incremental value of ICG.Methods: A total of 39 consecutive patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (40 cases: 38 unilateral and 1 bilateral) with combined blue dye and ICG for localization. The obtained fluorescence images of the lymphatic system were investigated.Results: All 84 lymph nodes removed in 40 procedures were identified by ICG, but only 37 were identified by blue dye. The ICG method identified an average of 2.1 SLNs in 39 of 40 cases with a detection rate of 97.5%, but only 0.93 SLN per case with blue dye. Subcutaneous lymphatic channel patterns were also detected by fluorescent imaging in 37 procedures, which all revealed lymphatic drainage toward the axilla except in one case with internal mammary pathway.Conclusion: This study demonstrated the accuracy and safety of ICG for SLNB and its superiority to blue dye method in SLN localization. Therefore, ICG fluorescence method is safe and effective addition in breast clinical settings, wherein blue dye alone is used.

TI  - Honesty-Humility and dispositional awe in Confucian culture: The mediating role of Zhong-Yong thinking style
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dispositional awe refers to the tendency or trait of awe that is a universal and complex human experience. However, the factors influencing this awe have rarely been addressed. For the first time, the current study explores the relationship between Honesty-Humility (H-H) and dispositional awe and the mediating role of a Zhong-Yong thinking style (ZY) in Confucian culture. A large sample of 2377 Chinese undergraduates ranging from 18 to 26 years old (mean: 20.7 years, SD = 1.7) was recruited via a cluster sampling. As predicted, H-H was positively correlated with dispositional awe, and this relationship was mediated by ZY. Though H-H was not significantly and directly correlated with dispositional awe in males, multiple-group structural equation modeling supported gender invariance in its direct and mediating effects. The implication of this study has been discussed.

TI  - NDVI Dynamics and Its Response to Climate Change and Reforestation in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an important component of the terrestrial ecosystem that plays an essential role in the exchange of water and energy in climate and biogeochemical cycles. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in northern China using the GIMMS-MODIS NDVI during 1982-2018. We explored the dominant drivers of NDVI change using regression analyses. Results show that the regional average NDVI for northern China increased at a rate of 0.001 year(-1). NDVI improved and degraded area corresponded to 36.1% and 9.7% of the total investigated area, respectively. Climate drivers were responsible for NDVI change in 46.2% of the study area, and the regional average NDVI trend in the region where the dominant drivers were temperature (T), precipitation (P), and the combination of precipitation and temperature (P&T), increased at a rate of 0.0028, 0.0027, and 0.0056 year(-1), respectively. We conclude that P has positive dominant effects on NDVI in the subregion VIAiia, VIAiic, VIAiib, VIAib of temperate grassland region, and VIIBiia of temperate desert region in northern China. T has positive dominant effects on NDVI in the alpine vegetation region of Qinghai Tibet Plateau. NDVI is negatively dominated by T in the subregion VIIBiib, VIIBib, VIIAi, and VIIBi of temperate desert regions. Human activities affect NDVI directly by reforestation, especially in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces.

TI  - Use of Remote Sensing Data to Improve the Efficiency of National Forest Inventories: A Case Study from the United States National Forest Inventory
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Globally, forests are a crucial natural resource, and their sound management is critical for human and ecosystem health and well-being. Efforts to manage forests depend upon reliable data on the status of and trends in forest resources. When these data come from well-designed natural resource monitoring (NRM) systems, decision makers can make science-informed decisions. National forest inventories (NFIs) are a cornerstone of NRM systems, but require capacity and skills to implement. Efficiencies can be gained by incorporating auxiliary information derived from remote sensing (RS) into ground-based forest inventories. However, it can be difficult for countries embarking on NFI development to choose among the various RS integration options, and to develop a harmonized vision of how NFI and RS data can work together to meet monitoring needs. The NFI of the United States, which has been conducted by the USDA Forest Service's (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program for nearly a century, uses RS technology extensively. Here we review the history of the use of RS in FIA, beginning with general background on NFI, FIA, and sampling statistics, followed by a description of the evolution of RS technology usage, beginning with paper aerial photography and ending with present day applications and future directions. The goal of this review is to offer FIA's experience with NFI-RS integration as a case study for other countries wishing to improve the efficiency of their NFI programs.

TI  - A soil colour map of China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil colour can indicate soil physical, chemical and biological properties and processes, and is an important indicator for soil classification, soil quality evaluation and soil management. It varies in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, and thus regional maps of soil colour can reveal spatial patterns of these properties, processes, and indicators. However, although soil regions are sometimes named for their dominant soil colour, it is directly measured only at "point" support, i.e., during soil profile description, whereas it is desirable to know soil colour over the entire soilscape. To achieve this for China we used predictive soil mapping methods to produce soil colour maps (dry and moist colours) at 1 km(2) grid cell size and over multiple depths from a consistent dataset of approximately 4 600 full profile descriptions taken as part of a national survey to define soil series in Chinese Soil Taxonomy, and a set of environmental covariates covering the national territory. The covariates characterized soil forming factors including climate, parent materials, terrain, vegetation, land surface water and thermal conditions. Soil colour descriptions in the Munsell system were extracted from the genetic horizon descriptions at the selected depths and converted to the sRGB and L*a*b* colour spaces. Dry and moist colour separates were not well-correlated in either space (r < 0.76). Random forest models were constructed in both spaces, for dry and moist colours separately. Models in sRGB space were moderately successful (R-2 approximate to 0.43, RMSE approximate to 26/255) at 5 cm, with success decreasing with depth. Models smoothed the colour space and thus did not predict the more extreme values or chromas, nor the rarer hues. Models in L*a*b* space were less successful. The fitted sRGB models were used to produce predictive maps over all of China. Regional patterns as well as local detail are clearly shown. Solar radiation, wind exposure, regolith thickness, and Landsat TM bands 7 and 5 contributed most to the predictions, followed by elevation, mean annual precipitation, terrain wetness index, air temperature seasonality, precipitation standard deviation and standard deviation of NDVI. These suggest pedological processes acting on the development of soil colours, including weathering of parent materials, oxidation-reduction chemistry and biochemistry of the decomposing of organic matter. This study shows that predictive methods from points using suitable covariates are an alternative to spatial predictions over map units from their representative profiles.

TI  - Spatial distribution prediction of soil As in a large-scale arsenic slag contaminated site based on an integrated model and multi-source environmental data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Different prediction models have important effects on the accuracy of spatial distribution simulations of heavy metals in soil. This study proposes a model (RFOK) combining a random forest (RF) with ordinary kriging (OK), multi-source environmental data such as terrain elements, site environmental elements, and remote sensing data were incorporated to predict the spatial distribution of heavy arsenic (As) in soil of a certain large arsenic slag site. The predictions results of RFOK were compared with those obtained using the RF, OK, inverse distance weighted (IDW), and stepwise regression (STEPREG) models for assessment of prediction accuracy. The results showed that arsenic pollution was widely distributed and the center of the site, including arsenic slag stacking area and production area were seriously polluted. The overall spatial distribution of arsenic pollution simulated by the five models was similar, but the IDW, RF, OK, and STEPREG showed less spatial variation of soil pollution, while RFOK simulation can better express the characteristics of details in change. The cross-validation results showed that RFOK had the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE) relative to the other four models, followed by RF, OK, IDW, and STEPREG. The RMSE, MAE and MRE of RFOK decreased by 62.2%, 64.3% and 68.7%, respectively, relative to the RF model with the second highest accuracy. Compared with the traditional spatial distribution prediction model, the RFOK model proposed in this study has excellent spatial distribution prediction ability for soil heavy metal pollution with large spatial variation characteristics, which can fully explain the nonlinear relationship between pollutant content and its environmental impact elements.

TI  - Estimation of Ice Thickness and the Features of Subglacial Media Detected by Ground Penetrating Radar at the Baishui River Glacier No. 1 in Mt. Yulong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), we measured and estimated the ice thickness of the Baishui River Glacier No. 1 of Yulong Snow Mountain. According to the position of the reflected media from the GPR image, combined with the radar waveform amplitude and polarity change information, the ice thickness and the changing medium position at the bottom of this temperate glacier were identified. Water paths were found in the measured ice, including ice caves and crevasses. A debris-rich ice layer was found at the bottom of the glacier, which produces strong abrasion and ploughing action at the bedrock surface. This results in the formation of different detrital layers stagnated at the ice-bedrock interface and numerous crevasses on the bedrock surface. Based on the obtained ice thickness and differential GPS data, combined with Landsat images, the kriging interpolation method was used to obtain grid data. The average ice thickness was 52.48 m and between 4740 and 4890 m above sea level, with a maximum depth of 92.83 m. The bedrock topography map of this area was drawn using digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. The central part of the glacier was characterized by small ice basins with distributed ice steps and ice ridges at the upper and lower parts.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATTENTION DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:This study evaluated the concurrent validity of emotional lability (EL) in children with ADHD.Method:A total of 2,015 children with ADHD and 745 typically developed controls (TDCs) were assessed and compared on EL.Results:ADHD participants expressed higher EL scores than TDCs, not influenced by gender or IQ. Higher levels of EL symptoms were found in children with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and with ADHD-combined subtype. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed a strong screening efficacy of EL symptoms on ADHD. The effect of developmental age on EL showed a desisting pattern in TDCs, as opposed to a persisting pattern in ADHD (not influenced by ODD comorbid status). ODD symptoms in ADHD showed an ascending pattern.Conclusion:EL can potentially serve as a sentinel index for the presence of ADHD, especially when the ADHD presentation is atypical. ODD may embody a developmental entity distinct from EL.

TI  - Crop residue burning practices across north India inferred from household survey data: Bridging gaps in satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - In north India, agricultural burning adversely affects local and regional air quality during the post-monsoon season (October to November), when the prevailing meteorology is favorable for smog and haze formation. Quantifying the contribution of smoke to air pollution in this region, however, is challenging. While the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, provides a nearly 20-year record of global fire activity, the sensor cannot adequately capture small, short-lasting agricultural fires due to its moderate spatial resolution (500 m-1 km) and limited overpasses (twice daily for each satellite), as well as the hazy conditions that typically obscure the north India land surface at this time of year. Moreover, current global fire emissions inventories based on MODIS observations can differ by up to an order of magnitude in this region. Here we incorporate household survey data to bridge gaps in MODIS observations and improve estimates of fire emissions over the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar during the 2003-2018 post-monsoon burning seasons. We develop a novel method that adjusts MODIS Fire Radiative Power (FRP) for: (1) small fires detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) at 375-m spatial resolution, (2) cloud/haze gaps in satellite observations, (3) partial-field burning practices, and (4) the diurnal cycle of fire activity. Adjusting FRP for the fire diurnal cycle yields the largest boost to emissions due to the short lifetime of the fires (similar to 1/2 h) and the brief windows of satellite detection. Using adjusted FRP, we estimate on average 10.4 +/- 3 Tg dry matter (DM) burned each year, yielding emissions of 65 +/- 18 Gg organic carbon (OC), 5.6 +/- 1.6 Gg black carbon (BC), 791 +/- 225 Gg CO, and 14.9 +/- 4.2 Tg CO2. On average, our OC + BC emissions are 3.4 times (min: 0.6, max: 6.6) the estimates from five widely used global fire emissions inventories. Our estimate for Punjab, which contributes more than two-thirds of emissions in the region, is consistent with our bottom-up validation, which uses burn rates from the household survey and government crop production statistics in 2016 and 2017. We spatially disaggregate the state-level emissions to construct a gridded inventory at daily, 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees resolution over north India from 2003 to 2018. The inventory, SAGE-IGP (Survey Constraints on FRP-based Agricultural Fire Emissions in the Indo-Gangetic Plain), improves modeling assessments of air quality impacts from agricultural burning, thus supporting effective policy development.

TI  - Simulation-Based Evaluation of the Estimation Methods of Far-Red Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Escape Probability in Discontinuous Forest Canopies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The escape probability of Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can be remotely estimated using reflectance measurements based on spectral invariants theory. This can then be used to correct the effects of canopy structure on canopy-leaving SIF. However, the feasibility of these estimation methods is untested in heterogeneous vegetation such as the discontinuous forest canopy layer under evaluation here. In this study, the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is used to simulate canopy-leaving SIF, canopy total emitted SIF, canopy interceptance, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) in order to evaluate the estimation methods of SIF escape probability in discontinuous forest canopies. Our simulation results show that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used to partly eliminate the effects of background reflectance on the estimation of SIF escape probability in most cases, but fails to produce accurate estimations if the background is partly or totally covered by vegetation. We also found that SIF escape probabilities estimated at a high solar zenith angle have better estimation accuracy than those estimated at a lower solar zenith angle. Our results show that additional errors will be introduced to the estimation of SIF escape probability with the use of satellite products, especially when the product of leaf area index (LAI) and clumping index (CI) was underestimated. In other results, fAPAR has comparable estimation accuracy of SIF escape probability when compared to canopy interceptance. Additionally, fAPAR for the entire canopy has better estimation accuracy of SIF escape probability than fPAR for leaf only in sparse forest canopies. These results help us to better understand the current estimation results of SIF escape probability based on spectral invariants theory, and to improve its estimation accuracy in discontinuous forest canopies.

TI  - A Gaussian Beam Method for Push-Broom Antenna Design
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Push-broom antenna is an important antenna form for satellite remote sensing. The main dish of a push-broom antenna is generated by rotating a section of a parabola about a tilt axis, forming a ring focus around the axis. Such a ring focus enables one to place multiple feeds to a single reflector to create multibeams for imaging. Currently, the synthesis of such a system is based on either geometrical optics or physical optics. However, since so many feeds are used and each beam has to be evaluated, these methods are less competent in the design of such an antenna. This communication builds a direct link between the output beam and the geometrical parameters of the feeds and the main reflector. Such a link is established using the Gaussian beam and beam transformation theories. This method gives one a quick estimation of the output performance and good starting values for optimization. Additionally, a complete mathematic description of the reflector and feed design is provided. Case study of an FY-3 prototype indicates that this method is efficient for push-broom antenna design, and the output beams show good uniformity.

TI  - Multi-Year Winter Variations in Suspended Sediment Flux through the Bohai Strait
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bohai Strait is the only channel that allows material exchanges between the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea. It is also the only channel for the transportation of materials from the Yellow River to the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. The supply of suspended sediment from the Bohai Sea plays a decisive role in the evolution of the mud area in the northern Yellow Sea and even the muddy area in the southern Yellow Sea. Previous studies have demonstrated that sediment exchange through the Bohai Strait occurs mainly in winter, but due to the lack of long-term observational data, changes in the sediment flux over multiple years have not been studied. In this paper, based on L1B data from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) -Aqua satellite, an interannual time series of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at each depth layers in the Bohai Strait in winter was established through 16 cruises that benefited from the complete vertical mixing water in the strait in winter. The numerical model FVCOM, (Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model) which is forced by the hourly averaged wind field, reflected the effect of winter gales. With the model simulated winter current from 2002 to the present and the SSC at each layer, multi-year winter suspended sediment flux data were obtained for the Bohai Strait. This study found that in the winter, the suspended sediment output from the Bohai Sea to the Yellow Sea through the southern part of the Bohai Strait, while the suspended sediment input from the Yellow Sea to the Bohai Sea is through the northern part. In terms of long-term changes, the net flux ranged between 1.22 to 2.70 million tons in winter and showed a weak downward trend. The output flux and input flux both showed an upward trend, but the increase rate of the input flux was 51,100 tons/year, which was higher than the increase of the output flux rate (46,100 tons/year). These changes were mainly controlled by the increasing strength of east component of winter wind. And the weak decrease in net flux is controlled by the difference of output and input flux.

TI  - RSVQA: Visual Question Answering for Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces the task of visual question answering for remote sensing data (RSVQA). Remote sensing images contain a wealth of information, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks, including land cover classification, object counting, or detection. However, most of the available methodologies are task-specific, thus inhibiting generic and easy access to the information contained in remote sensing data. As a consequence, accurate remote sensing product generation still requires expert knowledge. With RSVQA, we propose a system to extract information from remote sensing data that is accessible to every user: we use questions formulated in natural language and use them to interact with the images. With the system, images can be queried to obtain high-level information specific to the image content or relational dependencies between objects visible in the images. Using an automatic method introduced in this article, we built two data sets (using low- and high-resolution data) of image/question/answer triplets. The information required to build the questions and answers is queried from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The data sets can be used to train (when using supervised methods) and evaluate models to solve the RSVQA task. We report the results obtained by applying a model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the visual part and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the natural language part of this task. The model is trained on the two data sets, yielding promising results in both cases.

TI  - Mapping sea-ice types from Sentinel-1 considering the surface-type dependent effect of incidence angle
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated classification of sea-ice types in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is complicated by the class-dependent decrease of backscatter intensity with Incidence Angle (IA). In the log-domain, this decrease is approximately linear over the typical range of space-borne SAR instruments. A global correction does not consider that different surface types show different rates of decrease in backscatter intensity. Here, we introduce a supervised classification algorithm that directly incorporates the surface-type dependent effect of IA. We replace the constant mean vector of a Gaussian probability density function in a Bayesian classifier with a linearly variable mean. During training, the classifier first retrieves the slope and intercept of the linear function describing the mean value and then calculates the covariance matrix as the mean squared deviation relative to this function. The IA dependence is no longer treated as an image property but as a class property. Based on training and validation data selected from overlapping SAR and optical images, we evaluate the proposed method in several case studies and compare to other classification algorithms for which a global IA correction is applied during pre-processing. Our results show that the inclusion of the per-class IA sensitivity can significantly improve the performance of the classifier.

TI  - MODELLING OF THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE ELEMENTS OF THE SEDEYAKHA CATCHMENT ON THE BASIS OF HCC MODEL
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents and briefly discusses results and methodic of the modeling of annual average values of spatio-temporal dynamics of the elements of hydrological circle distribution on the Sedeyakha catchment. The study site is located on the north of Western Siberia (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug), has an area of 1310 km(2), and belongs to the forest-tundra geobotanical zone.The methodology of the research is based on the using of the Hydroclimatology Calculation (HCC) method in combination with the modeling of moisture and insolation conditions through SAGA software package.For the accounting of spatial heterogeneity of runoff formation, the geomorphometry analysis was carried out for the whole catchment. Heat and energy resources of evaporation were modeled by parameters of spectral albedo, which is available through Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellite images. Calculations were performed for the years with contrasting temperature and precipitation conditions (for July 2010 and July 2015).GIS-based modeling included two stages and several sequential operations with DEM: 1) downloading of the ArcticDEM; 2) geometric correction (spatial reference); 3) hydrological correction (filling sinks on the terrain model for simulation of surface runoff); 4) calculation of channel network and delineation of catchment subbasins; 5) calculation of the catchment basin boundaries of the River Sedeyakha; 6) calculation of Wetness Index.For the studied period (from 1967 to 2016), the coldest and driest year for the River Sedeyakha basin was 1969. The abnormally hot and the driest year is 2016. That year there have been outbreaks of anthrax and numerous fires in the tundra.The average value of heat and energy resources of evaporation (Zm) for half a century has increased by 22 %. The amount of precipitation increased by 130 mm (22 %), which led to an acceleration of a climatic runoff by 65 mm (24 %).It was revealed that the contribution of heat and energy resources of evaporation for the functioning of forest-tundra geosystems is very significant due to the "locking" effect of permafrost on water exchange with groundwater in the active layer. The increase of evaporation by 19 % leads to the decrease of runoff by almost two times. The results of the simulation were verified on a small forest-tundra catchment by data loggers.

TI  - A Complex Ultimate Reality: The Metaphysics of the Four Yogas
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay will pose and seek to answer the following question: If, as Swami Vivekananda claims, the four yogas are independent and equally effective paths to God-realization and liberation from the cycle of rebirth, then what must reality be like? What ontology is implied by the claim that the four yogas are all equally effective paths to the supreme goal of religious life? What metaphysical conditions would enable this pluralistic assertion to be true? Swami Vivekananda's worldview is frequently identified with Advaita Vedanta. We shall see that Vivekananda's teaching is certainly Advaitic in what could be called a broad sense. As Anantanand Rambachan and others, however, have pointed out, it would be incorrect to identify Swami Vivekananda's teachings in any rigid or dogmatic sense with the classical Advaita Vedanta of sankara; this is because Vivekananda's teaching departs from that of sankara in some significant ways, not least in his assertion of the independent salvific efficacy of the four yogas. This essay will argue that Swami Vivekananda's pluralism, based on the concept of the four yogas, is far more akin to the deep religious pluralism that is advocated by contemporary philosophers of religion in the Whiteheadian tradition of process thought like David Ray Griffin and John Cobb, the classical Jain doctrines of relativity (anekantavada, nayavada, and syadvada), and, most especially, the Vijnana Vedanta of Vivekananda's guru, Sri Ramakrishna, than any of these approaches is to the Advaita Vedanta of sankara. Advaita Vedanta, in Vivekananda's pluralistic worldview, becomes one valid conceptual matrix among many that bear the ability to support an efficacious path to liberation. This essay is intended not as an historical reconstruction of Vivekananda's thought, so much as a constructive philosophical contribution to the ongoing scholarly conversations about both religious (and, more broadly, worldview) pluralism and the religious and philosophical legacies of both Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. The former conversation has arrived at something of an impasse (as recounted by Kenneth Rose), while the latter conversation has recently been revived, thanks to the work of Swami Medhananda (formerly Ayon Maharaj) and Arpita Mitra.

TI  - An Azimuth Ambiguity Suppression Method Based on Local Azimuth Ambiguity-to-Signal Ratio Estimation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth ambiguity greatly affects the image quality and application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Several azimuth ambiguity suppression methods have been proposed; however, these methods cannot remove the ambiguity completely and only the first-order ambiguity has been considered. Hence, in this letter, a novel method based on Wiener filtering and local azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio (AASR) estimation for N-order azimuth ambiguity suppression is proposed. The Wiener filtering is used to attenuate the ambiguity energy. Then the original image and the filtered image are combined to estimate local AASR, which is used to identify the ambiguity pixel. Finally, the ambiguity can be removed via interpolation. Through this method, the N-order ambiguity energy can also be suppressed to a lower level, and simultaneously, the consistency, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio of an SAR image are maintained. Furthermore, in order to verify the practicability of the proposed method, it has been tested on the GaoFen-3 image and TerraSAR-X image.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node mapping in lower genital tract melanoma
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vulvar and vaginal melanomas are rare cancers of the female genital tract and account for 1% to 3% of all melanomas diagnosed in women. Due to the rarity of the disease, few data are available on the clinical and pathologic features of these cancers. Furthermore, treatment options are generally based on extrapolations of the information available for the more common cutaneous counterparts. Surgery represents the mainstay of treatment for lower genital tract melanoma. Moreover, the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment is controversial because no prospective data are available.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Data were collected from Medline, Embase, Web of Sciences and Scopus databases. On July 10, 2020, we used the search comprising the terms "vulvar melanoma," "genital melanoma" and "vulvovaginal melanoma" including only studies in which SLN biopsy was performed.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Ten retrospective studies have been found. No randomized trials have been reported. The studies included 132 patients while only 63 (47%) undergone SLN. 99mTC with or without blue dye followed by ultrastagine was highly accurate and is currently the gold standard. Mean detection rate was 98.3%. No clear evidence supported the execution of back lymphadenectomy (after SLN mapping), in fact, extrapolating data from cutaneous melanomas of other sites, completion of lymphadenectomy does not confer a melanoma-specific survival advantage.CONCLUSIONS: Although the small amount of available data, sentinel lymph node procedure is feasible and capable of identifying patients who have occult lymph node metastases. However, the potential role of the sentinel lymph node procedure as an alternative method of lymph node staging in patients with vulvar or vaginal melanoma needs further investigation.

TI  - Can proteomics contribute to biomonitoring of aquatic pollution? A critical review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Aquatic pollution is one of the greatest environmental problems, and therefore its control represents one of the major challenges in this century. In recent years, proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for searching protein biomarkers in the field of pollution biomonitoring. For biomonitoring marine contamination, there is a consensus that bivalves are preferred organisms to assess organic and inorganic pollutants. Thus, the bivalve proteome was intensively studied, particularly the mussel. It is well documented that heavy metal pollution and organic chemicals altered the structural proteins causing degradation of tissues of molluscs. Also, it is well known that proteins involved in stress oxidative such as glutathione and enzymes as catalase, superoxide dismutase or peroxisomes are overexpressed in response to contaminants. Additionally, using bivalves, other groups of proteins proposed as pollution biomarkers are the metabolic proteins. Even though other marine species are used to monitor the pollution, the presence of proteomic tools in these studies is scarce. Concerning freshwater pollution field, a great variety of animal species (fish and crustaceans) are used as biomonitors in proteomics studies compared to plants that are scarcely analysed. In fish species, proteins involved in stress oxidative such as heat shock family or proteins from lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were proposed as candidate biomarkers. On the contrary, for crustaceans there is a lack of proteomic studies individually assessing the contaminants. Novel scenarios, including emerging contaminants and new threats, will require proteomic technology for a systematic search of protein biomarkers and a greater knowledge at molecular level of those cellular pathways induced by contamination.

TI  - Phenology Modelling and Forest Disturbance Mapping with Sentinel-2 Time Series in Austria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, forests provide natural resources and ecosystem services. However, forest ecosystems are threatened by increasing forest disturbance dynamics, caused by direct human activities or by altering environmental conditions. It is decisive to reconstruct and trace the intra- to transannual dynamics of forest ecosystems. National to local forest authorities and other stakeholders request detailed area-wide maps that delineate forest disturbance dynamics at various spatial scales. We developed a time series analysis (TSA) framework that comprises data download, data management, image preprocessing and an advanced but flexible TSA. We use dense Sentinel-2 time series and a dynamic Savitzky-Golay-filtering approach to model robust but sensitive phenology courses. Deviations from the phenology models are used to derive detailed spatiotemporal information on forest disturbances. In a first case study, we apply the TSA to map forest disturbances directly or indirectly linked to recurring bark beetle infestation in Northern Austria. In addition to spatially detailed maps, zonal statistics on different spatial scales provide aggregated information on the extent of forest disturbances between 2018 and 2019. The outcomes are (a) area-wide consistent data of individual phenology models and deduced phenology metrics for Austrian forests and (b) operational forest disturbance maps, useful to investigate and monitor forest disturbances to facilitate sustainable forest management.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of monthly mean values of the surface temperature in August are created for the Sea of Okhotsk and adjacent waters using 21 years' worth of satellite measurements (1998-2018). In each spatial cell about 2 x 2 km in size, the amplitudes and phases of harmonics for different periods are determined by the least squares method. Distribution maps with periods that are multiples of a year are constructed for the harmonic amplitudes whose contributions to the interannual variations in the temperature of the surface layer are greatest. Features of the distribution of harmonics with certain periods in the Sea of Okhotsk and adjacent waters are revealed. Harmonics with periods of 6-7 years especially stand out. Their zone of influence covers most of the studied area, due probably to quasi-periodic oscillations of the Tsushima current. From south to north, the main periods change gradually from 6 to 11 years. However, in the northwestern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, the influence of the high-frequency component with a period of about three years also affects. The possibility of forecasting the temperature of the surface layer for the year ahead is shown, taking into account the parameters of a linear trend and the four harmonics with the largest amplitudes.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variability of snow cover over the Amur River Basin inferred from MODIS daily snow products in recent decades
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS snow products MOD10A1\MYD10A1 provided us a unique chance to investigate snow cover as well as its spatial-temporal variability in response to global changes from regional and global perspectives. By means of MODIS snow products MOD10A1\MYD10A1 derived from an extensive area of the Amur River Basin, mainly located in the Northeast part of China, some part in far east area of the former USSR and a minor part in Republic of Mongolia, the reproduced snow datasets after removal of cloud effects covering the whole watershed of the Amur River Basin were generated by using 6 different cloud-effect-removing algorithms. The accuracy of the reproduced snow products was evaluated with the time series of snow depth data observed from 2002 to 2010 within the Chinese part of the basin, and the results suggested that the accuracies for the reproduced monthly mean snow depth datasets derived from 6 different cloud-effect-removing algorithms varied from 82% to 96%, the snow classification accuracies (the harmonic mean of Recall and Precision) was higher than 80%, close to the accuracy of the original snow product under clear sky conditions when snow cover was stably accumulated. By using the reproduced snow product dataset with the best validated cloud-effect-removing algorithm newly proposed, spatial-temporal variability of snow coverage fraction (SCF), the date when snow cover started to accumulate (SCS) as well as the date when being melted off (SCM) in the Amur River Basin from 2002 to 2016 were investigated. The results indicated that the SCF characterized the significant spatial heterogeneity tended to be higher towards East and North but lower toward West and South over the Amur River Basin. The inter-annual variations of SCF showed an insignificant increase in general with slight fluctuations in majority part of the basin. Both SCS and SCM tended to be slightly linear varied and the inter-annual differences were obvious. In addition, a clear decreasing trend in snow cover is observed in the region. Trend analysis (at 10% significance level) showed that 71% of areas between 2,000 and 2,380 m a.s.l. experienced a reduction in duration and coverage of annual snow cover. Moreover, a severe snow cover reduction during recent years with sharp fluctuations was investigated. Overall spatial-temporal variability of Both SCS and SCM tended to coincide with that of SCF over the basin in general.

TI  - Residual stress testing and proposed residual stress model of hot-bent H-shaped steel
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Curved H-shaped steel is frequently processed by hot bending, and this high-temperature processing method alters its original residual stress pattern. In this study, residual stress in the H-shaped steel members was examined experimentally and through numerical simulations. Longitudinal residual stresses were measured using a cutting method. The residual stress distributions of the top and bottom flanges were symmetric, while the distribution in the web was asymmetric. The maximum tensile residual stress in the top flange appeared at both its tips, and the maximum compressive residual stress appeared at the web-to-flange junction; the stress distribution of the bottom flange was opposite that of the top flange. The maximum tensile and compressive residual stresses in the web appeared near the neutral axis in the top and bottom halves, respectively. A parametric analysis involving 45 numerical models was performed considering factors such as the bending ratio, height-to-width ratio, and yield strength. The results demonstrated that the magnitude of the residual stress closely correlated with the bending ratio. The height-to-width ratio had no distinct correlation with the residual stress. The magnitude of the residual stress was greater for higher yield strengths; therefore, in this study, the effect of the yield strength was simplified as the residual stress multiplied by f(y)/355. A simplified residual stress model using internal equilibrium conditions was proposed and verified to satisfactorily reproduce the distribution and magnitude of the residual stress of the hot-bent H-shaped steel members.

T2  - QUALITATIVE REPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - This participatory action research was designed to create guidelines and strategies to improve the delivery of mental health services to immigrants from Central and South America to the US. The demand for appropriate strategies for addressing the mental health needs of this population is increasing. This study recruited 17 traditional healers and their clients in the US and Peru to share their understanding of mental health needs, the conditions for which someone might seek treatment, and those aspects of traditional cosmology and practice that could inform modern approaches. The findings identified patterns of generational trauma still evident from colonialism, the need to respect the traditional worldview of immigrants in relation to diagnosis of mental distress, connection to nature and place, and the role of community and ancestors to the process of healing and recovery. Recommendations for practitioners to be a bridge between traditional and modern approaches to mental health are offered.

TI  - Analysis of the Decadal Kinematic Characteristics of the Daguangbao Landslide Using Multiplatform Time Series InSAR Observations After the Wenchuan Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Daguangbao landslide was the largest landslide triggered by the "5.12" Wenchuan Mw 7.9 earthquake. This landslide is among the few superlarge-scale landslides of 1 billion m(3) magnitude worldwide. As the landslide accumulation represents a potential hazard, long-term monitoring and geological interpretation of the Daguangbao landslide is important to reveal the postsliding deformation characteristics and laws of this landslide type. To study the kinematic characteristics 10 years postearthquake, the landslide accumulation deformation was monitored in two stages using different data sets and processing methods. First, regarding the deformation 2 years postearthquake, we selected PALSAR-1 data (21 October 2008 to 14 March 2011) and obtained the LOS (line of sight) direction time series deformation of the landslide using the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm. Second, for the last 4.5 years of deformation, Sentinel-1 data sets (26 November 2015 to 8 June 2020) in two ascending and one descending path are experimentally used. The vertical and east-west deformations during this period are obtained. Thickness, topography, precipitation, and other factors are combined to analyze the landslide accumulation deformation. The landslide accumulation volume decreases under gravitational influence, shrinkage is accelerated under precipitation influence, and periodic fluctuations occur, which lag precipitation changes. The maximum vertical direction deformation rate is below 80 mm/year, and the deformation magnitude in the east-west direction is approximately +/- 35 mm/year. Local deformation is still affected by the surface slope and aspect, and the overall landslide accumulation movement trend involves gathering of the eastern and western parts toward the middle. In the observation window, with the stabilization of accumulation, the deformation tends decrease.

AB  - To investigate the effects of field returning of Chinese milk vetch coupled with rice-fish symbiosis on the population growth and yield of rice, we carried out an experiment with four treatments, including winter fallow-double cropping rice (CK) as a control, Chinese milk vetch-double cropping rice (ZD) , winter fallow-double cropping rice combined with fish (YD) , and Chinese milk vetch-double cropping rice combined with fish (ZY). We measured leaf area index , amount of dry matter accumulation and translocation , rice yield , and yield composition index. The results showed that: (1) During the cultivation of double cropping rice, leaf area index at heading stage of the ZY treatment increased by 11.33% and 50.26% , respectively. The photosynthetic potential of ZY increased from 12.30% to 28.96% and 24.00% to 48.46% respectively from tillering stage to heading stage. The net assimilation rate from panicle primordium differentiation stage to heading stage increased by 25.46% and 11.62%. (2) YD, ZD and ZY improved aboveground biomass of double cropping rice. Aboveground biomass of ZY was the highest with 1607.70 and 1526.60 g . M-2, which respectively increased by 11.22%, 8.81%, and 0.90% during the early rice season and 14.34%, 5.42% and 5.78% during the late rice season compared with CK, YD, and ZD. ZY increased aboveground biomass and material transfer to panicle. The double cropping rice harvest index was the highest in ZY , which was 0.58 and 0.59 respectively. (3) The yield of double cropping rice in ZY was 6.68 and 7.15 t . hm(-2) respectively , which increased by 12.79%-17.99%, 2.23%-11.72% and 0.44%-14.95% compared with CK, YD and ZD. Grain number per panicle was the main factor affecting yield formation. Our results showed that YD, ZD, and ZY could effectively improve and optimize population growth of double cropping rice, thereby increase rice yield. Further, ZY is better than YD and ZD, and thus is a green and efficient farming method.

TI  - Trade-offs and synergies in ecosystem service values of inland lake wetlands in Central Asia under land use/cover change: A case study on Ebinur Lake, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem service value (ESV) of wetlands is a major concern in ecological research. However, inland lake wetland ecosystems in arid areas are easily overlooked and seldom quantitatively evaluated due to their relatively low biological production. In this study, the ESVs of the Ebinur Wetland Complex (EWC) in Xinjiang, China, were investigated for 11 land use types based on satellite data collected in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The results show that the land use/cover change (LUCC) in the EWC has been both naturally and anthropogenically affected since 2010, especially in constructed lands, shoal lands and marsh lands. The ESV of the EWC has increased overall, with a total increase of 6.34 x 108 yuan from 2000 to 2015. The ESVs were quantitatively evaluated according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) under different LUCCs. The ecosystem service factors (food supply (FS), wind prevention and sand fixation (WPSF), soil conservation (SC), and carbon fixation and oxygen supply (CFOS)) exhibited strong correlations (R-2 > 0.75) and synergies. The FS value accounted for the largest proportion (38.78%) of the ESV in the EWC, followed by the WPSF value (31.93%) and SC value (19.33%). Among the LUCCs, the ESV arable lands accounts for the largest fraction (49.97%) of the total ESV in the EWC. However, the increase was caused by the significant improvement in provisioning services such as arable lands at the expense of regulating and supporting services such as grassland and forest land (mainly cultivated to arable lands). Therefore, integrated strategies, such as the use of plantation water-saving crops, drip irrigation, captive breeding and the establishment of a nature reserve, will lead to sustainable development of the ESV in the EWC.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry using the ICESat-2 lidar and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric data is essential for marine, coastal ecosystems, and related studies. In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10% of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R-2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies. Hence, In the future, with the help of free and open-access satellite data (i.e., ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 imagery), this approach can be extended to a larger scale to obtain bathymetric maps in the shallow water of coastal areas, surroundings of islands and reefs, and inland waters.

TI  - Impact of BMI on Preoperative Axillary Ultrasound Assessment in Patients With Early Breast Cancer
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The accuracy of axillary ultrasound (AUS) with fine-needle aspiration with varying patient body mass index (BMI) is still unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the US features of axillary lymph nodes changes with BMI of patients. Patients and Methods: A retrospective review was performed involving 144 out of 270 patients with early breast cancer who underwent breast surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Diagnostic efficacy of AUS in preoperative axillary nodal staging was assessed in relation to BMI. Results: Negative predictive values of AUS for the overweight and obese groups were statistically significantly lower compared to the normal/underweight group (p=0.02 and p=0.003, respectively). Additionally, Spearman's correlation coefficient R between BMI and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy was 0.257, suggesting a significantly positive linear relationship between the two variables in the cohort overall. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate how in our cohort the negative predictive value of AUS was significantly influenced by adipose tissue and that the selection of the most suitable instrumental diagnostic technique might contribute to improving heterogeneous results.

TI  - Envisioning a global forest transition: Status, role, and implications
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data-driven discoveries are fuelling the literature on forest transitions, particularly in quantifying slow, large-scale trends. Mather's forest transition concept depicts the inflection point marking a change from decreasing to increasing forest area. This theory is being elucidated using satellite images of global forest cover from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and now from the FAO's recently introduced geospatial monitoring platform SEPAL 2.1. Recently, a series of high profile papers have illuminated the concept of the forest transition using analysis of remote sensing-based forest cover images. Defined as an increase in global forest cover, analysis of satellite images over the past thirty years suggests that a global forest transition has occurred. However, satellite data provide less information about biodiversity and carbon sequestration outcomes in new forests. Incorporating other data sources on the quality of forest transitions offers the potential to develop better reforestation programs, address climate change goals and enhance other ecological and human benefits. This article presents a view on remote sensing, biodiversity, and carbon science that has changed the study of forest transitions, and an outline of anticipated and suggested science and policy directions.

TI  - The role of sentinel-node biopsy in ovarian cancer
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node involvement is an important prognostic factor in early and advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, to date there is no reliable method of detecting lymph node involvement, apart from surgical staging. Thus, pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (LNE) are still part of standard surgery of early ovarian cancer. There is conflicting evidence about the therapeutic value of systematic LNE in early EOC. Thus, the developmemt of a method to predict nodal status accurately, without extensive LNE, is the subject of ongoing research. Sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLN) has become a standard procedure in oncological surgery. However, SI,N is not yet an established and widely accepted procedure for EOC. This review aimed at summarizing available evidence on its feasibility and reliability in EOC. Overall, evidence of SLN in early EOC is still scarce. So far, only small series of patients with a variety of tracers and injection sites were published. From the available literature, the most promising technique seems to be injection into the infundibulopelvic, as well as the proper ovarian ligament. Indocyanine green seems to be an excellent tracer for successful SLN of ovarian tumors, which can be used during laparoscopic or robotic surgery. The detection rates and true positive rates of studies support further investigation of the technique. Results from prospective studies, e.g. the ongoing SELLY trial, are necesssary to implement SLN into the standard treatment of early EOC.

TI  - Mapping of diffuse attenuation coefficient in optically complex waters of amazon floodplain lakes
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The modeling of underwater light field is essential for the understanding of biogeochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, carbon fluxes, and sediment transports in inland waters. Water-column light attenuation can be quantified by the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the downwelling irradiance (K-d) using semi-analytical algorithms (SAA). However, the accuracy of these algorithms is currently limited in highly turbid environments, such as Amazon Floodplains, due to the SAA parametrization steps. In this study, we assessed an SAA approach for K-d retrieval using a sizeable (n = 239) and diverse dataset (e.g., K-d (490) ranging from almost 0 to up to 30 m(-1) with mean values of 5.75 +/- 3.94 m(-1)) in Amazon freshwater ecosystem. The main framework of this study consists of i) re-parametrization of a quasi-analytical algorithm using regional in-situ inherent optical properties (IOPs) and ii) application and validation of SAA for K-d retrieval using in-situ and Sentinel-2/MSI (n = 49) derived from Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-IS). Overall, the performance of the calibrated SAA was satisfactory for both in-situ and satellite R-rs. The validation results with in-situ data achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) lower than 22%, Correlation Coefficient (R) > 0.80, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 1.7 m(-1) and bias between 0.73 and 1.34 for simulated visible bands of Sentinel-2/MSI (490, 560 and 660 nm) (VIS). The results using MSI imagery were similar to those of in-situ, with R > 0.9, MAPE < 20%, RMSE < 1.25 m(-1), and bias between 0.98 and 1.10 for VIS bands, which illustrate the viability of this methodology for K-d mapping in Amazon Floodplain Lakes. Therefore, this study demonstrates a successful application of satellite remote sensing data for the spatialization of the K-d in the optically complex waters of Amazon Basin, which is essential for the ecological management of the Amazon Floodplain Lakes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of land use changes using remote sensing techniques in urban areas is important in appraising urban development and environmental sustainability. However, when considering the cost-effectiveness and mapping accuracy, selection of a proper data source and an image classification technique has become a challenge, especially for researchers in the developing countries. This study, hence, aimed at investigating the effectiveness of two image sources, Google Earth and Landsat 8 as well as two classification methods, pixel- based classification and on-screen digitisation, in studying land use changes in Hambantota urban area covering a land area of about 4,000 hectares. Land use maps were created applying the two aforementioned classification techniques on the two open source images in different combinations to select the best option for studying land use changes in smaller urban areas. Results show that the overall accuracy of pixel-based classification for Landsat 8 and Google Earth images are 62.6 % and 59.1 %, respectively, whereas on-screen digitisation of Google Earth imagery resulted in the highest overall accuracy of 88.4 %. Therefore, Google Earth images with on-screen digitisation increased the accuracy of the land use map by 25.8 % and 29.3 %, respectively, compared to land use maps created by pixel-based classification of Landsat 8 and Google Earth images. Further, classification accuracies of paddy lands and sandy areas were improved by 74 % and 61 %, respectively, when on-screen digitisation method was applied to Google Earth images compared to pixel-based classification of Landsat 8 and Google Earth images. Therefore, use of on-screen digitisation method on Google Earth imagery is recommended as a cost-effective and high accuracy method for land use mapping of smaller urban areas, particularly, in developing countries.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in conservative surgery for breast cancer: a changing role in clinical practice
T2  - MINERVA CHIRURGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that the extent of surgical treatment in both breast and axilla can be minimized through a multimodal and personalized management, based on assessment of breast cancer (BC) molecular subtypes, genetics and on the prevailing relevance of systemic therapies. Axillary lymph-nodes dissection (ALND) represents the older surgical modality for appropriate staging and for adjuvant systemic and radiation therapies planning. Thanks to findings from extensive and crucial clinical trials, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) replaced this approach, obviating the need for ALND in node-negative disease patients, both in mastectomy and conservative surgery, and becoming a cnicial turning point in BC managing. Furthermore, recent clinical trials have established that ALND can be avoided in those patients with low axillary disease burden in the sentinel nodes who are undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy. Several studies also proved that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increases the BCS rates, as well reducing the extent of axillary surgery. The potential oncological safety of axillary observation choice in early BC patients undergoing BCS, in the recent perspective of the prevailing value of BC biology, is also under scientific evaluation. This study explores the current role of SLNB in BC patients eligible for BCS, providing a view into future directions in BC care.

TI  - Axillary surgery in breast cancer: An updated historical perspective
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This historical surgical retrospection focuses on the temporal de-escalation axillary surgery, focusing on the unceasing efforts of researchers toward new challenges, as documented by extensive studies and trials. Axillary surgery has evolved, aiming to offer the best oncologic treatment and improve the quality of life of women. Axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND) has been replaced by sentinel lymphnode biopsy (SLNB) in women with early clinically node-negative breast cancer, providing adequate axillary nodal staging information with minimal morbidity, and becoming the standard of care in the management of breast cancer. However, this is only the beginning. Strategies in defining systemic and radiotherapeutic treatments have gradually been optimized, offering increasingly refined and targeted breast cancer treatment tools. In recent years, the paradigm of completion ALND after a positive SLNB has been questioned, and several studies have led to revolutionary changes in clinical practice. Moreover, the increasingly pivotal role played by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has had a profound effect on the extent of axillary surgery, paving the way to a more finite "targeted" procedure in women with node-positive breast cancer who convert to negative nodes clinically after NAC. The utility of SLNB itself and its subsequent omission in women with negative nodes clinically and breast conservative surgery is also under scientific evaluation.The changes over time in the surgical approach to breast cancer have been numerous and significant. The novel emerging perspective characterized by recent advances in biology and genetics, in dedicated axillary ultrasound imaging and chemotherapy regimens, is the present reality that points to the future of axillary node treatment in breast cancer.

TI  - Detection of land cover changes in Baluchistan (shared between Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan) using the MODIS Land Cover Product
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes have been one of the most important and persistent factors recently causing changes in the Earth's land. The present study aimed to detect land use and land cover (LULC) changes in Baluchistan, in Southwestern Asia, which is shared by the three countries of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, using satellite remote-sensing products. To this end, the global land cover classification provided for a period of 13 years from 2001 to 2013 by the MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) was used. The changes and dynamics of different land cover classes were investigated using net change analysis and cross-tabulating matrix analysis methods. The net change analysis showed that the most area of Baluchistan is covered by the barren or sparsely vegetated land cover (about 82%) and the shrubland (about 16%) classes. The dynamics analysis of different land cover classes also indicated that there were almost mutually inverse relationships between the different land cover classes in Baluchistan. Such mutual relationships were most common between the following pair classes: shrublands-bare and non-vegetated lands; grasslands-bare and non-vegetated land classes; croplands-bare and non-vegetated lands classes; and shrublands-grasslands. The most unstable land cover classes in this territory were forests, Savannas, and grassland classes. Also, the analysis of land cover changes in the period 2001-2013 provided no clear and accurate evidence of desertification and land degradation at this spatial scale in Baluchistan.

TI  - Intercomparison of Sonde, WRF/CAMx and Satellite Sounder Profile Data for the Paso Del Norte Region
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paso Del Norte (PdN) region comprises the city of El Paso, TX, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and some neighboring cities in the state of New Mexico. Developing a regional weather model for this specific region has always been challenging due to its complex terrain. To obtain more accurate weather and pollution forecasting for the PdN region, the results of the downscaled WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) model were intercompared with meteorological satellite data, with ground and radiosonde dataset. In addition, it is critical to analyze the distributions of ozone concentrations to better understand atmospheric aerosol concentrations and predict them both more accurately. Hence, in this study the ozone results of CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) were extensively intercompared with ozonesonde data. The radiosonde/ozonesonde data were obtained throughout a campaign conducted during the summer of 2017 in the PdN region. Different meteorological variables such as temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, and ozone concentrations were used for comparison at several locations in the PdN region. The TCEQ (Texas Commission of Environment Quality) data from different CAMS (Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations) were used for ground data intercomparison with the WRF results. The meteorological satellite sounding data were retrieved using an in-house satellite antenna receiver. The results of this research paper will not only provide better pollution forecasting capability for the PdN region but also for other regions with similar topography and terrain.

TI  - Hedgehogs, Squirrels, and Blackbirds as Sentinel Hosts for Active Surveillance of <i>Borrelia miyamotoi</i> and <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> Complex in Urban and Rural Environments
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, is one of the most common vector-borne zoonotic diseases in Europe. Knowledge about the enzootic circulation of Borrelia pathogens between ticks and their vertebrate hosts is epidemiologically important and enables assessment of the health risk for the human population. In our project, we focused on the following vertebrate species: European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), Northern white-breasted hedgehog (E. roumanicus), Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), and Common blackbird (Turdus merula). The cadavers of accidentally killed animals used in this study constitute an available source of biological material, and we have confirmed its potential for wide monitoring of B. burgdorferi s.l. presence and genospecies diversity in the urban environment. High infection rates (90% for E. erinaceus, 73% for E. roumanicus, 91% for S. vulgaris, and 68% for T. merula) were observed in all four target host species; mixed infections by several genospecies were detected on the level of individuals, as well as in particular tissue samples. These findings show the usefulness of multiple tissue sampling as tool for revealing the occurrence of several genospecies within one animal and the risk of missing particular B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies when looking in one organ alone.

M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Acinic cell carcinoma(ACC)is an invasive malignancy primarily characterized by proliferation of tumor cells that resemble acinar cells of the salivary glands and pancreas. ACC of the mammary glands is rare. We report a case of primary ACC of the breast. Two masses were revealed in the left mammary gland of a 57-year-old woman who visited our hospital through screening mammography. The lesions were identified as synchronous multiple breast carcinoma of 2 different histological types; ACC and tubulolobular carcinoma. For treatment, left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed, followed by postoperative chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of ACC revealed abundant acinar- like structures formed by tumor cells with prominent eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm. Immunostaining was positive for S-100 protein, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, alpha1-antitrypsin, and lysozyme. The tumor cells were negative for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, which indicated that they had a triple-negative phenotype. Although primary ACC of the breast is regarded as low-grade triple-negative breast carcinoma with a favorable prognosis, further accumulation of cases may be needed to elucidate the biological features of ACC and investigate appropriate therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Operational Service for Mapping the Baltic Sea Landfast Ice Properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltic Sea is partly covered by sea ice in every winter season. Landfast ice (LFI) on the Baltic Sea is a place for recreational activities such as skiing and ice fishing. Over thick LFI ice roads can be established between mainland and islands to speed up transportation compared to the use of ferries. LFI also allows transportation of material to or from islands without piers for large ships. For all these activities, information on LFI extent and sea ice thickness, snow thickness and degree of ice deformation on LFI is very important. We generated new operational products for these LFI parameters based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and existing products and prediction models on the Baltic Sea ice properties. The products are generated daily and have a 500 m pixel size. They are visualized in a web-portal titled "Baltic Sea landfast ice extent and thickness (BALFI)" which has free access. The BALFI service was started in February 2019. Before the BALFI service, information on the LFI properties in fine scale (<1 km) was not available from any single source or product. We studied the accuracy and quality of the BALFI products for the ice season 2019-2020 using ice charts and in-situ coastal ice station data. We suggest that the current products give usable information on the Baltic LFI properties for various end-users. We also identify some topics for the further development of the BALFI products.

TI  - Inventory and Spatial Distribution of Glacial Lakes in Arunachal Pradesh, Eastern Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study generates a glacial lake inventory of Arunachal Pradesh, Eastern Himalaya, India using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images (2016-2018). The study reveals that there are in total 1532 (> 0.001 km(2)) glacial lakes, covering an area of 93.7 km(2). Glacier erosion lakes are the most dominant type with 1268 glacial lakes (82.8%) and an area of 76.8 km(2) (similar to 82%). About 50% of the lakes are located in the four districts of eastern Arunachal Pradesh, while similar to 16% in the three districts of central and similar to 33% in the four districts of western Arunachal Pradesh. The western Arunachal Pradesh has mixed patterns of glacial lakes types, whereas the erosion lakes dominate the eastern and central Arunachal Pradesh. The current inventory can serve as a baseline database for understanding glacial lake-related flood hazard studies in Arunachal Pradesh.

TI  - Transplanting Date Estimation Using Sentinel-1 Satellite Data for Paddy Rice Damage Assessment in Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Indonesia, there is a need to improve the efficiency of damage assessments of the agricultural insurance system for paddy rice producers affected by floods, droughts, pests, and diseases. In this study, we develop a method to estimate the transplanting date required for damage assessments of paddy rice fields. The study area is the Cihea irrigation district in West Java, Republic of Indonesia. Backscattering coefficients of VH polarization measured by a synthetic aperture radar onboard the Sentinel-1 satellite were used for the estimations. We investigated the accuracy of the estimations of the proposed method by smoothing out the time-series data, applying a speckle filter, and by signal synthesis of the surrounding fields. It was found that these variations effectively improved the estimation accuracy. To further improve the estimation accuracy, the data for all incident angles were used after correcting the incident angle dependence of the backscattering coefficients for three types of data with different incident angles (32 degrees, 41 degrees, and 45 degrees) obtained in the study area. The estimated transplanting date for each field in the test site was compared with the transplanting date obtained through interviews. The standard deviations of the estimation errors for the four cropping periods from March 2018 to February 2020 were found to be similar to 5-6 days, and the percentages of estimation errors in transplanting dates within 5, 10, and 15 days were estimated to be 69%, 92%, and 97%, respectively. It was confirmed that a sufficiently reliable transplanting date estimation can be obtained similar to 10-15 days after transplantation.

TI  - Comparison of Surface Solar Irradiance from Ground Observations and Satellite Data (1990-2016) over a Complex Orography Region (Piedmont-Northwest Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) surface solar irradiance (SSI) products were compared with ground-based observations over the Piedmont region (north-western Italy) for the period 1990-2016. These products were SARAH-2.1 (Surface Solar Radiation DataSet-Heliosat version 2.1) and CLARA-A2 (Cloud, Albedo and Surface Radiation dataset version A2). The aim was to contribute to the discussion on the representativeness of satellite SSI data including a focus on high-elevation areas. The comparison between SSI averages shows that for low OCI (orographic complexity index) stations, satellite series have higher values than corresponding ground-based observations, whereas for high OCI stations, SSI values for satellite records are mainly lower than for ground stations. The comparison between SSI anomalies highlights that satellite records have an excellent performance in capturing SSI day-to-day variability of ground-based low OCI stations. In contrast, for high OCI stations, the agreement is much lower, due to the higher uncertainty in both satellite and ground-based records. Finally, if the temporal trends are considered, average low-elevation ground-based SSI observations show a positive trend, whereas satellite records do not highlight significant trends. Focusing on high-elevation stations, the observed trends for ground-based and satellite records are more similar with the only exception of summer. This divergence seems to be due to the relevant role of atmospheric aerosols on SSI trends.

TI  - A satellite-driven hydro-economic model to support agricultural water resources management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of water resources among competing uses presents a complex technical and policy challenge. Integrated hydro-economic models capable of simulating the hydrologic system in irrigated and non-irrigated regions including the response of farmers to hydrologic constraints and economic and policy incentives, provide a framework to understand biophysical and socioeconomic implications of changing water availability. We present a transformative hydro-economic model of agricultural production driven by multi-sensor satellite observations, outputs from regional climate models, and socioeconomic data. Our approach overcomes the limitations of current decision support systems for agricultural water management and provides policymakers and natural resource managers with satellite data-driven, state-wide, operational models capable of anticipating how farmers allocate water, land, and other resources when confronted with new climate patterns, policy rules, or market signals. The model can also quantify how farming decisions affect agricultural water supplies. We demonstrate the model through an application in the state of Montana.

TI  - Hierarchical Geographic Object-Based Vegetation Type Extraction Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing vegetation type information with accurate surface distribution is one of the important tasks of remote sensing of the ecological environment. Many studies have explored ecosystem structure information at specific spatial scales based on specific remote sensing data, but it is still rare to extract vegetation information at various landscape levels from a variety of remote sensing data. Based on Gaofen-1 satellite (GF-1) Wide-Field-View (WFV) data (16 m), Ziyuan-3 satellite (ZY-3) and airborne LiDAR data, this study comparatively analyzed the four levels of vegetation information by using the geographic object-based image analysis method (GEOBIA) on the typical natural secondary forest in Northeast China. The four levels of vegetation information include vegetation/non-vegetation (L1), vegetation type (L2), forest type (L3) and canopy and canopy gap (L4). The results showed that vegetation height and density provided by airborne LiDAR data could extract vegetation features and categories more effectively than the spectral information provided by GF-1 and ZY-3 images. Only 0.5 m LiDAR data can extract four levels of vegetation information (L1-L4); and from L1 to L4, the total accuracy of the classification decreased orderly 98%, 93%, 80% and 69%. Comparing with 2.1 m ZY-3, the total classification accuracy of L1, L2 and L3 extracted by 2.1 m LiDAR data increased by 3%, 17% and 43%, respectively. At the vegetation/non-vegetation level, the spatial resolution of data plays a leading role, and the data types used at the vegetation type and forest type level become the main influencing factors. This study will provide reference for data selection and mapping strategies for hierarchical multi-scale vegetation type extraction.
