TI  - Quantifying the response of potential flooding risk to urban growth in Beijing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global urban growth leads to a great increase in the impervious surface area (ISA) such as roads, plazas, airports, and parking lots, and consequently reshapes hydrological regimes in urban basins. Beijing, the capital of China, has experienced rapid urban growth since the 1980s. However, the spatial-temporal variability of the ISA and its impact on flooding risk are unclear. This study monitored urban growth (i.e., the evolution of the ISA) in Beijing for the period of 1980-2015 based on Landsat data, and identified the response of surface runoff yield using a land-surface hydrological model. The modeling at a relatively high spatial resolution (similar to 6 km) was driven with retrieved long-term ISA dynamics, Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product, and climate forcings. The results show that the impervious surface fraction (ISF) in Beijing increased from 8.73% (1448.16 km(2)) in 1980 to 22.22% (3685.92 km(2)) in 2015. With a demarcation at around the year 2000. the ISA growth presents a new pattern with a northeast-southwest direction from the Core Functional Zone (Core-Zone). Due to the ISA expansion, the simulated runoff coefficient in 2010 is approximately doubled compared to that of 1980. We identified an ISF threshold of approximately 6%, beyond which every 1% increase in the ISF may increase the surface runoff by approximately 5.51 mm/year, and thereby poses a high potential flooding risk even under a moderate rainfall event. In four typical historical storms, the sensitivity coefficients of surface runoff to precipitation and ISF were 0.97 and 0.63, respectively, indicating impervious surfaces dramatically enhanced the potential flooding risk Our findings have implications for urban planning and the construction of sponge city in Beijing.

TI  - Irrigation cooling effect on land surface temperature across China based on satellite observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of irrigation on temperature has attracted much attention because its cooling effect may mask the warming due to other factors, such as greenhouse gas forcing. Although many studies have examined the irrigation cooling effect (ICE) based on near-surface air temperature from meteorological observations or climate model simulations, few studies have directly addressed the effect of irrigation on land surface temperature (LST), which is closely linked to the surface energy balance and near-surface air temperature. In this paper, an ICE detection (ICED) method is proposed to assess the effect of irrigation on LST using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products across China. The magnitude of the ICE is calculated as the 1ST difference between irrigated area and adjacent non-irrigated area in the self-adaptive moving window determined by the ICED method. The results show that irrigation cools daytime LST by 1.15 K, and cools nighttime LST by 0.13 K, on average, across irrigated areas in China. The effect of irrigation on LST differs greatly among the climate zones and seasons, characterized by the enhanced ICE in arid regions and the growing season. In the arid climate zone, nearly all the irrigated areas show a lower daytime LST than the adjacent non-irrigated areas, leading to a strong ICE magnitude of >6 K in the growing season. In the humid climate zone, the impact of irrigation on 1ST is generally negligible, with a magnitude around zero throughout the year. This study provides observational evidence and a comprehensive assessment of the effect of irrigation on LST. The proposed ICED method has the potential to be used to study the spatiotemporal variation of the effect of irrigation on 1ST over other regions with intensive irrigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characterisation of respiratory syncytial virus activity in children and adults presenting with acute respiratory illness at primary care clinics in Singapore, 2014-2018
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important respiratory pathogen that affects people of all ages.Objectives We examined the patterns of RSV circulation in 2014-2018, and investigated their age-specific differences in tropical Singapore.Methods Nasopharyngeal and/or throat swabs were taken from outpatient attendees for the national influenza virological surveillance among those who presented with acute respiratory illness in the community. Specimens tested negative for influenza were then tested for RSV and other respiratory pathogens.Results Among 8436 influenza-negative specimens tested during the five-year period, 5.8% (95% confidence interval 5.3%-6.3%) were positive for RSV. The peak of RSV activity occurred around middle of the year. The age-specific proportion of RSV detections showed a reverse J-shaped pattern; RSV positivity was the highest in young children <= 2 years of age (10.9%), followed by those aged 3-5 years (6.4%) and persons aged >= 65 years (5.3%), while the nadir was observed in the age group of 15-24 years (1.2%). RSV type A was predominantly circulating in children <= 5 years of age from 2014 to 2015 and 2017, whereas in 2016, they were more affected by type B.Conclusion Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently detected among the two age groups that have been recommended for influenza vaccination; persons >= 65 years of age and children 6 months to <5 years of age. Characterisation of RSV activity in the community helps to better inform public health policies for effective prevention and control interventions.

TI  - The risk of febrile seizures following influenza and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence on the risk of febrile seizures after inactivated influenza vaccine (11V) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is mixed. In the FDA-sponsored Sentinel Initiative, we examined risk of febrile seizures after IIV and PCV13 in children 6-23 months of age during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 influenza seasons.Methods: Using claims data and a self-controlled risk interval design, we compared the febrile seizure rate in a risk interval (0-1 days) versus control interval (14-20 days). In exploratory analyses, we assessed whether the effect of IIV was modified by concomitant PCV13 administration.Results: Adjusted for age, calendar time and concomitant administration of the other vaccine, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for risk of febrile seizures following IIV was 1.12 (95% CI 0.80, 1.56) and following PCV13 was 1.80 (95% CI 1.29, 2.52). The attributable risk for febrile seizures following PCV13 ranged from 0.33 to 5.16 per 100,000 doses by week of age.The age and calendar-time adjusted IRR comparing exposed to unexposed time was numerically larger for concomitant 11V and PCV13 (IRR 2.80, 95% CI 1.63, 4.83), as compared to PCV13 without concomitant IIV (IRR 1.54, 95% CI 1.04, 2.28), and the IRR for IIV without concomitant PCV13 suggested no independent effects of IIV (1RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63, 1.42). Taken together, this suggests a possible interaction between IIV and PCV13, though our study was not sufficiently powered to provide a precise estimate of the interaction.Conclusions: We found an elevated risk of febrile seizures after PCV13 vaccine but not after IIV. The risk of febrile seizures after PCV13 is low compared to the overall risk in this population of children, and the risk should be interpreted in the context of the importance of preventing pneumococcal infections.

TI  - Icings and groundwater conditions in permafrost catchments of northwestern Canada
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Icings are sheet-like masses of ice that form on the ground surface or in fluvial channels from groundwater seepage. Although the presence of icings in the landscape is known, few studies investigated their regional distribution and explored relations with terrain factors including permafrost and winter baseflow conditions. Here, we mapped the distribution of icings in a 618,430 km(2) area of northwestern Canada from a stack of 573 Landsat imageries (1985-2017) and determined using hydrometric data the winter baseflow contribution to the total annual discharge of 17 rivers in the study area. The 1402 mapped icings occur preferentially at the foothills of heavily faulted karstic mountainous regions in the continuous permafrost. Winter baseflow and its contribution to annual discharge was lower in continuous permafrost catchments than in discontinuous permafrost but showed a general increase over the 1970-2016 period. As such, the distribution of icings appears to be sensitive to winter air temperatures and winter baseflow conditions and icings located at the southern boundary of continuous permafrost would be more sensitive to degrading permafrost and the predicted increase in winter baseflow.

TI  - Geology of the InSight landing site on Mars
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft landed successfully on Mars and imaged the surface to characterize the surficial geology. Here we report on the geology and subsurface structure of the landing site to aid in situ geophysical investigations. InSight landed in a degraded impact crater in Elysium Planitia on a smooth sandy, granule- and pebble-rich surface with few rocks. Superposed impact craters are common and eolian bedforms are sparse. During landing, pulsed retrorockets modified the surface to reveal a near surface stratigraphy of surficial dust, over thin unconsolidated sand, underlain by a variable thickness duricrust, with poorly sorted, unconsolidated sand with rocks beneath. Impact, eolian, and mass wasting processes have dominantly modified the surface. Surface observations are consistent with expectations made from remote sensing data prior to landing indicating a surface composed of an impact-fragmented regolith overlying basaltic lava flows. The InSight spacecraft landed on Mars on November 2018. Here, the authors characterize the surficial geology of the landing site and compare with observations and models derived from remote sensing data prior to landing and from ongoing in situ geophysical investigations of the subsurface.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to assess the trend of spatiotemporal relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) under different ranges of LST and NDVI values for Raipur City of India using fifteen cloud-free Landsat data sets of the pre-monsoon season from 2002 to 2018. LST maintains a strong negative relationship with NDVI for the whole of the study area. The relationship is quite insignificant for both the high LST zones and low LST zones. The results also indicate that under the positive NDVI values, the LST-NDVI relationships are strong to moderately negative, whereas it is positive and non-consistent under the negative values of NDVI. The results also show that the relationship is stronger in the earlier times, whereas it is weaker in recent times. An increase in heterogeneous landscape inside the city boundary strongly supports the changing pattern of LST-NDVI relationship.

TI  - Malignant Hidradenocarcinoma of the Axilla
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant hidradenocarcinoma is a very rare and highly aggressive primary skin neoplasm that arises in the eccrine sweat glands. Diagnosis is typically made with histopathological evaluation after excisional biopsy. Reports of this tumor are scarce in the literature, thus making its characterization and management particularly challenging.A 71-year-old male presented in the clinic with swelling of the left lateral axilla on routine dermatological examination. Clinically, the lesion was suspected to be a capillary hemangioma. Upon surgical excision, the specimen was diagnosed as malignant hidradenocarcinoma based on histological characterization with immunohistochemical staining. Subsequent wide excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, which came back negative for residual tumor and metastasis.Due to the low incidence of this cancer and the markedly poor prognosis, accurate diagnosis of these tumors is highly important. Wide excisional biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy appear to be the most common initial treatment plans based on the available literature. With high rates of recurrence and metastasis, there remains the need to characterize effective adjuvant therapy for the post-operative management of hidradenocarcinoma.

TI  - Urban subsidence monitoring by SBAS-InSAR technique with multi-platform SAR images: a case study of Beijing Plain, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing, as the capital of China, suffers severe subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal. In this paper, the SBAS-InSAR technique was used to detect surface deformations in the Beijing plain. 47 scenes Envisat ASAR images obtained during June 2003 to August 2010, and 24 Radarsat-2 images obtained during November 2010 to December 2013 were employed to retrieve vertical deformation characteristic over this area. The deformation magnitude, evolution process and spatial distribution of representative targets that occurred during 11 years were retrieved. The vertical surface displacement rates during two periods were validated via leveling observations, which have an RMSE =1.15mm/a, which indicates that the two types of subsidence matched very well. The interferometric results revealed that the subsidence during the two periods show similar special distributions and have an uneven spatial-temporal trend. The scope and deformation rates of funnels continuously increased with from 2003 to 2013. Meanwhile, multiple expressways and urban ring roads spanned the subsidence funnel with sharp deformation rate, and showed different subsidence properties along their paths. Additionally, the spatial and temporal correlation analyses between the deformation measurements and the dynamic variation of groundwater pumping was also performed to explore the response relationship.

TI  - Predicting soil organic carbon stocks under commercial forest plantations in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa using remotely sensed data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Commercial forest plantations are increasing globally, absorbing a large amount of carbon valuable for climate change mitigation. Whereas most carbon assimilation studies have mainly focused on natural forests, understanding the spatial distribution of carbon in commercial forests is central to determining their role in the global carbon cycle. Forest soils are the largest carbon reservoir; hence soils under commercial forests could store a significant amount of carbon. However, the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) within forest landscapes is still poorly understood. Due to limitations encountered in traditional systems of SOC determination, especially at large spatial extents, remote sensing approaches have recently emerged as a suitable option in mapping soil characteristics. Therefore, this study aimed at predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in commercial forests using Landsat 8 data. Eighty-one soil samples were processed for SOC concentration and fifteen Landsat 8 derived variables, including vegetation indices and bands were used as predictors to SOC variability. The random forest (RF) was adopted for variable selection and regression method for SOC prediction. Variable selection was done using RF backward elimination to derive three best subset predictors and improve prediction accuracy. These variables were then used to build the RF final model for SOC prediction. The RF model yielded good accuracies with root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) of 0.704 t/ha (16.50% of measured mean SOC) and 10-fold cross-validation of 0.729 t/ha (17.09% of measured mean SOC). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Landsat 8 bands and derived vegetation indices and RF algorithm in predicting SOC stocks in commercial forests. This study provides an effective framework for local, national or global carbon accounting as well as helps forest managers constantly evaluate the status of SOC in commercial forest compartments.

TI  - Sebaceous carcinoma of the breast predominantly characterized by intraductal growth: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is frequently classified as periocular or extraocular. Extraocular SC is rare and mainly occurs in the head and neck, the major salivary glands, or oral mucosa. SC of the breast, lung, and ovary is particularly rare, and the few cases of SC of the breast predominantly exhibit intraductal growth. Case presentation A 47-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with accumulated polymorphic calcification in the left breast which was detected using mammography. Ultrasonography revealed an irregular 13-mm mass in the left breast, and analysis of a core needle biopsy revealed noninvasive ductal carcinoma. Total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathology demonstrated that carcinoma in situ (CIS) represented a significant lesion, and the cytoplasm of tumor cells was clear with numerous minute vacuoles. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that most tumor cells expressed adipophilin. Together, these findings led to a diagnosis of SC, mainly comprising CIS. Conclusions We encountered a rare case of SC of the breast with predominant CIS.

TI  - Target-oriented habitat and wildlife management: estimating forage quantity and quality of semi-natural grasslands with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-natural grasslands represent ecosystems with high biodiversity. Their conservation depends on the removal of biomass, for example, through grazing by livestock or wildlife. For this, spatially explicit information about grassland forage quantity and quality is a prerequisite for efficient management. The recent advancements of the Sentinel satellite mission offer new possibilities to support the conservation of semi-natural grasslands. In this study, the combined use of radar (Sentinel-1) and multispectral (Sentinel-2) data to predict forage quantity and quality indicators of semi-natural grassland in Germany was investigated. Field data for organic acid detergent fibre concentration (oADF), crude protein concentration (CP), compressed sward height (CSH) and standing biomass dry weight (DM) collected between 2015 and 2017 were related to remote sensing data using the random forest regression algorithm. In total, 102 optical- and radar-based predictor variables were used to derive an optimized dataset, maximizing the predictive power of the respective model. High R-2 values were obtained for the grassland quality indicators oADF (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 2.29%) and CP (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 1.70%) using 15 and 8 predictor variables respectively. Lower R-2 values were achieved for the quantity indicators CSH (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 2.77 cm) and DM (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 90.84 g/m(2)). A permutation-based variable importance measure indicated a strong contribution of simple ratio-based optical indices to the model performance. In particular, the ratios between the narrow near-infrared and red-edge region were among the most important variables. The model performance for oADF, CP and CSH was only marginally increased by adding Sentinel-1 data. For DM, no positive effect on the model performance was observed by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Thus, optical Sentinel-2 data might be sufficient to accurately predict forage quality, and to some extent also quantity indicators of semi-natural grassland.

TI  - Utilizing Landsat-8 and ASTER data in geologic mapping of hyper-arid mountainous region: case of Gabal Batoga area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-8 and ASTER images were utilized to derive geological information and mapping of a hyper-arid mountainous region. Principal component analyses and band rationing techniques in conjunction with petrography and field investigations enabled to produce a modified new geologic map of Gabal Batoga area, along the Red Sea coast of Egypt. The area is built by non-consanguineous diverse Pan-African basement rock units. These rock units are widely distributed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield. ASTER principal component images (PC2, PC5, PC7) and (PC2, PC3, PC8) as well as band ratio images (b4/b7, b3/b4, b2/b1) were effective in accurate lithological discrimination of the exposed rock units in the study area. The process was also enhanced and emphasized by Landsat-8 principal component images (PC2, PC4, and PC7) and band ratio (b6/b2, b6/b7, b6/b5 x b4/b5). The used methodology and techniques can be applicable in many similar arid and hyper-arid areas in the Arabian-Nubian Shield and elsewhere.

TI  - Merging regional and global aerosol optical depth records from major available satellite products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite instruments provide a vantage point for studying aerosol loading consistently over different regions of the world. However, the typical lifetime of a single satellite platform is on the order of 5-15 years; thus, for climate studies, the use of multiple satellite sensors should be considered. Discrepancies exist between aerosol optical depth (AOD) products due to differences in their information content, spatial and temporal sampling, calibration, cloud masking, and algorithmic assumptions. Users of satellite-based AOD time-series are confronted with the challenge of choosing an appropriate dataset for the intended application. In this study, 16 monthly AOD products obtained from different satellite sensors and with different algorithms were inter-compared and evaluated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) monthly AOD. Global and regional analyses indicate that products tend to agree qualitatively on the annual, seasonal and monthly timescales but may be offset in magnitude. Several approaches were then investigated to merge the AOD records from different satellites and create an optimised AOD dataset. With few exceptions, all merging approaches lead to similar results, indicating the robustness and stability of the merged AOD products. We introduce a gridded monthly AOD merged product for the period 1995-2017. We show that the quality of the merged product is as least as good as that of individual products. Optimal agreement of the AOD merged product with AERONET further demonstrates the advantage of merging multiple products. This merged dataset provides a long-term perspective on AOD changes over different regions of the world, and users are encouraged to use this dataset.

TI  - Twitter as a sentinel tool to monitor public opinion on vaccination: an opinion mining analysis from September 2016 to August 2017 in Italy
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media have become a common way for people to express their personal viewpoints, including sentiments about health topics. We present the results of an opinion mining analysis on vaccination performed on Twitter from September 2016 to August 2017 in Italy. Vaccine-related tweets were automatically classified as against, in favor or neutral in respect of the vaccination topic by means of supervised machine-learning techniques. During this period, we found an increasing trend in the number of tweets on this topic. According to the overall analysis by category, 60% of tweets were classified as neutral, 23% against vaccination, and 17% in favor of vaccination. Vaccine-related events appeared able to influence the number and the opinion polarity of tweets. In particular, the approval of the decree introducing mandatory immunization for selected childhood diseases produced a prominent effect in the social discussion in terms of number of tweets. Opinion mining analysis based on Twitter showed to be a potentially useful and timely sentinel system to assess the orientation of public opinion toward vaccination and, in future, it may effectively contribute to the development of appropriate communication and information strategies.

TI  - Bi- and three-dimensional urban change detection using sentinel-1 SAR temporal series
T2  - GEOINFORMATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are subject to multiple and very different changes, in a two- and three-dimensional sense, mostly as a consequence of human activities, such as urbanization, but also because of catastrophic and sudden events, such as earthquakes, landslides, or floods. This paper aims at designing a procedure able to cope with both types of changes by combining interferometric coherence and backscatter amplitude, and provide a semantically meaningful analysis of the changes detected in both city inner cores and suburban areas. Specifically, this paper focuses on detecting multi-dimensional changes in urban areas using a stack of repeat-pass SAR data sets from Sentinel-1A/B satellites. The proposed procedure jointly exploits amplitude and coherence time series to perform this task. SAR amplitude is used to extract changes about the urban extents, i.e. in 2D, while interferometric coherence is sensitive to the presence of buildings and to their size, i. e. to 3D changes. The proposed algorithm is tested using a time-series of two years of Sentinel-1 data, from May 2016 to October 2018, and in two different Chinese cities, Changsha and Hangzhou, with the aim to understand both the temporal evolution of the urban extents, and the changes within what is constantly classified as "urban" throughout the considered time period.

TI  - Reliability of labeling red cell units with minor antigen historical results and process considerations
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Several approaches are used by blood centers when providing minor (non-ABO/D) antigen-negative RBCs to hospitals. Details vary but include providing results on the unit labeling intended for clinical use without retyping or providing results on packing documents or via computer query requiring confirmation. Recent regulatory changes allow labeling with historical minor antigen results, defined as previously performed by the donor center on two different donations with results linked to the donor and confirmed concordant. Here we investigate causes of discrepancies and identify critical process steps.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Nine years (2009-2017) of data were reviewed for number, antigen system, and root cause of discrepancies flagged by the computer when retyping donors prior to labeling (internal discrepancies) or reported by the hospital when retested (external discrepancies). Licensed automated (CcEeK) and tube methods were used.RESULTS Among 300,000 samples phenotyped for CcEe, K, Fy(a/b), Jk(a/b), Ss (>3 million antigens), similar to 1,389,960 were repeated on 2nd donation with 397 (1/3501) discordant; 205 Fy, 118 Rh, and 74 others. Of similar to 682,691 antigen-negative phenotypes provided on unit labeling, similar to 37.5% (256,118) were retyped by hospitals with 29 discrepancies (1/8832), primarily Rh variants.CONCLUSION When repeating minor antigen types by serology, discrepancies are primarily associated with weak Fy(b), among Caucasian donors, and weak/partial Rh antigens in donors of African ancestry. DNA-based testing avoids these. To label with historical results, accuracy is increased by automated testing with direct computer interface. Testing on two donations with results confirmed to be concordant is not inferior to testing on the current donation.

TI  - Identifying marsh dieback events from Landsat image series (1998-2018) with an Autoencoder in the NIWB estuary, South Carolina
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports an inventory of marsh dieback events from spatial and temporal perspectives in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay (NIWB) estuary, South Carolina (SC). Past studies in the Gulf/Atlantic coast states have reported acute marsh dieback events in which marsh rapidly browned and thinned, leaving stubble of dead stems or mudflat with damaged ecosystem services. Reported marsh dieback in SC, however, have been limited. This study identified all marsh dieback events in the estuary since 1998. With 20 annually collected Landsat images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series was extracted. A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder neural network was developed to identify the NDVI anomalies on the trajectories. All marsh dieback patches were extracted, and their inter-annual changes were examined. Results showed a continuous, spatially variable multi-year dieback event in 1998-2005, which aligned with the reported dieback in the early 2000s from other states. The identified patches mostly returned to normal within one year while the phenomenon reoccurred in other areas of the estuary during the prolonged dieback period. This study presents the first attempt to explore long-term dieback dynamics in an estuary using satellite time series. It provides valuable information in documenting marsh healthiness and environmental resilience on SC coasts.

TI  - Heterodissemination: precision targeting container <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes with a cohabiting midge species carrying insect growth regulator
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Management of Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti is challenging in large part due to the cryptic nature of their larval habitats. Autodissemination, using conspecific species to transfer pesticide, is unable to provide proactive control. Here we report results from a new hypothesis, heterodissemination, wherein females of the cohabiting non-biting midge, Chironomus decorus, reared in the laboratory, treated with pyriproxyfen, and released to transfer lethal concentrations to shared mosquito larval habitats.Results Pyriproxyfen-impregnated oil and powder formulations were developed. The average payload for each female midge treated with oil followed by powder formulations was 5.07 +/- 0.92 mu g of active ingredient or 1660 times the median lethal concentration (LC50) for Ae. albopictus or Ae. aegypti in 200 mL of water. Subsequent residue analysis showed pyriproxyfen transference from chironomids, treated with oil formulation only, into water-holding containers up to 2.06 ppb or 171.7 times the LC50. Releasing 20 laboratory reared and contaminated Chironomus decorus into a small room resulted in 80.42 +/- 0.67% and 75.67 +/- 3.14% Ae. albopictus pupal mortality in open and cryptic sentinel ovicups, respectively. Container water volumes ranging up to 4 L did not affect efficacy. In a large field cage, 90.3 +/- 2.5% Ae. albopictus mortality was resulted from releasing 100 treated female midges. Releasing 400 contaminated midges into a residential backyard resulted in 74.3% pupal mortality in sentinel ovicups.Conclusions Room, large field cage and field release trials demonstrated that adult midges reared and treated in the laboratory transfer highly lethal concentrations of pyriproxyfen to Ae. albopictus container habitats. Heterodissemination provides a potential approach for precision, proactive mosquito control, which may draw attention for further studies. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Aquatic community structure as sentinel of recent environmental changes unraveled from lake sedimentary records from the Atacama Desert, Chile
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atacama Desert (21-26 degrees S) is currently one of the driest places on Earth and metal(loid) s are of special concern for this region, which hosts the largest-known porphyry copper deposits produced in Chile. Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22 degrees 20'S-68 degrees 35'W, 2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility, hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations; anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified. Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert of the world.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the potential zone of groundwater recharge is extremely important for the protection of water quality management in groundwater systems. Groundwater potential areas are identified with the help of RS and GIS techniques. In this study, a standard methodology was used for the determination of groundwater potential areas by using the integration of RS and GIS techniques. The composite maps (geology, geomorphology, lineaments, slope, soils and drainage) were generated using GIS tools. The accurate information to obtain the above parameters can be considered for the identification of the groundwater potential areas. The maps are generated using satellite data (LISS-III IRS-P6) and Survey of India (SOI) toposheet of scale 1:50,000. Then, it was integrated with Arc GIS Software for the evaluation of various geomorphic units and demarked the groundwater availability. The groundwater potential zones are classified into five categories like very poor, poor, moderate, good and excellent. In overall, the study area predominately is occupied with denudation hills and pediment slope and contains the less groundwater potential. This groundwater potential information will be useful for the effective identification of a suitable location for the extraction of groundwater.

TI  - A pathogen-derived metabolite induces microglial activation via odorant receptors
T2  - FEBS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Microglia (MG), the principal neuroimmune sentinels in the brain, continuously sense changes in their environment and respond to invading pathogens, toxins, and cellular debris, thereby affecting neuroinflammation. Microbial pathogens produce small metabolites that influence neuroinflammation, but the molecular mechanisms that determine whether pathogen-derived small metabolites affect microglial activation of neuroinflammation remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that odorant receptors (ORs), the largest subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, are involved in microglial activation by pathogen-derived small metabolites. We found that MG express high levels of two mouse ORs, Olfr110 and Olfr111, which recognize a pathogenic metabolite, 2-pentylfuran, secreted by Streptococcus pneumoniae. These interactions activate MG to engage in chemotaxis, cytokine production, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species generation. These effects were mediated through the G(alpha s)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and G(beta gamma)-phospholipase C-Ca2+ pathways. Taken together, our results reveal a novel interplay between the pathogen-derived metabolite and ORs, which has major implications for our understanding of microglial activation by pathogen recognition.Database Model data are available in the PMDB database under the accession number PM0082389.

TI  - Relationships between riparian evapotranspiration and groundwater depth along a semiarid irrigated river valley
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) from riparian vegetation can be difficult to estimate due to relatively abundant water supply, spatial vegetation heterogeneity, and interactions with anthropogenic influences such as shallower groundwater tables, increased salinity, and nonpoint source pollution induced by irrigation. In semiarid south-eastern Colorado, reliable ET estimates are scarce for the riparian corridor that borders the Arkansas River. This work investigates relationships between the riparian ecosystem along the Arkansas River and an underlying alluvial aquifer using ET estimates from remotely sensed data and modelled water table depths. Results from a calibrated, finite-difference groundwater model are used to estimate weekly water table fluctuations in the riparian ecosystem from 1999 to 2009, and estimates of ET are calculated using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model with over 200 Landsat scenes covering over 30 km(2) of riparian ecosystem along a 70-km stretch of the river. Comparison of calculated monthly SSEBop ET to estimated alfalfa reference ET from local micrometeorological station data indicated statistically significant high linear correspondence (R-2 = .87). Daily calculated SSEBop ET showed statistically significant moderate linear correspondence with data from a local weighing lysimeter (R-2 = .59). Simulated monthly SSEBop ET values were larger in drier years compared with wetter years, and ET variability was also larger in drier years. Peak ET most commonly occurred during the month of June for all 11 years of analysis. Relationships between ET and water table depth showed that peak monthly ET was highest when groundwater depths were less than about 3 m, and ET values were significantly lower for groundwater depths greater than 3 m. Negative sample Spearman correlation highlighted riparian corridor locations where ET increased as a result of decreased groundwater depths across years with different hydroclimatic conditions. This study shows how a combination of remotely sensed riparian ET estimates and a regional groundwater model can improve our understanding of linkages between riparian consumptive use and near-river groundwater conditions influenced by irrigation return flow and different climatic drivers.

TI  - A novel approach to use semantic segmentation based deep learning networks to classify multi-temporal SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of SAR data for land cover mapping provides many advantages over land cover classification achieved using optical remote sensing data. However, the classification of SAR data has always been a challenging task. In this study, the feasibility of the use of semantic segmentation based deep learning networks to classify temporal SAR data has been demonstrated. It has been achieved by applying six deep learning architectures viz. Pyramid Scene Parsing, UNET, DeepLabv3+, Path Aggregation Network, Encoder-Decoder Network and Feature Pyramid Network over temporally acquired SAR datasets for three different frequencies (triannual, quarterly and bimonthly). Outputs of all six architectures have been assessed using frequency weighted IoU. It was observed that Pyramid Scene Parsing architecture when applied on bimonthly temporal SAR provides the best results.

AB  - Purpose To determine the risk factors, morbidity, and quality of life associated with same-day surgery in gynecologic oncology. Methods In this prospective study, patients with a good performance status and an indication for a simple procedure [diagnostic laparoscopy (peritoneal carcinomatosis index, biopsy, and Port-A-Cath), adnexectomy or fimbriectomy] and a complex procedure [total hysterectomy, omentectomy with peritoneal staging, pelvic lymphadenectomy (or sentinel lymph node (SLN)), and/or paraaortic lymphadenectomy by minimally invasive surgery] were included. Univariate logistic regression analysis, multivariate analysis, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used in the statistical analyses. Results There were 171 consecutive surgeries (55 complex and 116 simple procedures). The rate of readmissions on the same day and at 30 days postoperatively was, respectively, 8% versus 3% with simple procedures and 16% versus 11% with complex procedures. We modified our procedure to decrease complications by prescribing prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) the next day at 8 am at home instead of the evening before discharge (fewer vaginal hematomas after hysterectomy: 2 hematomas/5 hysterectomies with LMWH on the same day versus 0/22 with LMWH on the next day, P = 0.03). The following factors were significantly associated with readmission: complex procedure (odds ratio [OR] 4.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-10.85, P = 0.003), absence of an exsufflation drain (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.19-7.31, P = 0.019), and end of surgery after 2 pm (OR 5.82, 95% CI 2.13-15.94, P = 0.001). Conclusion We modified our protocol to decrease complications (vaginal hematomas after hysterectomy) by prescribing prophylactic LMWH the next day at 8 am at home instead of the evening before discharge.

T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forecasting of air quality demands better estimates of aerosol emissions. The accuracy of conventional bottom-up approaches to estimate aerosol emissions depends on the degree to which various influencing parameters are estimated. The availability of satellite observations not only enhances the capability of determining various influencing parameters, but also provides alternate ways of assessing aerosol sources. The present study employs a Lagrangian approach to the Advection Diffusion Equation (ADE) to estimate the transported aerosols and hence the Aerosol Source Strength (ASS) using satellite-measured Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and reanalysis wind data. This top-down approach is based on the advection and diffusion of atmospheric aerosols considering wind circulation and atmospheric conditions rather than using indicative parameters. ASS was computed every 3 hr at a 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees grid across California during July 2018. For the computation, AOD retrievals were obtained from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 with observations every 15 min. The data were resampled to the grid every 3 hr, and backward trajectories were run at every gridpoint to ascertain the initial aerosol concentration for the ADE. The final aerosol concentrations obtained from the ADE model were then compared with the observed AOD to obtain the ASS during that time period. The results are indicative of higher ASS around wildfire locations. The ASS values also show good correlation (R-2=0.886) with Fire Radiative Power (FRP) obtained from Terra MODIS fire product. The method was further applied to investigate the spatial correlation of ASS with power plant density, which reveals a steady increase in ASS with power plant density (R-2=0.82).

TI  - Evaluation of postoperative quality of life by PGSAS-45 following local gastrectomy based on the sentinel lymph node concept in early gastric cancer
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The usefulness of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) for early gastric cancer has been demonstrated in a multicenter prospective study. However, quality of life (QOL) after local resection remains unclear. This present study investigated QOL after local resection and distal gastrectomy. Methods We examined 69 patients who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LADG) (n = 44) and laparoscopic local resection (LLR) (n = 25) in our hospital between September 2011 and May 2018. We conducted a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET) with SNNS as LLR. All patients had pStage I or II and none had received adjuvant chemotherapy. We evaluated QOL using the postgastrectomy syndrome assessment scale questionnaire (PGSAS-45) 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Results In PGSAS-45, no significant differences were observed between LLR and LADG at 1 and 6 months after surgery. At 12 months, the LLR group scored better for some of the subscales (SS). In the endoscopic evaluation, the LLR group showed significant improvements in residual gastritis at 6 months (P = 0.006) and esophageal reflux and residual gastritis at 12 months (P = 0.021 and P = 0.017). A significant difference was observed in the prognostic nutritional index, which was assessed using serum samples, between the two groups at 6 months (P = 0.028). The body weight ratio was better in the LLR group than in the LADG group at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.041 and P = 0.007, respectively). Conclusions CLEAN-NET with SNNS preserved a better QOL and nutrition status than LADG in patients with early gastric cancer.

TI  - Assessment of urban aerosol pollution over the Moscow megacity by the MAIAC aerosol product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated the distribution of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with a spatial resolution of 1 km over the Moscow megacity using the MAIAC aerosol product based on MODIS satellite data (Lyapustin et al., 2018) for the warm period of the year (May-September, 2001-2017). AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network)-based validation of satellite estimates near the city centre at Moscow_MSU_MO and over the Moscow suburbs at Zvenigorod revealed that MAIAC AOT at 0.47 mu m is in agreement with AERONET AOT though underestimated by 0.05-0.1 for AOT < 1 and overestimated for smoke conditions with AOT > 1. The MAIAC AOT biases were almost the same for the Moscow_MSU_MO and Zvenigorod AERONET sites, which indicated that the MAIAC algorithm effectively removed the effect of the bright urban surface in the city centre. For the ground-based measurements, the difference between annual median AOT at Moscow_MO_MSU and Zvenigorod (Delta AOT) varied within -0.002 to +0.03, with statistically significant positive bias for most years, and an average Delta AOT was about 0.02. According to the MAIAC dataset, the Delta AOT varied within +/- 0.01 and was not statistically significant. The Delta AOT started decreasing recently due to intensive urban development of the territory around Zvenigorod and the decrease in pollutant emissions in Moscow, which is mainly caused by the environmental regulations. According to the MAIAC dataset, the most pronounced spatial AOT differences over the territory of Moscow were observed at the 5% quantile level, where they reached 0.05-0.06 over several locations and could be attributed to the stationary sources of aerosol pollution, for example, large areas of construction sites, aerosol pollution from roads and highways, or agriculture activities. The differences between the maximum and the mean AOT for different quantiles, except the 95% quantile, within the Moscow region, were about 0.02-0.04, which could be attributed to the local aerosol sources. The application of the MAIAC algorithm over the whole Moscow region has revealed a decreasing AOT trend over the centre of Moscow and an increasing trend over the "New" Moscow territory which experienced an intensive build-up and agricultural development.

TI  - Aerosol retrieval study from multiangle polarimetric satellite data based on optimal estimation method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the optimal estimation (OE) theory, an inversion framework for aerosol retrieval from multiviewing polarimetric satellite measurements, is presented. The retrieved parameters include the wavelength-independent volume concentration and spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD). An OE-iteration approach is proposed to implement the framework. Polarization data from the polarization and directionality of the Earth's reflectance sensor over the Chinese Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region are selected to test the proposed algorithm. The validation against aerosol robotic network products produces high correlation coefficients (R) of 0.85, 0.9, and 0.86 for the fine-mode volume concentration, fine-mode AOD, and total AOD at 500 nm, respectively. These results indicate that the OE retrieval framework is practical and useful in the quantitative retrieval of AOD and fine-mode volume concentration from the multi-angle polarization data.

TI  - Monitoring the effects of open-pit mining on the eco-environment using a moving window-based remote sensing ecological index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental problems caused by mines have been increasing. As one of the most serious types of mining damage caused to the eco-environment, open pits have been the focus of monitoring and management. Previous studies have obtained effective results when evaluating the ecological quality of a mining area by using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). However, the calculation of RSEI does not consider that the ecological environmental impact is limited under natural conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved RSEI based on a moving window model, namely the moving window-based remote sensing ecological index (MW-RSEI). This improved index is more in agreement with the First Law of Geography than RSEI. This study uses Landsat ETM/OLI/TIRS images to extract MW-RSEI information of a case area in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, central China, in 2009 and 2018. The results revealed that the average value of MW-RSEI declined from 0.668 to 0.611 from 2009 to 2018, and the main drivers of the deterioration of the eco-environment were land use/cover (LUCC) changes, most of which were derived from urban expansion and mining. The serious impact of open pits on the eco-environment in mining areas is mainly due to their low vegetation cover; therefore, some effectively managed open pits can have a positive impact on the mining environment. The use of MW-RSEI provides valuable information on the eco-environment surrounding the open pit, which can be used for the rapid and effective monitoring of the eco-environment in mining areas.

TI  - From exotic to invasive in record time: The extreme impact of <i>Rugulopteryx okamurae</i> (Dictyotales, Ochrophyta) in the strait of Gibraltar
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, the exotic seaweed Rugulopteryx okamurae was detected for the first time on the south side of the Strait of Gibraltar, in Ceuta (northern Africa). This highly sensitive area is ideal for monitoring local environmental impacts arising from global warming, as well as the intrusion of alien species. Within one year, R. okamurae became an invasive species with an overflowing competitive capacity and growth. In 2015, more than 5000 tons of upstream biomass was extracted from beaches in Ceuta, and it has since spread irrepressibly on rocky illuminated bottoms of the subtidal zone to a maximum observed depth of 40 m. The highest coverage (80-90%) of R. okamurae in Ceuta was observed between 10 and 20 m depth in illuminated habitats, where it was having a severe impact on local benthic communities which were displaced. Between 5 and 30 m depth, coverage of R. okamurae exceeded 70% over a wide variety of substrate types. A submarine sentinel sessile bioindicators permanent quadrats (SBPQ) station installed in 2013 on poorly lit, vertical, and shady substrate in the El Estrecho Natural Park, on the north side of the Strait of Gibraltar (Tarifa), detected the presence of R. okamurae in July 2016 and recorded the subsequent increase in coverage. These findings reveal the useful role of this type of monitoring SBPQ sentinel station for the detection of impacts and exotic species in marine protected areas, and for the monitoring of global warming based on indicator species. We conclude that the catastrophic bloom of R. okamurae exhibited an initial geographical expansion (2015-2017) to the northern coastal area of the Strait of Gibraltar (Tarifa-Gibraltar) and subsequent extension in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, towards the Atlantic coast (2018) and the Mediterranean coast (2019). This bloom could have been associated with the temperature peak in July 2015 and was thus possibly linked to global warming. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Atmosphere-surface fluxes modeling for the high Andes: The case of paramo catchments of Ecuador
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in atmosphere-surface flux modeling over the mountainous regions of the globe has increased recently, with a major focus on the prediction of water, carbon and other functional indicators in natural and disturbed conditions. However, less research has been centered on exploring energy fluxes (net radiation; sensible, latent and soil heat) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over the Neotropical Andean biome of the paramo. The present study assesses the implementation and parameterization of a state-of-art Land-Surface Model (LSM) for simulation of these fluxes over two representative paramo catchments of southern Ecuador. We evaluated the outputs of the LSM Community Land Model (CLM ver. 4.0) with (i) ground-level flux observations from the first (and highest) Eddy Covariance (EC) tower of the Northern Andean paramos; (ii) spatial ETa estimates from the energy balance-based model METRIC (based on Landsat imagery); and (iii) derived ETa from the closure of the water balance (WB). CLM's energy predictions revealed a significant underestimation on net radiation, which impacts the sensible and soil heat fluxes (underestimation), and delivers a slight overestimation on latent heat flux. Modeled CLM ETa showed acceptable goodness-of-fit (Pearson R = 0.82) comparable to ETa from METRIC (R = 0.83). Contrarily, a poor performance of ETa WB was observed (R = 0.46). These findings provide solid evidence on the CLM's accuracy for the ETa modeling, and give insights in the selection of other ETa methods. The study contributes to a better understanding of ecosystem functioning in terms of water loss through evaporative processes, and might help in the development of future LSMs' implementations focused on climate / land use change scenarios for the paramo.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of desertification in Naiman Banner based on feature space models with typical surface parameters derived from LANDSAT images
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Naiman Banner is one of the most typical semi-arid vulnerable ecological zones that is characterized by vegetation degradation and severe desertification. Previous studies mostly utilized a single feature space or only the linear correlation model to monitor desertification. In this study, the optimal monitoring model that fully considers the multiple feature spaces and the nonlinear relationship between surface parameters in Naiman Banner was determined, and then the spatial-temporal evolution patterns of the desertification from 1989 to 2017 were analyzed. The results showed that: (a) The albedo-normalized difference vegetation index point-to-point model was applicable to areas with high-vegetation coverage, whereas the albedo-modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) linear model had better applicability in areas with relatively low vegetation coverage. Considering the surface cover, the desertification monitoring index based on albedo-MSAVI linear model had the best applicability. (b) During 1989-2017, the total desertification area percentage of Naiman County decreased from 90.85% in 1989 to 63.35% in 2017, showing a significant downward trend. (c) During the past 30 years, the desertification process was significantly influenced by human activities, such as 'Three-North' Shelterbelt, Returning Farmland to Forestry, and Returning Farmland to Grassland (d) The desertification levels of unused land and grassland with low coverage was relatively high, whereas the desertification degree of cultivated and forest lands was low. These results can be used as an effective reference for the remote sensing monitoring and evaluation of desertification and can provide data and decision support for the ecological restoration of the region.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Big Data and Iterative Approaches to Cultural Feature Detection and Past Landscape Process Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of "big" data is nothing new to archaeologists; we have long made a profession of collecting, organizing, and analyzing a surfeit of data describing everything from minute artifact attributes to landscape-wide environmental characteristics. Regardless of this abundance, we have and continue to confront the self-same problem inherent in "big" data, namely what analyses will actually help us use these data to advance understandings of past human behaviors. With burgeoning remote sensing technologies archaeology faces a new wave of "big" data, but how do these techniques improve our ability to make the inferential leaps to bridge the present to the past and bring new insights forward? We argue that, to date, remote sensing techniques (satellite, aerial, and unpersonned aerial imagery) have been applied somewhat narrowly to mostly high-resolution site-based research in archaeology. To truly unleash the capabilities of these techniques, and expand our capacity for wrangling "big" data to more fully investigate past patterns, we need to conduct iterative analyses incorporating remotely sensed data on bounded archaeological sites and regions and unbounded landscapes. A case study from the Late Precontact (ca. A.D. 1200-1600) period in the northern Great Lakes of North America detailing how such an iterative approach can be initiated is explored here.

TI  - Coastline changes and their effects on land use and cover in Subang, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is at high risk of coastal erosion. Therefore, is important to understand the current status over a large area in order to devise protection strategies. This study measured the coastline changes and examined the land use and cover affected by coastal changes in Subang, Indonesia, using Landsat images from 1990 and 2018. The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was used to separate the water and non-water features of the images, and land use and cover were classified using object-based image analysis based on the red, green, and blue bands and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results revealed considerable coastal erosion in Legonkulon. In the most extreme case, the coastline had moved 2361.46 m inland, and the total area lost to erosion was 1012.25 ha. This area was mostly covered by fishponds (983.34 ha) in 1990. Given that the fishery sector is the main livelihood of communities in the study area, the disappearance of fishponds might have affected their income and worsened their poverty. We found marked coastal accretion in Blanakan. In the most extreme case, the coastline had moved 1695.61 m seaward from 1990 to 2018, adding a total area of 1856.62 ha. The new areas were used as fishponds (1738.95 ha) in 2018. Although the accretion exceeded the erosion, the distributions differed regionally. Therefore, a regional protection strategy is necessary.

TI  - Monitoring recent changes of vegetation in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through satellite imagery guided by UAV surveys
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping accurately vegetation surfaces in space and time in the ice-free areas of Antarctica can provide important information to quantitatively describe the evolution of their ecosystems. Spaceborne remote sensing is the adequate way to map and evaluate multitemporal changes on the Antarctic vegetation at large but its nature of occurrence, in relatively small and sparse patches, makes the identification very challenging. The inclusion of an intermediate scale of observation between ground and satellite scales, provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery, is of great help not only for their effective classification, but also for discriminating their main communities (lichens and mosses). Thus, this paper quantifies accurately recent changes of the vegetated areas in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through a novel methodology based on the integration of multiplatform data (satellite and UAV). It consists of multiscale imagery (spatial resolution of 2 m and 2 cm) from the same period to create a robust classifier that, after intensive calibration, is adequately used in other dates, where field reference data is scarce or not available at all. The methodology is developed and tested with UAV and satellite data from 2017 showing overall accuracies of 96% and kappa equal to 0.94 with a SVM classifier. These high performances allow the extrapolation to a pair of previous dates, 2006 and 2013, when atmospherically clear very high-resolution satellite imagery are available. The classification allows verifying a loss of the total area of vegetation of 4.5% during the 11-year time period under analysis, which corresponds to a 10.3% reduction for Usnea sp. and 9.8% for moss formations. Nevertheless, the breakdown analysis by time period shows a distinct behaviour for each vegetation type which are evaluated and discussed, namely for Usnea sp. whose decline is likely to be related to changing snow conditions.

TI  - Spectral enhancement of Landsat OLI images by using Hyperion data: a comparison between multilayer perceptron and radial basis function networks
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The deactivation of Earth Observing-1 satellite has resulted in the termination of capturing Hyperion data as a unique source of hyperspectral satellite imagery. These images also were collected through an on-demand service and thereby are not available for the entire Earth's surface. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor, on the other hand, provides a free source of multi-spectral images with global coverage. Recognized these facts, the aim of this paper is to enhance the spectral resolution of OLI images by using existing Hyperion imageries to generate a high spectral resolution image for a desired date and site. This was conducted through the artificial neural network (ANN). To find the suitable ANN, we compared the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) networks for spectral enhancement. The research obtained two Hyperion and OLI images covering West Region of Tehran, Iran, on 4 January 2016. From 242 original Hyperion spectral bands, we selected 31 bands to reproduce from OLI spectral bands. These were determined through visual inspection, principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation test. The MLP and RBF networks were generated based on the OLI bands 1-7 and per 31 Hyperion bands as input and output layers respectively. The comparison between the spectral bands of spectra-enhanced image and original Hyperion data indicated a good agreement (0.884 > R-2 > 0.692). This study also found MLP network delivered higher accuracy against RBF network for spectral enhancement. The spectra-enhanced image can be used in studies with the need of images with continuous spectral bands.

TI  - Multi-approach synergic investigation between land surface temperature and land-use land-cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban expansion and associated land-use land-cover (LULC) change in India have emerged as a serious environmental threat that accelerates the impacts of urban heat island intensity (UHII). Three independent investigations have been conducted in this study using a series of Landsat data. The objectives of this work are: (1) To predict the near-future LULC scenario using an integrated model; (2) To understand the connection between band mean for particular LULC class with LST; (3) To analyze the temporal relationship between different types of built-up clusters and LST. The LULC and LST maps reveal that LST increases from 27.01 degrees to 33.86 degrees C, whereas built-up areas rise from 6.93% to 27.10% during 1988-2018, respectively. We observed that the near-future LULC scenario of KMA shows a huge expansion of built-up areas paid by decreased vegetation and open spaces. A clear significant correlation has been found between band mean and LST in all three Landsat sensors with the R-2 = 0.84; p<0.02 for Landsat 5 TM, R-2 = 0.91 and 0.99; p<0.01 and 0.00 for Landsat 7 ETM+, and R-2 = 0.88; p<0.01 for Landsat 8 OLI in connection to our second objective. However, no agreement has been found between different built-up clusters and LST over 30 years of observation. For the first time, this study established the interconnectivity between bands of Landsat sensors and LST. The temporal relationship between different built-up clusters and LST have reviled also for the first time. Beside this, the rising rate of built-up areas was observed by the integrated model. Such alarming condition demands immediate attention to sustainable, and scientific land use regulations under new urbanism policy.

TI  - Safety surveillance and the estimation of risk in select populations: Flexible methods to control for confounding while targeting marginal comparisons via standardization
T2  - STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider the critical problem of pharmacosurveillance for adverse events once a drug or medical product is incorporated into routine clinical care. When making inference on comparative safety using large-scale electronic health records, we often encounter an extremely rare binary adverse outcome with a large number of potential confounders. In this context, it is challenging to offer flexible methods to adjust for high-dimensional confounders, whereas use of the propensity score (PS) can help address this challenge by providing both confounding control and dimension reduction. Among PS methods, regression adjustment using the PS as a covariate in an outcome model has been incompletely studied and potentially misused. Previous studies have suggested that simple linear adjustment may not provide sufficient control of confounding. Moreover, no formal representation of the statistical procedure and associated inference has been detailed. In this paper, we characterize a three-step procedure, which performs flexible regression adjustment of the estimated PS followed by standardization to estimate the causal effect in a select population. We also propose a simple variance estimation method for performing inference. Through a realistic simulation mimicking data from the Food and Drugs Administration's Sentinel Initiative comparing the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers on incidence of angioedema, we show that flexible regression on the PS resulted in less bias without loss of efficiency, and can outperform other methods when the PS model is correctly specified. In addition, the direct variance estimation method is a computationally fast and reliable approach for inference.

TI  - Density dependence forces divergent population growth rates and alters occupancy patterns of a central place foraging Antarctic seabird
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Density-dependent regulation is an important process in spatio-temporal population dynamics because it can alter the effects of synchronizing processes operating over large spatial scales. Most frequently, populations are regulated by density dependence when higher density leads to reduced individual fitness and population growth, but inverse density dependence can also occur when small populations are subject to higher extinction risks. We investigate whether density-dependent regulation influences population growth for the Antarctic breeding Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae. Understanding the prevalence and nature of density dependence for this species is important because it is considered a sentinel species reflecting the impacts of fisheries and environmental change over large spatial scales in the Southern Ocean, but the presence of density dependence could introduce uncertainty in this role. Using data on population growth and indices of resource availability for seven regional Adelie penguin populations located along the East Antarctic coastline, we find compelling evidence that population growth is constrained at some locations by the amount of breeding habitat available to individuals. Locations with low breeding habitat availability had reduced population growth rates, higher overall occupancy rates, and higher occupancy of steeper slopes that are sparsely occupied or avoided at other locations. Our results are consistent with evolutionary models of avian breeding habitat selection where individuals search for high-quality nest sites to maximize fitness returns and subsequently occupy poorer habitat as population density increases. Alternate explanations invoking competition for food were not supported by the available evidence, but strong conclusions on food-related density dependence were constrained by the paucity of food availability data over the large spatial scales of this region. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating nonconstant conditions of species-environment relationships into predictive models of species distributions and population dynamics, and provides guidance for improved monitoring of fisheries and climate change impacts in the Southern Ocean.

TI  - Evidence and impact of map error on land use and land cover dynamics in Ashi River watershed using intensity analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previously, applications of intensity analysis (IA) on land use and land cover change (LULCC) studies have focused on deviations from uniform intensity (UI) and failed to quantify the reasons behind these deviations. This study presents the application of IA with hypothetical errors that could explain non-uniform LULCC in the context of IA at four-time points. LULCC in the Ashi watershed was examined using Landsat images from 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2014 showing the classes: Urban, water, agriculture, close canopy, open canopy and other vegetation. Matrices were created to statistically examine LULCC using IA. The results reveal that the seeming LULCC intensities are not uniform with respect to the interval, category and transition levels of IA. Error analysis indicates that, hypothetical errors in 13%, 19% and 11.2% of the 2000, 2010 and 2014 maps respectively could account for all differences between the observed gain intensities and the UI; while errors in 12%, 21%, and 11% of the 1990, 2000 and 2010 maps respectively could account for all differences between the observed loss intensities and the UI. A hypothetical error in 0.6% and 1.6% of the 1990 map; 1.5% and 4% of the 2000 map; 1.2% and 2.1% of the 2010 map could explain divergences from uniform transitions given URB gain and AGR gain during 1990-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2014 respectively. Evidence for a specific deviation from the relevant hypothesized UI is either strong or weak depending on the size of these errors. We recommend that users of IA concept consider assessing their map errors, since limited ground information on past time point data exist. These errors will indicate strength of evidence for deviations and reveals patterns that increase researcher's insight on LULCC processes.

TI  - Determination of optically inactive water quality variables using Landsat 8 data: A case study in Geshlagh reservoir affected by agricultural land use
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water chemical variables such as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) are soluble and are optically inactive. Remote sensing (RS) technique is able to monitor the optical activity of water but it has limited capability to monitor the TN and TP concentrations. In order to determine the TN and TP concentrations of Geshlagh Reservoir (GR), RS was used. The other water quality variables that were utilized included chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth (SDD) and total suspended solids (TSS). These variables are optically active and have a high correlation coefficient with TN and TP concentrations. The five images of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) taken at different times were used. Artificial neural network (ANN) model and linear regression (LR) model were utilized to determine the relationship of OLI data and TP and TN concentrations in GR. Results showed that the TN and TP concentrations have a high correlation with chlorophyll-a concentration. The spectral reflectance of bands ratio (band3/band2) and the single band of bands 3 and 4 were obtained as the most suitable bands to determine the chlorophyll-a concentration in GR. Compared with LR model, the accuracy of the ANN model was higher in the testing phase of TP prediction with R = 0.81 and TN prediction with R = 0.93. It can be concluded that the Landsat 8 OLI data has a high potential to provide the data of solubility variables of the water quality for the management of reservoirs. The contribution of this paper is that the developed ANN model will improve the prediction accuracy of inactive water quality variables based on the RS data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mangrove health along the hyper-arid southern Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover have severely influenced the sustainability of mangrove vegetation, especially in the hyper-arid, hyper-saline Red Sea coastal waters of Saudi Arabia. The present study investigates the effect of effluents released from an adjoining shrimp farm on the sustainability of a nearby mangrove woodland during operation and after closure of the farm. In addition, the consequences of dredging activities to fill coastal waters for land reclamation to develop a mega seaport at Jazan Economic City are explored. A band image-difference algorithm was applied to Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 08 Operational Land Imager satellite images obtained on different dates, which revealed a prominent vigour boom in the mangrove forest while the shrimp farm operated but a gradual decrease in vigour after its closure. During the investigation time frame of 2016 and 2017, spectral vegetation analysis of Sentinel-2A satellite images highlighted a strong negative correlation between dredging operations for seaport construction and the adjacent fragile mangrove forest. Dredging operations were responsible for a reduction of 19.30% in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, 27.5% in the Leaf Area Index, and 19.0% in the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. The results clearly show the potential application of spectral vegetation indices in the monitoring and analysis of anthropogenic impacts on coastal vegetation. We suggest strong management efforts for monitoring, assessing, and regulating measures to offset the negative trends in the sustainability of mangroves in Red Sea coastal regions.

TI  - Investigation of the "dust reservoir effect" of the Tarim Basin using WRF-GOCART model
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taklamakan and Gobi Deserts are two important dust source regions which are located in northwestern China where the topography is complicated. In this study, a historical severe dust episode was reconstructed and the subsequent dust behavior influenced by the topography was investigated by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model. Based on the validated simulation results and model sensitivity trials, the study suggest that the topography of the Tarim Basin can function as a "dust reservoir," which indicates that the basin can trap the ground-released dust at the beginning, and then re-release the trapped dust at a later time as a secondary source if the meteorological conditions permit. Moreover, to evaluate the "dust reservoir effect" of the Tarim Basin on the adjacent area, the mass concentration of PM10 was measured during the dust episode in a downwind city. Overall, given the dust modeling and PM10 sampling, the results indicate that the "dust reservoir" cannot only re-release dust aerosol as a secondary source, but also, the existence of a "dust reservoir" can prolong and exacerbate the impact on the air quality of the adjacent area.

TI  - Unusual recurrent metastasizing benign breast papilloma: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Papillary breast lesions may be benign, atypical, and malignant lesions. Pathological and clinical differentiation of breast papillomas can be a challenge. Unlike malignant lesions, benign breast papillomas are not classically associated with lymph node and distant metastasis. We report a unique case of a recurrent, benign breast papilloma presenting as an aggressive malignant tumor. Case presentation Our patient was a 56-year-old postmenopausal African American woman who was followed in the breast clinic with a long history of multiple breast papillomas. She underwent multiple resections over the course of 7-9 years. After being lost to follow-up for 2 years, she once again presented with a slowly enlarging left breast mass. Subsequent imaging revealed a predominantly cystic mass in the left breast, as well as a suspicious hypermetabolic internal mammary node and a hypermetabolic nodule in the pretracheal space. Biopsy of the internal mammary node demonstrated papillary neoplasm with benign morphology and immunostains positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/Neu. Due to the clinical picture concerning for malignancy, the patient was then started on endocrine therapy with palbociclib and letrozole before surgery. She then underwent simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection with negative nodes and pathology once again revealing benign papillary neoplasm. She underwent adjuvant chest wall radiation for 6 weeks and received letrozole following completion of her radiation therapy. She was without evidence of disease 30 months after surgery. Conclusions We present an unusual case of multiple recurrent peripheral papillomas with entirely benign histologic features exhibiting malignant behavior over a protracted period of many years, with an invasion of pectoralis musculature and possibly internal mammary and mediastinal nodes. Her treatment course included multiple surgeries (ultimately mastectomy), radiation therapy, and endocrine therapy.

M3  - Review
AB  - Epidemiological trends in congenital toxoplasmosis and CMV are extremely divergent. While there were only 39 cases of congenital toxoplasmosis in Switzerland between 1982 and 2015, there was an equivalent number of cases of congenital CMV, 38 in total, in 2017 alone. Serological screening for toxoplasmosis was logically abandoned in Switzerland in 2008. Regarding CMV, there is no recommendation for serological screening or neonatal screening in Switzerland, whereas early diagnosis can improve prognosis through the rapid initiation of antiviral treatment. The epidemiological data generated by sentinel surveillance of congenital CMV infections in Switzerland may or may not justify such a measure in our country in the future.

En ce qui concerne le CMV, il nexiste pas de recommandation de depistage neonatal en Suisse, alors quun diagnostic precoce peut ameliorer le pronostic par linstauration rapide dun traitement antiviral. Les donnees epidemiologiques generees par la surveillance sentinelle des infections congenitales a CMV en Suisse devraient permettre de justifier ou non une telle mesure dans notre pays a lavenir.

TI  - 'Remote' behavioural ecology: do megaherbivores consume vegetation in proportion to its presence in the landscape?
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Examination of the feeding habits of mammalian species such as the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) that range over large seasonally dynamic areas is exceptionally challenging using field-based methods alone. Although much is known of their feeding preferences from field studies, conclusions, especially in relation to differing habits in wet and dry seasons, are often contradictory. Here, two remote approaches, stable carbon isotope analysis and remote sensing, were combined to investigate dietary changes in relation to tree and grass abundances to better understand elephant dietary choice in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. A composited pair of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite images characterising flushed and senescent vegetation states, typical of wet and dry seasons respectively, were used to generate land-cover maps focusing on the forest to grassland gradient. Stable carbon isotope analysis of elephant faecal samples identified the proportion of C-3 (typically browse)/C-4 (typically grass) in elephant diets in the 1-2 days prior to faecal deposition. The proportion of surrounding C-4 land-cover was extracted using concentric buffers centred on faecal sample locations, and related to the faecal %C-4 content. Results indicate that elephants consume C-4 vegetation in proportion to its availability in the surrounding area during the dry season, but during the rainy season there was less of a relationship between C-4 intake and availability, as elephants targeted grasses in these periods. This study illustrates the utility of coupling isotope and cost-free remote sensing data to conduct complementary landscape analysis at highly-detailed, biologically meaningful resolutions, offering an improved ability to monitor animal behavioural patterns at broad geographical scales. This is increasingly important due to potential impacts of climate change and woody encroachment on broad-scale landscape habitat composition, allowing the tracking of shifts in species utilisation of these changing landscapes in a way impractical using field based methods alone.

TI  - Effect of delay between nuclear medicine scanning and sentinel node biopsy on outcome in patients with cutaneous melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important staging tool for the management of melanoma. A multicentre study was done to validate previous findings that the timing of lymphoscintigraphy influences the accuracy of SLNB and patient outcomes, particularly survival.Methods Data were reviewed on patients undergoing SLNB for melanoma at three centres in the UK and Sweden, examining the effect of timing of SLNB after nuclear medicine scanning. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and progression-free (PFS) survival, stratified by timing of lymphoscintigraphy. Independent risk factors for survival were identified by Cox multivariable regression analysis.Results A total of 2270 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 56 months. Univariable analysis showed a 4 center dot 2 per cent absolute and 35 center dot 5 per cent relative benefit in DSS (hazard ratio 1 center dot 36, 95 per cent c.i. 1 center dot 05 to 1 center dot 74; P = 0 center dot 018) for 863 patients whose SLNB was performed up to 12 h after lymphoscintigraphy compared with 1407 patients who had surgery after more than 12 h. There were similar OS and PFS benefits (P = 0 center dot 036 and P = 0 center dot 022 respectively). Multivariable analysis identified timing of lymphoscintigraphy as an independent predictor of OS (P = 0 center dot 017) and DSS (P = 0 center dot 030). There was an excess of nodal recurrences as first site of recurrence in the group with delayed surgery (4 center dot 5 versus 2 center dot 5 per cent; P = 0 center dot 008).Conclusion Delaying SLNB beyond 12 h after lymphoscintigraphy with Tc-99-labelled nanocolloid has a significant negative survival impact in patients with melanoma.

TI  - A joint probabilistic index for objective drought identification: the case study of Haiti
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since drought is a multifaceted phenomenon, more than one variable should be considered for a proper understanding of such an extreme event in order to implement adequate risk mitigation strategies such as weather or agricultural indices insurance programmes or disaster risk financing tools. This paper proposes a new composite drought index that accounts for both meteorological and agricultural drought conditions by combining in a probabilistic framework two consolidated drought indices: the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the vegetation health index (VHI). The new index, called the probabilistic precipitation vegetation index (PPVI), is scalable, transferable all over the globe and can be updated in near real time. Furthermore, it is a remote-sensing product, since precipitation is retrieved from satellite data and the VHI is a remote-sensing index. In addition, a set of rules to objectively identify drought events is developed and implemented. Both the index and the set of rules have been applied to Haiti. The performance of the PPVI has been evaluated by means of a receiver operating characteristic curve and compared to that of the SPI and VHI considered separately. The new index outperformed SPI and VHI both in drought identification and characterization, thus revealing potential for an effective implementation within drought early-warning systems.

TI  - Sentinel node tumor burden in prediction of prognosis in melanoma patients
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent data have demonstrated no survival benefit to immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for positive sentinel node (SN) disease in melanoma. It is important to identify parameters in positive SNs, which predict prognosis in melanoma patients. These might provide prognostic value in staging systems and risk models by guiding high-risk patients' adjuvant therapy in clinical practice. In this retrospective study of university hospital melanoma database we analyzed tumor burden and prognosis in patients with positive SNs. Patients were stratified by the diameter of tumor deposit, distribution of metastatic focus in SN, ulceration and number of metastatic SNs. These were incorporated in Cox proportional hazard regression models. Predictive ability was assessed using Akaike information criterion and Harrell's concordance index. A total of 110 patients had positive SN and 104 underwent CLND. Twenty-two (21%) patients had non-SN metastatic disease on CLND. The 5-year melanoma specific survival for CLND-negative patients was 5.00 years (IQR 3.23-5.00, range 0.72-5.00) compared to 3.69 (IQR 2.28-4.72, range 1.01-5.00) years in CLND-positive patients (HR 2.82 (95% CI 1.17-6.76, p = 0.020).The models incorporating distribution of metastatic focus and the largest tumor deposit in SN had highest predictive ability. According to Cox proportional hazard regression models, information criterions and c-index, the diameter of tumor deposit > 4 mm with multifocal location in SN despite of number of metastatic SN were the most important parameters. According to the diameter of tumor deposit and distribution of metastatic focus in SN, adequate stratification of positive SN patients was possible and risk classes for patients were identified.

TI  - Ensemble-based satellite-derived carbon dioxide and methane column-averaged dry-air mole fraction data sets (2003-2018) for carbon and climate applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), denoted XCO2 and XCH4, respectively, have been used in recent years to obtain information on natural and anthropogenic sources and sinks and for other applications such as comparisons with climate models. Here we present new data sets based on merging several individual satellite data products in order to generate consistent long-term climate data records (CDRs) of these two Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). These ECV CDRs, which cover the time period 2003-2018, have been generated using an ensemble of data products from the satellite sensors SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and (for XCO2) for the first time also including data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. Two types of products have been generated: (i) Level 2 (L2) products generated with the latest version of the ensemble median algorithm (EMMA) and (ii) Level 3 (L3) products obtained by gridding the corresponding L2 EMMA products to obtain a monthly 5 degrees x 5 degrees data product in Obs4MIPs (Observations for Model Inter-comparisons Project) format. The L2 products consist of daily NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files, which contain in addition to the main parameters, i.e., XCO2 or XCH4, corresponding uncertainty estimates for random and potential systematic uncertainties and the averaging kernel for each single (quality-filtered) satellite observation. We describe the algorithms used to generate these data products and present quality assessment results based on comparisons with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TC-CON) ground-based retrievals. We found that the XCO2 Level 2 data set at the TCCON validation sites can be characterized by the following figures of merit (the corresponding values for the Level 3 product are listed in brackets) single-observation random error (1 sigma): 1.29 ppm (monthly: 1.18 ppm); global bias: 0.20 ppm (0.18 ppm); and spatiotemporal bias or relative accuracy (1 sigma): 0.66 ppm (0.70 ppm). The corresponding values for the XCH4 products are single-observation random error (1 sigma): 17.4 ppb (monthly: 8.7 ppb); global bias: 2.0 ppb (2.9 ppb); and spatiotemporal bias (1 sigma): 5.0 ppb (4.9 ppb). It has also been found that the data products exhibit very good long-term stability as no significant long-term bias trend has been identified. The new data sets have also been used to derive annual XCO2 and XCH4 growth rates, which are in reasonable to good agreement with growth rates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) based on marine surface observations.

TI  - Global carbon surcharge for the reduction of anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many governments take the view that voluntary national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient to avoid negative climate effects. In the absence of independent verification, however, pledges are unlikely to be sufficient for a rapid and strong reduction of emissions. It is often claimed that a global carbon tax could be an effective instrument. However, such a tax is difficult to set and to collect, especially in countries with poor administrative infrastructure. Results Here, we formulate and discuss a novel approach, the Global Carbon Surcharge (GCS), that mimics a carbon tax but does not require tax collection by governments. We define GCS as a requirement or a voluntary commitment encompassing all companies extracting carbon-carrying raw materials, namely coal, oil, gas and limestone, with the aim to burden their extraction with costs proportional to their carbon intensity. GCS mandates all companies to store these materials immediately after mining for a given period of time in the vicinity of the production site. Thereby, GCS generates additional costs that propagate through all sectors of the global economy. We elucidate how the investment costs for the storage infrastructure translate into surcharges on the raw materials. Conclusions We show that by a proper choice of the storage time and the size of the storage unit, GCS becomes equivalent to a carbon tax in the range between 50 and 100 euro per ton of CO2 that is assumed to be necessary for the transition to a carbon-neutral energy system. An attractive feature of GCS is that it can be verified, in particular by citizens themselves, using publicly available satellite data. Finally, if compulsory storage is coupled to blockchain-based smart contracts and a mandatory (expensive) mining of cryptocurrency, GCS can be operated without governmental protectionism, corruption and fraud. However, the main uncertainties of the GCS approach lie in the substantial expansion of infrastructure and the fact that the induced price effects must be sufficient to achieve a rapid and far-reaching substitution of fossil fuels.

TI  - Assessing transportation vulnerability to tsunamis: utilising post-event field data from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, Japan, and the 2015 Illapel tsunami, Chile
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Transportation infrastructure is crucial to the operation of society, particularly during post-event response and recovery. Transportation assets, such as roads and bridges, can be exposed to tsunami impacts when near the coast. Using fragility functions in an impact assessment identifies potential tsunami effects to inform decisions on potential mitigation strategies. Such functions have not been available for transportation assets exposed to tsunami hazard in the past due to limited empirical datasets. This study provides a suite of observations on the influence of tsunami inundation depth, road-use type, culverts, inundation distance, debris and coastal topography. Fragility functions are developed for roads, considering inundation depth, road-use type, and coastal topography and, for bridges, considering only inundation depth above deck base height. Fragility functions are developed for roads and bridges through combined survey and remotely sensed data for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, Japan, and using post-event field survey data from the 2015 Illapel earthquake and tsunami, Chile. The fragility functions show a trend of lower tsunami vulnerability (through lower probabilities of reaching or exceeding a given damage level) for road-use categories of potentially higher construction standards. The topographic setting is also shown to affect the vulnerability of transportation assets in a tsunami, with coastal plains seeing higher initial vulnerability in some instances (e.g. for state roads with up to 5 m inundation depth) but with coastal valleys (in some locations exceeding 30 m inundation depth) seeing higher asset vulnerability overall. This study represents the first peer-reviewed example of empirical road and bridge fragility functions that consider a range of damage levels. This suite of synthesised functions is applicable to a variety of exposure and attribute types for use in global tsunami impact assessments to inform resilience and mitigation strategies.

TI  - Exploring Polarimetric Phase of Microwave Backscatter from <i>Typha</i> Wetlands
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their natural and societal importance, wetlands are becoming increasingly threatened. The goal of this study is to investigate the potential of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for monitoring one important vegetation constituent of wetlands: Typha. An idealized cylindrical scattering model is developed to portray double bounce microwave scattering from Typha stalks. Then a thin cylinder Brewster angle is introduced; relating the co-pol phase difference (CPD) of Typha to its relative permittivity. Full polarization Radarsat-2 data were acquired for a variety of dates and incidence angle ranges in order to validate the scattering model. The dependence of CPD on incidence angle is found to be consistent with the model. The evolution of CPD with seasonal senescence was also investigated. Despite some agreement with expected trends in vegetation moisture, there are anomalies that remain unexplained; possibly due to ecosystem change. This suggests the need for radar scatterometer experiments in a controlled environment to better explore the dependence of CPD on incidence angle and seasonal change. Last, cross-pol phase difference (XPD) histograms support other research in demonstrating the existence of coherent depolarization in Typha scattering. Additional modeling, entailing the detailed structure of the vegetation, will be necessary to understand this behavior.

TI  - Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of Precambrian mafic dyke swarms in northern Mauritania (West African craton): analysis and results from remote-sensing interpretation, geographical information systems (GIS), Google Earth ™ images, and regional geology
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used remote sensing, geographical information systems, Google Earth (TM) images, and regional geology in order to (i) improve the mapping of linear structures and understand the chronology of different mafic dyke swarms in the Ahmeyim area that belongs to the Archean Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane of the Reguibat Shield, West African craton, NW Mauritania. The spatial and temporal distributions with the trends of the dyke swarms provide important information about geodynamics. The analysis of the mafic dyke swarms map and statistical data allow us to distinguish four mafic dyke swarm sets: a major swarm trending NE-SW to NNE-SSW (80%) and three minor swarms trending EW to ENE-WSW (9.33%), NW-SE to WNW-ESE (9.06%), and NS (1.3%). The major swarms extend over 35 km while the minor swarms do not exceed 13 km. The Google Earth (TM) images reveal relative ages through crossover relationships. The major NE-SW to NNE-SSW and the minor NS swarms are the oldest generations emplaced in the Ahemyim area. The NW-SE-oriented swarm dykes which are cutting the two former swarms are emplaced later. The minor E-W to WSW-ENE swarms are probably the youngest. A precise U-Pb baddeleyite age of 2733 +/- 2 Ma has been obtained for the NNE-SSW Ahmeyim Great Dyke. This dyke is approximately 1500 m wide in some zone and extends for more than 150 km. The distinct mafic dyke swarms being identified in this study can potentially be linked with coeval magmatic events on other cratons around the globe to identify reconstructed LIPs and constrain continental reconstructions.

T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The population targeted for influenza vaccination can be repeatedly vaccinated over successive seasons, and vaccines received in previous seasons may retain preventive effect. This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines received in the current and prior seasons in the 2018-2019 season.Methods: Influenza-like illness patients attended by sentinel general practitioners or admitted to hospitals in Navarre, Spain, were tested for influenza. Vaccination status in the current and three prior seasons was obtained from the vaccination registry. The test-negative design was used to estimate the vaccine effectiveness.Results: A total of 381 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases, 341 A(H3N2) cases and 1222 controls were analysed. As compared to individuals unvaccinated in the current and three prior seasons, the influenza vaccine effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 57% (95% confidence interval ICI]: 40%, 70%) for current season vaccination regardless of prior doses and 48% (95%Cl: 14%, 68%) for vaccination in prior seasons but not in the current season. These estimates were 12% (95%CI: -23%, 37%) and 27% (95%CI: -22%, 56%), respectively, against influenza A(H3N2). Individuals vaccinated with the two A(H1N1)pdm09 strains in influenza vaccines since 2009, A/Michigan/45/2015 and A/California/07/2009, had higher protection (68%; 95%CI: 53%, 77%) than those vaccinated with A/Michigan/45/2015 only (29%, p = 0.020) or with A/California/07/2009 only (34%, p = 0.005).Conclusion: These results suggest moderate effectiveness of influenza vaccination against A(H1N1) pdm09 and low effectiveness against A(H3N2) influenza in the 2018-2019 season. Vaccination in prior seasons maintained a notable protective effect. Strains included in previous vaccines were as effective as the current vaccine strain, and both added their effects against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A study of the influence of tropospheric subsidence on spring and summer surface ozone concentrations at the JRC Ispra station in northern Italy
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of tropospheric ozone on the surface ozone concentrations is investigated at the monitoring station of JRC Ispra, based on 10 years of measurements (2006-2015) of surface ozone data. In situ hourly measurements of ozone and other air pollutants, meteorological parameters, and weekly averaged 7Be (as an indicator of upper-tropospheric-stratospheric influence) and Pb-210 measurements (as an indicator of boundary layer influence) have been used for the analysis. In addition, IASI C GOME-2 and IASI ozone satellite data have also been used. It is observed that frequently 7Be and ozone weekly peaks coincide, which might be explained by the impact of deep atmospheric subsidence on surface ozone, particularly during late spring and early summer. Based on this observation, a detailed analysis of selected 7Be and ozone episodes occurring during that period of the year has been performed in order to further elucidate the mechanisms of tropospheric influence on the surface pollutant concentrations. For the analysis, composite NOAA/ESRL reanalysis synoptic meteorological charts in the troposphere have been used as well as IASI satellite ozone measurements and NOAA HYSPLIT back trajectories. The JRC station hourly measurements during subsidence episodes show very low values of local pollution parameters (e.g., NOx, Rn-222, nephelometer data, PM10), close to zero. Conversely, during these periods ozone levels usually reach values around 45-60 ppb during the afternoon hours but also show significantly higher values than the average during the night and morning hours, which is a sign of direct tropospheric influence on the surface ozone concentrations.

TI  - Burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness (ILI) in Ethiopia, 2012 to 2017
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe influenza virus spreads rapidly around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia.MethodInfluenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the "Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)".ResultA total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which, 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (n=455, 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n=293, 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100,000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15-44years of age ['Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100,000 population', 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] and 5-14years of age [R=49.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43]. The seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons; in a period from October-December and from April-June.ConclusionSignificant morbidity of influenza like illness was observed with two peak seasons of the year and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) remains the predominantly circulating influenza subtype. Further study need to be considered to identify potential risks and improving the surveillance system to continue early detection and monitoring of circulating influenza virus in the country has paramount importance.

TI  - Producing consistent visually interpreted land cover reference data: learning from feedback
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Reference data for large-scale land cover map are commonly acquired by visual interpretation of remotely sensed data. To assure consistency, multiple images are used, interpreters are trained, sites are interpreted by several individuals, or the procedure includes a review. But little is known about important factors influencing the quality of visually interpreted data. We assessed the effect of multiple variables on land cover class agreement between interpreters and reviewers. Our analyses concerned data collected for validation of a global land cover map within the Copernicus Global Land Service project. Four cycles of visual interpretation were conducted, each was followed by review and feedback. Each interpreted site element was labelled according to dominant land cover type. We assessed relationships between the number of interpretation updates following feedback and the variables grouped in personal, training, and environmental categories. Variable importance was assessed using random forest regression. Personal variable interpreter identifier and training variable timestamp were found the strongest predictors of update counts, while the environmental variables complexity and image availability had least impact. Feedback loops reduced updating and hence improved consistency of the interpretations. Implementing feedback loops into the visually interpreted data collection increases the consistency of acquired land cover reference data.

TI  - Evaluating autumn phenology derived from field observations, satellite data, and carbon flux measurements in a northern mixed forest, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Common approaches currently used to monitor forest phenology include direct field observation and indirect approaches such as satellite remote sensing and carbon flux measurements. However, differences in both temporal and spatial scales of these methods make direct comparison challenging. In order to evaluate the reliability of indirect measures of autumn phenology in estimating direct observations, we compared the timing of three transition dates and the rate of autumn progression derived from (i) satellite data (MOD13Q1 006 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products, 2000-2017), (ii) carbon flux measurements (net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP), 1997-2016), and (iii) field observation (2010, 2012 for the north site and 2010, 2012, and 2013 for the south site) from a mixed forest in northern Wisconsin, USA. Overall, the transition dates and progression rates derived from NDVI were closest to that of field observations. Furthermore, the start of autumn derived from satellite data was earlier than directly observed leaf coloration (LC), which resulted from species-specific canopy senescence patterns and the sensitivity of the vegetation indices. Even after full leaf fall was reached, EVI continued to detect coloring which was likely due to the presence of understory plant species. Finally, NEE and GPP changes tended to start before LC as a result of tree physiological and environmental changes and continued after full leaf fall possibly due to understory and coniferous activity. These results highlight the need for long-term field observations of both trees and understory species, information on species-specific canopy senescence patterns, and species composition in understanding the efficiency of indirect approaches in estimating autumn forest phenology.

TI  - Melanoma of the External Auditory Canal: A Review of Seven Cases at a Tertiary Care Referral Center
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Examine the presentation and management characteristics of seven patients with melanoma of the external auditory canal (EAC).Study Design Retrospective case series and review of the relevant literature.Methods Records of seven patients from 2003 to 2017 with melanoma of the EAC were reviewed for characteristics of presentation, subsequent management, and outcomes. A thorough review of relevant literature is presented.Results The median age is 52 years, with four females. The average Breslow depth was 3.6 mm, with five patients having a Clark level IV or greater on presentation. Six patients underwent lateral temporal bone resection, and one patient underwent wide local excision of the cartilaginous canal. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in three patients. Three patients experienced distant recurrence an average of 20 months following primary therapy. Median follow-up was 21 months. At last follow-up, four were free of disease, one had active disease, and two were deceased from melanoma.Conclusions This is the largest series and the first to report the use of SLNB for patients with EAC melanoma in the peer-reviewed literature. Patients with external auditory canal melanoma present with higher Breslow thickness and stage relative to all external ear melanomas. Management should include wide local excision, which entails lateral temporal bone resection when the bony ear canal is involved. SLNB has a critical role in identifying patients with early metastatic disease. Postoperative radiation therapy should be considered for patients with high-risk features to reduce the risk of locoregional relapse. Chemotherapy, and especially immunotherapy, has an emerging role for this disease.Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 2020

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To analyze the accuracy of the sentinel lymphatic node biopsy (SLNB) and to investigate predictive factors for sentinel node (SN) status and prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with melanoma. Material and methods Between June 1997 and June 2017, 440 consecutive patients, who underwent SLNB by a single surgical team, were prospectively included. Descriptive and survival analysis were performed. Results 119 of 440 patients (26%) had positive SN. SLNB's false-negative rate was 6.3%. Breslow thickness, Clark ' s level, ulceration and histological subtype were statistically significant predictive factors of SN metastases. In a multivariate analysis, positive SN (HR = 2.21, p = 0.01), deeper Breslow thickness (HR = 2.05, p = 0.013), male gender (RR = 2.05, p = 0.02), and higher Clark's level (HR = 2.30, p = 0.043) were significantly associated with decreased RFS; and positive SN (HR = 2.58, p < 0.001), deeper Breslow thickness (HR = 2.57, p = 0.006) and male gender (HR = 1.93, p = 0.006) were associated with lower DSS. Conclusion SLNB is a reliable and reproducible procedure with high sensitivity (93.7%). Positive SN metastases, Breslow thickness and male gender were statistically associated with poorer outcomes. Male gender was an independent prognostic factor of tumor thickness or SN status.

TI  - Investigating the potential use of Sentinel-1 data for monitoring wetland water level changes in China's Momoge National Nature Reserve
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has become a promising technique for monitoring wetland water levels. However, its capability in monitoring wetland water level changes with Sentine-1 data has not yet been thoroughly investigated.Methods. In this study, we produced a multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band VV-polarized SAR backscatter images and generated a total of 28 interferometric coherence maps for marsh wetlands of China's Momoge National Nature Reserve to investigate the interferometric coherence level of Sentinel-1 C-VV data as a function of perpendicular and temporal baseline, water depth, and SAR backscattering intensity. We also selected six interferogram pairs acquired within 24 days for quantitative analysis of the accuracy of water level changes monitored by Sentinel-1 InSAR. The accuracy of water level changes determined through the Sentinel-1 InSAR technique was calibrated by the values of six field water level loggers.Results. Our study showed that (1) the coherence was mainly dependent on the temporal baseline and was little affected by the perpendicular baseline for Sentinel-1 C-VV data in marsh wetlands; (2) in the early stage of a growing season, a clear negative correlation was found between Sentinel-1 coherence and water depth; (3) there was an almost linear negative correlation between Sentinel-1 C-VV coherence and backscatter for the marsh wetlands; (4) once the coherence exceeds a threshold of 0.3, the stage during the growing season, rather than the coherence, appeared to be the primary factor determining the quality of the interferogram for the marsh wetlands, even though the quality of the interferogram largely depends on the coherence; (5) the results of water level changes from InSAR processing show no agreement with in-situ measurements during most growth stages. Based on the findings, we can conclude that although the interferometric coherence of the Sentinel-1 C-VV data is high enough, the data is generally unsuitable for monitoring water level changes in marsh wetlands of China's Momoge National Nature Reserve.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the past land use land cover (LULC) change and simulates the future change using Landsat images in northern Ethiopia. A supervised classification method with a maximum likelihood algorithm was employed to detect the past changes using ENVI 5.3 software. Moreover, a Cellular Automata (CA)-Makrov model was used to simulate from 2015 to 2030. In the period 1985-2015, the statistical result shows an increase of agricultural land (AL) by 32.3 km(2) (19.2%) and settlement (ST) by 51.6 km(2) (345.2%). Most of the increases were gained from shrub-bush land (SBL) which showed a decline of 61.8 km(2) (49.4%). However, in the simulation model of 2030, an increase of SBL (47.08 km(2)) and grass land by 12.38 km(2) was predicted. The consideration of socioeconomic and biophysical factors in the simulation model results different trend compare to the historical LULC change that support to landuse managers and planners.

TI  - Improvement of the Rapid-Development Thunderstorm (RDT) Algorithm for Use with the GK2A Satellite
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - New technologies for the classification of convective cloud lifecycles and the prediction of their movements are needed to detect severe convective weather and to support objective cloud guidance. Satellites enable earlier detection of severe weather over larger coverage areas than ground-based observations or radar. The use of satellite observations for nowcasting is thus likely. In this study, convective initiation (CI) data are paired with a modified rapid-development thunderstorm (RDT) algorithm for the analysis of new data from the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A, GK2A). The RDT algorithm is further modified to accommodate the additional GK2A satellite channels, and new satellite data are used to continuously analyze thunderstorms associated with severe weather in Korea. The logistic regression (LR) machine learning approach is used to optimize the criteria of interest fields and weighting coefficients of the RDT algorithm for convective detection. In addition, auxiliary data (cloud type, convective rainfall rate, and cloud top temperature/height) calculated from RDT sub-module is replaced with GK2A derived products. The fully modified RDT algorithm (K-RDT) is quantitatively verified using lightning data from summer convection cases. The probability of detection (POD) for convective clouds is increased by 30-40%, and the threat score (TS) for average lightning activity is improved by 10-30%. The channel properties of Japan Himawari-8 satellite are similar to those of the GK2A satellite. Due to the lack of GK2A satellite data during the development period, CI data from the Himawari-8 satellite are used as proxies.

TI  - A national dataset of 30 m annual urban extent dynamics (1985-2015) in the conterminous United States
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Dynamics of the urban extent at fine spatial and temporal resolutions over large areas are crucial for developing urban growth models and achieving sustainable development goals. However, there are limited practices of mapping urban dynamics with these two merits combined. In this study, we proposed a new method to map urban dynamics from Landsat time series data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and developed a national dataset of annual urban extent (1985-2015) at a fine spatial resolution (30 m) in the conterminous United States (US). First, we derived the change information of urbanized years in four periods that were determined from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), using a temporal segmentation approach. Then, we classified urban extents in the beginning (1985) and ending (2015) years at the cluster level through the implementation of a change vector analysis (CVA)-based approach. We also developed a hierarchical strategy to apply the CVA-based approach due to the spatially explicit urban sprawl over large areas. The overall accuracy of mapped urbanized years is around 90 % with the 1-year tolerance strategy. The mapped urbanized areas in the beginning and ending years are reliable, with overall accuracies of 96 % and 88 %, respectively. Our results reveal that the total urban area increased by about 20 % during the period of 1985-2015 in the US, and the annual urban area growth is not linear over the years. Overall, the growth pattern of urban extent in most coastal states is plateaued over the past three decades while the states in the Midwestern US show an accelerated growth pattern. The derived annual urban extents are of great use for relevant urban studies such as urban area projection and urban sprawl modeling over large areas. Moreover, the proposed mapping framework is transferable for developing annual dynamics of urban extent in other regions and even globally.

TI  - Going beyond a tale of two sectors: a reflective career planning toolkit for social work students
T2  - SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to make the case that social work students would benefit from thinking beyond the binary of statutory sector vs voluntary sector when thinking about their future career. It argues instead that they should think in terms of their own philosophical worldview, their own preferences in terms of the mechanics of day-to-day practice, and the reasons for those preferences. Drawing on reflection literature, Johns' Model of Reflection (2017) and an element of Motivational Interviewing, and informed by a value pluralist perspective, the paper sets out a reflective process for social work students to use. The process supports students firstly to explore their own core values and worldview, then to consider their feelings about more practical aspects of the social work role, and finally to find the connections and possible dissonances between the two. It is hoped that the article and the reflective process here advanced can contribute to students being able to plan for their professional futures in a way that does not depend principally on having to choose between statutory or voluntary sector practice, but on a much wider array of factors and values.

TI  - Fifty years after surgeon general's report: cultural cognition, biased assimilation, and cigarette smoking risk perceptions among college students
T2  - HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research suggests that cultural worldviews bias how and what people think about various societal risks. But how does this mechanism manifest when people receive balanced information about a highly publicised health issue such as cigarette smoking? Using the cultural cognition worldview scales, we demonstrate that despite the considerable interventions post the 1964 landmark Surgeon General's Report, young adults in the U.S. still perceive smoking risks in ways that affirm their cultural worldviews along two dimensions: egalitarianism-hierarchism and individualism-communitarianism. Those who subscribe to hierarchical and individualistic worldviews were more dismissive of the risks associated with cigarette smoking and exposure, while egalitarians and communitarians associated smoking with higher risks. We observed an interaction between the two worldview dimensions. Besides, exposed to balanced information - as is often the case in media coverage based on the journalistic norm of balance - about the risks and benefits of smoking, those who are concurrently hierarchical and individualistic in their outlook assimilated information about benefits while discounting the dangers of smoking. Egalitarian communitarians (on the other end of the continuum) discounted the benefits information vis-a-vis the risk information. Thus, culturally-biased cognition of risk perception does not only apply to novel and abstract risks but also highly publicised ones. Communication and public policy implications are discussed.

TI  - A review of remote sensing applications in tropical forestry with a particular emphasis in the plantation sector
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this article is to evaluate current achievements of remote sensing technologies in forest and plantation monitoring. Despite considerable efforts having been dedicated to monitor tropical forest, some issues remain open for further exploration, including forest type mapping, biomass estimation, change detection and the detection of invasive species. Large-scale forest conversion to plantations makes it necessary to assess applications and methodologies currently published with the aim to provide an outlook for future research. Multispectral datasets have been favoured in this domain, largely because of their long-term availability. Remote sensing applications in plantation forests are often perceived as less problematic than natural forests, perhaps due to their relatively homogenous cover. We present evidence that assumptions of homogeneity in canopy cover may not be fully satisfied. Vital aspects of plantation for management such as stand age mapping, detecting disturbance and productivity measurement have been understudied, which therefore warrant further investigation.

TI  - Remote sensing and machine learning for crop water stress determination in various crops: a critical review
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - The remote sensing (RS) technique is less cost- and labour- intensive than ground-based surveys for diverse applications in agriculture. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), provides an effective approach to construct a model for regression and classification of a multivariate and non-linear system. Without being explicitly programmed, machine learning models learn from training data, i.e., past experience. Machine learning, when applied to remotely sensed data, has the potential to evolve a real-time farm-specific management system to reinforce farmers' ability to make appropriate decisions. Recently, the use of machine learning techniques combined with RS data has reshaped precision agriculture in many ways, such as crop identification, yield prediction and crop water stress assessment, with better accuracy than conventional RS methods. As agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of the worldwide water withdrawals, it must be used in the most efficient way to obtain maximum yields and food production. The use of water management and irrigation based on plant water stress have been demonstrated to not only save water but also increase yield. To date, RS and ML-based results have encouraged farmers and decision-makers to adopt this technology to meet global food demands. This phenomenon has led to the much-needed interest of researchers in using ML to improve agriculture outcomes. However, the use of ML for the potential evaluation of water stress continues to be unexplored and the existing methods can still be greatly improved. This study aims to present an overall review of the widely used methods for crop water stress monitoring using remote sensing and machine learning and focuses on future directions for researchers.

TI  - Coupled approach for radiometric calibration and parameter retrieval to improve SPM estimations in turbid inland/coastal waters
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision radiometric calibration (RC) coefficients are required to retrieve reliable water quality parameter products in turbid inland/coastal waters. However, unreliable RC coefficients when satellite sensors lack accurate and in-time RC may lead to pronounced uncertainties in the products through error propagation. To address this issue, a novel approach for estimating water quality parameters, taking suspended particulate matter (SPM) as a case, was proposed by coupling the procedures of RC and SPM model development. The coupled models were established using digital numbers (DNs) from target sensors and "in-situ" SPM measurements from concurrent well-calibrated reference sensors, with the RC coefficients introduced as unknown model parameters. The approach was tested and validated in varied Chinese inland/coastal regions, including the Hongze lake (HL), Taihu lake (TL), and Hangzhou bay (HB). The results show: (1) the DN-based SPM models can achieve a degree of accuracy comparable to reflectance-based SPM models with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.72, and root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 7.02 mg/L, 15.73 mg/L, and 619.2 mg/L for the HL, TL, and HB, respectively, and the biases less than 3% between the derived and official gain RC coefficients; (2) the uncertainty of SPM products increases exponentially as the RC uncertainty increases for exponential reflectance-based SPM models; (3) the DN-based SPM models are less sensitive to the uncertainties of atmospheric correction and RC coefficients, while the reflectance-based models suffer deeply. This study provides encouraging results to the improvement of SPM retrieval using the DN-based models by coupling RC and SPM retrieving processes, especially for sensors without precise RC coefficients.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Detects Firn Aquifers in the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Firn aquifers in Greenland store liquid water within the upper ice sheet and impact the hydrological system. Their location and area have been estimated with airborne radar sounder surveys (Operation IceBridge, OIB). However, the OIB coverage is limited to narrow flight lines, offering an incomplete view. Here, we show the ability of satellite radar measurements from Sentinel-1 to map firn aquifers across all of Greenland at 1 km(2) resolution. The detection of aquifers relies on a delay in the freezing of meltwater within the firn above the water table, causing a distinctive pattern in the radar backscatter. The Sentinel-1 aquifer locations are in very good agreement with those detected along the OIB flight lines (Cohen's kappa = 0.84). The total aquifer area is estimated at 54,800 km(2). With continuity of Sentinel-1 ensured until 2030, our study lays a foundation for monitoring the future response of firn aquifers to climate change.

TI  - Mapping the annual dynamics of cultivated land in typical area of the Middle-lower Yangtze plain using long time-series of Landsat images based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivated land in Middle-lower Yangtze Plain has been greatly reduced over the last few decades due to rapid urban expansion and massive urban construction. Accurate and timely monitoring of cultivated land changes has significant for regional food security and the impact of national land policy on cultivated land dynamics. However, generating high-resolution spatial-temporal records of cultivated land dynamics in complex areas remains difficult due to the limitations of computing resources and the diversity of land cover over a complex region. In our study, the annual dynamics of cultivated land in Middle-lower Yangtze Plain were first produced at 30 m resolution with a one-year interval in 1990-2010. Changes of vegetation and cultivated land are examined with the breakpoints inter-annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trajectories and synthetic NDVI derived by the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTRAFM), respectively. Last, cultivated land dynamics is extracted with a one-year interval by detecting phenological characteristic. The results indicate that the rate of reduction in cultivated land area has accelerated over the past two decades, and has intensified since 1997. The dynamics of cultivated land mainly occurred in the mountains, hills, lakes and around towns, and the change frequency of these area was mainly one or two times. In particular, the changes in cultivated land in Nanjing have been most intense, perhaps attributed to urban greening and infrastructure construction.

TI  - Deformation of the Baige Landslide, Tibet, China, Revealed Through the Integration of Cross-Platform ALOS/PALSAR-1 and ALOS/PALSAR-2 SAR Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-eight ALOS/PALSAR-1 and ALOS/PALSAR-2 images acquired from January 2007 to August 2018 were exploited to characterize the deformation history and temporal evolution of the Baige landslide, China, which successively occurred on 11 October and 3 November 2018. To mitigate the errors caused by the topographic relief and to conduct offset estimates between the SAR images from different platforms, a novel offset-tracking method is proposed. The SAR images were ortho-rectified firstly. Then two-dimensional deformations were retrieved successfully from SAR images acquired at an identical platform and different platforms. Our results indicate that the maximum cumulative deformation in the line-of-sight direction of the Baige landslide reached about -60 m between January 2007 and August 2018. Furthermore, correlation between time series deformation and monthly precipitation and soil moisture derived from SAR intensity images suggests that the failure of the Baige landslide was closely related to the heavy rainfall in the summer of 2018.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of the yellowwood tree (<i>Podocarpus henkelii</i>) in the Weza-Ngele forest using the newly launched Sentinel-2 multispectral imager data
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation of indigenous tree species is not only significant for the natural heritage, but for conserving numerous species that are heavily dependent on these trees for survival. Remotely sensed data have been proven to be an effective tool for enumeration monitoring of vegetation resources. However, the utility of freely available new generation multispectral sensors with improved spatial and spectral resolutions still needs to be understood in the conservation of natural resources. Therefore, this study sought to map the spatial distribution of Podocarpus henkelii in Weza-Ngele forest using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument. A total of five classes were randomly sampled and discriminated using Random Forest technique. The models created from only spectral bands were compared to those derived from combining vegetation indices and spectral bands. The Index Database was used to compute vegetation indices (VI) with 10 different VI being selected for characterizing Podocarpus land cover types. The overall accuracies of spectral bands, as well as spectral bands combined with vegetation indices, was 67% and 80%, respectively. These results underscore the utility of the new generation of multispectral sensors in successfully discriminating P.henkelii from other land cover, thus providing a cheaper and easier alternative for indigenous forest species mapping.

TI  - The contribution of ALOS/PALSAR-1 multi-temporal data to map permanently and temporarily flooded coastal wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although regional wetland mapping studies have mostly relied on optical sensors, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are being increasingly applied. The aim of this study is to analyse the ability of the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on board of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS/PALSAR-1) data to identify, delineate and monitor wetlands, and to evaluate the importance of scene selection in a highly unpredictable wetland. Three SAR scene sets (Year A, Year B and Inter-annual) were built for this purpose, considering the intra-annual and inter-annual hydrologic variability and the phenologic variability of the studied coastal wetland. Seven land cover types were defined, including three permanently flooded wetland classes, three temporarily flooded wetland classes and one non-wetland class. An object-based unsupervised classification approach was applied on each multi-temporal set. The obtained clusters were characterized by a temporal signature and assigned to the seven land cover types using a decision tree with user-defined thresholds. The accuracy assessment of each product was performed using a set of 258 data sites, including field collected data and data retrieved from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery acquired during the dates of the field campaign. The Year B set showed the best accuracy (83.4% overall, 75% Kappa coefficient (kappa)) and the lowest omission and commission mean errors (16.6% and 16.1% respectively). The classes that were best differentiated are permanently flooded wetlands (PFW) and non-wetlands (NW) in all sets.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is the main component of phytoplankton and an important index of water quality. Pearson correlation analysis is conducted on measured Chl-a concentration and band reflectance to determine the sensitive bands or multiband combinations of the Chl-a to input to a support vector machine (SVM) model. An indicator beta is defined to evaluate the model performance of fitting and prediction. The model performs well with the lowest beta (decision coefficient, (R-2) = 0.774; root mean square error (RMSE) = 22.636 mu g/L) of the validation set. The model test results prove that the model performs well. We analyze the impact factors of the model. The seasonal factor affects the model performance significantly; thus, samples from different seasons should be combined to train the model and inverse the water quality. Noise points reduce the model accuracy significantly; therefore, obvious outliers must be excluded at first. Additionally, the sampling method affects model accuracy, and systematic sampling in the descending order of Chl-a concentration is recommended. The combination of SVM algorithm and remote sensing technology provides a convenient, scientific, and real-time method to monitor and control water quality.

TI  - Seasonal and annual segregation of liquid water and ice clouds in Iran and their relation to geographic components and precipitation
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and proper understanding of the state of the clouds regarding different seasons of the year will have profound effects on different economic and environmental sectors. The purpose of this study is to determine the hourly dissociation of ice and liquid clouds in Iran. To this end, cloud optical thickness (COT) data, as well as optical depth of clouds in two phases of liquid and ice were obtained and processed from 31 synoptic meteorological stations (1960-2015), MODIS data from Terra satellite during the years 2001 to 2011, and they were processed then. Next, using the RegCM4 model, the cloud fraction (clt) was simulated to accurately identify the cloud cover situation in Iran. The results showed that the maximum annual mean abundance of liquid and ice clouds was 18.95 days for the time 15:00 and 3.99 days for the time 06:00, respectively. Climatic zones of the Caspian and Persian Gulf coasts at 15 o'clock had the highest decreasing trend of liquid clouds. Ice clouds in all parts of Iran's climate, with the exception of the eastern plateau, also declined. From south to north and east to west of Iran, the occurrence of ice and liquid clouds is increasing. Therefore, the spatio-temporal distribution of liquid and ice clouds in the country was also dependent on spatial components and latitude had the greatest impact. From the satellite and modeled data, the RegCM4 model has been able to detect the Monsoon phenomenon in southeastern Iran during the summer. CLT simulation in Iran has also shown that cloud cover in Iran fluctuates between 28 and 65% on average, with 81.5% of Iranian stations having a significant change in the amount of annual cloud cover. Correlation of liquid and ice clouds with precipitation showed that liquid clouds in summer and ice clouds in spring had higher correlation with precipitation in Iran. Northern coasts of Iran due to greater ascent mechanisms such as coastal compressors, north latitude atmospheric circulation systems, and maximum winds in the north and west of Iran due to the location of western systems entry and sufficient thermal gradient, had maximum ice clouds in the last half century. Also, south of Iran, despite having extended and great water-bodies, is less cloudy due to descending air in Hadley's circulation (Hadley cell) of air.

TI  - Comparing geological and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry data of the Sele River coastal plain, southern Italy: Implications for recent subsidence trends
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many coastlines around the world are subsiding, often due to tectonic causes. In tectonically active areas, the exploitation of natural resources has caused acceleration of subsidence rates. In these cases, it is difficult to separate the many different components of the subsidence process. We try to fill this gap, using both remote sensing data and geological evidence, in an area located in southern Italy (Sele River plain) and characterized by the presence of both human activities and natural processes.The coastal sector of the Sele plain shows a complex subsidence pattern, as testified by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS InSAR) data related to a period of about two decades (1992-2010), that we put in correlation with stratigraphical data from both outcrops and boreholes (ca. 250). The Quaternary infill of the coastal sectors of the plain is not laterally isotropic and homogeneous because of the presence of layers of clastic sediments with different degrees of compaction. Dunal and beach sands, back-ridge (lagoonal and palustrine) silty clays, palaeosols and thick peaty layers are the main facies of this sedimentary prism. The back-ridge depressions hosted palustrine and marshy environments and were artificially drained in the last centuries. The main output of the PS-InSAR analysis is a map of vertical ground deformation (VGD), which has been a useful tool to understand the causes of the subsidence process if combined with geological data from field and boreholes. In fact, the overlay of the SAR interferometry VGD map with the geomorphological and stratigraphical features shows that the subsidence is higher in the northern sector of the plain, where the Quaternary alluvial-coastal deposits are thicker because of the structural asymmetry of the graben. The maximum subsidence rate, however, can be observed in the central part of the plain, in correspondence of the Sele, Tusciano and Picentino river mouths and in the coastal belt. This could be related to the thickness of loose sediments (>20 m) and to the presence of still compacting clay-rich sediments. In the southernmost sector the rates are the lowest recorded in the plain due to the minor thickness of Holocene deposits and to the presence of very thick sedimentary bodies of travertine. The understanding of subsidence patterns may represent a basic tool for future studies about the assessment of the coastal inundation hazard and related risk mitigation in the Sele River plain. Such a tool may reinforce the methodological approach to risk assessment in similar morphological settings. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of evapotranspiration based on upscaling eddy covariance measurements in the dryland of the North China Plain
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important for understanding hydrological cycle and water resources management in the cropland. Based on eight flux sites within the North China Plain (NCP) and the surrounding area, which were integrated together for the first time, we applied support vector regression method to develop ET dataset for the cropland in NCP from 1982 to 2015 with 1/12 degrees spatial resolution and eight-day temporal interval. The mean annual ET over cropland within NCP was 575 mm yr(-1) with a non-significant increasing trend. In wheat season, the seasonal ET increased significantly at the rate of 1.28 mm yr(-2) with a mean value of 238 mm yr(-1); in maize season, the mean value of seasonal ET was 221 mm yr(-1) with a decreasing trend of -0.95 mm yr(-2). The comparatively high mean annual ET values occurred primarily in the well irrigated area near the Taihang Mountains, irrigation districts along the Yellow River and the humid region. The attribution analysis which combined multiple regression with the first difference method revealed that human activities dominated ET trend at annual scale as well as in wheat season, with relative contributions of 52% and 56%, respectively. While in maize season, ET trend was mostly controlled by climate change with relative contribution of 77%. Among the climate factors, in wheat season, the significantly increasing air temperature was the principal climatic cause of ET increase which was partly offset by the significantly decreasing wind speed; while in maize season, the significant ET decline was primarily resulted from the significantly decreasing net radiation and wind speed. Compared with our ET dataset, the four widely used global or national ET datasets significantly underestimated ET in wheat season, especially in the extensively irrigated areas, suggesting that local observations are crucial for regional studies.

TI  - Estimation of lake ecological quality from Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Water Framework Directive requires European states to monitor the ecological quality of their lakes. Detailed information on the composition and abundance of biological groups such as aquatic plants (macrophytes) and phytoplankton (including chlorophyll a) must be expressed as an ecological quality ratio (EQR), ranging from 1 (close to reference status) to 0 (bad status). Effort is often focused on gathering this detailed information on selected lakes at the expense of more synoptic approaches that could capture a more holistic assessment of a catchment's water quality. This could be rectified if remote sensing can provide predictions of ecological quality for unmonitored lakes. We found that data from Sentinel-2 satellites, based on regression model outputs of observed vs estimated results, successfully predicted the macrophyte EQR (R-2 = 0.77) and the maximum lake depth that macrophytes colonised to (R-2 = 0.80) but average chlorophyll a was less well predicted (R-2 = 0.66). Predictions for a test catchment indicated that results were within one ecological assessment class width of measured values for macrophytes. This approach can potentially estimate status for unmonitored lakes in Ireland, be integrated with results on monitored lakes and used to direct resources where needed at national and catchment scales.

TI  - A parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) approach for estimating maize progress percentage at field scale
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Crop Progress Percentage (CPP) in a given phenology stage reflects growth status in the crop life cycle. Generally, routine field measurements of this variable are missing, hence various alternative approaches have been proposed for its estimation. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which follow the Bayesian structure are helpful tools for this aim. In the current study, an approach based on the parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) method is used for more accurate estimation of the maize CPP at field scale. The CPP information recorded in three experiment sites i.e. Karaj, Darab and Zarghan were used to validate the performance of the PEB method and to test the robustness. The PEB method includes a non-homogeneous HMM along with an empirical method based on fitting a gamma probability density function (PDF) on prior probabilities. Temporal sequence of phonological stages is regarded as the hidden layer and temporal sequence of NDVI and AGDD indices as the observable layer. The procedure of CPPs estimation is based on calculation of prior and posterior probabilities and an inverse normalization. The overall RMSE of the non-homogeneous HMM before applying the empirical method was 15.1, 11.5 and 7.8% for Karaj, Darab and Zarghan, respectively. However, it was found that the applied HMM fails to estimate the CPPs of final phenological stages accurately. The averaging process of the prior probabilities does not include the errors produced by factors such as climate variability or farming practices. To overcome these problems, we used an empirical Bayes method to estimate the hyperparameters of a gamma density function which was applied as a prior density. This simple approach to maintain the inter-annual variability due to non physiological factors, made the prior probabilities more flexible. The applied empirical Bayes approach (PEB) had significantly smaller RMSE (8, 7.5 and 6.4%, respectively); especially in final phenological stages, and led to more accurate prediction of the phenological dates. The findings derived by PEB are more consistent with those obtained by HMM when the inter-annual variability, mainly date of sowing, is minimum (Specifically, for Zarghan station). The proposed modified approach can be recommended for use at the field scale and serve as a promising tool especially in the regions which suffer the inter-annual variability.

TI  - Interannual variation of the East Asia Jet Stream and its impact on the horizontal distribution of aerosol in boreal spring
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interannual variation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in East Asia has been investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) data for 2000-2018. The data analysis focuses on boreal spring when Siberian biomass burning is at its seasonal maximum. The results indicate that the significant increase in organic and black carbon is primarily caused by emissions from biomass burning in East Asia, which leads to significant interannual variations in aerosol loading and pan-Pacific transport. The anomalous large-scale climate variability associated with the East Asia Jet Stream (EAJS) provides favorable conditions for increasing the AOD of organic and black carbon in Northeast Asia and may represent an underlying physical mechanism. When the EAJS shows greater weakening than normal, abnormal high-pressure anomalies are maintained in East Asia, which tend to drive warm advection over Northeast Asia. This warm advection expedites the melting of the Eurasian snow cover, which helps increase surface dryness in late spring and provides favorable conditions for biomass burning. The EAJS index can be predictable with statistical significance up to lead 1 month by the dynamical ensemble seasonal forecasts, suggesting a possible implementation of the empirical AOD forecasts using climate forecast models.

TI  - Evaluation and improvement of MODIS aerosol optical depth products over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we use the level-1.5 and level-2.0 aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 dataset at 12 sites in China to evaluate the MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) AOD products retrieved using three distinct algorithms: Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), and DTB merged from DT and DB from Terra and Aqua. The performance of the three algorithms is evaluated. Based on these evaluations, a simple and efficient AOD retrieval algorithm at a high spatial resolution of 1.0 km for China is proposed. AODs at this spatial resolution over China are then retrieved using the methods of DT and DB, respectively. The evaluation results showed that: (1) there is little difference in the AOD products derived from Terra and Aqua. The differences in the determination coefficient (R-2) between the two platforms at most sites are less than 0.05. (2) There are relatively large differences in AODs between the AERONET level-1.5 dataset and MODIS dataset while these differences are mostly filtered out by the quality assurance process of the AERONET level-2.0 dataset. The statistical tests indicate that the MODIS DTB AOD product is generally better than those from the other two algorithms. Using the new algorithm developed in this study, the AODs at a high spatial resolution of 1 km in the whole of China are determined and the results are compared with the MODIS DTB product. The results show that the AODs determined using the new method agree reasonably well with those of the MODIS DTB dataset though the new results have slightly negative biases in the wintertime. However, these negative biases may not be a negative sign due to the fact that the MODIS AODs are subject to a positive bias relative to the AERONET AODs.

TI  - Characterizing braided rivers in two nested watersheds in the Source Region of the Yangtze River on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - large and complex braided channels (>1 km wide) in the Source Region of the Yangtze River (SRYR) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, are characterized by a unique alpine environment with very high elevations and glacier sources. Yet, little is known about the morphological complexity and changes of large braided channels owing to the scarcity of hydrological and topographical data. In this study, we provided the first insight into these issues using compiled long-term (several decades) climatic and suspended sediment data, and Landsat images of braided channels in two nested headwater watersheds (i.e., Tuotuo and Tongtian river watersheds) in the SRYR. Analysis of annual and monthly mean temperature, precipitation, and water discharges illustrated the nature of the hydrological regime and their response to glacier melting in the two watersheds. Examination of annual mean suspended sediment loads and concentrations (C) led to two sediment rating curves and generally similar C values between the two watersheds. Among a suite of morphological indices for braided rivers, braiding intensity may be quantified using four different ones. After comparing the indices, we showed that they had similar ability of characterizing braiding patterns and adopted branch count index (BIT3) for further analysis. We found that BIT3 was linearly correlated with active valley width (W-R) during both flood and dry seasons for the 17 selected braided reaches distributed within the two nested watersheds. In addition, braiding density, defined as the ratio of BIT3 to W-R, remained approximately unchanged irrespective of elevations and locations of these reaches, indicating clearly that morphological structures of braided channels are spatially uniform in the SRYR. Along the main channels of the two nested watersheds over the entire study period, BIT3 always reached the maximum as R-W, defined as the ratio of water body to exposed active riverbed area, was around 0.43. Furthermore, R-W was always positively correlated with the associated water discharge (Q). Variable degrees of braiding adjustment in response to changes of hydrological regime were represented by hysteresis loops between BIT3 and Q. These results revealed relatively homogeneous morphologic properties of braided channels across the two nested watersheds and provided an important benchmark for future morphodynamic research on braided rivers in the SRYR.

TI  - Using heterogeneity indices to adjust basal area - Leaf area index relationship in managed coniferous stands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure of contemporary managed forests is complex and deviates from experimental forests which are usually even-aged monocultures and single-storied. To apply theoretical growth and yield functions on managed forests, adjustments are required, especially for leaf area index (LAI) which is a key biophysical variable in process-based growth models. To asses this, the performance of canopy LAI in modelling the basal area (BA) of managed boreal forests dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L). Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was investigated by heterogeneity analysis. The study was based on the assumption that canopy LAI and BA are strongly related and are vital for estimating stand productivity and growth. Managed forests were represented by field data from the 2016 and 2017 Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) campaigns. Species-specific LAI conversion parameters were applied on the general plant area index (PAD values from hemispheric fish-eye photos taken from the permanent and temporary NFI sample plots. The heterogeneity analysis was studied in two parts by: (a) ground-based stand structural heterogeneity (SSH) described by species composition, coefficient of tree diameter variation, tree social status and height-diameter ratio, and (b) spectral heterogeneity (SPH) by vegetation and textural indices developed from Sentinel-2. Species-specific final (with heterogeneity metrics) and base (without heterogeneity metrics) models were fitted for BA-LAI and BA-PM relationships by nonlinear least squares and generalised additive regression functions, respectively. The performance of models was assessed by the root-mean-squared error (RMSE, m(2)ha(-1)) and the relative root-mean-squared error (ReIRMSE, %) metrics. For both species, BA-LAI final models (FMs) accounting for heterogeneity resulted in larger explained variance than the base models (BMs). Compared with the BMs, FMs with SSH reduced the variance by 55% in Norway spruce (RMSE = 3.33, ReIRMSE = 15.39) and 43% in Scots pine (RMSE = 3.70, ReIRMSE = 17.38). The fit between BA-LAI with SPH also showed an improvement for Norway spruce (RMSE = 5.56) and Scots pine (RMSE = 5.66) over the BMs, suggesting the potential use of Sentinel-2 in future growth models. The results of the study suggest that in growth models when extrapolating theoretical growth functions to managed forests, there is a need to calibrate the models with the forest structural heterogeneity. This is important for drawing realistic conclusions from growth and yield modelling of managed stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine.

TI  - Optical and physical properties of aerosols during active fire events occurring in the Indo-Gangetic Plains: Implications for aerosol radiative forcing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatological characteristics of biomass burning over the western Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) are examined during the post-monsoon (October-November) season from 2001-2018 using the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) fire products. The intensity of the biomass burning are estimated from the fire pixels detected by the MODIS satellites in the form of fire counts, surface brightness temperature, and fire radiative power. Such biomass burning are mostly affected over Lahore and Patiala region of the western IGP. These fire products are examined along with optical and physical properties of aerosols and its radiative forcing estimated from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data. Due to non-availability of long-term aerosol data, the study was performed only at Lahore (AERONET) and Patiala (MODIS) of the western IGP region. The current study shows increasing trends of average brightness temperature by 16% year(-1) over Patiala and 14% year(-1) over Lahore, which enhances the aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 3%-7% year(-1) over the study region. The sphericity of the fine-mode aerosols are rising from 23% to 61% during non-fire to fire events and the dominance of fine-mode aerosols are observed during the active fire events. Further, the absorptivity of AOD (at 440 nm) has enhanced from 0.07 to 0.14 during non-fire to fire events. Asymmetric parameter (AS) of fine-mode aerosol increases from 0.65 to 0.68 during non-fire to active fire events. The characteristics of elevated aerosol layers due to the active fire events are clearly distinguished from the non-fire events within 0-2 km above the surface as noticed from high aerosol extinction and attenuated back scatter coefficients, obtained from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). Absorbing aerosols associated from biomass-burning contribute to the surface radiative forcing by -173.96 +/- 47 W m(-2) and atmospheric forcing by 123.57 +/- 41 W m(-2) over Lahore. The impact of the biomass-burning over Lahore has making the atmosphere more warming by 3.50 +/- 1.14 K Day(-1). The estimated heating rates (HR) in the atmosphere are rising during both fire and non-fire events by 3.79% and 3.44% per year, respectively.

TI  - The January 2018 to September 2019 surge of Shisper Glacier, Pakistan, detected from remote sensing observations
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed the actively surging Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram region of Pakistan using earth observation data from Landsat 8 OLI and Planet images. Changes in the surface glacier velocity, supraglacial moraines and debris cover were assessed using Landsat 8 data at monthly time-steps from January 2018 to May 2019. High resolution data from Planet Labs was used to precisely detect the snout advance and ice-dammed lake expansion. Downstream cross-section profiles of the valley were generated using a moderate resolution digital elevation model to assess the inundation in the event of rapid ice-dammed lake drainage. Correlation Image Analysis Software working on the principle of normalized cross-correlation was used to generate time series monthly surface velocity profiles for Shisper Glacier. Manual digitization at 1:30000 scale was used to delineate supraglacial moraines and supraglacial debris cover. The glacier surface velocity profiles indicate that the ablation zone of the glacier continues to be in an active surge phase resulting in advance of the snout and expansion of the ice-dammed lake. Surface glacier velocities are as high as 48 m d(-1). Between 18 December 2018 and 8 May 2019, the glacier snout advanced at similar to 6 m d(-1) with a total overall advance of 860 m. The lake formed due to damming of an outflow stream from Mochowar Glacier expanded to its maximum area (29.69 ha) in May 2019 before drainage started on 23 June 2019. Our estimates indicate that the peak discharge in case of rapid drainage could vary between 5033 m(3) s(-1) and 6167 m(3) s(-1) and potentially affect infrastructure downstream.

TI  - Developing a dust storm detection method combining Support Vector Machine and satellite data in typical dust regions of Asia
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing the dust storm detection is a key part for the environmental protection, human healthy and economic development. The goal of this paper is to propose a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based method to automatically detect dust storms using remote sensing data. Existing methods dealing with this problem are usually threshold-based that are of great complexity and uncertainty. In this paper we propose a simple and reliable method combining SVM with MODIS L1 data and explore the optimal band combinations used as the feature vectors of SVM. The developed method was evaluated by MODIS and OMI data qualitatively and quantitatively on three study sites located in the Arabian Desert, Gobi Desert and Taklimakan Desert, and it was also compared to three other traditional methods based on their accuracy, complexity, reliability and sensitivity to thresholds. The detection results demonstrated that the combination of (Band7 - Band3)/(Band7 + Band3) ((B7 - B3)/(B7 + B3)), Band20 - Band31 (B20 - B31), and Band31/Band32 (B31/B32) can detect the dust storms more precisely than other individual bands or their combination. The comparison among those cases indicated that the proposed automatic method exhibited an advantage of minimizing the uncertainty and complexity, which were the limits of defining thresholds based on the threshold-based methods. The conclusions can provide references for studies that focus on statistical-based dust storm detection. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of the MISR fine resolution aerosol product using MODIS, MISR, and ground observations over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, NASA's Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) team released the Version 23 (V23) 4.4-km Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product, which has better spatial resolution than V22 at 17.6 km. However, its quality has not been validated in China. Here, V23 products for different spatiotemporal domains are obtained for validation against Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD measurements for 29 sites from 2008 to 2017. Based on the national daily mean, V23 AOD yields a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.902 with AERONET; 59.45% of retrievals fall within the expected error (=EE; +/- 0.05 or +/- 0.2 x AOD). A mean error (ME) of -0.0605 with 24.11% of retrievals falling below the EE indicates that MISR data are still underestimated at high AODs. The sample numbers and accuracies of spatially averaged 17.6-km and 50-km data are greatly improved relative to V22. The seasonal mean of V23 retrievals = EE in fall and winter are highest, followed by those in summer and spring; the validation results at 17.6 km are generally better than those at 50 km. By region, V23 retrievals = EE in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions are 68.87%, 61.43%, and 73.13% respectively, while that of Taiwan is below 60% (55.75%). No V22 records exist in PRD, and V23 products over other regions in all seasons perform well; V22 retrievals in summer are also recommended. Compared with Terra/MODIS 3-km AOD in 2016, the V23 product has a slightly higher R value (0.925) with AERONET than MODIS (0.909). The MISR AOD bias is lower, and MODIS AOD is overestimated relative to the ground truth; both present consistent seasonality characteristics (spring > winter > summer > autumn), with the maximum in March and minimum in August. To investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics over long-term AOD, MISR V23 4.4-km AOD can be used in combination with other observation data.

TI  - An eigenvector spatial filtering based spatially varying coefficient model for PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration estimation: A case study in Yangtze River Delta region of China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ordinary interpolation using PM2.5 ground monitoring observations can seldom reveal the PM2.5 concentration distribution characteristics due to the uneven distribution of monitoring stations and because ordinary linear regression often neglects the spatial autocorrelation among geographical locations. In this study, we developed an eigenvector spatial filtering based spatially varying coefficient (ESF-SVC) model to estimate ground PM2.5 concentration. To generate and analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5 concentration in the China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, ESF-SVC model which uses a set of satellite remote sensing data, factory locations, and road networks, was fitted at different time scales from December 2015 to November 2016. Comparisons among the ESF-SVC, eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models suggest that the ESP-SVC model with an average annual and seasonal adjusted R-2 of 0.684, is 10.3 and 13.8% higher than the GWR and ESF models, respectively. The average annual and seasonal cross validation root mean square error (RMSE) of the ESF-SVC models lower than the GWR and ESF models. PM2.5 concentration distribution maps for annual and seasonal were produced to illustrate YRD region's spatiotemporal characteristics. In summary, an ESF-SVC model offers a reliable approach for PM2.5 concentrations estimation in large area.

TI  - A critical view of long-term AVHRR aerosol data record in China: Retrieval frequency and heavy pollution
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent AVHRR aerosol products expended from MODIS Deep Blue (DB) algorithm provide an unprecedented long-term data record over land that dates back to 1980s. Unlike previous studies focused on performance of AVHRR retrievals, here we present a critical view into the influence of retrieval frequency on consistency of AVHRR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) with other satellite DB products, and application potential in characterizing the dramatic aerosol loading in China. Despite the good consistency of collocated AVHRR, SeaWiFS, and MODIS DB AOD, their different retrieval frequency leads to distinct distribution of annual or seasonal AOD. In particular, the over-strict cloud screening of AVHRR with fewer bands tends to filter out high-AOD and clean bright surface, with the overall AOD frequency only half of MODIS's. Retrieval frequency and selection criterion of AOD quality can determine representativity and consistency of conventional averaged satellite AOD, uncertainties of which should be considered according to specific application purpose. The time series variation of AVHRR AOD shows that early 1990s is a key time point when frequent haze pollution appears and increases in eastern China. By contrast, aerosol loading in 1995-1999 has reached similar level as in 2000s with notable hotspot of high-AOD (-0.8-0.9) and slight changes. Our results shows that full record of AVHRR aerosol products with corresponding improvement can greatly renew the understanding of aerosols in China.

TI  - Detecting intra- and inter-annual variability in gross primary productivity of a North American grassland using MODIS MAIAC data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prairie productivity is largely affected by temperature and precipitation and is vulnerable to a changing climate. In this study, we used 5-years of growing season eddy covariance and satellite data (MODIS MAIAC) from two adjacent field sites in southern Alberta (Canada) prairie to monitor intra- and inter-annual variation in prairie productivity using remote sensing. Three MODIS vegetation indices were examined to track seasonal variation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP): the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the NIRv, and the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI). The productivity of these prairie ecosystems was mainly driven by precipitation, with temperature affecting the starting time of the growing season. The three vegetation indices captured distinct aspects of GPP phenology. CCI, which is sensitive to chlorophyll and carotenoid pigment ratios, followed seasonal GPP dynamics more closely than NDVI and NIRv. Consequently, less hysteresis occurred with the seasonal CCI-GPP relationship than with the NDVI-GPP or NIRv-GPP relationships. Relative to 16-day composite data, daily MODIS data provided a more detailed GPP phenology. However, relationships between all vegetation indices and GPP improved with temporal aggregation up to one month, demonstrating that the degree of data aggregation affects the ability of reflectance-based indices to track GPP. Results from a multivariable regression revealed a strong relationship between GPP and a linear combination of 3 MODIS bands (B1, B2 and B11), which indicates that additional spectral information provided by the MODIS ocean band (band 11) can help track grassland GPP better than typical 2-band broad-band indices (e.g. NDVI or NIRv) only. Improved monitoring of prairie ecosystems using these enhanced approaches, can lead to a better understanding of the effects of changing weather and climate on the productivity of prairie ecosystems.

TI  - Variation of the aerosol optical properties and validation of MODIS AOD products over the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau based on ground-based remote sensing in 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol change over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is poorly understood due to the scarcity of aerosol measurements over the TP. The aerosol optical properties were measured with a CE-318 sun photometer from January to December in 2017 at the Litang station (30.00 degrees N, 100.16 degrees E, 3950.5 m a.s.l.) over the eastern edge of the TP to characterize the variations in the aerosol optical properties and assess the applicability of MODIS AOD products at the eastern edge of TP. The analyses show that the annual mean aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD(440nm)) is 0.08 +/- 0.03. The mean annual Angstrom exponent between 440 and 870 can (AE(440-870nm)) is 0.72 +/- 0.23. The monthly-averaged AOD(440nm) exhibits a maximum (0.11 +/- 0.04) in July and minimum (0.05 +/- 0.02) in January, while the monthly mean AE(440-870nm) shows a maximum (1.08 +/- 0.19) in July and minimum (0.48 0.32) in February. The findings based on measured AOD(440nm) and AE(440-870nm) indicate low AOD, dominated by coarse particles in winter and fine particles in summer over the eastern TP edge. Three datasets of MODIS AOD products with 3 km spatial resolution as well as with 10 km spatial resolution based on Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms are validated using the ground -based measurements over the eastern edge of the TP. Although the validations show a low accuracy of MODIS AOD products of the three datasets over this TP region, the MODIS AOD products based on the DB algorithm with 10 km resolution could be used in the atmospheric environment over the eastern edge of the TP based on the best match between AOD data and ground-based measurements, the lowest retrieval error, and the largest percentage falling within the expected error envelope.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution and Variation Characteristics of Aerosol Optical Properties in Henan Province
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal variation and spatial distribution characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol column mass concentration (AMC), and fine mode fraction (FMF) were analyzed based on the aerosol product information obtained from MODIS/Terra C6.1 from 2001 to 2018 in the Henan province. The spatial distribution of AOD and AMC in all seasons are high in the east and low in the west, and high in the north and low in the south, which was related to the special topography, population distribution, and number of enterprises in each region. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of FMF is opposite to that of AOD and AMC. In spring, AMC was the highest, while FMF was the lowest, indicating that it was mainly affected by dust aerosol in spring. AOD and FMF were the highest in summer, while the AMC was lower, mainly because the high values of AOD in summer were caused by the hygroscopic growth of aerosol. The increase of rainwater scouring and secondary aerosol generation led to the domination of fine-mode aerosols in summer. In autumn and winter, the AOD and AMC were relatively low, and the FMF was slightly higher than in spring. The AOD and AMC in the Henan Province showed a decreasing annual trend, while the FMF exhibited an increasing trend. The average monthly peak-valley difference of AOD, AMC, and FMF decreased after 2011.

TI  - Estimation of surface albedo from meteorological observations across China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is an important parameter in agronomic, physiological, biological, and biogeochemical studies. Ground observations of surface albedo, which are available at only a limited number of stations worldwide, are not applicable for most unmonitored areas. The objective of this study was to develop an analytical model that accounts for the effects of various influencing factors in estimating snow-free surface albedo from standard meteorological observations. Daily measurements of surface albedo during 1993-2015 from 14 meteorological stations were collected to calibrate the model parameters and to examine the performance of the developed model. The comparative results indicated that the calibrated model performed well in ground albedo parameterization across China. The calibrated model was also applied to estimate the surface albedo of a hypothetical reference crop. The simulated results demonstrated that the reference surface albedo was generally less than the specified default constant value of 0.23 and that it exhibited characteristic seasonal and latitudinal variations. The use of the default constant value of albedo rather than the albedo estimated using the proposed model resulted in systematic underestimation of net radiation, especially for low-latitude regions in summer and autumn.

TI  - Legacy effect of spring phenology on vegetation growth in temperate China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring vegetation phenology is one of the most sensitive bio-indicators of the ongoing climate warming. Climate warming has substantially advanced spring phenological development and increased productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the relative importance of spring phenology and climatic factors on vegetation growth has not yet been thoroughly investigated. We extracted Start of Season (SOS) dates using five standard methods from satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data in temperate China from 1982 to 2015 and explored the spatio-temporal variation in vegetation growth and its linkages to spring phenology and climatic factors. In line with previous studies, we found that in temperate China spring phenology was significantly advanced on the average by -1.16 +/- 0.25d per decade during 1982-2015. Spring and summer vegetation growth, that was defined as mean value of NDVI over spring and summer respectively, were significantly increased on the average by 2.6 x 10(-3) and 4.8 x 10(-3), respectively, per decade over the same period. Interestingly, we found that SOS, rather than climatic factors, was the main determinant of spring vegetation growth across the forests and grasslands. However, phenology effect on summer vegetation growth was weaker in all vegetation types, and in grasslands precipitation was the main determinant of summer growth. Our study confirms that spring phenology plays a key role in vegetation growth but further highlighted that its role diminishes as the growing season progresses from spring to summer.

TI  - O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry on O<sub>3</sub> episode days and non-O<sub>3</sub> episode days in Wuhan, Central China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneous field measurements of ozone (03) and its precursors were conducted at an urban site (Zi Yang, ZY) and a suburban site (Huang Pi, HP) in August 2018 in Wuhan, China. The observation results revealed that the mean levels of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were higher at ZY than those detected at HP, while the opposite trend was observed for O-3 levels. Compared to non-O-3 episode days, higher levels of O-3 and its precursors (i.e. NMHCs, NO and CO) were observed on O-3 episode days at both ZY and HP. A chemical box model was used to investigate the O-3 photochemistry on O-3 episode days and non-O-3 episode days at ZY and HP, and the O-3 production was found to be dominated by the reaction of HO2 + NO at the two sites. In terms of O-3 destruction, OH + NO2 was the major contributor at ZY, while the highest contribution at HP was from the reaction of O(1D) + H2O. The net O-3 production rates increased significantly from non-O-3 episode days to O-3 episode days at both ZY and HP, indicating increased O-3 accumulation on O-3 episode days. In addition, the model simulation indicated that O-3 formation was controlled by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at ZY, whereas O-3 formation was cooperative controlled by VOCs and NO at HP. Overall, these findings can provide valuable information on formulating and implementing O-3 control strategies in urban and suburban areas in China.

TI  - Management of the axilla in breast cancer: outcome analysis in a series of ductal versus lobular invasive cancers
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been considered essential for the staging of breast cancer (BC). As the impact of tumor biology on clinical outcomes is recognized, a surgical de-escalation approach is being implemented. We performed a retrospective study focused on surgical management of the axilla in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) versus invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Materials and methods 1151 newly diagnosed BCs, IDCs (79.6%) or ILCs (20.4%), were selected among patients treated at our Breast Cancer Unit from 2012 to 2018. Tumor characteristics and clinical information were collected and predictors of further metastasis after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) analyzed in relation to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results 27.5% of patients with ILC had >= 3 metastatic lymph nodes at ALND after positive SLNB versus 11.48% of IDCs (p = 0.04). Risk predictors of further metastasis at ALND were the presence of > 2 positive lymph nodes at SLNB (OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.15-19.5 p = 0.03), T3-T4 tumors (OR = 4.93, 95% CI 1.10-22.2, p = 0.03) and Non-Luminal BC (OR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.16-6.50, p = 0.02). The lobular histotype was not associated with the risk of further metastasis at ALND (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.77-3.41, p = 0.20). Conclusions ILC histology is not associated with higher risk of further metastasis at ALND in our analysis. However, surgical management decisions should be taken considering tumor histotype, biology and expected sensitivity to adjuvant therapies.

TI  - Uranium anomalies detection through Random Forest regression
T2  - EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne geophysics provides one of the most relevant data for uranium exploration. However, the application of radiometric surveys is decreasing considerably as the depth of exploration is increasing. Notwithstanding, there is still a large potential for radiometric data, especially using recent data processing techniques such as machine learning methods. In this work, we propose a new method to detect uranium anomalies through regression using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm (RF). The RF regression allows combining airborne geophysical data to predict the expected uranium content, which represents the uranium content generated by environmental effects such as lithology and pedogenesis. Therefore, the deviation (Ud) between the measured uranium and the expected uranium represents the secondary effects such as weathering, soil alteration, hydrothermal alteration or mineralisation process. We evaluated the relevance of the geophysical parameters proposed by previous authors in the prediction of the expected uranium (thorium, thorium potassium ratio, uranium potassium ratio, and Total Gradient Amplitude). Randomly selecting only 10% of the database as training data, we estimate the expected uranium with an R-2 = 0.99 concerning the measured uranium. To assess the reliability of the Ud anomalies, we employed the proposed methodology in the Carajas Mineral Province (CMP), Brazil. In the CPM, the Ud anomalies showed a clear correlation with the several Iron Oxide Copper-Gold deposits (IOCG) and some IOCG-related and granite-related prospects. In situ measurements with a portable gamma-ray spectrometer in the Salobo mine supported the uranium anomalies. The Ud map also highlighted contrasts within granites that correlate with previously reported granitic facies. Therefore, the Ud map generated by RF regression is useful in setting exploration targets for conventional and unconventional uranium resources, as well as in high-detail granitic facies mapping.

TI  - Evolving a comprehensive geomatics multi-criteria evaluation index model for optimal pipeline route selection
T2  - STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Selection of pipeline routes is a geospatial multi-criteria evaluation problem since it involves the assessment of technical, environmental and safety-related factors that influence pipeline system operations. This study determines the optimal pipeline route for transmission of oil and gas products using the Dangote Refinery Project in Nigeria as a case study. Pertinent route selection factors were identified and structured into the expert feedback model of the Analytical Network Process (ANP) for accurate prioritization. LANDSAT 8 imageries of the study area were processed and classified into various land use and land cover types, which were further modelled in ArcMap 10.2 GIS software for routing analysis. Findings reveal that the most highly prioritized factors for proper route selection were the environmental and geological factors, while the least prioritized was the economic factor. In the end, alternative Route 2 was identified as the optimal route among the four evaluated alternative routes because of its minimum route length, minimum passage length through sensitive settlement areas, and less number of river, stream and existing platforms' crossings.

TI  - Appropriating Democracy: A Comparison Between Argumentative Strategies for Confucian and Islamic Democracy
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveying English, Chinese and Arabic texts, I find that advocates for Islamic or Confucian democracy often use three argumentative strategies. First, they tend to interpret democracy as a procedure to select a government instead of as an ideology or worldview. They, therefore, seem to have adopted a reform policy first suggested in nineteenth-century China: that of keeping the local 'essence' (ti) - often interpreted as values - and adopt the foreign 'practical use' (yong) - technology. However Islamic activists in particular are also able to draw on a founding myth of local democracy in the form of the early Islamic state under the Prophet, which provides an, albeit vague, native democratic practices and mechanisms. A third strategy is the search for democratic values in tradition. Both sides find native equivalents for the 'sovereignty of the people', interpret exhortations to rule for the people as proof for democratic values, and stress a right to revolt. Both sides share an unease with Western liberal democracy's secularism or moral neutrality, preferring a 'communitarian' alternative - a more harmonious, less competitive form of democracy in which the individual's freedom is restrained by their ties to a moral society.(1)

TI  - Filter-based cerebral protection during transcatheter aortic valve implantation What have we learned so far?
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR HERZ THORAX UND GEFASSCHIRURGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Brain protection for stroke prophylaxis during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using mechanical protection devices has gained in importance in recent years. Randomized studies investigating the filter-based Sentinel (TM) cerebral protection system (Sentinel-CPS) have shown that the device has a high safety profile and is effective in capturing embolic debris as well as in reducing cerebral ischemia in magnetic resonance imaging. At the forefront of the discussions on the routine use of the Sentinel-CPS are testing of treatment prerequisites and the optimal planning of the procedure in addition to safety and effectiveness. For preoperative evaluation the most important examination prior to Sentinel-CPS implantation is computed tomography (CT) of the aorta with complete visualization of the supra-aortic branches. Anatomical variants, vascular diameter, stenoses, calcifications and kinking of the access and filter target vessels have to be assessed. A recent all-comers analysis determining the percentage of patients potentially eligible for Sentinel-CPS showed formal contraindications for implantation in 38% of patients (nx202f;= 122/317). The most common reason for exclusion (28%) was that the vessel dimensions within the target landing zone of the left common carotid artery (<6.5x202f;mm) were too small. As only one size of filter system is currently available, only two thirds of the patients would seem to be eligible for Sentinel-CPS implantation. In order to avoid periprocedural complications and a potential device failure, a standardized preoperative planning protocol should be implemented for the application of the Sentinel-CPS.

TI  - Wind Speed-Independent Two-Source Energy Balance Model Based on a Theoretical Trapezoidal Relationship between Land Surface Temperature and Fractional Vegetation Cover for Evapotranspiration Estimation
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration over heterogeneous surfaces using satellite imagery and few meteorological observations remains a challenging task. Wind speed (u), which is known to exhibit high temporal-spatial variation, is a significant constraint in the abovementioned task. In this study, a wind speed-independent two-source energy balance (WiTSEB) model is proposed on the basis of a theoretical land surface temperature (T-r)-fractional vegetation coverage (f(c)) trapezoidal space and a two-stage evapotranspiration decomposing method. The temperatures in theoretically driest boundaries of the T-r-f(c) trapezoid are iteratively calculated without u by using an assumption of the absence of sensible heat exchange between water-saturated surface and atmosphere in the vertical direction under the given atmospheric condition. The WiTSEB was conducted in HiWATER-MUSOEXE-12 in the middle reaches of the Heihe watershed across eight landscapes by using ASTER images. Results indicate that WiTSEB provides reliable estimates in latent heat flux (LE), with root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) and coefficient of determination of 68.6 W m(-2) and 0.88, respectively. The RMSE of the ratio of the vegetation transpiration component to LE is 5.7%. Sensitivity analysis indicates WiTSEB does not aggravate the sensitivity on meteorological and remote sensing inputs in comparison with other two-source models. The errors of estimated T-r and observed soil heat flux result in LE overestimation/underestimation over parts of landscapes. The two-stage evapotranspiration decomposing method is carefully verified by ground observation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Antananarivo is located in the central highlands of Madagascar, and is the largest urban center of the island. Considering the frequent heavy cyclonic rains frequently affecting the area, its geomorphological context is particularly prone to geo-hydrological hazards, such as landslides and flash floods, as recently proved during the disastrous events of the winters of 2015 and 2018. Field data and high-resolution remote sensing data interpretation (DEMs and satellite orthophotos) were combined in order to produce detailed hydrographic and geomorphological maps. The aim was to understand the processes acting in the Analamanga hill area, with special regards to the effect of human activity in modeling the natural landforms and exacerbating the geo-hydrological hazards. The obtained maps will provide management-planning tools to be used as a first step towards a risk reduction strategy in the Antananarivo historical urban center.

TI  - Assessing the spatiotemporal variation of NPP and its response to driving factors in Anhui province, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems is an important metric of ecosystem functioning; however, the understanding of response mechanism of NPP to influencing factors and driving mechanisms are still limited. In this study, taking Anhui province as an example, spatio-temporal changes of NPP and its response to influencing factors were investigated for evaluating the effects of climate change and land use and land cover change (LUCC) on regional NPP. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was employed for NPP simulation by using the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and meteorological data over 2001-2016. Combined domestic LUCC, the spatiotemporal distribution pattern and dynamic change characteristics of NPP under a long time series and its response to climate factors and human activities were analyzed in the Anhui province. The results indicated that from 2001 to 2016, total NPP had a fluctuated and decreased trend with the variation range between 30.52 and 38.07 TgC in Anhui province. The multi-year average of total NPP was about 34.62 TgC. The highest value was in 2008 and the lowest value was in 2011. Among them, amount of forestland NPP was the most. The spatial distribution of NPP shows that the high value area was mainly distributed in southern Anhui mountain areas and western Anhui Dabie mountain areas; the lower value was distributed in the middle in the study area. The area of which the NPP showed a slight decrease and essentially unchanged accounted for 59.35% and 31.82%, respectively. In general, the correlation between vegetation NPP and temperature was greater than that between precipitation. The vegetations NPP of eight land use types were all positively correlated with temperature. However, the other seven types of land use were negatively correlated with precipitation except cultivated land. In the past 16 years, the decrease of cultivated land areas and the increase of urban and construction land areas contributed a lot to the decrease of vegetation NPP in Anhui province. The NPP changes of different land use types were closely related to climatic factors, land cover area, and vegetation types.

LAI, biomass and VWC of cotton with optical VIs as input (R-2= 0.42, 0.51 and 0.52) respectively were estimated. Correlation between RVI and plant height, crop age and VWC were found between 0.4 and 0.6. Fresh biomass from RVI ranged 100 -4000 gm(-2), dry biomass from NDVI ranged 50-950 gm(-2) and VWC 65-85%. Correlation between VIs and RVI was found to be non- significant. A multiple linear regression model using NDVI vs. LSWI and RVI were developed to assess LAI, biomass and VWC. The model predicted LAI with R-2 of 0.5 but failed to estimate biomass and VWC.

TI  - Third Line Eribulin for Triple-negative Metastatic Breast Ductal Carcinoma Resulting in Extended Progression-free Survival of 57 Months
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Eribulin is a non-taxane microtubule inhibitor approved for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma after two prior chemotherapeutic regimens. We report a patient with extended progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 57 months with metastatic breast carcinoma treated with eribulin in the third-line setting. A 48-year-old lady was diagnosed with stage HA (pT2N0M0), high grade, triple-negative, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the left breast on core needle biopsy. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide followed by a negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Subsequent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection revealed a 2.5 cm, high grade, triple-negative IDC with three additional lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma, consistent with the initial diagnosis. Eight months into the surveillance program, the patient developed a 2.8 cm right lower lobe (RLL) lung mass with standard uptake value (SUV) of 27 on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT). Core needle biopsy of the lung lesion revealed sheets of poorly differentiated carcinoma, immunophenotypically compatible with the initial diagnosis of breast pathology. She then commenced single-agent paclitaxel in the 1st line metastatic setting with a significant decrease in RLL lung mass to less than 1 cm with an SUV of 1.7 noted. The patient developed progression after seven months and started 2nd line gemcitabine noting initial improvement and subsequent stable disease for a period of 12 months. Eventual progression of RLL lung nodule measuring 2.1 cm with SUV of 10 noted. Initiated 3rd line eribulin with a notable response on imaging studies within three months and with no evidence of disease (NED) on scans over the subsequent 57 months. Eribulin related mild neuropathy superimposed on previous paclitaxel associated grade 2 neuropathy required a 20% eribulin dose reduction. The patient is currently clinically and radiographically stable with plateaued serum tumor markers. Our patient has shown excellent response and tolerance to eribulin with PFS of over 57 months (nineteen times the norm) which is rare.

TI  - Dual state/rainfall correction via soil moisture assimilation for improved streamflow simulation: evaluation of a large-scale implementation with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) measurements contain information about both pre-storm hydrologic states and within-storm rainfall estimates, both of which are required inputs for event-based streamflow simulations. In this study, an existing dual state/rainfall correction system is extended and implemented in the 605 000 km(2) Arkansas-Red River basin with a semi-distributed land surface model. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite surface SM retrievals are assimilated to simultaneously correct antecedent SM states in the model and rainfall estimates from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. While the GPM rainfall is corrected slightly to moderately, especially for larger events, the correction is smaller than that reported in past studies due primarily to the improved baseline quality of the new GPM satellite product. In addition, rainfall correction is poorer in regions with dense biomass due to lower SMAP quality. Nevertheless, SMAP-based dual state/rainfall correction is shown to generally improve streamflow estimates, as shown by comparisons with streamflow observations across eight Arkansas-Red River sub-basins. However, more substantial streamflow correction is limited by significant systematic errors present in model-based streamflow estimates that are uncorrectable via standard data assimilation techniques aimed solely at zero-mean random errors. These findings suggest that more substantial streamflow correction will likely require better quality SM observations as well as future research efforts aimed at reducing systematic errors in hydrologic systems.

TI  - An improved Terra-Aqua MODIS snow cover and Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0 combined product (MOYDGL06*) for high-mountain Asia between 2002 and 2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Snow is a significant component of the ecosystem and water resources in high-mountain Asia (HMA). Therefore, accurate, continuous, and long-term snow monitoring is indispensable for the water resources management and economic development. The present study improves the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrora-diometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites 8 d ("d" denotes "day") composite snow cover Collection 6 (C6) products, named MOD10A2.006 (Terra) and MYD10A2.006 (Aqua), for HMA with a multistep approach. The primary purpose of this study was to reduce uncertainty in the Terra-Aqua MODIS snow cover products and generate a combined snow cover product. For reducing underestimation mainly caused by cloud cover, we used seasonal, temporal, and spatial filters. For reducing overestimation caused by MODIS sensors, we combined Terra and Aqua MODIS snow cover products, considering snow only if a pixel represents snow in both the products; otherwise it is classified as no snow, unlike some previous studies which consider snow if any of the Terra or Aqua product identifies snow. Our methodology generates a new product which removes a significant amount of uncertainty in Terra and Aqua MODIS 8 d composite C6 products comprising 46% overestimation and 3.66% underestimation, mainly caused by sensor limitations and cloud cover, respectively. The results were validated using Landsat 8 data, both for winter and summer at 20 well-distributed sites in the study area. Our validated adopted methodology improved accuracy by 10% on average, compared to Landsat data. The final product covers the period from 2002 to 2018, comprising a combination of snow and glaciers created by merging Randolph Glacier Inventory version 6.0 (RGI 6.0) separated as debris-covered and debris-free with the final snow product MOYDGL06*. We have processed approximately 746 images of both Terra and Aqua MODIS snow containing approximately 100 000 satellite individual images. Furthermore, this product can serve as a valuable input dataset for hydrological and glaciological modelling to assess the melt contribution of snow-covered areas.

TI  - The prognostic significance of microsatellites in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microscopic satellite metastases are an adverse prognostic feature in primary cutaneous melanoma patients. The prognostic significance of microsatellites, including their number, size and distance from the primary melanoma, using the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer definition, has not previously been evaluated. This study sought to determine the prognostic significance of microsatellites in histopathologically reviewed cases. Eighty-seven cases of primary cutaneous melanoma with the presence of microsatellites documented in the original pathology report and all histopathology slides available were reviewed and the findings were correlated with clinical outcome. Matched control cases were selected for all confirmed microsatellites cases. The presence of microsatellites was confirmed in 69 cases. The microsatellite group had significantly worse prognosis, with 21% 5-year disease-free survival compared with 56% in the control group (p < 0.001). The 5-year melanoma-specific survival was 53% in the microsatellites group and 73% in the control group (p = 0.004). Increasing distance (mm) of the microsatellite from the primary melanoma was found to adversely influence disease-free survival (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.13-1.36, p < 0.001), overall survival (HR = 1.26 95%CI: 1.13-1.40, p < 0.001), and melanoma-specific survival (HR = 1.27 95% CI: 1.11-1.45, p < 0.001). Number and size of microsatellites were not significant prognostic factors. The presence of microsatellites was the only factor that proved to be an independent predictor of sentinel node positivity in multivariate analysis (OR 4.64; 95% CI 1.66-12.95; p = 0.003). Microsatellites were significantly associated with more loco-regional recurrences (p < 0.001) but not distant metastases (p = 0.821). Melanomas with microsatellites as defined by the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system are thus aggressive tumors, associated with significantly worse disease-free survival, overall survival and melanoma-specific survival. The presence of microsatellites is also associated with sentinel node-positivity and local and in-transit recurrence. Increasing distance of the microsatellite from the primary tumor is an independent adverse prognostic factor that warrants further evaluation.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with fluorescent and radioactive tracers in vulvar cancer patients
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Application of radioactive tracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in vulvar cancer has been established, however, the use of radioisotopes is expensive and requires complex logistics. This exploratory study evaluated the feasibility of near-infrared fluorescence-based SLNB in comparison to the gold standard using radioactive guidance. Methods At Evangelische Kliniken Essen-Mitte (Essen, Germany) between 02/2015 and 04/2019, 33 patients with squamous cell vulvar cancer and unifocal tumors (32 midline, 1 lateral) smaller than 4 cm underwent SLNB as part of their routine primary surgical therapy. Radiolabeled nanocolloid technetium 99 (Tc-99m) was injected preoperatively and indocyanine green (ICG) intraoperatively. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from patients' records, and descriptive statistics were applied. The detection rate of the ICG fluorescence technique was compared with the standard radioactive approach. Results In patients with midline tumors, bilateral SLNB was attempted. SLNB was feasible in 61/64 (95.3%) groins with Tc-99m and in 56/64 (87.5%) with ICG. In total, 125 SLNs were excised; all SLNs were radioactive and 117 (93.6%) also fluorescent. In 8 patients with BMI > 30 kg/m(2), SLNB was successful in 14/15 groins (93.3%) with Tc-99m and 13/15 groins (86.7%) with ICG. Upon final histology, infiltrated nodes were present in 9/64 (14.1%) groins and 10/125 SLNs; one positive SLN was not detected with ICG. Conclusions SLNB using ICG is a promising technique, however, the detection rate obtained was slightly lower than with Tc-99m. The detection rate increased over time indicating that experience and training may play an important role besides further methodological refinements.

TI  - Interannual variability of the Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration over Sri Lankan Dome in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the interannual variability of the surface and subsurface Chlorophyll-a Concentration (CC) over the Sri Lankan Dome (SLD) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and its possible linkages to local wind-induced upwelling and advection-driven CC transport via southwest monsoon current (SMC) from surrounding waters. A regional ocean modelling system (ROMS) coupled with a nitrogen-based nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus (NPZD) ecosystem model has been used to simulate the three-dimensional SMC and the upwelling system over the SLD region (5-10N, 82-87E) during 2003-2016. A deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM: 0.8-1.8 mg m(-3)) is observed at the intermediate depths of 10 to 55 m. The model-simulated CC in the SLD region shows a seasonal variation with maximum value during June through September (JJAS), compares well with Bio-Argo observations available nearby, and significantly correlates (r = 0.78) with satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The subsurface chlorophyll distribution demonstrated strong interannual variability, especially during JJAS and is associated with concurrent upwelling. The Ekman Pumping correlates well with the thermocline depth (r = -0.70) and with the deep chlorophyll maximum (r = -0.74). The simulated zonal transport of chlorophyll across 80E is moderately correlated with the surface chlorophyll on SLD from MODIS observation (0.69) and from the biophysical simulation (0.79), which signifies the role of SMC intrusion from the Arabian Sea to the southwestern BoB. A data-model composite analysis showed that a favourable wind stress curl and shallower thermocline enhanced the Chlorophyll concentration in the SLD region in the high-chlorophyll years (2004, 2014, and 2016). In contrast, reduced advection from the Arabian Sea, deeper thermocline, and the weakening of the deep chlorophyll maxima are responsible for lowering the chlorophyll concentration during the low-chlorophyll years (2008, 2009, and 2011).

TI  - Longer migration not necessarily the costliest strategy for migrating humpback whales
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-distance migration is a demanding physical activity, and how well animals manage the associated costs will have important implications for their fitness.The Oceania humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) population is recovering from past exploitation markedly slower than the neighbouring east Australian whales. The reasons for this are unknown, although higher energetic costs of longer migratory distances could be a possible explanation. Due to their fully aquatic lives, studying the energy expenditure of these large animals requires methods that do not rely on capturing the animal, such as bioenergetic models.A state-space model was fitted to satellite data to infer behavioural states for southern migrating whales. Travel speeds and behavioural states were used in a bioenergetic model to estimate the energetic cost of the migration phase. Relative differences in average duration, distance, and energetic costs were compared between migratory routes and distances.Total energy used during migration was a trade-off between cost of transport (determined by travel speed) and daily maintenance (determined by daily basal metabolic costs). Oceania whales migrating to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas travelled fastest and furthest, 15 and 21% further than whales migrating to the d'Urville Sea (east Australian whales) and Ross Sea, respectively. Therefore, they had the highest cost of transport, 25 and 85% higher than for d'Urville Sea and Ross Sea whales, respectively. However, energy saved in terms of daily maintenance by using fewer days to complete a longer migration resulted in only a 6-7% increase in total energetic cost.The results highlight that travelling further does not necessarily translate into an increase in total energy expenditure for migratory whales, since they can compensate for longer distance by travelling faster. Further research on the energetics of different whale populations could provide insight into the productivity of Southern Ocean feeding regions and help understand the environmental and anthropogenic effects on the whales' energy budgets.

TI  - A new analysis approach for long-term variations of forest loss, fragmentation, and degradation resulting from road-network expansion using Landsat time-series and object-based image analysis
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite facilitating transport by low-volume roads for multiple purposes, these roads also open corridors to the remote pristine forests and accelerate forest dynamics with deleterious consequences to the forest functionalities and indigenous inhabitants. We assessed the spatial variations of Hyrcanian forest loss, fragmentation, and degradation resulting from the expansion of rural, logging, and mine roads between 1966 and 2016 in northeast Iran. Various data were employed to generate a precise road network; the density of road segments was weighted on the basis of their carrying capacity during 1966-1986, 1986-2000, and 2000-2016. Three dimensions of forest changes were retrieved using the Landsat time-series and object-based image analysis. The spatial patterns of high rates of forest changes were clustered using spatial autocorrelation indicators. The spatial regression models were carried out to explore relationships between forest change and road expansion. The results showed that rural roads were upgraded but forest and mine roads remarkably expanded in recent decades. The spatial variations of forest-dynamic patterns have been changing from forest loss (1966-2000) to forest fragmentation and degradation (1986-2016). The high density of rural roads was significant on the high rates of forest loss and fragmentation during 1966-2000, and the expansion of forest and mine roads significantly intensified the rates of fragmentation and degradation during 1986-2016. Our findings suggest for mitigating destructive schemes over Hyrcanian forests, developing either protected areas or joining unprotected forests to the reserved areas should be prioritized.

TI  - Supra-glacial debris cover changes in the Greater Caucasus from 1986 to 2014
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of supra-glacial debris cover and its changes remain incomplete in the Greater Caucasus, in spite of recent glacier studies. Here we present data of supra-glacial debris cover for 659 glaciers across the Greater Caucasus based on Landsat and SPOT images from the years 1986, 2000 and 2014. We combined semi-automated methods for mapping the clean ice with manual digitization of debris-covered glacier parts and calculated supra-glacial debris-covered area as the residual between these two maps. The accuracy of the results was assessed by using high-resolution Google Earth imagery and GPS data for selected glaciers. From 1986 to 2014, the total glacier area decreased from 691.5 +/- 29.0 to 590.0 +/- 25.8 km(2) (15.8 +/- 4.1 %, or similar to 0.52 % yr(-1)), while the clean-ice area reduced from 643.2 +/- 25.9 to 511.0 +/- 20.9 km(2) (20.1 +/- 4.0 %, or similar to 0.73 % yr(-1)). In contrast supra-glacial debris cover increased from 7.0 +/- 6.4 %, or 48.3 +/- 3.1 km(2), in 1986 to 13.4 +/- 6.2 % (similar to 0.22 % yr(-1)), or 79.0 +/- 4.9 km(2), in 2014. Debris-free glaciers exhibited higher area and length reductions than debris-covered glaciers. The distribution of the supra-glacial debris cover differs between the northern and southern and between the western, central and eastern Greater Caucasus. The observed increase in supra-glacial debris cover is significantly stronger on the northern slopes. Overall, we have observed up-glacier average migration of supra-glacial debris cover from about 3015 to 3130 m a.s.l. (metres above sea level) during the investigated period.

TI  - Detection of Nonpalpable Tiny Axillary Lymph Nodes Surrounded by Adipose Tissue Using a Near-Infrared Camera
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is not always possible to detect nonpalpable small lymph nodes (LNs) surrounded by adipose tissue under the wavelength of visible light. A newly developed near-infrared camera with InGaAs element was able to capture photographs using light at >1000-nm wavelength, at which the difference in absorbance between water and lipids is large. This study investigated the ability to detect nonvisible small LNs using light at 1300-nm wavelength.Methods and Results: Following retrieval of LNs through axillary LN dissection from 20 patients with breast cancer, residual specimens were simultaneously photographed using light at 970-, 1070-, 1200-, 1300-, 1450-, and 1600-nm wavelengths. A total of 45 specimens were observed pathologically at the selected portions in which the 1300-nm light was absorbed (high absorbance group [HA group], n = 25) and those in which the 970-nm light was absorbed instead (low absorbance group [LA group], n = 20). All specimens categorized in the HA group detected the LNs, whereas none of those categorized in the LA group detected an LN. The sensitivity and specificity in the identification of an LN were 1.0. The LNs detected using this camera were significantly smaller than those detected by surgeons (3.00 +/- 2.93 mm vs. 5.90 +/- 3.91 mm, p < 0.01).Discussion: The light at 1300-nm wavelength was absorbed by axillary LNs. This camera detected LNs that were undetectable by surgeons. This novel technology may be applied to lymphatic microsurgery and contribute to the development of a minimally invasive LN dissection method.

TI  - Analog Site Experiment in the High Andes-Atacama Region: Surface Energy Budget Components on Ojos del Salado from Field Measurements and Weather Research and Forecasting Simulations
T2  - ASTROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are abundant, whereas surface in situ verification of atmospheric conditions is rare on Mars. Earth-based analogues could help gain an understanding of soil and atmospheric processes on Mars and refine existing models. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model against measurements from the Mars analogue High Andes-Atacama Desert. Validation focuses on the surface conditions, and on the surface energy budget. Measurements show that the average daily net radiation, global radiation, and latent heat flux amount to 131, 273, and about 10 W/m(2), respectively, indicating extremely dry atmospheric conditions. Dynamically, the effect of topography is also well simulated. One of the main modeling problems is the inaccurate initial soil and surface conditions in the area. Correction of soil moisture based on in situ and satellite soil moisture measurements, as well as the removal of snow coverage reduced the surface skin temperature root mean square error from 9.8 degrees C to 4.3 degrees C. The model, however, has shortcomings when soil condition modeling is considered. Sensible heat flux estimations are on par with the measurements (daily maxima around 500 W/m(2)), but surface soil heat flux is greatly overestimated (by 150-500 W/m(2)). Soil temperature and soil moisture diurnal variations are inconsistent with the measurements, partially due to the lack of water vapor representation in soil calculations.

TI  - Sidescan sonar meets airborne and satellite remote sensing: challenges of a multi-device seafloor classification in extreme shallow water intertidal environments
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal ecosystems like the Wadden Sea are particularly valuable for their ecological and economic importance. Here, the natural dynamics of the abiotic and biotic processes is threatened by the human pressure, and great efforts are made on mapping and monitoring programs. Remote sensing techniques (e.g., satellite and airborne sources) are commonly used on land and intertidal areas, whereas hydroacoustic devices are deployed in the subtidal zones. The overlap of hydroacoustics (sidescan sonar) and airborne Lidar data in such sensitive transitional zone (inter- to subtidal) is rather uncommon. In order to test the limitations of both techniques in extremely shallow waters (0.7 m min, water depth) and to find the most efficient methods for the spatial classification of intertidal areas, a portion of the backbarrier tidal flat of Norderney was investigated. Lidar bathymetric data were used for extracting high resolution morphological information. Sidescan sonar mosaics were collected in two following years under contrasting weather conditions. An expert classification based on sidescan sonar backscatter intensity, seafloor texture, morphology, and surface sediment data subdivided the research area into 10 classes. The outcomes were compared with an existing RapidEye-based classification. The tested methods showed both advantages and limitations, which were discussed based on statistical analyses. Satellite and Lidar approaches were most suitable for mapping biogenic features (e.g., shellfish beds) over large areas, whereas sidescan sonar was superior for detail detection and discrimination of morpho-sedimentary regions. As an outlook, it is postulated to perform ground-truthed hydroacoustic mapping on small testing areas, and to use the obtained classification for training satellite-based classification algorithms.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after perinatal sentinel events: less brain injury on MRI and improved neurodevelopmental outcome at 18-36 months
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To study the association between perinatal sentinel events (PSE) and brain MRI/neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Design This is a retrospective single-center study. Data collection included perinatal history, brain MRI, and neurodevelopmental outcome. Results Out of the 182 neonates, 53 (29%) neonates had PSE and 129 (71%) neonates did not have PSE. Neonates with PSE had more normal MRIs (76%) compared with neonates without PSE (55%), p = 0.01. PSE was associated with favorable motor (p = 0.02), language outcome (p = 0.03), and trend to better cognitive scores (p = 0.13). In PSE, favorable motor outcome persisted (OR for impairment 0.15 (0.003-0.84), p = 0.03) after adjusting for the degree of encephalopathy and brain MRI injury. Injury on brain MRI despite TH after PSE was associated with unfavorable neurodevelopmental outcome (p < 0.001). Conclusion Neonates with HIE receiving TH after PSE had less severe injury on brain MRI after rewarming, and improved motor and language outcomes at 18-36 months.

TI  - Magnetometer with nitrogen-vacancy center in a bulk diamond for detecting magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical applications
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a novel magnetometer that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond, to detect the magnetic field generated by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for biomedical applications. The compact probe system is integrated into a fiber-optics platform allowing for a compact design. To detect signals from the MNPs effectively, we demonstrated, for the first time, the application of an alternating current (AC) magnetic field generated by the excitation coil of several hundred microteslas for the magnetization of MNPs in diamond quantum sensing. In the lock-in detection system, the minimum detectable AC magnetic field (at a frequency of 1.025 kHz) was approximately 57.6 nT for one second measurement time. We were able to detect the micromolar concentration of MNPs at distances of a few millimeters. These results indicate that the magnetometer with the NV- centers can detect the tiny amounts of MNPs, thereby offering potential for future biomedical applications.

TI  - Response to resources and parasites depends on health status in extensively grazed sheep
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A fundamental question in animal ecology is how an individual's internal state and the external environment together shape species distributions across habitats. The increasing availability of biologgers is driving a revolution in answering this question in a wide range of species. In this study, the position of sheep (Ovis aries) from Global Positioning System collars was integrated with remote sensing data, field sampling of parasite distributions, and parasite load and health measures for each tagged individual. This allowed inter-individual variation in habitat use to be examined. Once controlling for a positive relationship between vegetation productivity and tick abundance, healthier individuals spent more of their time at sites with higher vegetation productivity, while less healthy individuals showed a stronger (negative) response to tick abundance. These trends are likely to represent a trade-off in foraging decisions that vary between individuals based on their health status. Given the rarity of studies that explore how animal distributions are affected by health and external factors, we demonstrate the value of integrating biologging technology with remote sensing data, traditional ecological sampling and individual measures of animal health. Our study, using extensively grazed sheep as a model system, opens new possibilities to study free-living grazing systems.

TI  - Using object-based image analysis with multi-temporal aerial imagery and LiDAR to detect change in temperate intertidal habitats
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal habitat maps are needed at both fine and coarse scales to monitor change and inform conservation and management, but current methods of field survey and expert interpretation of aerial imagery can be time-consuming and subjective. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) of remote sensing data is increasingly employed for producing habitat or land cover maps. Users create automated workflows to segment imagery, creating ecologically meaningful objects, which are then classified based on their spectral or geometric properties, relationships to other objects and contextual data.This study evaluates the change-detection capability of OBIA in the intertidal environment by developing and comparing two OBIA methods for quantifying change in extent and distribution of habitats from freely available multi-temporal aerial imagery and LiDAR data. Despite considerable variability in the data, pre- and post-classification change detection methods had sufficient accuracy (mean overall accuracy from 70.5 to 82.6%) to monitor deviation from a background level of natural environmental fluctuation.This insight into spatial and temporal patterns of natural cyclical change and their detectability by OBIA could inform use of remote sensing for regular, rapid coastal assessment, providing an alert system to direct survey resources to areas of ecologically relevant change.

TI  - Combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for improving above-ground biomass estimation
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground Biomass (AGB) represents the largest amount of biomass found on earth. Passive and active remote sensors have been a useful tool in estimating AGB for this purpose; nevertheless, both data sources suffer from saturation problems in dense vegetation. A combination of optical and radar data could potentially increase the accuracy of AGB estimation. In this study we evaluate the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for assessing AGB in a private forest in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Forty five sample plots of 20 m x 20 m were used as ground truth data. AGB correlated with Sentinel-1 backscatter and Sentinel-2 derived variables with R-2 = 0.34 and R-2 = 0.82, respectively; nevertheless, the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 yielded the highest accuracy (i.e., R-2 = 0.84). The results indicate that AGB in Yogyakarta is most accurately estimated based on the synergy of optical and radar satellite images.

TI  - Climate change perceptions, data, and adaptation in the Garhwal Himalayas of India
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan communities that depend on rain-fed agriculture are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we compare local perceptions of climate change from a household survey (n = 251) to climate data obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS 2.1) and MODIS Terra Snow Cover data product datasets. The study is situated in and around the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, which is located within the Garhwal Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. We found that a large majority of respondents perceive that rainfall is increasing and that snowfall is decreasing, while a smaller majority perceives an increase in summer temperatures and no change in winter temperatures. Agreeing with the perceptions of the majority, the climate data show an increase in summer temperature and winter rainfall. However, the climate data also show an increase in winter temperature, and no monotonic change in snowfall, findings which are contrary to the perception of the majority. Household perceptions of climate change were not associated with adaptation; while many households perceived change, very few reported that they were planning to adapt. To encourage adaptation, communities would benefit from locally appropriate climate data products, and collaboration on best practices with researchers, NGOs, and extension services.

TI  - Existential Threat Fuels Worldview Defense, but not after Priming Autonomy Orientation
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although mortality salience (MS) typically motivates worldview defensiveness, priming an autonomy/self-determined orientation may attenuate that defensiveness. In Study 1 (n = 156) MS (vs. pain) had higher support for militaristic defense of American interests abroad, unless participants were also primed with autonomy-oriented (vs. controlled) concepts. In Study 2 (n = 205), a pilot survey found participants were strongly aware of and interested in the cultural value of tolerance; MS (vs. neutral) had higher defense of that salient value in the form of support for more expansive/accepting immigration policy, unless participants were primed to recall autonomous/self-determined (vs. controlled) experiences. These findings bear implications for both aggressive and prosocial existential defenses, political ideology, and the intersection of existential defense and growth orientations.

TI  - Absolute and relative differential blood count predicts survival of AJCC stage I-II melanoma patients scheduled for sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objectives Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood is associated with poor overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy. However, the impact of peripheral blood cells in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is still unclear. This study was intended to characterize the impact of peripheral blood leukocytic cells on overall survival (OS) in melanoma patients undergoing SLNB.Methods A total of 1412 AJCC stage I-II melanoma patients scheduled for SLNB at a single institution in the period 2010-2015 with available perioperative blood tests were randomly assigned to two independent cohorts. Associations of peripheral blood leukocytes with OS were analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimator and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.Results NLR >4.26, absolute neutrophil count >5800/mu L, relative neutrophil count >69.7% and relative lymphocyte count <= 17.5% were significantly associated with reduced OS in both cohorts. Absolute monocytes >810/mu L, absolute eosinophils <= 200/mu L, relative monocytes >6.6%, relative eosinophils <= 2.7% and relative basophils <= 0.6% were significantly associated with reduced OS in one cohort each. On multivariate analysis, a combined score including absolute levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils was significantly associated with OS in both cohorts. The hazard ratio of patients with a risk score of 3-4 was 5.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.52-19.42, P = 0.0094) in cohort 1 and 9.42 (2.06-43.06, P = 0.0038) in cohort 2, respectively.Conclusions We conclude that peripheral blood leukocytes are independently associated with OS in stage I-II melanoma patients and should be considered as prognostic markers in these patients. Eosinophils and basophils deserve more attention in future investigations.

TI  - Alpine grassland plants grow earlier and faster but biomass remains unchanged over 35 years of climate change
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data indicate significant advancement in alpine spring phenology over decades of climate warming, but corresponding field evidence is scarce. It is also unknown whether this advancement results from an earlier shift of phenological events, or enhancement of plant growth under unchanged phenological pattern. By analyzing a 35-year dataset of seasonal biomass dynamics of a Tibetan alpine grassland, we show that climate change promoted both earlier phenology and faster growth, without changing annual biomass production. Biomass production increased in spring due to a warming-induced earlier onset of plant growth, but decreased in autumn due mainly to increased water stress. Plants grew faster but the fast-growing period shortened during the mid-growing season. These findings provide the first in situ evidence of long-term changes in growth patterns in alpine grassland plant communities, and suggest that earlier phenology and faster growth will jointly contribute to plant growth in a warming climate.

TI  - The major lightning regions and associated casualties over India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning, a climate-related highly localized natural phenomenon, claims lives and damage properties. These losses could only be reduced by the identification of active seasons and regions of lightning. The present study identifies and correlates the lightning-prone regions with the number of casualties reported over India at the state/union territory level. The seasonal and monthly composite satellite data of Lightning Imaging Sensor for the duration of 16 years (1998-2013) have been analyzed in this study for the identification of the major lightning-prone seasons and regions over India. The casualties due to lightning have also been estimated using data from Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India, National Crime Record Bureau report of India. The spatial distribution analysis reveals that lightning occurs mostly in hilly regions over India throughout the year (26 flash/sq. km/yr) and, however, causes lesser casualties because of the sparse population over the hilly terrain. The seasonal analysis reveals the most lightning phenomena occur during the pre-monsoon period (40-45 flash/sq. km/yr) over the northeast region of India. During the winter period, the lightning dominates over the northern parts of India such as Jammu and Kashmir. The state-wise casualties' study reveals that maximum casualties are reported in Madhya Pradesh (313 deaths), Maharashtra (281 deaths) and Orissa (255 deaths) on an average per annum. The favorable climatic conditions, such as availability of moisture content, unstable atmosphere and strong convection, cause severe cases of lightning over the regions of Orissa and Maharashtra.

TI  - Potential impacts of mining of super-thick coal seam on the local environment in arid Eastern Junggar coalfield, Xinjiang region, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining has serious impacts on local environment, including damage to the land and soil by subsidence, damage to ground-water systems through the fracturing and subsiding of overlying rocks, contamination of surface waters with acid mine drainage, and pollution of the atmosphere by release of toxic gases. The damage to ground water and its consequent impacts on the regional environment is the core of research of the coal mining from the perspective of environment protection. The present paper focuses on the changes of surface vegetation coverage, the pollutants released from pit coal power plants, and the damages to the ground aquifers induced by mining activities in arid Eastern Junggar coalfield of China. At first, the authors investigated the changes of surface vegetation coverage, since mining began in the 2000s using Landsat data. Results show that the low surface vegetation coverage (grade 1 plus grade 2) in the southern part of the region decreased from 11.62 x 10(8) m(2) in 2003 to 9.57 x 10(8) m(2) in 2017 (-17.6%), while it increased from 11.58 x 10(8) m(2) in 2003 to 12.70 x 10(8) m(2) in 2017 (+ 9.7%) in the eastern part. The high surface vegetation coverage (grade 3 plus grade 4) in the southern part increased from 1.94 x 10(8) m(2) in 2003 to 4.00 x 10(8) m(2) in 2017 (+ 106.2%), while it decreased from 4.39 x 10(8) m(2) in 2003 to 3.26 x 10(8) m(2) in 2017 (-25.74%) in the eastern part. The data of annual precipitation during the same period in this area show that the changes of surface vegetation coverage have less relationship with the annual precipitation, which indicates that the mining activities is probably the major factor for that. Second, a statistic of air pollutants generated from pit coal power plants was made based on data of references. Results show that the estimated gaseous pollutant emissions increased as 865.23 tons of smoke particles, 5940.73 tons of SO2, and 7584.48 tons of NO2 in 2013, which increased rapidly with 9.73 times the smoke particle, 21.69 times the SO2, and 9.24 times the NO2 than that of 2007. And then, the physical and numerical simulation of the damage of mining activities to aquifers was made to show the permeability of the reference points of overlying aquifers varies associated with mining activities. Results show that the porous rock matrix permeability has a negative relationship with fluctuation during mining, while the fracture permeability shows a positive one. Finally, a case investigation in southern area surrounding this coalfield was illustrated. Result shows that the local ground-water level decreased by 16 m difference from the altitude level of + 774 m in 2003 to + 758 m in 2013. Data and results from this study presented the already and the potential pollutions and damages to local environment induced by the mining activities in this region.

TI  - Assessing seasonal and long-term mangrove canopy variations in Sinaloa, northwest Mexico, based on time series of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring is currently a strategy used to preserve this important coastal vegetation type. However, the temporal resolution of most satellite imagery limits the analysis of seasonal changes. Here, seasonal trend analysis (STA) was performed using an enhanced vegetation index (EVI) monthly time series (2005-2016) edited from MOD13Q1 products (MODIS Terra), to detect changes in mangrove cover in Sinaloa State in northwestern Mexico. The results were compared with a baseline map derived from a post-classification comparison of two mangrove distribution maps of 2005 and 2015. The STA procedure enabled the identification of mangrove canopy seasonal cycles, with open canopies between May and July and closed canopies from August to October. It was also possible to detect annual and long-term changes in canopy, with positive trends observed in most of Sinaloa's mangrove ecosystems, which partially agree with the post-classification comparison results. Despite their coarse resolution, using the MODIS EVI products proved to be useful to confidently detect short- and long-term changes in mangrove cover, particularly in large ecosystems. Consequently, land use change analyses using these inputs could help to take actions related to mangrove cover management, considering the trends of change in this vegetation type.

TI  - Synergic Use of Multi-Sensor Satellite Data for Volcanic Hazards Monitoring: The Fogo (Cape Verde) 2014-2015 Effusive Eruption
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring volcanic eruptions provides key information for hazard assessment and its time evolution. Satellite remote sensing data are nowadays essential to perform such task, thanks to their capability to survey disastrous events also in remote and under-monitored regions, with frequent revisit time and accurate spatial resolution. Even though satellite imageries are presently used to analyze several phenomena related to eruptions, automatic methods and synergic exploitation of different sensors are rarely considered. In this work, we have analyzed satellite images coming from both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors, to study the effusive eruption of Fogo volcano, Cape Verde, which took place between November 2014 and January 2015. In particular, we have exploited multi-sensor images from Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, Landsat-8, and Earth-Observing-1 missions, to retrieve lava flow patterns and volcanic source parameters related to the eruption. The main outcome of our work is the application of a new automatic change detection technique for estimating the lava field and its temporal evolution, combining the SAR intensity and the interferometric SAR coherence. The innovative algorithm is able to take full advantage of the Sentinel-1 mission's 6-day repeat cycle. Such data are here used for the first time for lava mapping, thereby providing an unprecedented example of using the multi-temporal interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence to automatically monitor lava flow evolution in emergency phase. This new technique, jointly used with optical satellite images, is capable of resolving with spatial and temporal detail the evolution of lava flows. We have also performed differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) to map the ground deformation and retrieve the feeding dyke by inverting syn-eruptive signals. Results from source modeling show a SW-NE oriented dyke, located inside Cha das Caldeiras, SW of the Pico do Fogo. Our work highlights how multidisciplinary and satellite open data, along with innovative and automatic processing techniques, may be adopted for real-time hazard estimates in an operational environment.

TI  - Mapping the extent and methods of small-scale emerald mining in the Panjshir Valley, Afghanistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerald mining in the Panjshir Valley, Afghanistan, has occurred for thousands of years, yet few records exist documenting the detailed spatial extent, techniques, or productivity of small-scale miners. This study proposes new methods to map and monitor the extent and changes in small-scale mining in remote and inaccessible terrain by integrating multispectral remote sensing analysis with archival geologic data and three-dimensional topographic change detection to examine emerald deposit zones and mining activity in the Panjshir Valley. Specifically, previously mapped geologic units known to host emeralds were re-analyzed using Landsat multispectral analysis to investigate the potential distribution of mining activity. Interpretation of very fine-resolution satellite imagery showed that mining activity is becoming more concentrated and transitioning from traditional tunneling methods to mechanized surface excavation. Finally, topographic change analysis of mechanized mine sites was combined with archival grade data to estimate production and consider improved recovery methods by small-scale miners.

TI  - Analysis of the Drug Resistance of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> in the China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Trial Program, 2007-2018
T2  - MICROBIAL DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the drug resistance data of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) collected in 19 tertiary hospitals in the China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Trial Program from 2007 to 2018.Methods: According to the unified plan, clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected from 19 tertiary hospitals in 19 cities in mainland China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by a twofold agar dilution method, and antimicrobial susceptibility was established. The isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and their drug resistance data were analyzed.Results: In total, 302 strains of CRKP were screened from 3,671 strains of K. pneumoniae. The clinical isolation rate of CRKP increased from 0.9% to 19.9% in the past 12 years, and the isolation rate of CRKP in pediatric patients increased the fastest, to 24.7%. Along this period, the isolation rate in the intensive care unit was higher than that in other settings. The number of CRKP strains with imipenem and meropenem MIC <= 8 mg/L decreased from 63.6% to 11.7% and from 72.7% to 14.2%, respectively. Resistance to drugs that may be used to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections has increased to varying degrees, and CRKP has the lowest resistance rate to polymyxin B (<19.0%).Conclusion: Because the MIC of CRKP is increasing each year in China, carbapenems are less likely to be used as part of combined therapy to treat CRKP infections. It is difficult to obtain good therapeutic effects against CRKP infections with MICs that are too high. CRKP is still the most sensitive to polymyxin B in vitro, followed by tigecycline. Combination therapy may be the most effective current treatment for CRKP infection.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the long-term outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for head and neck cutaneous melanoma (HNCM).Study DesignRetrospective cohort study.SettingTertiary academic medical center.Subjects and MethodsLongitudinal review of a 356-patient cohort with HNCM undergoing SLNB from 1997 to 2007.ResultsDescriptive characteristics included the following: age, 53.5 +/- 19 years (mean +/- SD); sex, 26.8% female; median follow-up, 4.9 years; and Breslow depth, 2.52 +/- 1.87 mm. Overall, 75 (21.1%) patients had a positive SLNB. Among patients undergoing completion lymph node dissection following positive SLNB, 20 (27.4%) had at least 1 additional positive nonsentinel lymph node. Eighteen patients with local control and negative SLNB developed regional disease, indicating a false omission rate of 6.4%, including 10 recurrences in previously unsampled basins. Ten-year overall survival (OS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were significantly greater in the negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) cohort (OS, 61% [95% CI, 0.549-0.677]; MSS, 81.9% [95% CI, 0.769-0.873]) than the positive SLN cohort (OS, 31% [95% CI, 0.162-0.677]; MSS, 60.3% [95% CI, 0.464-0.785]) and positive SLN/positive nonsentinel lymph node cohort (OS, 8.4% [95% CI, 0.015-0.474]; MSS, 9.6% [95% CI, 0.017-0.536]). OS was significantly associated with SLN positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 2.39; P < .01), immunosuppression (HR, 2.37; P < .01), angiolymphatic invasion (HR, 1.91; P < .01), and ulceration (HR, 1.86; P < .01). SLN positivity (HR, 3.13; P < .01), angiolymphatic invasion (HR, 3.19; P < .01), and number of mitoses (P = .0002) were significantly associated with MSS. Immunosuppression (HR, 3.01; P < .01) and SLN status (HR, 2.84; P < .01) were associated with recurrence-free survival, and immunosuppression was the only factor significantly associated with regional recurrence (HR, 6.59; P < .01).ConclusionsLong-term follow up indicates that SLNB showcases durable accuracy, safety, and prognostic importance for cutaneous HNCM.

TI  - ICG-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling during Robotic Retroauricular Neck Dissection in cN0 Oral Cancer
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we sought to evaluate the clinical feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG)-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling during robotic retroauricular neck dissection (RAND) in patients with cN0 oral cancer. Nine adult patients diagnosed with T1 to T2 oral squamous cell carcinoma were consecutively recruited. All of them underwent transoral partial glossectomy and robotic RAND (levels I-III) simultaneously. Twelve hours prior to surgery, ICG was injected into the 4 quadrants around primary tongue tumors. During robotic RAND, intraoperative and ex vivo ICG-stained LNs were identified using the Firefly system and examined for the presence of fluorescence. ICG-stained LNs were identified in all patients. Thirty-one ICG-stained LNs were detected in 313 retrieved LNs (9.9%). Occult metastases were detected among the ICG-stained LNs in 2 patients (22.2%). There was no metastasis identified in the ICG-unstained LNs. Upstaging rates, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of ICG-guided SLN sampling were 22.2%, 100%, 91.5%, and 100%, respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the application of nanocarbon in surgical endoscopy in patients with thyroid cancer for the clinical tracing of level VI sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and for parathyroid gland protection.Materials and Methods: Ninety-three patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) who underwent an endoscopic thyroid cancer operation were included. We randomly divided these patients into a control group (n = 42) and a nanocarbon group (n = 51). For the nanocarbon group, after thyroid exposure, nanocarbon was injected into the thyroid gland, and the SLNs were resected and subjected to frozen sectioning and routine pathological examination. In addition, the postoperative calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels of both groups were analyzed to compare the features of the nanocarbon application.Results: The number of central lymph (level VI) nodes dissected and the number of metastatic lymph nodes identified were analyzed in both groups. The number of dissected lymph nodes from both unilateral and bilateral thyroid surgeries was significantly larger in the nanocarbon group than in the control group. At the same time, the number of identified metastasis lymph nodes dissected were higher in the nanocarbon group than in the control group. We assessed the postoperative calcium and PTH level to evaluate the parathyroid function. Our results show that the nanocarbon group had a better protective effect on parathyroid function than the control group.Conclusions: As a lymph node trace agent, nanocarbon could better evaluate and permit a more clear lymph dissection for patients with PTC. Nanocarbon contributes to a decrease in the incidence rate of parathyroid damage, which has great clinical value.

TI  - Temporal and source assessments of organic and elemental carbon at sites in the northern South African interior
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) can affect climate, air quality, human health, acid deposition and visibility, and contain a significant fraction of organic (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). Southern Africa is an important source region for OC and EC, however, little OC and EC data have been published for this region. This paper presents a multi-year, multi-site (an urban-industrial site in the Vaal Triangle, UI-VT; an industrially influenced site at Amerfoort, iI-AF; and two regional background sites at Skukuza and Louis Trichardt, RR-SK and RR-LT) PM with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) OC and EC dataset for South Africa. The median OC (9.3) and EC (3.2 mu g.m(-3)) concentrations at UI-VT were 1.3 to 2.5 and 2.7 to 4.4 times higher, if compared to the other sites. OC/EC ratios indicated that sources in close proximity to UI-VT were likely the main contributors, while sources that are more distant contributed fractionally more at the other sites. Household combustion for space heating and regional open biomass burning contributed to elevated levels during the cold and dry months at UI-VT. Regional open biomass burning also lead to higher OC and EC concentrations during the dry season at the industrially influenced site (iI-AF) and one of the regional background sites (RR-SK). From the seasonal concentration patterns, it seemed as if household combustion for space heating also contributed at these two sites during the cold months, but this could not be proven, even if only samples with limited influence of open biomass burning were considered. Such biomass burning influences were semi-quantified by considering MODIS fire pixels occurring within the air mass fetch region for each sample. For the remaining regional background site (RR-LT) the results suggesed that only regional open biomass burning contributed to elevated levels of OC and EC in the dry season and that household combustion for space heating did not contribute significantly.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lymph node metastasis is a significant predictive factor for disease recurrence and survival in cervical cancer patients and relevant for therapeutic strategies. We evaluated the clinical value of indocyanine green (ICG) by measuring the sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node mapping compared with the gold standard of complete lymphadenectomy in detecting lymph node metastases for cervical cancer. Methods We utilized the near-infrared imaging agent ICG to detect tumor-infested lymph nodes in the pelvis analogue to a classical sentinel lymph node procedure by analyzing data from 20 patients who had undergone surgery for cervical cancer at our institution. A laparoscopic lymph node mapping procedure by means of ICG, followed by a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without paraaortic lymphadenectomy was done in all patients. Results Histological examination identified seven patients with tumor-positive pelvic nodes, whereas mapping with ICG identified only five of these patients. Detection rate of positive nodes by ICG mapping and false negative rate was 71.4% and 28.6%, respectively; bilateral detection rate was 83.3%. One of the two false negative patients additionally suffered from deep infiltrating endometriosis. Conclusions Our results indicate that ICG can identify the relevant pelvic nodes independent of tumor size, provided bilateral detection is achieved and additional, related diseases are excluded.

TI  - Combating drug shortages in China: surveillance warning and practice standardization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Like other countries, China has been experiencing drug shortages during the past years, including drugs on the National Essential Medicine List and emergency drugs. Drug shortages have raised public concerns in China and have severe impacts on all stakeholders in the supply chain, especially patients and hospitals. Recently, Chinese governments have ramped up several measures to ensure a steady supply of essential and first-aid drugs. In this commentary, we share our experiences of addressing drug shortages at Hunan Province, central China. We focus on the establishment of a provincial drug shortage monitoring center, and the Center's efforts to standardize practices on the management of drug shortages and identify therapeutic alternatives for drugs in short supply based on international best practices.

TI  - Algal growth and weathering crust state drive variability in western Greenland Ice Sheet ice albedo
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the primary controls upon the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is albedo, a measure of how much solar radiation that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed. Lower-albedo snow and ice surfaces therefore warm more quickly. There is a major difference in the albedo of snow-covered versus bare-ice surfaces, but observations also show that there is substantial spatio-temporal variability of up to similar to 0.4 in bare-ice albedo. Variability in bare-ice albedo has been attributed to a number of processes including the accumulation of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) and the changing physical properties of the near-surface ice. However, the combined impact of these processes upon albedo remains poorly constrained. Here we use field observations to show that pigmented glacier algae are ubiquitous and cause surface darkening both within and outside the south-west GrIS "dark zone" but that other factors including modification of the ice surface by algal bloom presence, surface topography and weathering crust state are also important in determining patterns of daily albedo variability. We further use observations from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to examine the scale gap in albedo between ground versus remotely sensed measurements made by Sentinel-2 (S-2) and MODIS. S-2 observations provide a highly conservative estimate of algal bloom presence because algal blooms occur in patches much smaller than the ground resolution of S-2 data. Nevertheless, the bare-ice albedo distribution at the scale of 20mx20m S-2 pixels is generally unimodal and unskewed. Conversely, bare-ice surfaces have a left-skewed albedo distribution at MODIS MOD10A1 scales. Thus, when MOD10A1 observations are used as input to energy balance modelling, meltwater production can be underestimated by similar to 2 %. Our study highlights that (1) the impact of the weathering crust state is of similar importance to the direct darkening role of light-absorbing impurities upon ice albedo and (2) there is a spatial-scale dependency in albedo measurement which reduces detection of real changes at coarser resolutions.

T2  - RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI
M3  - Article
AB  - The peculiar features of the Mediterranean Sea in terms of both gravity variations and geodynamic complexities resulted in a wide range of studies and research projects during the last decades focusing on the modeling of static and dynamic processes of this almost closed sea basin. The scope of the present study is twofold. The first part shall provide a synopsis of the data and methods used and the results achieved for geoid determination in the first phase of the GEOMED project (GEOid in the MEDiterranean) in the early 90s. The second part focuses on the recent activities and improvements of the continuation of the previous research in the framework of the GEOMED-2 project which is still an ongoing work. The collection of all available surface and satellite data towards the creation of improved gravity databases and the computation of marine geoid models are discussed. The crucial role of global geopotential models and digital topography and bathymetry is analyzed, focusing on the efficient modeling of the low and high frequencies of the gravity signal. The numerical methodology is discussed in the context of the available data sets and computer facilities over the duration of GEOMED. Finally, gravity databases and geoid models for the whole test area are presented and evaluated for both phases of the project. Some recommendations are also drawn along with a discussion on new methodological tools for the implementation of new data sources, targeting to the future improvement of gravity field over the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Ocean sentinel albatrosses locate illegal vessels and provide the first estimate of the extent of nondeclared fishing
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With threats to nature becoming increasingly prominent, in order for biodiversity levels to persist, there is a critical need to improve implementation of conservation measures. In the oceans, the surveillance of fisheries is complex and inadequate, such that quantifying and locating nondeclared and illegal fisheries is persistently problematic. Given that these activities dramatically impact oceanic ecosystems, through overexploitation of fish stocks and bycatch of threatened species, innovative ways to monitor the oceans are urgently required. Here, we describe a concept of "Ocean Sentinel" using animals equipped with state-of-the-art loggers which monitor fisheries in remote areas. Albatrosses fitted with loggers detecting and locating the presence of vessels and transmitting the information immediately to authorities allowed an estimation of the proportion of nondeclared fishing vessels operating in national and international waters of the Southern Ocean. We found that in international waters, more than one-third of vessels had no Automatic Identification System operating; in national Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), this proportion was lower on average, but variable according to EEZ. Ocean Sentinel was also able to provide unpreceded information on the attraction of seabirds to vessels, giving access to crucial information for risk-assessment plans of threatened species. Attraction differed between species, age, and vessel activity. Fishing vessels attracted more birds than other vessels, and juveniles both encountered fewer vessels and showed a lower attraction to vessels than adults. This study shows that the development of technologies offers the potential of implementing conservation policies by using wide-ranging seabirds to patrol oceans.

TI  - Challenges in early phase of implementing the 1-3-7 surveillance and response approach in malaria elimination setting: A field study from Myanmar
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe National Plan for Malaria Elimination (NPME) in Myanmar (2016-2030) aims to eliminate indigenous Plasmodium falciparum malaria in six states/regions of low endemicity by 2020 and countrywide by 2030. To achieve this goal, in 2016 the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) implemented the "1-3-7" surveillance and response strategy. This study aims to identify the barriers to successful implementation of the NPME which emerged during the early phase of the "1-3-7" approach deployment.MethodsA mixed-methods study was conducted with basic health staff (BHS) and Vector Born Disease Control Program (VBDC) staff between 2017 and 2018 in six townships of six states/regions targeted for sub-national elimination by 2020. A self-administered questionnaire, designed to assess the knowledge required to implement the "1-3-7" approach, was completed by 544 respondents. Bivariate analysis was performed for quantitative findings and thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative findings using Atals.ti software.ResultsAlthough 83% of participants reported performing the key activities in the "1-3-7" surveillance and response approach, less than half could report performing those activities within 3days and 7days (40 and 43%, respectively). Low proportion of BHS correctly identified six categories of malaria cases and three types of foci (22 and 26%, respectively). In contrast, nearly 80% of respondents correctly named three types of case detection methods. Most cited challenges included 'low community knowledge on health' (43%), 'inadequate supplies' (22%), and 'transportation difficulty' (21%). Qualitative data identified poor knowledge of key surveillance activities, delays in reporting, and differences in reporting systems as the primary challenges. The dominant perceived barrier to success was inability to control the influx of migrant workers into target jurisdictions especially in hard-to-reach areas. Interviews with township medical officers and the NMCP team leaders further highlighted the necessity of refresher training for every step in the "1-3-7" surveillance and response approach.ConclusionsThe performance of the "1-3-7" surveillance and response approach in Myanmar delivers promising results. However, numerous challenges are likely to slow down malaria elimination progress in accordance with the NPME. Multi-stakeholder engagement and health system readiness is critical for malaria elimination at the sub-national level.

TI  - Multi-temporal remote sensing data to monitor terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate variations in Ghana
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational monitoring of vegetation and its response to climate change involves the use of vegetation indices (VIs) in relation to relevant climatic data. This study analyses the temporal variations of vegetation indices in response to climatic data (temperature and precipitation) to better understand the phenological changes in the Wa-West and Tolon districts of Ghana during 1999-2011. This study also examines the inter-annual variation of vegetation indices and lag effects of climate variables (temperature and precipitation) using simple regression and correlation approaches. Results indicate that the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) were significantly correlated with the mean temperature, whereby the value of NDVI increases with a decrease in temperature and value of NDSI increases with an increase in temperature. On examining seasonal variations, our findings indicated that the months of August and September have the highest mean NDVI values. This study confirms that consistently rising temperature and altered precipitation patterns have exerted a strong influence on temporal distributions and productivities of the terrestrial ecosystems of the Tolon and Wa-West districts of Ghana. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how vegetation indices can be used as an indicator to monitor phenological changes in the terrestrial ecosystem.

TI  - Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP) of Behavioral Health (BH) Problems: Engagement Factors Predicting Subsequent Service Utilization
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to 1) better understand patterns of utilization of Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP) Programs and Services in the State of Connecticut by adult Medicaid recipients experiencing a serious mental illness, substance use disorder, or co-occurring disorders; and 2) to determine the relationship between the duration of an IOP episode and connection to care rates for higher (i.e., rehospitalization) or lower levels of care following discharge. We hypothesized that the duration of an IOP episode would impact positively in reducing the use of higher levels of care while increasing the use of lower levels of care. In order to examine the frequency and duration of use of Intensive Outpatient (IOP) services by the CT Medicaid population, a two-year timeframe was selected: July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2014. A survival analysis was conducted to assess the risk of readmission to an IOP within 180 days based on demographic and utilization factors including, Age (in years on date of discharge), Race and Ethnicity, Gender, Homeless Status (at least one day in CY 2013), and Engagement Group (Intent to Treat, Early Termination, Minimally Adequate Dosage, & Target or More). To better understand the patterns of utilization associated with Adult IOP services, the average length of stay, number of treatment days, and average number of treatment days per week were explored. The number of unique individuals who were part of this analysis is 11,473, of which 2050 were mental health IOP utilizers (18%), 4598 were co-occurring IOP utilizers (40%), and 4825 (42%) were substance use IOP utilizers. For the total population, the average length of stay (ALOS) in days was 42 and the average number of treatment days attended per week was 2.5, for an average of 15 treatment days per episode of care. Among the IOP Cohorts, the Mental Health Cohort had the longest ALOS at 44.15 days, an average of 2.34 days of service per week, for an average of 14.76 days of IOP service per episode of care. The Substance Use Cohort had the shortest ALOS at 41.33 days, but had the highest intensity of services per week at 2.71 for an average of 16 days of service per episode of care. The Co-Occurring Cohort presented an ALOS of 41.74 days, an average of 2.32 services per week and an average of 13.83 sessions per episode. Overall there is evidence supporting an association between the number of days of care and protection from hospitalization, up to a certain number of days of care or number of days in IOP. Above the Minimally Adequate Dosage, the IOP protection factor seems to reach a plateau. This means that after 16 days of care, the chances of hospitalization remain the same regardless of the additional days provided.

TI  - Improving multi-technique monitoring using Sentinel-1 and Cosmo-SkyMed data and upgrading groundwater model capabilities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquifer-systems have become a strategic source of fresh water in the present climatic conditions, especially under stress in arid regions like the Iberian Mediterranean Arc. Understanding the behavior of groundwater reservoirs is crucial to their well-management and mitigation of adverse consequences of overexploitation. In this work, we use space geodetic measurements from satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, covering the period 2011-2017, to predict and validate the ground surface displacement over the fastest subsiding basin due to groundwater withdrawal in Europe (>10 cm/year). The 2D decomposition of InSAR displacements from Cosmo-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 satellites allows us to detect horizontal deformation towards the basin center, with a maximum displacement of 1.5 cm/year. InSAR results were introduced in a newly developed methodology for aquifer system management to estimate unknown pumping rates for the 2012-2017 period. This study illustrates how the combination of InSAR data, groundwater flow and deformation models can be used to improve the aquifer-systems sustainable management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A spatially explicit database of wind disturbances in European forests over the period 2000-2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Strong winds may uproot and break trees and represent a major natural disturbance for European forests. Wind disturbances have intensified over the last decades globally and are expected to further rise in view of the effects of climate change. Despite the importance of such natural disturbances, there are currently no spatially explicit databases of wind-related impact at a pan-European scale. Here, we present a new database of wind disturbances in European forests (FORWIND). FORWIND is comprised of more than 80 000 spatially delineated areas in Europe that were disturbed by wind in the period 2000-2018 and describes them in a harmonized and consistent geographical vector format. The database includes all major windstorms that occurred over the observational period (e.g. Gudrun, Kyrill, Klaus, Xynthia and Vaia) and represents approximately 30% of the reported damaging wind events in Europe. Correlation analyses between the areas in FORWIND and land cover changes retrieved from the Landsat-based Global Forest Change dataset and the MODIS Global Disturbance Index corroborate the robustness of FORWIND. Spearman rank coefficients range between 0.27 and 0.48 (p value < 0.05). When recorded forest areas are rescaled based on their damage degree, correlation increases to 0.54. Wind-damaged growing stock volumes reported in national inventories (FORESTORM dataset) are generally higher than analogous metrics provided by FORWIND in combination with satellite-based biomass and country-scale statistics of growing stock volume. The potential of FORWIND is explored for a range of challenging topics and scientific fields, including scaling relations of wind damage, forest vulnerability modelling, remote sensing monitoring of forest disturbance, representation of uprooting and breakage of trees in large-scale land surface models, and hydrogeological risks following wind damage. Overall, FORWIND represents an essential and open-access spatial source that can be used to improve the understanding, detection and prediction of wind disturbances and the consequent impacts on forest ecosystems and the land-atmosphere system. Data sharing is encouraged in order to continuously update and improve FORWIND.

TI  - Retrieval of Fine Mode Aerosol Optical Depth Based on Satellite Polarization Remote Sensing
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine mode aerosol optical depth in Xianghc was calculated, using data from the onboard multi-angle polarization sensor POLDER-3 in the PARASOL satellite. The retrieval results were compared with the operational products of POLDER, MOMS, and AERONET data. The results show that the accuracy of POLDER using polarization remote sensing is significantly better than that of unpolarized MOMS. The correlation coefficient is increased from 0.67 to 0. 93, and the average error is reduced from 0. 32 to 0. 15. As combined with the neural network (NN) method, the method gave correlation coefficient of 0.94 and standard deviation of only 0. 11 . Then, NN was applied to Hangzhou and Hong Kong, respectively. The verification results show that it has similar accuracy in Hangzhou but poor applicability in Hong Kong. The research shows it is feasible to use the NN to extract fine mode aerosol information from polarized signals.

TI  - Introducing the 4.4 km spatial resolution Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has been operational on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite since early 2000, creating an extensive data set of global Earth observations. Here we introduce the latest version of the MISR aerosol products. The level 2 (swath) product, which is reported on a 4.4 km spatial grid, is designated as version 23 (V23) and contains retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol particle property information derived from MISR's multi-angle observations over both land and water. The changes from the previous version of the algorithm (V22) have significant impacts on the data product and its interpretation. The V23 data set is created from two separate retrieval algorithms that are applied over dark water and land surfaces, respectively. Besides increasing the horizontal resolution to 4.4 km compared with the coarser 17.6m resolution in V22 and streamlining the format and content, the V23 product has added geolocation information, pixel-level uncertainty estimates, and improved cloud screening. MISR data can be obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Science Data Center at https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/misr_table (last access: 11 October 2019). The version number for the V23 level 2 aerosol product is F13_0023. The level 3 (gridded) aerosol product is still reported at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees spatial resolution with results aggregated from the higher-resolution level 2 data. The format and content at level 3 have also been updated to reflect the changes made at level 2. The level 3 product associated with the V23 level 2 product version is designated as F15_0032. Both the level 2 and level 3 products are now provided in NetCDF format.

TI  - Artificial intelligence based approaches to evaluate actual evapotranspiration in wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are extraordinary ecosystems and important climate regulators that also contribute to reduce natural disaster risk. Unfortunately, wetlands are declining much faster than forests. The safeguarding of the wetlands also needs knowledge of the dynamics that control the water balance of these environments. Therefore, an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration in wetlands is an essential task.When adequate experimental data are available, some algorithms deriving from Artificial Intelligence research represent a promising alternative to the most common estimation techniques.In this study, starting from daily measurements of climatic variables such as net solar radiation, depth to water, wind speed, mean relative humidity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean temperature, using the Random Forest, Additive Regression of Decision Stump, Multilayer Perceptron and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, 24 estimation models, different in input variables, have been developed and compared. The data have been provided by USGS. They have been obtained from a measuring site in wetlands of Indian River County, Florida using the eddy-covariance technique.The accuracy of these models based on AI algorithms remains good even if the number of input variables is reduced from 7 to 3. Net solar radiation, mean temperature and mean relative humidity or wind speed measurements allow obtaining a sufficiently accurate estimation model. Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors provide slightly better performance than Additive Regression of Decision Stump and Multilayer Perceptron. The analyzed models show in most cases the lowest accuracy in the range 2-4 mm/day, while the highest accuracy is obtained in the ranges 0-2 mm/day and 6-8 mm/day, with the exception of the models based on the Additive Regression, which show similar levels of accuracy in the different considered sub-intervals.

TI  - Multi-temporal reconstruction of long-term changes in land cover in and around the Swartkops River Estuary, Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-date remotely sensed images comprising Landsat TM images of 1984, 1993 and 2003 and, Landsat OLI images of 2013 were used to reconstruct long-term changes in land cover in the Swartkops River Estuary by mapping changes in vegetation distribution over a period of 30 years between 1984 and 2013. These images were complemented by high-resolution near-anniversary aerial photographs that were used as ancillary sources of ground truth during supervised classification of the Landsat images. Results of our investigation point to human-induced loss of biodiversity due to persistent encroachment of different development activities on terrestrial vegetation, substantial expansion of the salt marsh due to climate change-driven relative sea level rise and persistent increase in keystone salt marsh vegetation species notably Zostera capensis and Spartina maritima due to the combined influence of human-induced nutrient loading into estuarine water and relative sea level rise. These observations argue for the immediate need to embrace appropriately informed management interventions in order to enhance the sustainability of salt marsh ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations.

TI  - H3K27me3 and EZH2 expression in melanoma: relevance for melanoma progression and response to immune checkpoint blockade
T2  - CLINICAL EPIGENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Upregulation of the histone methyltransferase enzyme EZH2 and its histone modification H3K27me3 has been linked to melanoma progression, metastasis, and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). In clinical trials, EZH2 inhibitors are currently tested to overcome resistance to ICB. The aim of this study is to evaluate expression patterns and the predictive value of H3K27me3 and EZH2 in metastatic melanoma samples prior to ICB. As H3K27me3 expression has been associated with a dedifferentiated, invasive melanoma phenotype, we also investigated the prognostic value of H3K27me3 expression in primary melanomas. Results H3K27me3 and EZH2 expression were evaluated in a cohort of 44 metastatic melanoma samples before ICB using immunohistochemistry (IHC). 29/44 (66%) of melanomas showed H3K27me3 expression, and 6/44 (14%) showed EZH2 expression. No predictive value for therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 therapy could be found for H3K27me3 or EZH2 expression on melanoma cells. To investigate the prognostic significance of H3K27me3, we analyzed H3K27me3 expression in a representative cohort of 136 primary melanomas with known sentinel lymph node status. H3K27me3 expression is associated with increased tumor thickness and nodal involvement. Melanoma metastases showed a higher expression of H3K27me3 in comparison to primary melanomas. In human melanoma cell lines, TNF alpha and INF gamma could not induce H3K27me3 expression. Conclusion Our study shows that H3K27me3 expression is more frequent than EZH2 and is associated with a more invasive and metastatic melanoma cell phenotype. We suggest that H3K27me3 expression by IHC might be a suitable method to evaluate the activity of EZH2 inhibitors in clinical trials.

TI  - Satellite-derived mapping of kelp distribution and water optics in the glacier impacted Yendegaia Fjord (Beagle Channel, Southern Chilean Patagonia)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is a brown alga with extensive global distribution, however, recent evidence suggests that its dynamics presents high degree of regional variability. In southern Chilean fjord region, largely unexplored kelp forests are currently being threatened by global change and human impacts. High-resolution satellite (Sentinel-2) imagery was used to describe temporal and spatial distribution patterns of kelp beds in Yendegaia Fjord (Beagle Channel) using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), and to characterize water optical gradients of this habitat strongly influenced by river runoff from a melting glacier. The suitability of SMA for kelp classification was contrasted with other vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, FAI). Validation was made using drone aerial photographs of kelp canopies. Different analysis tools resulted in up to 35% difference in kelp coverage estimation. The overall accuracy (66-82%) of kelp classification followed an order FAI < EVI < NDVI < SMA. Omission error of SMA and lower coincidence with vegetation indices occurred in pixels with low kelp pixel abundance (<0.50). Based on SMA, the lowest kelp abundance was observed in the river mouth with high turbidity, increasing towards the Beagle Channel. The highest kelp abundance was observed in late summer, but otherwise no clear seasonal patterns could be observed. Water turbidity presented both spatial and seasonal variation. Strong particle sedimentation (leading to light attenuation, interference with remote detection of kelps, and even to their detachment due to substrate quality) and tidal fluctuations in glacier-impacted fjord-type environments can be identified as key features affecting both the kelp population dynamics as well as their remote sensing. Also, low sun elevation at high latitudes in midwinter produces uncertainties in image analyses. In all, the remote sensing approach used in the present study can be regarded as a useful tool to map and monitor kelps forests from a remote region. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nomogram-based estimate of axillary nodal involvement in ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance): validation and association with radiation protocol variations
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose A substantial proportion of patients enrolled on ACOSOG Z0011 received protocol-deviant radiation treatment. It is currently unknown whether these deviations involved the use of more extensive fields in patients at higher nomogram-predicted risk. Methods We used the M.D. Anderson (MDA) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering (MSK) nomograms to estimate risk of additional positive axillary nodes using surgical pathology information. In the control arm, we compared axillary dissection (AD) findings to nomogram-predicted estimates for validation. We used logistic regression to evaluate whether nomogram-estimated higher risk of nodal involvement was associated with high tangent (HT) or supraclavicular (SCV) radiation fields for patients with known radiation field design. Results 552/856 (64.5%) had complete details for the MDA nomogram. Mean MDA risk estimate in both treatment arms was 23.8%. Estimated risk for patients on the AD arm with positive nodes was 25.9%. Higher risk estimate was associated with additional positive nodes in the AD arm (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, p < 0.0001). We observed significant association with higher MDA nomogram-estimated risk and SCV radiation (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10, p < 0.0001) but not HT (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96-1.02, p = 0.52) The MSK nomogram had similar associations. Conclusion MDA and MSK nomogram risk estimates were associated with lymph node risk in ACOSOG Z0011. Radiation oncologists' use of differing radiation fields were associated with treating higher risk patients. ClinicalTrials.gov id: NCT00003854.

TI  - Water and sediment act as reservoirs for microbial taxa associated with invasive dreissenid mussels
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are invasive, filter-feeding, bivalves that have disrupted the ecology of thousands of freshwater biomes across North America. Due to their efficient filter-feeding activity, zebra mussels (ZMs) and other bivalves are extensively used to detect chemical contamination in waterways. In this study, we evaluated whether water and sediment serve as major sources of ZM tissue-associated microbiota, and whether ZMs serve as a reservoir for potentially pathogenic microbes in aquatic systems. High-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene was done to characterize the microbial community structure in 472 environmental samples, comprising ZMs, sediment, and the water column, collected from 15 lakes during the summer and fall months. Sequence analyses, done using the SourceTracker program, predicted that water and sediment contributed up to 91 and 86%, respectively, to the structure of microbiota within ZMs, and that mussels from the same site showed nearly identical source microbiota profiles. The relatively high local source contribution suggests that the microbiota in ZM tissue has the potential to reflect biological contamination and this phenomenon can be used to monitor microbial water quality. A preferential enrichment of several taxa was also observed in ZM tissues, including potential pathogenic groups such as Aeromonas, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas. Taken together, our results contribute to an improved understanding of ZMs as a sentinel species in aquatic habitats and its potential impact to water quality management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Can syndromic surveillance help forecast winter hospital bed pressures in England?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHealth care planners need to predict demand for hospital beds to avoid deterioration in health care. Seasonal demand can be affected by respiratory illnesses which in England are monitored using syndromic surveillance systems. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between syndromic data and daily emergency hospital admissions.MethodsWe compared the timing of peaks in syndromic respiratory indicators and emergency hospital admissions, between 2013 and 2018. Furthermore, we created forecasts for daily admissions and investigated their accuracy when real-time syndromic data were included.ResultsWe found that syndromic indicators were sensitive to changes in the timing of peaks in seasonal disease, especially influenza. However, each year, peak demand for hospital beds occurred on either 29th or 30th December, irrespective of the timing of syndromic peaks. Most forecast models using syndromic indicators explained over 70% of the seasonal variation in admissions (adjusted R square value). Forecast errors were reduced when syndromic data were included. For example, peak admissions for December 2014 and 2017 were underestimated when syndromic data were not used in models.ConclusionDue to the lack of variability in the timing of the highest seasonal peak in hospital admissions, syndromic surveillance data do not provide additional early warning of timing. However, during atypical seasons syndromic data did improve the accuracy of forecast intensity.

TI  - Impact of building greening on building energy consumption: A quantitative computational approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's urbanization process continues to accelerate, building energy consumption is becoming an increasingly serious issue, and more attention is being focused on the use of sustainable green buildings to control building energy consumption. The aim of this study is to establish a method to quantitatively predict the impact of greening on building energy consumption. First, we used NASA satellite data to establish the Beijing Land Characteristics Index, including land surface temperature (LST), normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), building silhouette (BS), impervious surfaces index (ISI), and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). Then, we used the spatial autoregressive model to explore the relationship between building greening and outdoor temperature and finally used the degree-day method to establish the connection between building greening and building energy consumption. The regression results show that the outdoor temperature of the building has a high spatial autocorrelation. For every NDVI increase of 0.1, the outdoor temperature is reduced by 1.317 degrees C. Using the final model to calculate the Shuangjing commercial district data, for every NDVI increase of 0.1 in the Shuangjing area (116.4656241, 39.89360353), the building energy consumption decreased by 7.771%. The results of this study provide strong support for urban greening policy implementation and a more accurate quantitative forecasting method for greening investment and building energy consumption to meet the general cleaner production trend in building construction.

TI  - Sensitivity of Landsat 7 & 8-derived vegetation indices on semi-arid rangelands of southwestern Uzbekistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent use of vegetation indices (VIs) for monitoring rangeland ecosystems in Middle Asia, and particularly Uzbekistan has been limited. In the face of intense rangeland degradation in Uzbekistan, understanding the applicability of VIs is an immediate priority for the assessment of the current state of these rangelands. This article focuses on comparing and evaluating the potential of five intensively used VIs (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, PVI and TSAVI) to detect changes in condition and productivity of Artemisia spp. rangelands across different seasons and years. The results indicate a high degree of similarity in the response of the tested VIs when multi-season and multi-year vegetation data were combined. However, there was significant variability when vegetation data were parsed into seasons and/or variable precipitation years. We recommend that a remote sensing assessment of rangelands in various stages of invasion by native non-palatable plants should rely on a multi-season analysis of NDVI or SAVI.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance genes as landscape anthropization indicators: Using a wild felid as sentinel in Chile
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global emerging public health issue whose presence and impact in wildlife are widely unknown. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are considered environmental contaminants, suitable to evaluate the degree of anthropic impact on wildlife and the environment. We used a wild felid, the guigna (Leopardus guigna), as a sentinel for the presence of ARGs in anthropized and pristine areas across their entire distribution range in Chile. We evaluated fecal samples from 51 wild guignas, collected between 2009 and 2018. Real-time PCR essays were employed to detect and quantify 22 selected ARGs in their fecal microbiome. All animals (100%) were positive for at least one ARG. The most prevalent ARG families were those that confer resistance to tetracycline (88.2%) and beta-lactamase (68.9%), with tet (Q) (60.8%), tet(W) (60.8%), and bla(TEM) (66.7%) as the most prevalent ARGs. Multi-resistance profiles were observed in 43% of the guignas. Statistically significant differences were found between anthropized and pristine areas for tet(Q) (p = 0.014), tet(W) (p = 0.0037), tetracycline family (p = 0.027), multi-resistance profile prevalence (p = 0.043) and tet(W) quantification (p = 0.004). Two animals from anthropized landscapes were positive for mecA, a gene associated with Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci resistant to methicillin, while three animals from anthropized areas were positive for bla(CTX-M), that encodes class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Both genes have been identified in bacteria causing relevant nosocomial infections worldwide. This is the first study on ARGs in wild felids from Chile and the first detection of mecA in South American wild felids. We observed an association between the degree of landscape anthropization and ARG prevalence, confirming that ARGs are important indicators of wildlife exposure to human activity/presence, with a widespread distribution.

TI  - Evaluation of aerosol and cloud properties in three climate models using MODIS observations and its corresponding COSP simulator, as well as their application in aerosol-cloud interactions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of modelling diagnostics with appropriate observations is an important task that establishes the capabilities and reliability of models. In this study we compare aerosol and cloud properties obtained from three different climate models (ECHAM-HAM, ECHAM-HAM-SALSA, and NorESM) with satellite observations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The simulator MODIS-COSP version 1.4 was implemented into the climate models to obtain MODIS-like cloud diagnostics, thus enabling model-to-model and model-to-satellite comparisons. Cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs) are derived identically from MODIS-COSP-simulated and MODIS-retrieved values of cloud optical depth and effective radius. For CDNC, the models capture the observed spatial distribution of higher values typically found near the coasts, downwind of the major continents, and lower values over the remote ocean and land areas. However, the COSP-simulated CDNC values are higher than those observed, whilst the direct model CDNC output is significantly lower than the MODIS-COSP diagnostics. NorESM produces large spatial biases for ice cloud properties and thick clouds over land. Despite having identical cloud modules, ECHAM-HAM and ECHAM-HAM-SALSA diverge in their representation of spatial and vertical distributions of clouds. From the spatial distributions of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol index (AI), we find that NorESM shows large biases for AOD over bright land surfaces, while discrepancies between ECHAM-HAM and ECHAM-HAM-SALSA can be observed mainly over oceans. Overall, the AIs from the different models are in good agreement globally, with higher negative biases in the Northern Hemisphere. We evaluate the aerosol-cloud interactions by computing the sensitivity parameter ACI(CDNC) = dln(CDNC)/dln(AI) on a global scale. However, 1 year of data may be considered not enough to assess the similarity or dissimilarities of the models due to large temporal variability in cloud properties. This study shows how simulators facilitate the evaluation of cloud properties and expose model deficiencies, which are necessary steps to further improve the parameterisation in climate models.

TI  - Solitons and Turbulence in Solar Wind at 1 au: Multi-satellite Data and FDTD Simulations
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - During 2015 January 1-31 multi-satellite data at 1 au showed the propagation of single soliton pulses, the formation of soliton trains, and their ultimate development into the turbulence in solar wind magnetic field, density, speed, temperature, and dynamic pressure. This work is motivated by a basic research question: what are the differences in the conditions for excitation of soliton pulse, soliton train, and turbulence in the solar wind? To answer this question, a convective and dispersive system is considered and simulated via the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. It is found that when a system is initially driven by a weak shock wave only a single soliton pulse will propagate. When the convection coefficient is smaller than or equal to the dispersion coefficient and system is driven by a strong shock then soliton trains are formed. The development of turbulence occurs when the convective coefficient dominates the dispersion coefficient and the system is driven by a stronger shock. Combining the findings of FDTD simulations with the Hall magnetohydrodynamic model, it is concluded that an enhanced interplanetary magnetic field in the magnetic sheath and the declining ion density after corotation interaction region interface provide favorable conditions for the solitons formation. Contrarily, the declining magnetic field in ejecta provides pertinent conditions for the evolution of Alfvenic turbulence. Our findings are critical for understanding the wave development into turbulence in solar wind.

AB  - Full frequency reuse based dual satellite system (DSS) is investigated in this work. In the case of DSS, user terminals receive inter spot beam and intra spot beam interfering signals due to the simultaneous transmission of data from both satellites. Cooperative precoding algorithm is proposed to mitigate these effects. The achievable data rates with zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized ZF precoding algorithms are characterized. If the user terminals served by both satellites are colocated, then the proposed cooperative precoding algorithm fails because of correlated channels. To this end, relay-aided DSS (RA-DSS) is proposed. The achievable data rates of both full-duplex and half-duplex RA-DSSs are characterized. Through simulations, it is shown that the proposed full-duplex RA-DSS achieves better data rate than the DSS, single satellite system, and orthogonal transmission even if the users are closely placed.

TI  - How does urban expansion impact people's exposure to green environments? A comparative study of 290 Chinese cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the difference of greenspace in different urban areas is a critical requirement for maintaining urban natural environment and lessening environmental inequality. However, how urban expansion impacts on people's exposure to ambient green environments has been limitedly addressed. Here we integrated multi-source geospatial big data including mobile-phone location-based service (LBS) data, Sentinel-2, and nighttime light satellite imageries to quantitatively estimate changes in people's exposure to green environments for 290 cities in China from 1992 to 2015. Results showed that the urban expansion process directly led to differences in green environments between old and new urban areas. These differences were not only observed by the green coverage rate but also captured using a dynamic assessment of people's exposure to greenspace. For most of China's large cities, people could enjoy more greenspace in new urban areas than the old ones. A significant day-to-night variation of people's exposure to greenspace was identified between old and new urban areas. Our results also revealed that urbanization did bring some positive effects to improve green environments for cities located in harsh natural conditions (e.g., semiarid/arid and desert regions).

TI  - Modern orthodoxy and morality: an uneasy partnership
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern orthodoxy often perceives itself and is perceived by others as a movement which grants more importance to moral considerations in its interpretation of halakha and in its general worldview than does the ultra-orthodox movement. Accordingly, modern orthodox rabbis are often referred to as more "moderate" than their ultra-orthodox counterparts, a term which seems to imply that they are more open to moral arguments and more likely to adopt, or to develop, moral interpretations of halakha. A study of some central figures like Walter Wurzburger, Eliezer Berkovits and Joseph B. Soloveitchick, however, indicates that the modern orthodox approach to morality is much more ambivalent. The purpose of this paper is to discuss this ambivalence and to speculate on its source.

TI  - Superflares on Solar-type Stars from the First Year Observation of <i>TESS</i>
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - astronomy. In this work, we present the study of superflares on solar-type stars using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Thirteen sectors of observations during the first year of the TESS mission covered the southern hemisphere of the sky, containing 25,734 solar-type stars. We verified 1216 superflares on 400 solar-type stars through automatic search and visual inspection with 2 minute cadence data. Our result suggests a higher superflare frequency distribution than the result from Kepler. This may be because the majority of TESS solar-type stars in our data set are rapidly rotating stars. The power-law index. of the superflare frequency distribution (dN/dE infinity E-gamma) is constrained to be gamma = 2.16 +/- 0.10, which is a little larger than that of solar flares but consistent with the results from Kepler. Because only seven superflares of Sun-like stars are detected, we cannot give a robust superflare occurrence frequency. Four stars were accompanied by unconfirmed hot planet candidates. Therefore, superflares may possibly be caused by stellar magnetic activities instead of planet-star interactions. We also find an extraordinary star, TIC43472154, which exhibits about 200 superflares per year. In addition, the correlation between the energy and duration of superflares (T-duration proportional to E-beta) is analyzed. We derive the power-law index to be beta = 0.42 +/- 0.01, which is a little larger than beta = 1/3 from the prediction according to magnetic reconnection theory.

TI  - Evaluation of malaria surveillance system in Kano State, Nigeria, 2013-2016
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Malaria surveillance system strengthening is essential in the progress towards malaria elimination. In Nigeria, more attention is being given to this recently as the country is striving towards achieving elimination. However, the surveillance system performance is fraught with challenges including poor data quality with varying magnitude by state. This study evaluated the operation of the Kano State malaria surveillance system and assessed its key attributes. Methods An observational study design comprising a survey, record review and secondary data analysis, and mixed methods data collection approach were used. Four key stakeholders' and 35 Roll Back Malaria Focal Persons (RBMs) semi-structured interviews on operation of the system and attributes of the surveillance system, were conducted. We analyzed the abstracted 2013-2016 National Health Management Information System web-based malaria datasets. The surveillance system was evaluated using the "2001 United States Centers for Disease Control's updated guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems". Data were described using means, standard deviation, frequencies and proportions. Chi-squared for linear trends was used. Results Overall, 24 RBMs (68.6%) had <= 15-year experience on malaria surveillance, 29 (82.9%) had formal training on malaria surveillance; 32 RBMs (91.4%) reported case definitions were easy-to-use, reporting forms were easy-to-fill and data flow channels were clearly defined. Twenty-seven respondents (69.2%) reported data tools could accommodate changes and all RBMs understood malaria case definitions. All respondents (4 stakeholders and 34 RBMs [97.1%]) expressed willingness to continue using the system and 33 (84.6%) reported analyzed data were used for decision-making. Public health facilities constituted the main data source. Overall, 65.0% of funding were from partner agencies. Trend of malaria cases showed significant decline (chi(2)(trend) = 7.49; P = 0.0006). Timeliness of reporting was below the target (>= 80%), except being 82% in 2012. Conclusions Malaria surveillance system in Kano State was simple, flexible, acceptable, useful and donor-driven but the data were not representative of all health facilities. Timeliness of reporting was suboptimal. We recommended reporting from private health facilities, strengthening human resource capacity for supportive supervision and ensuring adequate government funding to enhance the system's representativeness and improve data quality.

TI  - Risks for cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms due to land management and climate interactions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and severity of cyanobacteria harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) have been increasing with frequent eutrophication and shifting climate paradigms. CyanoHABs produce a spectrum of toxins and can trigger neurological disorder, organ failure, and even death. To promote proactive CyanoHAB management, geospatial risk modeling can act as a predictive mechanism to supplement current mitigation efforts. In this study, iterative AIC analysis was performed on 17 watershed-level biophysical parameters to identify the strongest predictors based on Sentinel-2-derived cyanobacteria cell densities (CCD) for 771 waterbodies in Georgia Piedmont. This study used a streamlined watershed delineation technique, a 1-meter LULC classification with similar to 88% accuracy, and a technique to predict CyanoHAB risk in small-to-medium sized waterbodies. Landscape characteristics were computed utilizing the Google Earth Engine platform that enabled large spatio-temporal scope and variable inclusion. Watershed maximum winter temperature, percent agriculture, percent forest, percent impervious, and waterbody area were the strongest predictors of CCD with a 0.33 R-squared. Warmer winter temperatures allow cyanobacteria to be photosynthetically active year-round, and trigger CyanoHABs when warmer temperatures and nutrients are introduced in early spring, typically referred to as Spring Bloom in southeast U.S. The risk models revealed an unexpected significant linear relationship between percent forest and CCD. It is due to the fact that land reclamation via reforestation in the piedmont have left legacy sediment and nutrients which are mobilized as surface runoff to the watershed after rain events. A Jenks Natural Break scheme assigned waterbodies to CyanoHAB risk groups, and of the 771 waterbodies, 24.38% were low, 37.35% and 38.26% were medium and high risk respectively. This research supplements existing cyanobacteria risk modeling methods by introducing a novel, scalable, and reproducible method to determine yearly regional risk. Future studies should include factors such as demographic, socioeconomic, labor, and site-specific environmental conditions to create more holistic CyanoHAB risk outputs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Seasonal cycles of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau detected by Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term evolution of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) could be observed from Landsat series of satellite data since the 1970s. However, the seasonal cycles of lakes on the TP have received little attention due to high cloud contamination of the commonly-used optical images. In this study, for the first time, the seasonal cycle of lakes on the TP was detected using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with a high repeat cycle. A total of approximately 6000 Level-1 scenes were obtained that covered all large lakes (>50 km(2)) in the study area. The images were extracted from stripmap (SM) and interferometric wide swath (IW) modes that had a pixel spacing of 40 m in the range and azimuth directions. The lake boundaries extracted from Sentinel-1 data using the algorithm developed in this study were in good agreement with in-situ measurements of lake shoreline, lake outlines delineated from the corresponding Landsat images in 2015 and lake levels for Qinghai Lake. Upon analysis, it was found that the seasonal cycles of lakes exhibited drastically different patterns across the TP. For example, large size lakes (>100 km(2)) reached their peaks in August-September while lakes with areas of 50-100 km(2) reached their peaks in early June-July. The peaks of seasonal cycles for endorheic lakes were more pronounced than those for exorheic lakes with flat peaks, and glacier-fed lakes with additional supplies of water exhibited delayed peaks in their seasonal cycles relative to those of non-glacier-fed lakes. Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as the westerlies, Indian summer monsoon, transition in between, and East Asian summer monsoon, were also found to affect the seasonal cycles of lakes. The results of this study suggest that Sentinel-1 SAR data are a powerful tool that can be used to fill gaps in intra-annual lake observations. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Leaf phenology amplitude derived from MODIS NDVI and EVI: Maps of leaf phenology synchrony for Meso- and South America
T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The leaf phenology (i.e. the seasonality of leaf amount and leaf demography) of ecosystems can be characterized through the use of Earth observation data using a variety of different approaches. The most common approach is to derive time series of vegetation indices (VIs) which are related to the temporal evolution of FPAR, LAI and GPP or alternatively used to derive phenology metrics that quantify the growing season. The product presented here shows a map of average 'amplitude' (i.e. maximum minus minimum) of annual cycles observed in MODIS-derived NDVI and EVI from 2000 to 2013 for Meso- and South America. It is a robust determination of the amplitude of annual cycles of vegetation greenness derived from a Lomb-Scargle spectral analysis of unevenly spaced data. VI time series pre-processing was used to eliminate measurement outliers, and the outputs of the spectral analysis were screened for statistically significant annual signals. Amplitude maps provide an indication of net ecosystem phenology since the satellite observations integrate the greenness variations across the plant individuals within each pixel. The average amplitude values can be interpreted as indicating the degree to which the leaf life cycles of individual plants and species are synchronized. Areas without statistically significant annual variations in greenness may still consist of individuals that show a well-defined annual leaf phenology. In such cases, the timing of the phenology events will vary strongly within the year between individuals. Alternatively, such areas may consist mainly of plants with leaf turnover strategies that maintain a constant canopy of leaves of different ages. Comparison with in situ observations confirms our interpretation of the average amplitude measure. VI amplitude interpreted as leaf life cycle synchrony can support model evaluation by informing on the likely leaf turn over rates and seasonal variation in ecosystem leaf age distribution.

TI  - New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging with Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs): Efficacy, Toxicity, and Future Applications
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Supermagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) are nanoparticles that have an iron oxide core and a functionalized shell. SPIONs have recently raised much interest in the scientific community, given their exciting potential diagnostic and theragnostic applications. The possibility to modify their surface and the characteristics of their core make SPIONs a specific contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging but also an intriguing family of tracer for nuclear medicine. An example is 68Ga-radiolabeled bombesin-conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles coated with trimethyl chitosan that is selective for the gastrin-releasing peptide receptors. These receptors are expressed by several human cancer cells such as breast and prostate neoplasia. Since the coating does not interfere with the properties of the molecules bounded to the shell, it has been proposed to link SPIONs with antibodies. SPIONs can be used also to monitor the biodistribution of mesenchymal stromal cells and take place in various applications. The aim of this review of literature is to analyze the diagnostic aspect of SPIONs in magnetic resonance imaging and in nuclear medicine, with a particular focus on sentinel lymph node applications. Moreover, it is taken into account the possible toxicity and the effects on human physiology to determine the SPIONs' safety.

TI  - Climate variability and trends in the reproductive habitat of the critically endangered hooded grebe
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The population of the critically endangered hooded grebe (Podiceps gallardoi) has decreased drastically during recent decades. The effects of climate change on their reproductive area (Southern Patagonia) have been proposed as one of the potential causes of their critical situation. However, there is much uncertainty about climate variability and climate trends at local scales in Patagonia, and their effects on the hooded grebe habitat.Variability and trends in temperature, precipitation, and wind from 1960 to 2016 in one of the most important reproductive areas of hooded grebe - the Lake Strobel plateau - were analysed. A Landsat satellite image series (1973-2016) was used to evaluate changes in lake area in the region.Generalized linear models were used to analyse the relationship between the variation in lake area and climatic variables, including the Antarctic Oscillation Mode (AAO) index, which is the most important year to year pattern in climate variability at high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.High inter-annual variability and increasing coefficients of variation in precipitation and wind were found, as well as a significant positive trend in temperature. Total lake area, as well as the area specifically used by hooded grebe to reproduce, decreased significantly over time, with high inter-annual variability. Variation in lake area was significantly correlated with variation in precipitation, and with the AAO index.The loss of reproductive habitat may force the hooded grebe to use sub-optimal environments, such as lakes with lower food supply, lower macrophyte cover, and less protection from wind - a potential major handicap for this declining species.Information on lake variation in response to climatic variability could be used to guide hooded grebe conservation strategies, directing more resources and special efforts to those reproductive lakes that are more resilient to the effects of climate fluctuations.

TI  - Fire foci assessment in the Western Amazon (2000-2015)
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Burning is a practice widely used by rural producers in Brazil, mainly in the Amazon region, as the main instrument to prepare the land for agriculture. In this study, we used the data of all heat foci in the Western Amazon, Brazil, provided by the National Institute for Space Research through its Database of Burns (BDQueimadas). This database often has some redundancies owing to the detection of the same burn more than once or capture of the same fire focus by different environmental satellites, resulting in an overestimation of data. In the present study, we optimize a method to reduce redundancies in an extensive database for the Western Amazon for the time period of 2000-2015, using a model for the identification and exclusion of duplicate heat foci, utilizing the ArcGIS 10.2 software. Kernel density estimates were used and correlated with average precipitation of each year obtained from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite (product 3B43). From a total of 1,273,971 heat foci obtained from all environmental satellites, only 433,267 were maintained for the whole period of study (2001-2015), indicating a reduction of approximately 66%. NPP-375 (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, 375 m of spatial resolution) was the most redundant environmental satellite. The fire foci occurrence showed high correlations with rainfall as well as El Nino events. This work could also delineate areas in the Western Amazon that are most vulnerable to drought and resulting fires.

TI  - Assessment of slope instability with effects of critical displacement by using InSAR and FEM
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A good knowledge of the mechanism of slope failure in open-cast mines can be understood by evaluating the intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their interactions in causing slope instability, and by gathering displacement information from periodical monitoring. Surface deformations, caused by mining activities at mine sites, are conventionally measured by using survey instruments such as levels, theodolites, total stations, GPS receivers, and photogrammetric cameras. However, conventional long-term monitoring techniques are insufficient due to unfavorable factors such as topographic structure and flora of the observation, urbanization rate, and time delays in obtaining results. Due to this fact that the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has become prominent in recent years as a method that uses satellite data to enable the detection of surface deformations and movements especially in very large areas. In this study, the mechanism of slope failure accurately detected by way of associating mechanical and physical information of the slopes with time-dependent deformation behavior (time series analysis) by periodically monitoring of displacements at the benches of a lignite open pit that experienced interruptions of production due to slope failures. Mining area has been periodically monitored by InSAR and data consisting of the time-dependent behavior of the deformations were correlated with the mechanical and physical property data that were obtained from back analysis of slope failure using finite elements method (FEM) approximation. In this context, a dynamic method was proposed that can predict the failure risk of the slopes at the site before the critical displacement values are not reached.

TI  - How action research can make deliberative policy analysis more transformative
T2  - POLICY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hajer and Wagenaar originally proposed Deliberative Policy Analysis (DPA) as an approach suited to transforming a policy world characterized by complexity, pluralism and unpredictability. Because its transformative ambitions have long remained unfulfilled, DPA has begun embracing a variety of Action Research (AR) approaches committed to generating policy change in a world beset by multiple sustainability crises. However, a systematic assessment of how AR can make DPA more transformative has been absent thus far. We argue that AR can strengthen the transformative ambitions of DPA in three ways. First, it helps clarify the purposes of DPA based on a critical and relational worldview emanating from their shared pragmatist foundations. Second, it unveils the structural challenges of becoming more transformative in the shadow of the hegemonic institutional organization of academic and policy systems. Finally, it provides a heuristic framework for engaging in the critical-relational dynamics of generating policy change and sustainability transitions. We conclude with a number of recommendations, based on AR principles, practices and experiences, that deliberative policy analysts can adopt to help their initiatives become more transformative.

TI  - From Liminality to <i>Communitas:</i> The Collective Dimensions of Transformative Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses a significant gap in the transformative learning literature as it relates to collective transformation, a transformation that is a level beyond individual transformation and is differentiated from the designed and imposed forms of social or organizational change. We consider collective transformation as an emergent and shared worldview shift that is grounded in a shared experience. The participants might not be fully aware of or even able to describe this experience until they engage with it at the interpersonal level. In prior research and practice, the five authors have independently observed and documented the phenomenon of collective transformation among members of marginalized populations who have undergone liminal experiences-forms of disequilibrium that leave individuals betwixt and between. The common thread in these experiences is the emergence of a shared feeling called communitas, which is a deeply felt (yet often temporary) sense of belonging and community. This study's purpose is to further explore the roles that states of liminality and communitas play in creating the conditions for collective transformation. We draw on several theoretical and practice-based areas of literature and on five particular types of experience. We then examine each case for shared experiences of liminality and communitas as well as for the underlying qualities of self-understanding, relational ability, and a collectively felt sense of new possibilities. This study also includes suggestions for the application of these concepts to other social groups and in other contexts.

TI  - Above-cloud aerosol optical depth from airborne observations in the southeast Atlantic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeast Atlantic (SEA) region is host to a climatologically significant biomass burning aerosol layer overlying marine stratocumulus. We present the first results of the directly measured above-cloud aerosol optical depth (ACAOD) from the recent ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) airborne field campaign during August and September 2016. In our analysis, we use data from the Spectrometers for Sky-Scanning Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR) instrument and found an average ACAOD of 0.32 at 501 nm (range of 0.02 to 1.04), with an average angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) above clouds of 1.71. The AE is much lower at 1.25 for the full column (including below-cloud-level aerosol, with an average of 0.36 at 501 nm and a range of 0.02 to 0.74), indicating the presence of large aerosol particles, likely marine aerosol, in the lower atmospheric column. The ACAOD is observed from 4STAR to be highest near the coast at about 12 degrees S, whereas its variability is largest at the southern edge of the average aerosol plume, as indicated by 12 years of MODIS observations. In comparison to MODIS-derived ACAOD and long-term fine-mode plume-average AOD along a diagonal routine track extending out from the coast of Namibia, the directly measured ACAOD from 4STAR is slightly lower than the ACAOD product from MODIS. The peak ACAOD expected from MODIS AOD retrievals averaged over a long term along the routine diagonal flight track (peak of 0.5) was measured to be closer to coast in 2016 at about 1.5-4 degrees E, with 4STAR ACAOD averages showing a peak of 0.42. When considering the full observation set over the SEA, by spatially binning each sampled AOD, we obtain a geographically representative mean ACAOD of 0.37. Vertical profiles of AOD showcase the variability in the altitude of the aerosol plume and its separation from the cloud top. We measured larger AOD at a high altitude near the coast than farther from the coast, while generally observing a larger vertical gap farther from the coast. Changes in AOD with altitude are correlated with carbon monoxide, a gas tracer of the biomass burning aerosol plume. Vertical extent of gaps between aerosol and cloud show a wide distribution, with a near-zero gap being most frequent. The gap distribution with longitude is observed to be largest at about 7 degrees E, farther from coast than expected from previous studies.

TI  - New estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning and peat fires using MODIS Collection 6 burned areas
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paris Agreement calls on parties to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change by engaging in appropriate policies and measures as put forward through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), to strengthen transparency when reporting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to increase their mitigation contributions to climate action from 2020. It also calls for regular and transparent monitoring and reporting of the GHG emissions and on the NDCs implementation efforts. Biomass fires significantly affect the GHG atmospheric balance, with fire emissions representing more than 5% of total emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), according to recent estimates produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). We update previously published Tier 1 estimates of GHG emissions in FAOSTAT-which had been used in the IPCC AR5 analysis-by using new burned area activity data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) known as MCD64A1, Collection 6. The previous FAOSTAT estimates had used as input the Global Fire Emission Database v.4 (GFED4) burned area product, based on older MODIS Collection 5.1 burned area product. In line with differences between the input data used, the new FAOSTAT estimates indicate roughly 30% higher fire emissions globally than previously published. Our analysis also confirms that the FAOSTAT Tier 1 approach produces fire emissions estimates that are comparable to those computed at Tier 3 by GFED, and thus represent a useful complementary tool in support of country GHG reporting.

TI  - Climate change scenarios and projected impacts for forest productivity in Guanacaste Province (Costa Rica): lessons for tropical forest regions
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica is home to highly diverse forests which are under threat of degradation due to ongoing climatic changes. There is concern that increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation will force these forests outside of their optimal growth ranges leading to widespread degradation of forest productivity. The objectives of this study are, therefore, to project and assess climatic changes in Guanacaste and to build a relationship between these climatic changes and forest productivity with the goal of projecting productivity trends into the future. The ClimateSA model was used to project RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios from 2018 to 2080 and then assess these projections for the mean and extreme future conditions. Furthermore, the MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP) algorithm was used to build a relationship between forest productivity and the vapour pressure deficit scalar (VPD scalar) and project GPP alteration under future climatic scenarios both seasonally and annually. Results indicate that Guanacaste's mean annual precipitation will stay within the historic levels for both the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The monthly and annual temperatures increase in all projections. Results also indicate that the productivity-climate relationship follows a quadratic relationship between GPP and the VPD scalar. This quadratic relationship leads to areas with higher precipitation (high VPD scalar) experiencing an increase in GPP as they dry in the future. In drier areas (low VPD scalar), reduced precipitation will stabilize or decrease GPP.

TI  - Neoadjuvant therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in HER2-positive breast cancer patients: results from the PEONY trial
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of the study is to evaluate the optimal timing of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinical negative axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) before neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and the feasibility of SLNB substituting for ALN dissection in patients with positive ALNs who convert to node negative, for HER2-positive disease. Methods Patients receiving SLNB with dual tracer mapping in the PEONY trial were analyzed. Results For 80 patients with clinical negative ALNs, the node negative rate by pathology after NAT was 83.8%. SLNB was performed after NAT in 71 patients. The identification rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was 100%. For patients with positive ALNs before NAT, the axillary pathologic complete response rate in the dual HER2 blockade arm was significantly higher than that in the single blockade arm (p = 0.002). SLNB was performed in 71 patients. The identification rate was 100% and the false-negative rate was 17.2%. The false-negative rates were 33.3%, 14.3%, and 0 when 1, 2, and more than 2 SLNs were detected. There was no false-negative case when more than 1 SLN and the clipped nodes were removed simultaneously. Conclusions For clinical ALN negative patients, HER2-positive subtype is found to have high node negative rate by pathology and it is recommended to undergo SLNB after NAT. For patients with positive ALNs who convert to negative, the false-negative rate is high. Dual tracer mapping, more than 2 SLNs detected, more than 1 SLN identified plus the clips placed are the guarantees for lower false-negative rate.

TI  - Remote sensing of phytoplankton decline during the late 1980s and early 1990s in the South China Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The duration of a single satellite deployment is insufficient to detect long-term trends in phytoplankton biomass. By integrating data from different platforms, we quantified the phytoplankton trends in the South China Sea (SCS) from the early-to-mid 1980s to the present. We focused on winter data because the sea surface temperature (SST) in winter has been increasing over the past three decades. We included data from three different eras: (1) the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) period (1979-1983), (2) the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) period (1998-2002), and (3) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) period (2010-2014). There was a decline in phytoplankton (approximately 0.15 mg m(-3)) over the entire SCS from the CZCS period to the SeaWiFS period. The largest reduction (over 0.3 mg m(-3)) occurred in the northern and western SCS. After the SeaWiFS period, the phytoplankton increased by approximately 0.05 mg m(-3). The largest increase was observed to the west of Luzon Strait, extending towards the east coast of Hainan Island. The fluctuations in phytoplankton from the early-to-mid 1980s to the present were consistent with the variation in the wind field rather than with the continued increase in SST. The wind speed decreased from the CZCS period to the SeaWiFS period and increased from the SeaWiFS period to the MODIS period. Moreover, the nutrient variations induced by the mixed-layer depth also contributed to the fluctuations in phytoplankton.

TI  - Retrieval of gridded aerosol direct radiative forcing based on multiplatform datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols play a crucial role in regional radiative budgets. Previous studies on clear-sky aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) have mainly been limited to site-scale observations or model simulations for short-term cases, and long-term distributions of ADRF in China have not been portrayed yet. In this study, an accurate fine-resolution ADRF estimate at the surface was proposed. Multiplatform datasets, including satellite (MODIS aboard Terra and Aqua) and reanalysis datasets, served as inputs to the Santa Barbara Discrete Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model for ADRF simulation with consideration of the aerosol vertical profile over eastern China during 2000-2016. Specifically, single-scattering albedo (SSA) from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2) was validated with sun photometers over eastern China. The gridded asymmetry parameter (ASY) was then simulated by matching the calculated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes from the radiative transfer model with satellite observations (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System, CERES). The high correlation and small discrepancy (6-8Wm 2) between simulated and observed radiative fluxes at three sites (Baoshan, Fuzhou, and Yong'an) indicated that ADRF retrieval is feasible and has high accuracy over eastern China. Then this method was applied in each grid of eastern China, and the overall picture of ADRF distributions over eastern China during 2000-2016 was displayed. ADRF ranges from 220 to -20 W m(-2), and annual mean ADRF is -100.21 W m(-2), implying that aerosols have a strong cooling effect at the surface in eastern China. With the economic development and rapid urbanization, the spatiotemporal changes of ADRF during the past 17 years are mainly attributed to the changes of anthropogenic emissions in eastern China. Our method provides the long-term ADRF distribution over eastern China for the first time, highlighting the importance of aerosol radiative impact under climate change.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2A multispectral image for benthic habitat composition mapping
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2A accuracy for benthic habitat composition mapping was tested and compared to ALOS AVNIR-2. Aerial image acquired using custom-made unmanned aerial vehicle was used to train and validate the model. The mapping was conducted regardless of the benthic class and at individual benthic class. Benthic habitat class spatial distribution was obtained using the combination of image segmentation and classification tree analysis. The aerial image was interpreted based on the percentage of the constructed and non-constructed classes. The constructed class includes coral reefs, dead coral, seagrass, and macroalgae, while non-constructed class covers carbonate sand, rock, and rubble. Sentinel-2A produced higher accuracy (92%) than ALOS AVNIR-2 (78%) for benthic habitat spatial distribution mapping. However, in the empirical modelling of benthic habitat composition, ALOS AVNIR-2 (SE 23-24%) produced slightly better accuracy than Sentinel-2A (SE 23-27%). Several factors affected the low accuracy, which include the sub-pixel mixing of benthic habitat and constructed class, the delay between dates of acquisition, and radiometric quality of the images. Since the fundamental relationship between reflectance value and the percentage of the constructed class has been justified and consistent, given more experiments it has the potential to predict benthic habitat composition with higher accuracy in the future.

TI  - Assessment of Metastatic and Reactive Sentinel Lymph Nodes with B7-H3-Targeted Ultrasound Molecular Imaging: A Longitudinal Study in Mouse Models
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To explore the potential of B7-H3-targeted ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) for longitudinal assessment and differentiation of metastatic and reactive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in mouse models. Procedures Metastatic and reactive SLN models were established by injection of 4T1 breast cancer cells and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) respectively to the 4th mammary fat pad of female BALB/c mice. At day 21, 28, and 35 after inoculation, USMI was performed following intravenous injection of B7-H3-targeted microbubbles (MBB7-H3) or IgG-control microbubbles (MBcontrol). All SLNs were histopathologically examined after the last imaging session. Results A total of 20 SLNs from tumor-bearing mice (T-SLNs) and five SLNs from CFA-injected mice (C-SLNs) were examined by USMI. Nine T-SLNs were histopathologically positive for metastasis (MT-SLNs). From day 21 to 35, T-SLNs showed a rising trend in MBB7-H3 signal with a steep increase in MT-SLNs at day 35 (213.5 +/- 80.8 a.u.) as compared to day 28 (87.6 +/- 77.2 a.u., P = 0.002) and day 21 (55.7 +/- 35.5 a.u., P < 0.001). At day 35, MT-SLNs had significantly higher MBB7-H3 signal than non-metastatic T-SLNs (NMT-SLNs) (101.9 +/- 48.0 a.u., P = 0.001) and C-SLNs (38.5 +/- 34.0 a.u., P = 0.001); MBB7-H3 signal was significantly higher than MBcontrol in MT-SLNs (P = 0.001), but not in NMT-SLNs or C-SLNs (both P > 0.05). A significant correlation was detected between MBB7-H3 signal and volume fraction of metastasis in MT-SLNs (r = 0.76, P = 0.017). Conclusions B7-H3-targeted USMI allows differentiation of MT-SLNs from NMT-SLNs and C-SLNs in mouse models and has great potential to evaluate tumor burden in SLNs of breast cancer.

TI  - The Powerful Male Hero: A Content Analysis of Gender Representation in Posters for Children's Animated Movies
T2  - SEX ROLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Findings across a wide body of research suggest that media targeted at young audiences often portray characters according to stereotypical gender roles. Childhood is a particularly sensitive time in gender identity development, and logic from social cognitive theory suggests that repeatedly observing these stereotypes can have a lasting influence on young audiences' worldview. Building on previous research investigating gender role displays in film content, and with the expectation that content creators use movie posters to convey a one-shot summary of films to audiences, we conducted a content analysis on the gendered power depictions of the main characters in movie posters of 152 popular U.S. animated children's feature films produced over the last 80 years. Findings revealed that main characters were more likely to be male and that males were portrayed as more powerful. These results add to a growing, yet substantial, body of research illustrating the prevalence of stereotypical gender role portrayals across virtually every popular medium with which children come into contact. We discuss our results' implications for potential short-term and long-term effects of exposure to films' gender role stereotypes on young viewers' real-life gender role expectations.

TI  - Investigating the impact of the temporal resolution of MODIS data on measured phenology in the prairie grasslands
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal resolution of vegetation indices (VIs) determines the details of seasonal variation in vegetation dynamics observed by remote sensing, but little has been known about how the temporal resolution of VIs affects the retrieval of land surface phenology (LSP) of grasslands. This study evaluated the impact of temporal resolution of MODIS NDVI, EVI, and per-pixel green chromatic coordinate (GCCpp) on the quality and accuracy of the estimated LSP metrics of prairie grasslands. The near-surface PheonoCam phenology data for grasslands centered over Lethbridge PhenoCam grassland site were used as the validation datasets due to the lack of in situ observations for grasslands in the Prairie Ecozone. MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data from 2001 to 2017 were used to compute the time series of daily reference and to simulate 2-32 day MODIS VIs. The daily reference and simulated multi-day time series were fitted with the double logistic model, and the LSP metrics were then retrieved from the modeled daily time series separately. Comparison within satellite-based estimates showed no significant difference in the phenological metrics derived from daily reference and multi-day VIs resampled at a time step less than 18 days. Moreover, a significant decline in the ability of multi-day VIs to predict detailed temporal dynamics of daily reference VIs was revealed as the temporal resolution increased. Besides, there were a variety of trends for the onset of phenological transitions as the temporal resolution of VIs changed from 1 to 32 days. Comparison with PhenoCam phenology data presented small and insignificant differences in the mean bias error (MBE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) of grassland phenological metrics derived from daily, 8-, 10-, 14-, and 16-day MODIS VIs. Overall, this study suggested that the MODIS VIs resampled at a time step less than 18 days are favorable for the detection of grassland phenological transitions and detailed seasonal dynamics in the Prairie Ecozone.

TI  - Monitoring of the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> from 1985 to 2015 in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Spartina alterniflora is an invasive plant on the coast of China that replaces native vegetation and has a serious negative impact on local ecosystems. Monitoring the spatial distribution of S. alterniflora and its changes over time can reveal its expansion mechanism, which is crucial for the management of coastal ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to map the distribution of S. alterniflora in Zhejiang Province from 1985 to 2015 using a time series of Landsat TM/OLI images and analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of expansion of this species. Results After analyzing the distribution of coastal vegetation, the vegetation index was calculated based on Landsat images for 4 years (1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015). According to a threshold determined based on expert knowledge, the distribution of S. alterniflora in Zhejiang Province was extracted, and the temporal and spatial changes in the distribution of S. alterniflora were analyzed. The classification accuracy was 90.3%. S. alterniflora has expanded rapidly in recent decades after being introduced into southern Zhejiang. Between 1985 and 2015, S. alterniflora increased its area of distribution by 10,000 hm(2), and it replaced native vegetation to become the most abundant halophyte in tidal flats. Overall, S. alterniflora expanded from south to north over the decades of the study, and the fastest expansion rate was 463.64 hm(2)/year, which occurred between 1995 and 2005. S. alterniflora was widely distributed in the tidal flats of bays and estuaries and expanded outward as sediment accumulated. Conclusions This study reveals the changes over time in S. alterniflora cover in Zhejiang and can contribute to the control and management of this invasive plant.

TI  - Machine learning and soil sciences: a review aided by machine learning tools
T2  - SOIL
M3  - Review
AB  - The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation in the transition zone from the Chengdu Plain region to the Longmen Mountains by field measurements and LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS-derived indices
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key element in hydrological processes, and the accessibility of the moisture in the soil controls the mechanisms thereof amid land surface and atmospheric progressions. Many studies have examined the role of the land surface temperature (LST) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in changes in soil moisture. Nevertheless, an understanding of the influence of the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), which combines the LST and the NDVI, on soil moisture remains elusive, including in the transition zone area from the Chengdu Plain region to the Longmen Mountains (TZ). In this study, the TVDI was calculated based on the NDVI and LST, using LANDSAT 8 operational land imager/thermal infrared sensor (OLI/TIRS) images. From the TVDI, regression models were trained by using 96 observation points of in situ soil moisture measurements to calculate the soil moisture in the transition zone. The results revealed that there is a strong and significant negative correlation between the TVDI and the in situ measured soil moisture (P<0.05, r=0.710, R-2=0.504). This indicates that the TVDI can reflect the soil moisture status in the TZ. The overall spatial patterns of soil moisture content were relatively high in the northwestern and central mountainous areas but were relatively low in the southeastern plains. Our study uniquely illustrates the spatial patterns of the relationship between TVDI variability and soil moisture variability in the TZ, western China and provides an approach for using remotely sensed soil moisture to optimise the parameterisation of soils in agricultural water management.

CP  - 1st Global Civil Engineering Conference (GCEC)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - The traditional approaches of mineral-mapping are time consuming and expensive process. Remote sensing is a tool to map the minerals precisely using their physical, chemical and optical properties. In the present study, Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu is selected to extract the abundant mineral such as Limestone using Hyperion and Landsat-8 OLI imageries. The chemical composition of the mineral is identified using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The spectral reflectance of minerals is characterized using analytical spectral device (ASD) field spectroradiometer. The minerals showed deep absorption in short wave infrared region from 1800 to 2500 nm. The mineral mapping in hyperspectral data is performed using various preliminary processing such as bad band removal, vertical strip removal, radiance and reflectance generation and postprocessing steps such as data dimensional reduction, endmember extraction and classification. To improve the classification accuracy, the vertical strip removal process is performed using a local destriping algorithm. Absolute reflectance of Hyperion and Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) imageries is carried out using the FLAASH (fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes) module. Spectral data reduction techniques in reflectance bands performed using minimum noise fraction method. The noiseless reflectance bands spatial data reduced by the Pixel Purity Index method in the threshold limit of 2.5 under 10,000 repetitions. The obtained reflectance imagery spectra compared with the spectral libraries such as USGS (United States Geological Survey), JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and field spectra. Endmembers of minerals are carried out using high probability score obtained from the various methods such as SAM (spectral angle mapper), SFF (spectral feature fitting) and BE (binary encoding). The mineral mapping of both imageries is carried out using a supervised classification approach. The results showed that hyperspectral remote sensing performed good results as compared to multispectral data.

TI  - High-throughput DNA barcoding of oligochaetes for abundance-based indices to assess the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic oligochaete communities are valuable indicators of the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes, but identification of specimens to the species level based on morphological features requires solid expertise in taxonomy and is possible only for a fraction of specimens present in a sample. The identification of aquatic oligochaetes using DNA barcodes would facilitate their use in biomonitoring and allow a wider use of this taxonomic group for ecological diagnoses. Previous approaches based on DNA metabarcoding of samples composed of total sediments or pools of specimens have been proposed for assessing the biological quality of ecosystems, but such methods do not provide precise information on species abundance, which limits the value of resulting ecological diagnoses. Here, we tested how a DNA barcoding approach based on high-throughput sequencing of sorted and genetically tagged specimens performed to assess oligochaete species diversity and abundance and the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes. We applied both molecular and morphological approaches at 13 sites in Swiss streams and at 7 sites in Lake Geneva. We genetically identified 33 or 66 specimens per site. For both approaches, we used the same index calculations. We found that the ecological diagnoses derived from the genetic approach matched well with those of the morphological approach and that the genetic identification of only 33 specimens per site provided enough ecological information for correctly estimating the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes.

TI  - Remote sensing of regional-scale maize lodging using multitemporal GF-1 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging stress affects the yield, quality, and mechanical harvesting capacity of maize, thereby resulting in a reduction in maize production. The timely monitoring of maize lodging assists in determining the extent and degree of the effects. This study proposed a method for this purpose using Gaofen-1 (GF-1) optical satellite images, which can be significant for lodging field management, production assessments, and implementation of the related remedial measures. The evaluation index of the lodging grade was constructed by measuring the proportion and angle of maize lodging after the lodging incident. Variations in spectral reflectance and vegetation index were calculated before and after lodging. The competitive adaptive reweighted sampling algorithm was used to screen the optimal combination of variables sensitive to the evaluation index of the maize lodging grade. A remote sensing monitoring model was established by using random forest (RF) and partial least squares (PLS). Results show that the maize lodging monitoring model established by RF is better than that of PLS. The accuracy of monitoring the lodging damage using the GF-1 images reaches 79%. Meanwhile, the classification map of the lodging grade we constructed using an RF model is consistent with the actual lodging area. Hence, this method can effectively characterize the intensity of lodging stress and can also be used to assess the range of damages caused by regional-scale lodging.

TI  - Development and Initial Validation of the Perceived Classism Experiences Scale
T2  - COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the development and initial validation of the Perceived Classism Experiences Scale (PCES), a scale created to measure experiences of classism based on the Social Class Worldview Model. In Study 1, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 309 participants, revealing three distinct factors: Downward Classism, Upward Classism, and Lateral Classism. In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis with data from a distinct sample of 341 participants provided further support for the bifactor structure of the PCES. Significant correlations with subjective social status, self-rated health, stress, state and trait anxiety, life satisfaction, and well-being further supported criterion validity of the PCES. The PCES advances on previous scales of classism, as it is theory-driven and it is not restricted to academic environments. We discuss research and practical implications of the PCES.

TI  - Hyperspectral Satellite Remote Sensing of Water Quality in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we evaluated the applicability of a space-borne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion, to resolve for chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in Lake Atitlan, a tropical mountain lake in Guatemala. In situ water quality samples of Chl a concentration were collected and correlated with water surface reflectance derived from Hyperion images, to develop a semi-empirical algorithm. Existing operational algorithms were tested and the continuous bands of Hyperion were evaluated in an iterative manner. A third order polynomial regression provided a good fit to model Chl a. The final algorithm uses a blue (467 nm) to green (559 nm) band ratio to successfully model Chl a concentrations in Lake Atitlan during the dry season, with a relative error of 33%. This analysis confirmed the suitability of hyperspetral-imagers like Hyperion, to model Chl a concentrations in Lake Atitlan. This study also highlights the need to test and update this algorithm with operational multispectral sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2.

TI  - Monitoring the trends of water-erosion desertification on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, China from 1989 to 2016 using time-series Landsat images
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP) is a typical ecologically fragile region in southwest China. Water-erosion desertification (WED) is one of the most significant environmental and socio-economic issues on the YGP and has seriously restricted the socio-economic development of this region. However, the research on monitoring of the desertification trends in this region has been limited to long time-series Landsat imagery. The objectives of this research were to monitor the WED trends on the YGP using time-series Landsat imagery data from 1989 to 2016. In this paper, we present a multi-indicator rule-based method, which was used to map the WED on the YGP during this period. The results show that the addition of multiple indicators improved the WED classification accuracy to 90.61%. Overall, the following results were obtained by using the proposed method. (1) The slight desertification area on the YGP increased from 89,617.09 km(2) in 1989 to 100,976.47 km(2) in 2016 with an annual growth ratio (AGR) of 0.48%, the moderate desertification area increased from 80,276.65 km(2) in 1989 to 90,768.39 km(2) in 2016 with an AGR of 0.50%, and the severe desertification area increased from 8149.3 km(2) in 1989 to 13,220.16 km(2) in 2016 with an AGR of 2.39%. (2) The WED expansion on the YGP can be divided into three stages. Firstly, the total WED area increased slowly from 17.80x10(4) km(2) in 1989 to 17.98x10(4) km(2) in 2010 with an AGR of 0.05%. Then, the WED rapidly expanded from 17.98x10(4) km(2) in 2010 to 20.28x10(4) km(2) in 2013 with an AGR of 4.26%. Finally, the WED increased slightly from 20.28x10(4) km(2) in 2013 to 20.50x10(4) km(2) in 2016 with an AGR of 0.36%. The total areas of the different degrees of WED decreased in 1992, 1998, 2001, and 2004. (3) The driving factors of WED were analyzed based on the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. We found that precipitation, vegetation area, and gross domestic product have key roles in the processes of desertification reversion and development. However, the regression coefficients between WED and these factors exhibited considerable spatial variations. The regression coefficients of the key driving factors showed different spatial distributions based on the GWR model in the YGP. The research results can provide scientific reference information for the prevention and control of WED in the YGP.

TI  - Assessment of single-channel algorithms for land surface temperature retrieval at two southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential parameter in investigating environmental, ecological processes and climate change, and thermal infrared remote sensing is a useful tool to acquire information regarding LST. Several accurate LST retrieval methodologies have been developed or refined in recent years and have demonstrated great potential. An assessment of various recent LST inversion single-channel (SC) algorithms is presented. These algorithms include improved mono- window, SC, and improved single channel (ISC). We compared the methods using two Brazilian sites, in which two kinds of validation were performed: field measurements with the satellite overpass and a comparative analysis using the web-based Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator tool and the radiative transfer equation (RTE) (assumed as reference). The three methods showed high coefficient of determination with the RTE (between 0.9 and 0.98). SC algorithm produced the furthest results from the reference and was statistically different. ISC algorithm provided the most reliable LST estimates, yielding root mean square errors between 1.53 and 1.91 K. LST can be retrieved through ISC algorithm only using meteorological station data, thus being an alternative for regions where radiosonde points have low density. Our findings contribute to more operational LST products from the Landsat series in humid places. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks accurately predict cover fractions of plant species and communities in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) greatly extended our possibilities to acquire high resolution remote sensing data for assessing the spatial distribution of species composition and vegetation characteristics. Yet, current pixel- or texture-based mapping approaches do not fully exploit the information content provided by the high spatial resolution. Here, to fully harness this spatial detail, we apply deep learning techniques, that is, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), on regular tiles of UAV-orthoimagery (here 2-5 m) to identify the cover of target plant species and plant communities. The approach was tested with UAV-based orthomosaics and photogrammetric 3D information in three case studies, that is, (1) mapping tree species cover in primary forests, (2) mapping plant invasions by woody species into forests and open land and (3) mapping vegetation succession in a glacier foreland. All three case studies resulted in high predictive accuracies. The accuracy increased with increasing tile size (2-5 m) reflecting the increased spatial context captured by a tile. The inclusion of 3D information derived from the photogrammetric workflow did not significantly improve the models. We conclude that CNN are powerful in harnessing high resolution data acquired from UAV to map vegetation patterns. The study was based on low cost red, green, blue (RGB) sensors making the method accessible to a wide range of users. Combining UAV and CNN will provide tremendous opportunities for ecological applications.

TI  - Remotely sensed forest understory density and nest predator occurrence interact to predict suitable breeding habitat and the occurrence of a resident boreal bird species
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat suitability models (HSM) based on remotely sensed data are useful tools in conservation work. However, they typically use species occurrence data rather than robust demographic variables, and their predictive power is rarely evaluated. These shortcomings can result in misleading guidance for conservation. Here, we develop and evaluate a HSM based on correlates of long-term breeding success of an open nest building boreal forest bird, the Siberian jay. In our study site in northern Sweden, nest failure of this permanent resident species is driven mainly by visually hunting corvids that are associated with human settlements. Parents rely on understory nesting cover as protection against these predators. Accordingly, our HSM includes a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based metric of understory density around the nest and the distance of the nest to the closest human settlement to predict breeding success. It reveals that a high understory density 15-80 m around nests is associated with increased breeding success in territories close to settlements (<1.5 km). Farther away from human settlements breeding success is highest at nest sites with a more open understory providing a favorable warmer microclimate. We validated this HSM by comparing the predicted breeding success with landscape-wide census data on Siberian jay occurrence. The correlation between breeding success and occurrence was strong up to 40 km around the study site. However, the HSM appears to overestimate breeding success in regions with a milder climate and therefore higher corvid numbers. Our findings suggest that maintaining patches of small diameter trees may provide a cost-effective way to restore the breeding habitat for Siberian jays up to 1.5 km from human settlements. This distance is expected to increase in the warmer, southern, and coastal range of the Siberian jay where the presence of other corvids is to a lesser extent restricted to settlements.

TI  - Characteristics of convections associated with the Tibetan Plateau vortices based on geostationary satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs) are major rain producers over the Tibetan Plateau, some of which can move eastward off the plateau and trigger heavy rainfall over southwestern and eastern China. The infrared black body temperature (TBB) data, derived from geostationary meteorological satellite FY-2E in the period of May-August of 2010-2014, is utilized to investigate the characteristics of convections associated with the moving-off TPVs. During May-August, negative TBB anomalies appear over the tracks of the TPVs, but are located further north of the tracks in May and June than in July and August. Relative to the centre of TPVs, low TBB appears in the southeast and extends from southwest to northeast, whose values are smaller and ranges are larger before the TPVs move off than after moving off. Distributions of TBB at different evolution times show a close relationship with the characteristics of TPVs. The intensity, scales and shape of the convections linked to the TPVs are explored in the coordinates whose origin is the composite centre of the convections. Generally, convections associated with the TPVs are elliptic and stretch from southwest to northeast, with average spatial scales of approximately 3 degrees in the zonal and 2 degrees in the meridional direction. Convections in July and August are more intensive and lie southwest-northeast, and those in May and June are weaker with a quasi-zonal orientation. The horizontal scales of convections are much larger in May and July than those in June and August. Convections are usually larger and more intense before the TPVs move off than after moving off, corresponding to the changes of TPVs.

TI  - Vegetation trends associated with urban development: The role of golf courses
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, cities are growing rapidly in size and density and this has caused profound impacts on urban forest ecosystems. Urbanization requiring deforestation reduces ecosystem services that benefit both city dwellers and biodiversity. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation changes associated with urbanization is thus a vital component of future sustainable urban development. We used Landsat time series data for three decades from 1988 to 2018 to characterize changes in vegetation cover and habitat connectivity in the Perth Metropolitan Area, in a rapidly urbanising Australian biodiversity hotspot, as a case study to understand the impacts of urbanization on urban forests. Moreover, as golf courses are a major component in urban areas, we assessed the role of golf courses in maintaining vegetation cover and creating habitat connectivity. To do this we employed (1) land use classification with post-classification change detection, and (2) Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA). Over 17,000 ha of vegetation were cleared and the area of vegetation contributing to biodiversity connectivity was reduced significantly over the three decades. The spatial patterns of vegetation loss and gain were different in each of the three decades (1988-2018) reflecting the implementation of urban planning. Furthermore, MSPA analysis showed that the reduction in vegetation cover led to habitat fragmentation with a significant decrease in the core and bridge classes and an increase in isolated patches in the urban landscape. Golf courses played a useful role in maintaining vegetation cover and contributing to connectivity in a regional biodiversity hotspot. Our findings suggest that for future urban expansion, urban planning needs to more carefully consider the impacts of deforestation on connectivity in the landscape. Moreover, there is a need to take into consideration opportunities for off-reserve conservation in smaller habitat fragments such as in golf courses in sustainable urban management.

TI  - Multiplexed NIR-II Probes for Lymph Node-Invaded Cancer Detection and Imaging-Guided Surgery
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor-lymph node (LN) metastasis is the dominant prognostic factor for tumor staging and therapeutic decision-making. However, concurrently visualizing metastasis and performing imaging-guided lymph node surgery is challenging. Here, a multiplexed-near-infrared-II (NIR-II) is reported in vivo imaging system using nonoverlapping NIR-II probes with markedly suppressed photon scattering and zero-autofluorescence, enabling visualization of the metastatic tumor and the tumor metastatic proximal LNs resection. A bright and tumor-seeking donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) dye, IR-FD, is screened for primary/metastatic tumor imaging in the NIR-IIa (1100-1300 nm) window. This optimized D-A-D dye exhibits greatly improved quantum yield of organic D-A-D fluorophores in aqueous solutions (approximate to 6.0%) and good in vivo performance. Ultrabright PbS/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) with dense polymer coating are used to visualize cancer-invaded sentinel LNs in the NIR-IIb (>1500 nm) window. Compared to clinically used indocyanine green, the QDs show superior brightness and photostability (no obvious bleaching even after continuous laser irradiation for 5 h); thus, only a picomolar dose is required for sentinel LNs detection. This combination of dual-NIR-II image-guided surgery can be performed under bright light, adding to its convenience and appeal in clinical use.

TI  - Ultrasound-Based Nomogram Identifies Breast Cancer Patients Unlikely to Harbor Axillary Metastasis: Towards Selective Omission of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background As tumor biology takes precedence over anatomic staging to determine breast cancer (BC) prognosis, there is growing interest in limiting axillary surgery. There is a need for tools to identify patients at the lowest risk of harboring axillary lymph node (ALN) disease, to determine when omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be appropriate. We examined whether a nomogram using preoperative axillary ultrasound (axUS) findings, clinical tumor size, receptor status, and grade to calculate the probability of nodal metastasis (PNM) has value in surgical decision making. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of female patients (February 2011-October 2014) with invasive BC who underwent preoperative axUS and axillary surgery. Cases with locally advanced BC, neoadjuvant treatment, or bilateral BC were excluded. PNM was calculated for each case. Using various PNM thresholds, the proportion of cases with ALN metastasis on pathology was examined to determine an optimal PNM cut-point to predict ALN negativity. Results Of 357 included patients, 72% were node-negative on surgical staging, and 69 (19.6%) had a PNM < 9.3%. Of these 69 patients, 6 had ALN metastasis on surgical pathology, yielding a false negative rate (FNR) of 8.7% for predicting negative ALN when a PNM threshold of < 9.3% was used. Conclusion A nomogram incorporating axUS findings and tumor characteristics identified a sizeable subgroup (19.6%) in whom ALN was predicted to be negative, with an 8.7% FNR. Surgeons can use this nomogram to quantify the probability of ALN metastasis and select patients who may benefit from omitting SLNB.

TI  - Analysis and suitability modeling of solid waste disposal sites in Kano metropolis, Nigeria
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Municipal solid waste management is a global contemporary issue affecting cities' authorities. Like other major cities of the world, Kano metropolis, with a population of more than four million, is faced with serious solid waste management problems. This study assesses the suitability of existing locations of solid waste disposal sites within metropolitan Kano. Satellite imageries (Landsat, AsterDEM), GPS-locations of the waste disposal sites, and topographical map of Kano metropolis were used as data for this study. The data were modeled and analyzed using a multi-criteria decision technique. The output produces restriction and suitability maps for solid waste disposal within the metropolis. Results show that only 26 percent of the existing solid waste disposal sites are suitable, while 74 percent are unsuitable sites. The study recommends the relocation of those existing unsuitable solid waste disposal sites to more environmentally favorable sites as highlighted in this study.

TI  - The local climate impact of an African city during clear-sky conditions-Implications of the recent urbanization in Kampala (Uganda)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at assessing and understanding the impact of recent urbanization on the (surface) urban heat island ((S)UHI) under clear-sky conditions in a tropical African city using different sources of remotely sensed data sets together with an urban climate model (UCM). The observed SUHI during clear sky conditions is found to be about 4 degrees C on average over the capital city of Kampala, Uganda. The UCM, consisting of TERRA_URB embedded in COSMO-CLM, represents the SUHI well during night but overestimates it by about 3 degrees C in the mean during day. Moreover, a systematic warm land surface temperature bias of about 4 degrees C is identified by night. Improved urban input parameters-derived from Local Climate Zones following the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) framework-lead to a more realistic representation of spatial land surface temperatures patterns. In addition, this parameterization of the UCM can properly represent atmospheric variables such as air temperature, specific and relative humidity, as observed by the automated weather stations. A model sensitivity study furthermore demonstrates that the stronger urban heat island induced by the recent urbanization of Kampala over the past 15 years strongly interacts with the lake-land breeze circulation. Stronger daytime convection over the hotter city leads to areas of convergence that amplify the afternoon lake breeze in the Southern parts of the metropolis. Overall, this study demonstrates that the city of Kampala has a tangible effect on the regional climate that needs to be considered when studying present and future climate impacts.

TI  - Comparing Observation, Axillary Radiotherapy, and Completion Axillary Lymph Node Dissection for Management of Axilla in Breast Cancer in Patients with Positive Sentinel Nodes: A Systematic Review
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated observation or axillary radiotherapy (ART) in place of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) for management of positive sentinel nodes (SNs) in clinically node-negative women with breast cancer. The optimal treatment strategy for this population is not known. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM Reviews-NHS Economic Evaluation Database were searched from inception until July 2019. A systematic review and narrative summary was performed of RCTs comparing observation or ART versus cALND in clinically node-negative female breast cancer patients with positive SNs. The Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs was used to assess risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), axillary recurrence, and axillary surgery-related morbidity. Results Three trials compared observation with cALND, and two trials compared ART with cALND. No studies blinded participants or personnel, and there was heterogeneity in inclusion criteria, study design, and follow-up. Neither observation nor ART resulted in statistically inferior 5- or 8-year OS or DFS compared with cALND. There was also no statistically significant increase in axillary recurrences associated with either approach. Four trials reported morbidity outcomes, and all showed cALND was associated with significantly more lymphedema, paresthesia, and shoulder dysfunction compared with observation or ART. Conclusions Women with clinically node-negative breast cancer and positive SNs can safely be managed without cALND.

TI  - Global Travel in the Late Middle Ages: The Eyewitness Account of Johann Schiltberger
T2  - MEDIEVAL HISTORY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent discussions have centred intensively on the question how to establish new cultural-historical perspectives that are no longer Eurocentric. Mediaevalists and Early Modernists have strongly endeavoured to grasp and to realise Global Mediaeval and Early Modern Studies, but despite many efforts, we are not easily getting away from traditional approaches, especially because many of our sources do not lend themselves quite so easily for that task. Whereas previous scholars have turned their attention primarily towards crusader and pilgrimage accounts, and then also towards some travelogues (Marco Polo), within the German context one early fifteenth-century text stands out that allows us to open the window wide towards a more global perspective, Hans Schiltberger's Reisebuch. This experienced tremendous popularity in the German-speaking lands far into the late seventeenth century, illustrating the life of a slave who was traversing many countries in the Middle East and even Northern Asia in military service. This account can in fact be regarded as a unique contribution in terms of the author's worldview and experiences. He was, involuntarily, one of the first European to report so extensively about those countries located east of the Holy Land and to discuss their political and military history.

TI  - Processes culminating in the 2015 phreatic explosion at Lascar volcano, Chile, evidenced by multiparametric data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Small steam-driven volcanic explosions are common at volcanoes worldwide but are rarely documented or monitored; therefore, these events still put residents and tourists at risk every year. Steam-driven explosions also occur frequently (once every 2-5 years on average) at Lascar volcano, Chile, where they are often spontaneous and lack any identifiable precursor activity. Here, for the first time at Lascar, we describe the processes culminating in such a sudden volcanic explosion that occurred on 30 October 2015, which was thoroughly monitored by cameras, a seismic network, and gas and temperature sensors.Prior to the eruption, we retrospectively identified unrest manifesting as a gradual increase in the number of long-period (LP) seismic events in 2014, indicating an enhanced level of activity at the volcano. Additionally, sulfur dioxide (SO2) flux and thermal anomalies were detected before the eruption. Then, our weather station reported a precipitation event, followed by an increase in steaming and a sudden volcanic explosion at Lascar. The multidisciplinary data exhibited short-term variations associated with the explosion, including (1) an abrupt eruption onset that was seismically identified in the 1-10 Hz frequency band, (2) the detection of a 1.7 km high white-gray eruption column in camera images, and (3) a pronounced spike in SO2 emission rates reaching 55 kg s(-1) during the main pulse of the eruption as measured by a mini-differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) scanner. Continuous carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature measurements conducted at a fumarole on the southern rim of the Lascar crater revealed a pronounced change in the trend of the relationship between the CO2 mixing ratio and the gas outlet temperature; we speculate that this change was associated with the prior precipitation event. An increased thermal anomaly inside the active crater as observed in Sentinel-2 images and drone overflights performed after the steam-driven explosion revealed the presence of a similar to 50 m long fracture truncating the floor of the active crater, which coincides well with the location of the thermal anomaly. This study presents the chronology of events culminating in a steam-driven explosion but also demonstrates that phreatic explosions are difficult to predict, even if the volcano is thoroughly monitored; these findings emphasize why ascending to the summits of Lascar and similar volcanoes is hazardous, particularly after considerable precipitation.

TI  - Investigating size-segregated sources of elemental composition of particulate matter in the South China Sea during the 2011 <i>Vasco</i> cruise
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The South China Sea (SCS) is a receptor of numerous natural and anthropogenic aerosol species from throughout greater Asia. A combination of several developing countries, archipelagic and peninsular terrain, a strong Asian monsoon climate, and a host of multi-scale meteorological phenomena make the SCS one of the most complex aerosol-meteorological systems in the world. However, aside from the well-known biomass burning emissions from Indonesia and Borneo, the current understanding of aerosol sources is limited, especially in remote marine environments. In September 2011, a 2-week research cruise was conducted near Palawan, Philippines, to sample the remote SCS environment. Size-segregated aerosol data were collected using a Davis Rotating Uniform size-cut Monitor (DRUM) sampler and analyzed for concentrations of 28 elements measured via X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was performed separately on the coarse, fine, and ultrafine size ranges to determine possible sources and their contributions to the total elemental particulate matter mass. The PMF analysis resolved six sources across the three size ranges: biomass burning, oil combustion, soil dust, a crustal-marine mixed source, sea spray, and fly ash. Additionally, size distribution plots, time series plots, back trajectories and satellite data were used in interpreting factors. The multi-technique source apportionment revealed the presence of biogenic sources such as soil dust, sea spray, and a crustal-marine mixed source. Anthropogenic sources were also identified: biomass burning, oil combustion, and fly ash. Mass size distributions showed elevated aerosol concentrations towards the end of the sampling period, which coincided with a shift of air mass back trajectories to southern Kalimantan. Covariance between coarse-mode soil dust and fine-mode biomass burning aerosols were observed. Agreement between the PMF and the linear regression analyses indicates that the PMF solution is robust. While biomass burning is indeed a key source of aerosol, this study shows the presence of other important sources in the SCS. Identifying these sources is not only key for characterizing the chemical profile of the SCS but, by improving our picture of aerosol sources in the region, also a step forward in developing our understanding of aerosol-meteorology feedbacks in this complex environment.

TI  - Characterization of structural failures founded on soils in Panyam and some parts of Mangu, Central Nigeria
T2  - GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural failure of buildings, roads, and other infrastructures has led to the loss of lives and monumental damage to the economy. In developing countries such as Nigeria, the failures are always attributed to the nature/type of soils in the area without considering other factors. With the increase in civil engineering constructions and the scramble for a limited portion of competent soils for such constructions, land, therefore, is becoming man's most priced commodity for agriculture, residential and industrial purposes. No works of such have been done in the area, it is, therefore, imperative to study the cause(s) to prevent further loss of lives and the negative effects of such on the economy. The study was carried out at Panyam and some surrounding localities on latitudes N9(0)21 ' and N9(0)26 ' and longitudes 9(0)11 ' E and 9(0)16 ' E an area of 72km(2). A total of forty samples were collected out of which twenty were selected for swelling potentials determination due to their cohesive nature within the 1.5m depth. To characterize the swelling of the soils, inferential testing methods; direct method comprising Liquid Limit and Plasticity Index with values ranging from 30% - 70% and 10% - 27% respectively, and the indirect method (Free Swell Index, FSI) whose values range from 9.1% - 90% were used. Most of the soils analyzed based on the geotechnical standards were categorized relatively safe for civil infrastructure. Structural studies employed the direct measurements of surface structures to get the orientations of structures measured. Landsat image and Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) map of the area was acquired from the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) for subsurface structural analysis. The RTP-TMI (reduce to pole) grid data of the area were processed to improve magnetic anomalies associated with edges of surface/near-surface geological structures using the MAGMAP two-dimensional fast fourier transform (2D-FFT) filters package in Oasis Montaj v7.2 software. Geophysical studies using aeromagnetic data at a near-surface depth of 40m and fractures measured on the surface both revealed a major trend in the NNE - SSW. It was observed that structures constructed across the major trend suffered little to moderate damage while those constructed along the major fractures trend suffered severe damage. It was concluded that both soils and fractures played individual roles in the collapse of infrastructure in the area.

AB  - The water availability assessment is an important aspect for planning and management of water resources in the basin; however, non-availability of observed runoff is an important issue often found in the developing countries. The farmers of irrigation projects incur more expenditure due to assured supply and suffer huge economic loss in dry years. In the present study, a water balance of reservoir for computation of runoff coupled with the application of spatially distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, the SWAT model and SWAT-CUP application have been proposed for hydrological modeling can be used asses the inflows for efficient reservoir operation and planning of releases. The proposed methodology has been applied on Tandula reservoir catchment in Chhattisgarh state of India, which is well-known for its paddy cultivation and any short supply affect the economic status of marginal farmers in the command. The water balance of Tandula reservoir has been carried out for the period of 1991 to 2015 using daily reservoir levels, releases, evaporation, seepage, supplies from other sources, and spillway information. The percentage error in water balance analysis of Tandula reservoir varied between - 6.87 and 3.39% and seem reasonably well matched. The runoff obtained from water balance was checked with the SCS-CN technique and found close resemblance on the monthly and yearly basis. The digital image processing of remote sensing data has been used for determination of land uses and found that forest and agriculture land with rice cultivation are the principal land uses covering nearly 86% area of the catchment. The sensitivity analysis suggested that SCS curve number (r_CN2), saturated hydraulic conductivity (sol_k), soil antecedent water content (sol_AWC), and Manning's N for the main channel (Ch_N2) are the most sensitive parameters. The sequential uncertainty fitting (SUFI2) technique has been used for calibration of model for the period of 1995 to 2007 and validated for 2008 to 2015. The model performance was adjudged using P-factor, r-factor, and Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, and best-fit model parameters were determined. The Nash-Sutcliff efficiency for calibration and validation were found as 0.75 and 0.65 respectively suggested that the developed model can be used for assessment of runoff from the catchment. The knowledge of the availability of water using the amalgamation of water balance, SWAT model, and SWAT CUP application can be used for reservoir operation, irrigation management, and assessment of the impact of climate and land use change on runoff from the catchment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland inventories especially on their spatial extent are a prerequisite for management and conservation of any wetland. The advancement in geospatial techniques has offered a wide range of methodological applications to prepare the inventories and to understand the dynamics of wetlands. The freely available Landsat imagery has been widely used in extracting spatial and temporal information about wetlands. The literature suggests that wetland has declined all over the globe over the past few decades. This study aims to prepare land use/land cover information of three wetlands of Punjab (Harike, Ropar, and Nangal) through direct on screen digitization and through digital processing using automatic digital indices as well. Evaluation of the performance of two band indices, normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) is also taken up in the present study. Landsat data of two periods-1990/91 and of 2018 are used for the study to perform two band indices. The result indicates that the NDWI and MNDWI are less time consuming and serve the purpose of mapping and monitoring wetlands with higher accuracy.

TI  - Development of Magnetic Probe for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Laparoscopic Navigation for Gastric Cancer Patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - New laparoscopic sentinel lymph node navigation using a dedicated magnetic probe and magnetic nanoparticle tracer for gastric cancer patients allows minimally invasive surgeries. By identifying the sentinel lymph nodes containing magnetic nanoparticles, patients can avoid excessive lymph node extraction without nuclear facilities and radiation exposure. This paper describes the development of the laparoscopic magnetic probe, ACDC-probe, for laparoscopic sentinel lymph node identification utilizing the nonlinear response of the magnetic nanoparticles magnetized by an alternating magnetic field with a static magnetic field. For highly sensitive detection, the ratio of static to alternating magnetic fields was optimized to approximately 5. The longitudinal detection length was approximately 10mm for 140 mu g of iron, and the detectable amount of iron was approximately 280ng at a distance of 1mm. To demonstrate the feasibility of laparoscopic detection using the ACDC-probe and magnetic tracers, an experiment was performed on a wild swine. The gastric sentinel lymph node was clearly identified during laparoscopic navigation. These results suggest that the newly developed ACDC-probe is useful for laparoscopic sentinel lymph node detection and this magnetic technique appears to be a promising method for future sentinel lymph node navigation of gastric cancer patients.

TI  - Eccrine Porocarcinoma with Zosteriform Metastasis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare malignant tumor that develops in the eccrine glands, appearing as a primary tumor, or by malignant transformation of an eccrine poroma. It is a carcinoma with high metastatic and recurrent potential; it has the same incidence in both sexes, and mainly affects the elderly. Its diagnosis, rather than clinical, is histological, and due to the rarity of the disease, it is a pathological challenge. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for porocarcinoma, but surgical resection with tumor-free margins is considered the basis of treatment, in addition to sentinel node biopsy under risk factors and individualization of each patient. For the metastatic form, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the treatment of choice. Herein, we present the case of a man with eccrine porocarcinoma with extensive zosteriform skin metastasis and lymph node involvement, treated with chemotherapy and concomitant radiotherapy.

TI  - Soil loss estimation using the revised universal soil loss equation and a GIS-based model: a case study of Jijel Wilaya, Algeria
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The wilaya of Jijel with sylvo-agricultural vocation is considered to be the most degraded region of northern Algeria and the Maghreb, which makes it very sensitive to water erosion phenomena. To characterize the stage of physical degradation of the study area, this study attempts to estimate and map potential soil loss of the wilaya using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). In order to achieve this, our methodology was to overlay data representing the various factors of the RUSLE equation. The result highlighted the high erosivity of the study area where soil loss greater than 100 t/ha/year occupies 68.63% of its area with a loss rate average of 286.4 t/ha/year and a total loss of 688,219 t/year. These high rates are due to a very steep terrain, an aggressive climate, a high soil erodibility, and a vegetation cover degraded by repeated summer fires. Remote sensing data used in a GIS allowed the quantification of potential soil loss and the determination of priority protection areas on a regional scale; this was a great benefit for this sector as it has a high proportion of steep slope areas that makes it almost inaccessible.

TI  - Twenty years of land cover change in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon: implications for biodiversity conservation
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru's "capital of biodiversity" due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

TI  - The microbiota programs DNA methylation to control intestinal homeostasis and inflammation
T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparison of DNA methylation patterns between conventionally raised and germ-free mice shows that the presence of a commensal microbiota induces methylation changes at regulatory elements in a subset of genes that are important for intestinal homeostasis.Although much research has been done on the diversity of the gut microbiome, little is known about how it influences intestinal homeostasis under normal and pathogenic conditions. Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been suggested to operate at the interface between the microbiota and the intestinal epithelium. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on conventionally raised and germ-free mice, and discovered that exposure to commensal microbiota induced localized DNA methylation changes at regulatory elements, which are TET2/3-dependent. This culminated in the activation of a set of 'early sentinel' response genes to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exposure to the microbiota in dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute inflammation results in profound DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility changes at regulatory elements, leading to alterations in gene expression programs enriched in colitis- and colon-cancer-associated functions. Finally, by employing genetic interventions, we show that microbiota-induced epigenetic programming is necessary for proper intestinal homeostasis in vivo.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - A copy of The Secret Teachings of All Ages (1928) by Manly Palmer Hall (1901-1990) was listed among the books possessed by Osama bin Laden (1957-2011) in his last lodgings. The prolific Canadian-born, US-American author advanced a positive interpretation of Islam within an esotericist worldview. By meticulously scrutinising primary sources, this article aims at mapping his conception of Islam and understanding its role within Hall's interpretation of history. Furthermore, drawing upon scholarly discussions of conspiracism, as well as on examinations of bin Laden's figure and messages, this article assesses whether Hall can be described as a conspiracist author and whether his interpretation of history and Islam could have fascinated the founder of Al Qaeda.

TI  - Robust deflated principal component analysis via multiple instance factorings for dimension reduction in remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are often adversely affected by noises due to atmospheric water absorption, transmission errors, sensor sensitivity, and saturation. Therefore, the performance of the classical principal component analysis (PCA) is negatively affected when dealing with such noisy data. To overcome this problem, a robust deflated PCA via multiple instance factorings (RDPCA-MIF) for dimension reduction in remote sensing images is proposed. In contrast to the traditional PCA, a penalty is imposed on the instance space through instance factoring technique to suppress the effect of noise in pursuing projections. To achieve this, we use two strategies, total distance, and cosine similarity metrics. Both strategies discriminate between noise and authentic data points by iteratively learning the relationship between instances and projections. Moreover, a deflation strategy that enables multiple relationships learning between instances and projections is applied to thoroughly evaluate the importance of instances in relation to all projections. Extensive experimental evaluations of the proposed RDPCA-MIF on Salinas-A dataset and shallow and deep features from the NWPU-RESISC45 remote sensing dataset prove its superiority over six comparative methods in dimension reduction and classification tasks.

TI  - If Sages Worked in Tech: Ancient Wisdom for Future-Proof Leadership
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Leadership and its definition is on a continual evolution that is often no more than exchanging one outdated characteristic (goodbye "Charismatic Leadership" - the idea that one figurehead inspires and directs the company) (Vergauwe, Wille, Hofmans, Kaiser, & De Fruyt, 2018) for more progressive examples, (hello "Servant Leadership" - the idea that the purpose of leaders it to serve those who deliver the 'product') (Linuesa-Langreo, Ruiz-Palomino, & Elche-Hortelano, 2017); without fully explaining the transition. Partly due to the newness of the field compared to other academic disciplines, and partly to the acceleration of business behavior; academic and business definitions of leadership seem to be struggling to keep pace. The current article presents evidence to support a more enduring lens of leadership, with particular attention to leadership definitions from Taoism and contemporary texts that describe the Tao. In the context of "second-tier" leadership, a relatively modern concept, it suggests approaches to the attainment of the Tao style may be another route to a post-conventional worldview more applicable in the modern age. The future-proof leader has a greater capacity to wrestle the complexities of the modern world (Kegan, 1994) and take multiple perspectives on any given problem. Future-proofed "wise" leadership is agnostic of the change speed of technology, yet the momentum of technology, globalization, and instant communication are what makes its understanding a modern necessity.

TI  - Oxidative Stress and Damage Biomarkers in Clam <i>Ruditapes decussatus</i> Exposed to a Polluted Site: The Reliable Biomonitoring Tools in Hot and Cold Seasons
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a multi-biomarker approach was used to assess the biological effects of metal pollution in the southern lagoon of Tunis, on clam Ruditapes decussatus both in "hot" (in summer) and "cold" (in winter) seasons. Clams were collected in August 2015 and February 2016 from three sites of the lagoon and from Louza considered a reference site. The concentrations of five trace metals (cadmium, copper, iron, lead, and zinc) in the soft tissues of R. decussatus were evaluated at the sampling sites. A core of biomarkers indicative of (a) neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE); (b) biotransformation (glutathione S-transferase, GST); (c) oxidative stress (catalase, CAT; total glutathione peroxidase, T-GPx; total glutathione peroxidase, T-GPx; selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, Se-GPx; glutathione reductase, GR; superoxide dismutase, SOD) (d) lipid peroxidation (malondialdhyde, MDA level), and (e) apoptotic process (caspase 3-like, CSP3) was selected for measurements of environmental effects on the populations of clams collected from the different sampling sites. The results of metal bioaccumulation in soft tissues of Ruditapes decussatus revealed a high pollution in the South Lagoon of Tunis with spatial variation and relatively high levels at the navigation channel. Anthropogenic pollutants in the lagoon led to the activation of antioxidant defense and biotransformation enzymes to oxidative damage of the membrane and activation of apoptosis, and revealed neurotoxicity. Among this core of biomarkers, the antioxidants enzymes (CAT, SOD, GR, and GPx) were very sensitive, allowing the discrimination among sites and pointing to the navigation channel as the most impacted site in the southern lagoon of Tunis. Moreover, a significant effect of season was recorded on biomarkers responses (e.g., CAT, GR, SOD, AChE, and CSP3 activities and MDA levels) with higher levels in winter than in summer, probably influenced by the reproductive stage and food availability. Finally, the measurement of the selected core of biomarkers in the whole soft tissues of clams was considered as an integrated indicator of environmental stress. Moreover, R. decussatus proved to be a remarkable sentinel species capable to establish a reliable diagnosis of the health status of the marine environment in different areas of the southern lagoon of Tunis, both in "hot" and "cold" seasons.

TI  - Impact of 2004 co-seismic coastal uplift on the mangrove cover along the North Andaman Islands
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The December 2004 earthquake and the subsequent tsunami have incurred devastating impacts on vital habitats along the Indian coastal region, where few of them are irreversible. The earthquake has uplifted the northern Andaman coast, resulting in a drastic reduction of tidal water influx into the adjoining mangrove-laden mudflats. Satellite images of the period from 2003 to 2019 were used to assess the impact of coastal upliftment on the northern Andaman mangroves. Through satellite data analysis, we report a loss of 6500 ha of northern Andaman mangroves. Tidal hydrodynamics simulation under the post-earthquake scenario showed a vast area of mudflats deprived of tidal influx. This reduction in the tidal inundation has incurred a gradual and permanent mangrove area degradation. The earthquake impact on the mangroves was not spontaneous, but a gradual process, where the mangroves were intact until Mach 2006. The earthquake and the resultant coastal uplift have significantly altered the coastal geomorphology as well as the plant demography of the study area. Field visit revealed the terrestrial vegetation growth along the erstwhile mudflats, and vast areas of mangrove peat are observed, surrounded by successions of marshy and terrestrial plants. As mangroves are preferred habitat for diverse marine and terrestrial organisms and act as a vital food source and juvenile shelters for various fish species, the extensive loss of mangrove area may adversely affect a large scale biological ecosystem.

TI  - A review and framework for the evaluation of pixel-level uncertainty estimates in satellite aerosol remote sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent years have seen the increasing inclusion of per-retrieval prognostic (predictive) uncertainty estimates within satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data sets, providing users with quantitative tools to assist in the optimal use of these data. Prognostic estimates contrast with diagnostic (i.e. relative to some external truth) ones, which are typically obtained using sensitivity and/or validation analyses. Up to now, however, the quality of these uncertainty estimates has not been routinely assessed. This study presents a review of existing prognostic and diagnostic approaches for quantifying uncertainty in satellite AOD retrievals, and it presents a general framework to evaluate them based on the expected statistical properties of ensembles of estimated uncertainties and actual retrieval errors. It is hoped that this framework will be adopted as a complement to existing AOD validation exercises; it is not restricted to AOD and can in principle be applied to other quantities for which a reference validation data set is available. This framework is then applied to assess the uncertainties provided by several satellite data sets (seven over land, five over water), which draw on methods from the empirical to sensitivity analyses to formal error propagation, at 12 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites. The AERONET sites are divided into those for which it is expected that the techniques will perform well and those for which some complexity about the site may provide a more severe test. Overall, all techniques show some skill in that larger estimated uncertainties are generally associated with larger observed errors, although they are sometimes poorly calibrated (i.e. too small or too large in magnitude). No technique uniformly performs best. For powerful formal uncertainty propagation approaches such as optimal estimation, the results illustrate some of the difficulties in appropriate population of the covariance matrices required by the technique. When the data sets are confronted by a situation strongly counter to the retrieval forward model (e.g. potentially mixed land-water surfaces or aerosol optical properties outside the family of assumptions), some algorithms fail to provide a retrieval, while others do but with a quantitatively unreliable uncertainty estimate. The discussion suggests paths forward for the refinement of these techniques.

TI  - Correcting non-photochemical quenching of Saildrone chlorophyll-a fluorescence for evaluation of satellite ocean color retrievals
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In vivo chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) can serve as a reasonable estimator of in situ phytoplankton biomass with the benefits of efficiently and affordably extending the global chlorophyll (Chl) data set in time and space to remote oceanic regions where routine sampling by other vessels is uncommon. However, in vivo Chlf measurements require correction for known, spurious biases relative to other measures of Chl concentration, including satellite ocean color retrievals. Spurious biases affecting in vivo Chit; measurements include biofouling, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, calibration offsets, and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). A more evenly distributed global sampling of in vivo ChlF would provide additional confidence in estimates of uncertainty for satellite ocean color retrievals. A Saildrone semi-autonomous, ocean-going, solar- and wind-powered surface drone recently measured a variety of ocean and atmospheric parameters, including ChlF, during a 60-day deployment in mid-2018 in the California Current region. Correcting the Saildrone ChlF data for known biases, including deriving an NPQ-correction, greatly improved the agreement between the drone measurements and satellite ocean color retrievals from MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP, highlighting that once these considerations are made, Saildrone semi-autonomous surface vehicles are a valuable, emerging data source for ocean and ecosystem monitoring.

TI  - Evolution of the submarine-subaerial edifice of Bogoslof volcano, Alaska, during its 2016-2017 eruption based on analysis of satellite imagery
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016-2017 eruption of Bogoslof volcano involved at least 70 detected eruptive events between mid-December 2016 and August 30, 2017. Acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery throughout the duration of the eruptive period allowed us to document and map the various morphologic changes that occurred on the subaerial part of Bogoslof Island. The emplacement of pyroclastic-flow and surge deposits caused the island to increase in area by about 1.5 km(2). The dominant volcanic landforms of the eruption were a series of tuff rings emplaced around various submarine vents. Many of the tuff rings were mantled with surface dunes and impressive amounts of ballistic ejecta, likely derived from erupting magma bodies or previously emplaced submarine lava domes. Debris-flow deposits and surface channels extending over tuff ring surfaces apparent in multiple satellite images are evidence for explosive ejection of seawater. In most cases, erupting vents were initially submarine or began at subaerial lava domes and were largely flooded by seawater suggesting that water-magma ratios were likely high. Under such conditions where water is abundant, eruptive products typically reflect a high degree of water involvement and are dominated by the formation of wet tephra jets and flows and associated deposits typically consist of fine ash and lapilli, contain accretionary lapilli and ash aggregates, and usually form tuff cones and mounds. We observed none of these features in our analysis of satellite data or during our examination of eruptive deposits on Bogoslof Island in 2018. On the contrary, the dominant landform associated with the Bogoslof eruption was tuff rings. The development of tuff rings and surface dunes are commonly associated with the formation of pyroclastic base surges that are by comparison emplaced relatively dry. Dry base surge deposits can be generated from phreatomagmatic explosions involving superheated steam. It is possible that shallow submarine, magma-wet sediment interactions were a characteristic and possibly a dominant eruptive process of the 2016-2017 Bogoslof eruption.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) were evaluated in the peri-urban area of the Arshaly district, which borders the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Landsat multispectral images were used to study the changes in LULC. The analysis of LULC dynamics was carried out using supervised classification with a multi-temporal interval (1998, 2008, and 2018). During the study period, noticeable changes occurred in LULC. There was an increase in the area of arable land and forests and a reduction in the pastures. There was a sharp increase in the built-up area; that is, there was an intensification of land use through an increase in the share of arable land as well as the transformation of agricultural land for development. However, in general, the influence of urban sprawl in this peri-urban area has so far been accompanied by only a slight focus on its sustainable development.

TI  - Spatial Pattern of Agricultural Productivity Trends in Malawi
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess spatial patterns of Malawian agricultural productivity trends to elucidate the influence of weather and edaphic properties on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) seasonal time series data over a decade (2006-2017). Spatially-located positive trends in the time series that can't otherwise be accounted for are considered as evidence of farmer management and agricultural intensification. A second set of data provides further insights, using spatial distribution of farmer reported maize yield, inorganic and organic inputs use, and farmer reported soil quality information from the Malawi Integrated Household Survey (IHS3) and (IHS4), implemented between 2010-2011 and 2016-2017, respectively. Overall, remote-sensing identified areas of intensifying agriculture as not fully explained by biophysical drivers. Further, productivity trends for maize crop across Malawi show a decreasing trend over a decade (2006-2017). This is consistent with survey data, as national farmer reported yields showed low yields across Malawi, where 61% (2010-11) and 69% (2016-17) reported yields as being less than 1000 Kilograms/Hectare. Yields were markedly low in the southern region of Malawi, similar to remote sensing observations. Our generalized models provide contextual information for stakeholders on sustainability of productivity and can assist in targeting resources in needed areas. More in-depth research would improve detection of drivers of agricultural variability.

TI  - Flood Risk Assessment Based on Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Method in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Metropolitan Area, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most devastating natural events and leads to enormous and recurring loss of life, properties, and resources around the globe. With climate change and accelerating urbanization, flood disasters in China have increasingly affected the sustainable development of metropolitan areas. Risk assessment is an essential step in flood management and disaster mitigation, which provide a quantitative measure of flood risk. However, the difficulty of flood risk zoning is dealing with the uncertainty of the evaluation process and the complicated non-linear relationship between indicators and risk levels. To address this issue, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) method based on combined weight (CW) was utilized in this paper to generate flood risk maps at a grid-scale (1 x 1 km). For the case study in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area (BTH) in China, fourteen indicators were selected to construct the flood risk assessment model based on the FSE approach integrated with ArcGIS. The research demonstrates that moderate, high, and very high risk zones are distributed in the southeast fluvial plain of the BTH area, accounting for 31.36% of the total land area. Meanwhile, low and very-low risk zones occupy 68.64% of the total land area, and are primarily located in the high plateau and mountain regions in the northwest. We analyzed the risk level of each county and proposed risk mitigation measures based on field investigations. The verified risk assessment results were spatially consistent with the historical flood disaster records and loss positions, indicating the accuracy and reliability of the risk assessment map using the FSE approach. Compared with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) TAR (Third Assessment Report) and AR5 (Fifth Assessment Report) methods, FSE has significant advantages in handling uncertainty, complexity, and the non-linear relationship between indices and risk grades. This study provides a novel quantitative method for flood risk assessment in metropolitan areas and practical implications for urban flood management.

CP  - 4th Ruijin International Thoracic Symposium (RITS) / 4th Huaxia Thoracic Surgery Medical Forum
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Background: In the current healthcare environment there is increasing pressure to deliver high quality care to more people at less cost. Robotic assisted thoracic surgical procedures (RATS) have been shown by some to be more expensive than conventional endoscopic or open surgery. We initiated this study to assess the financial impact of RATS compared to robotic non-thoracic surgery in an academic institution.Methods: A retrospective study was performed for all patients who underwent any robotically assisted surgical procedure at Temple University Hospital (TUH) in fiscal year 2015. Surgical volume, operative time, length of stay (LOS), case mix index (CMI), direct and indirect costs, hospital charges, surgical charges, contribution margin (CM) and net margin (NM) were collected for the thoracic surgery service in addition to other services which performed more than 20 robotic cases a year. We analyzed the data according to the following strategy: ( I) financial performance for both inpatient and outpatient robotic procedures for the entire hospital; (II) compared financial data for robotic and non-robotic surgeries in the thoracic surgery division; (III) compared thoracic surgery data with the STS database for the same time period in order to calculate any potential cost saving (PCS).Results: In FY15, a total of 696 robotic procedures were performed by the various services at TUH with a mean of 58 cases each month. Although CM was highest for cardiovascular surgery, the highest NM was by thoracic surgery. Despite having the highest volume and a positive CM, the mostly outpatient urology service showed a negative NM in FY15. A CMI-adjusted comparison on 208 of the 589 robotic procedures where there was a comparable group of inpatients who had open procedures, the mean direct cost for non-robotic procedures was $6,239, 9% less than for robotic procedures. The mean total cost for non-robotic procedures was only 3.64% ($435) less than that for robotic procedures ($11,502 vs. $11,937). When compared with the UHC expected LOS, the robotic group had a lower LOS while the non-robotic group had a higher LOS. The mean total direct costs were $3,510 less for the robotic procedures ($16,502 vs. $20,012). When compared to similar cases reported to the STS in FY 2015, the length of stay, conversion rate, transfusion rate, post-operative complications and OR time compared favorably. Using calculations based on published data, the potential cost savings are in the 1 to 2 million dollar range compared to traditional endoscopic or open procedures reported to the STS.Conclusions: High acuity services such as Thoracic Surgery drive higher CM per case as long as variable costs especially LOS are kept low. Procedures with lower CMI may not provide a high enough CM to offset the fixed and variable costs. Robotic surgical cases performed in the outpatient setting may incur significant losses as the reimbursement does not cover the direct costs. Hospitals should preferentially allocate robotic resources to inpatient procedures with higher CMI and work to decrease overall LOS.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to develop methodology for obtaining basin hydrological data for the Blue Nile sub-basins; as well to establish different types of data bank for the Blue Nile River Basin (BNRB). Data scarcity has been regarded as a huge problem in modeling the water resources of the Blue Nile River Basin. Satellite rainfall data together with the evapotranspiration have been used to calculate the runoff data. However, in data-scarce regions such as in a transboundary basin, remote sensing data could be a valuable option for hydrological predictions when ground rainfall stations are not available; as well as the remote sensing data can be used to fill gaps in the ground rainfall stations. The satellite rainfall data for all Blue Nile sub-basins were downloaded in a monthly basis for the period 1980-2010 from the Global Weather Data for the National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) from its website (www.globalweather.tamu.edu). This data were modified with the actual measured rainfall from near gauge stations for the period 1993-1999 by using a weighting factor depending on the distance between satellite data, by using inverse equation and the distances between the middle of sub-basins and the first and second nearest measured rainfall stations, respectively, the modified satellite rainfall data have been found. The selection of the boundary coordinates is used for each sub-basin to set the nearest rainfall satellite station in the middle of each sub-basin and, this is done by using the global weather and Google earth capability. The relation between modified rainfall data and the satellite rainfall data has been found. Different types of input data are used in the WEAP model after being modified and calibrated, such as satellite rainfall data, ET ref, effective precipitation, and crop coefficient K-c in the upper Blue Nile basin. The study area has been divided into 16 sub-basins. WEAP model has been applied to the whole Blue Nile basin, keeping the monthly values of K c same among the different sub-basins for the whole simulated period of 1980-2010. The observed stream flows, using rainfall-runoff relationship, have been simulated with the measured flows by using WEAP model at the four river gauging stations (El-deim, Giwiasi, Hawata and Khartoum) in a monthly time step yielded reasonable values. By evaluating the Blue Nile River Basin at the calibration period (1980-1995) in a monthly time step, the NSE, r(2), and d results for the Blue Nile River at the gauging stations showed a very good model performance.

TI  - Mapping Paleohydrologic Features in the Arid Areas of Saudi Arabia Using Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the Arabian Peninsula is one of the driest regions on Earth; however, this area experienced heavy rainfall in the past thousand years. During this period, catchments received substantial amounts of surface water and sustained vast networks of streams and paleolakes, which are currently inactive. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data reveal paleohydrologic features buried under shallow aeolian deposits in many areas of the ad-Dawasir, Sahba, Rimah/Batin, and as-Sirhan wadis. Optical remote-sensing data support that the middle of the trans-peninsula Wadi Rimah/Batin, which extends for 1200 km from the Arabian Shield to Kuwait and covers similar to 200,000 km(2), is dammed by linear sand dunes formed by changes in climate conditions. Integrating Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Geo-Eye, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, and ALOS/PALSAR data allowed for the characterization of paleodrainage reversals and diversions shaped by structural and volcanic activity. Evidence of streams abruptly shifting from one catchment to another is preserved in Wadi ad-Dawasir along the fault trace. Volcanic activity in the past few thousand years in northern Saudi Arabia has also changed the slope of the land and reversed drainage systems. Relics of earlier drainage directions are well maintained as paleoslopes and wide upstream patterns. This study found that paleohydrologic activity in Saudi Arabia is impacted by changes in climate and by structural and volcanic activity, resulting in changes to stream direction and activity. Overall, the integration of radar and optical remote-sensing data is significant for deciphering past hydrologic activity and for predicting potential water resource areas.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the current land use problems is essential for designing management options for sustainable use and to obtain optimal benefit out of land. This study was intended to examine the current land use problems and propose management options and strategies for sustainable land use in Debre Tsyon kebele of Enebsie Sar Midir district, Ethiopia. The Landsat-8 OLI-TIRS of 2017, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model, interview and field observation was employed to generate data on the current land use, land use problems and management options for the future use. The hybrid pixel-based image classification (supervised and unsupervised) method was used to map the land use classes. The results show that the cropland occupy the vast portion (75%) of the study area. However, the improper land use was very high in agricultural and grazing lands use classes. The growing demand for land resources pushed the community to expand farmlands to fragile steep areas with slope > 30%. Of the total agricultural land, 12.6% found in fragile areas with slope > 30%. Likewise, the grazing land has already deteriorated and could not bring pasture for livestock year-round. The vegetation cover has been declining due to improper use. Hence, this calls for the local government to implement appropriate land use plan and efficient land management options to curb the unsustainability spiral.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-criteria method is a widely used technique to study and analyze the impact and causes of natural hazards. Our study area, that forms a part of the governorate of Sohag, lies in Southeast Sohag and is one of the most flash flood prone regions of Egypt's Eastern Desert. In the last decades, this area of Sohag has suffered from frequent flash floods, with some flood events resulting in human casualties. In our study, we use a multi-criteria process combined with geographical information system (GIS) and remotely sensed data to produce a flash flood susceptibility map. In addition, we discuss the various factors related to flash flooding such as elevation, slope, drainage network, lithology, topographic wetness index, as well as land use, and reclassify these based on their contribution and their effect on flood probability. To calculate the weighted factor for each raster, a pairwise matrix was constructed. Results from our multi-criteria analysis for flash flooding indicate that approximately 5% of the total study area is at a very high risk of flooding, 10% at a high risk, and 25% at a moderate flood risk. Furthermore, our results highlight the areas at risk of flooding and the need for the development of relevant warning systems. Our results also indicate that the southeastern part of the study area is most susceptible to flash floods and we suggest that the necessary focus be given to this region as well as the implementation of a flood warning system. A consistency index was used to determine the accuracy of our model and was calculated to be 0.058, indicating a well-performing model.

TI  - Mapping Forest Composition with Landsat Time Series: An Evaluation of Seasonal Composites and Harmonic Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat program has long supported pioneering research on the recovery of forest information by remote sensing technologies for several decades, and efforts to improve the thematic resolution and accuracy of forest compositional products remains an area of continued innovation. Recent development and application of Landsat time series analysis offers unique opportunities for quantifying seasonality and trend components among different forest types for developing alternative feature sets for forest vegetation mapping. Within a large forested landscape in Southeastern Ohio, USA, we examined the use of harmonic metrics developed from time series of all available Landsat-8 observations (2013-2019) relative to seasonal image composites, including accompanying spectral components and vegetation indices. A reference dataset among three sources was integrated and used to categorize forest inventory data into seven forest type classes and gradient compositional response. Results showed that the combination of harmonic metrics and topographic variables achieved an accuracy agreement with the reference data of 74.9% relative to seasonal composites (71.6%) and spectral indices (70.3%). Differences in agreement were attributed to improved discrimination of three heterogeneous upland hardwood classes and an early-successional, young forest class, all forest types of primary interest among managers across the region. Variable importance metrics often identified the cosine and sine terms that quantify the seasonality in spectral values in the harmonic feature space, suggesting these aspects best support the characterization of forest types at greater thematic detail than seasonal compositing procedures. This study demonstrates how advanced time series metrics can improve forest type modeling and forest gradient quantifications, thus showcasing a need for continued exploration of such approaches across different forest types.

TI  - Improving accuracy evaluation of Landsat-8 OLI using image composite and multisource data with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is very important for evaluation and management of natural resources. Classification of remote sensing data in mountainous and other heterogeneous environments are particularly problematic because of their high spectral heterogeneity. The aim of this study is to conduct accuracy analyses of LULC classification of Landsat-8 OLI composite images and multisource ancillary data using four machine learning classifiers on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in the Golden Gate Highland National Park (GGHNP) and its near surrounding. Our results indicate that the inclusion of short-wave infrared bands increased accuracy of image composites by more than 10% in landcover types with wider range of spectral characteristics. Best performance was achieved by MaxEnt with overall accuracy and kappa statistics of 0.846 and 0.775, respectively. Support Vector Machine (SVM), however, produces relatively higher accuracy for handling different characteristics of multisource data. In elevated areas, aspect was found to outperform other topographic indices in reducing misclassification errors associated with confusion of grasslands with bare lands and water. The LULC produced from image composites can provide some reliable information on vegetation, land and water characteristics and reduce confusion associated with complex biophysical environments on vegetation spectral signatures in sub-tropical mountainous grasslands.

TI  - Recent advances in the use of public domain satellite imagery for mineral exploration: A review of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 applications
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Thanks to their wide coverage and the valuable spectral information, remote sensing data constitute a popular instrument in the mineral exploration toolbox. In recent times, the remote sensing community has witnessed the launch of the new and improved Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors. The former constitutes the eighth sensor of the Landsat series launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), while the latter is linked to the Sentinel-mission launched by the European Space Agency (ESA). The main objective of our contribution is to provide a comprehensive review of the use of the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors in mineral exploration. The free and open access to these data and their enhanced spectral and spatial characteristics (compared to the existing multispectral sensors) has clearly promoted the use of remotely sensed in mineral exploration. In addition, as illustrated by the case studies presented in this paper, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data present effective and accurate mapping tools for mineral exploration. Both sensors identified iron oxides and Al-OH absorption features, in addition to silicate and carbonate minerals. Our review indicated that Landsat-8 is by far the more popular sensor in mineral exploration applications. Greater uptake of Sentinel-2 and further case studies will be necessary to better demonstrate its capabilities and potential.

TI  - A Semiautomatic Pixel-Object Method for Detecting Landslides Using Multitemporal ALOS-2 Intensity Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate mapping of large-scale landslides and other mass movement disasters is crucial for prompt disaster response efforts and immediate recovery planning. As such, remote sensing information, especially from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, has significant advantages over cloud-covered optical imagery and conventional field survey campaigns. In this work, we introduced an integrated pixel-object image analysis framework for landslide recognition using SAR data. The robustness of our proposed methodology was demonstrated by mapping two different source-induced landslide events, namely, the debris flows following the torrential rainfall that fell over Hiroshima, Japan, in early July 2018 and the coseismic landslide that followed the 2018 Mw6.7 Hokkaido earthquake. For both events, only a pair of SAR images acquired before and after each disaster by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) was used. Additional information, such as digital elevation model (DEM) and land cover information, was employed only to constrain the damage detected in the affected areas. We verified the accuracy of our method by comparing it with the available reference data. The detection results showed an acceptable correlation with the reference data in terms of the locations of damage. Numerical evaluations indicated that our methodology could detect landslides with an accuracy exceeding 80%. In addition, the kappa coefficients for the Hiroshima and Hokkaido events were 0.30 and 0.47, respectively.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Level-2 and Sentinel 2 Level-1C Fusion Techniques Intended for Image Segmentation of Archaeological Landscapes and Proxies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of medium resolution, open access, and freely distributed satellite images, such as those of Landsat, is still understudied in the domain of archaeological research, mainly due to restrictions of spatial resolution. This investigation aims to showcase how the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel optical sensors can efficiently support archaeological research through object-based image analysis (OBIA), a relatively new scientific trend, as highlighted in the relevant literature, in the domain of remote sensing archaeology. Initially, the fusion of a 30 m spatial resolution Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Level-2 and a 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel 2 Level-1C optical images, over the archaeological site of "Nea Paphos" in Cyprus, are evaluated in order to improve the spatial resolution of the Landsat image. At this step, various known fusion models are implemented and evaluated, namely Gram-Schmidt, Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA), and hue-saturation-value (HSV) algorithms. In addition, all four 10 m available spectral bands of the Sentinel 2 sensor, namely the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands (Bands 2 to 4 and Band 8, respectively) were assessed for each of the different fusion models. On the basis of these findings, the next step of the study, focused on the image segmentation process, through the evaluation of different scale factors. The segmentation process is an important step moving from pixel-based to object-based image analysis. The overall results show that the Gram-Schmidt fusion method based on the near-infrared band of the Sentinel 2 (Band 8) at a range of scale factor segmentation to 70 are the optimum parameters for the detection of standing visible monuments, monitoring excavated areas, and detecting buried archaeological remains, without any significant spectral distortion of the original Landsat image. The new 10 m fused Landsat 8 image provides further spatial details of the archaeological site and depicts, through the segmentation process, important details within the landscape under examination.

TI  - Processing of Near Real Time Land Surface Temperature and Its Application in Forecasting Forest Fire Danger Conditions
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real time (NRT) remote sensing derived land surface temperature (Ts) data has an utmost importance in various applications of natural hazards and disasters. Space-based instrument MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) acquired NRT data products of Ts are made available for the users by LANCE (Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability) for Earth Observing System (EOS) of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) free of cost. Such Ts products are swath data with 5 min temporal increments of satellite acquisition, and the average latency is 60-125 min to be available in public domain. The swath data of Ts requires a specialized tool, i.e., HEG (HDF-EOS to GeoTIFF conversion tool) to process and make the data useful for further analysis. However, the file naming convention of the available swath data files in LANCE is not appropriate to download for an area of interest (AOI) to be processed by HEG. In this study, we developed a method/algorithm to overcome such issues in identifying the appropriate swath data files for an AOI that would be able to further processes supported by the HEG. In this case, we used Terra MODIS acquired NRT swath data of Ts, and further applied it to an existing framework of forecasting forest fires (as a case study) for the performance evaluation of our processed Ts. We were successful in selecting appropriate swath data files of Ts for our study area that was further processed by HEG, and finally were able to generate fire danger map in the existing forecasting model. Our proposed method/algorithm could be applied on any swath data product available in LANCE for any location in the world.

TI  - Wind Farm Wakes from SAR and Doppler Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We retrieve atmospheric wake characteristics at the wind farm Westermost Rough from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. For the first time, co-located reference measurements of the full flow field around the wind farm are available from Doppler radars. One case with a reference measurement of up to 10 km downstream of the wind farms shows that SAR images depict the wake better close to the wind farm than further downstream. The comparison of two cases with similar wind speed and direction indicate that under unstable atmospheric stratification, we can retrieve the structure of the wake field close to the wind farm from SAR, while this was not possible for a case with stable stratification. We find that openly available Sentinel-1 image archives can be used to study the structure of wind farm wakes depending on the atmospheric stability conditions. From an average of twelve available co-located cases, we find that velocity deficits at the wind turbine hub height are 8% from Doppler radar measurements and 4% from SAR wind retrievals.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations are used to detect surface waters but uncertainties such as instrument noise or retrieval errors can introduce noise or missing-data in the resulting water maps, especially for datasets at the global scale. In this study, spatial filters based on several a priori information are proposed to reduce noise and perform spatial interpolation to fill missing-data in satellite-based surface water maps such as wetlands, rivers, lakes. Four main sources of a priori of information are considered: (1) historical information at the pixel level, (2) neighbouring information constraints based on a historical record, (3) constraints based on topography, and (4) hydrological constraints based on a floodability index. Experiments are conducted over synthetic but realistic data, as well as over real Sentinel 1 (SAR) and 2 (visible) water map retrievals. Mis-classification quantitative results over these three types of data show that simple determinist spatial filters allow reducing noise and filling missing-data. The four sources of a priori information can be exploited and combined to improve observed water maps. This opens some ways to develop post-processing tools for improving surface water maps at high spatial resolution from missions such as SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) to be launched in 2020.

TI  - Postoperative Upper Extremity Function in Implant and Autologous Breast Reconstruction
T2  - JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background After mastectomy and breast reconstruction, many patients experience upper extremity complications, such as pain, restriction in motion, and lymphedema. Despite an aesthetically satisfactory outcome, these occurrences can diminish a patient's postoperative quality of life. Several studies have investigated the causes and incidence of these complications. However, there is currently a paucity of data comparing postoperative upper extremity function according to reconstruction technique. Methods A review was performed of patients enrolled in a physical therapy (PT) program after mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. PT initial encounter evaluations were used to gather data on patients' postoperative upper extremity function. Hospital records were used to gather surgical and demographic data. For each patient, data were collected for each upper extremity that was ipsilateral to a reconstructed breast. Data were then compared between patients who underwent implant-based versus autologous deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstruction. Results A total of 72 patients were identified, including 39 autologous and 33 implant-based reconstruction cases. Proportions of patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsies and axillary lymph node dissections were similar between the two groups. The autologous-based reconstruction patients had significantly higher arm pain at rest ( p = 0.004) and with activity ( p = 0.031) compared with implant patients. Shoulder range of motion and manual muscle test results were similar between groups, with the exception of elbow flexion, which was weaker in implant patients ( p = 0.030). Implant patients were also more likely to report "severe difficulty" or "inability" to perform activities of daily living ( p = 0.022). Edema/swelling, axillary cording, and lymphedema girth measurements were similar between the two groups. Conclusion Different techniques of breast reconstruction can result in different postoperative upper extremity complications. These data show specific areas where postoperative care and PT can be customized according to reconstruction type. Investigation is currently underway to determine the effect of PT on upper extremity function in these patients.

Here, we test two approaches to correct atmospheric errors-phase elevation correlations and global weather models and assess the ability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series to detect deformation anomalies using either a fixed threshold or a cumulative sum control chart. We use the 2017-2018 crisis at Agung volcano as a case example because strong atmospheric signals were originally misidentified as true deformation, and obscured the subtle deformation pattern associated with magmatic activity. We assess the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) of each method and found the average area under the ROC curve to be about 0.5 for the uncorrected data (corresponding to no discrimination capability), around 0.8 after combined atmospheric corrections (weather model and phase elevation approaches), and more than 0.95 using a cumulative sum control chart (where 1 corresponds to ideal separation between classes). Our results retrospectively show that uplift could have been detected to a 95% level of confidence for both ascending and descending time series by October 2017, 15 days after the start of the seismic swarm and 1 month prior to the eruption. Thus, our approach successfully flags anomalous behavior without relying on visual inspection or selection of an arbitrary threshold, and hence shows potential as a monitoring tool for volcano observatories globally.

AB  - Accurate estimation of runoff and sediment yield amount is not only an important task in physiography but also important for proper watershed management. Watershed is an ideal unit for planning and management of land and water resources. Direct runoff in a catchment depends on soil type, land cover and rainfall. Of the many methods available for estimating runoff from rainfall, the curve number method (SCS-CN) is the most popular. The curve number depends upon soil and land use characteristics. This study was conducted in the Kaam watershed in north western Libya using remote sensing and GIS. SCS-CN method has been used for surface runoff estimation for five sub-watersheds of Kaam. The soil map, land use and slope map were created in the GIS environment, because the curve number method is used here as a distributed model, it is necessary to obtain information on a large number of sub-catchments in the basin. Therefore, remote sensing and GIS techniques were used. The major advantage of employing GIS in rainfall-runoff modelling is that more accurate sizing and catchment characterization can be achieved. Furthermore, the analysis can be performed much faster, especially when there is a complex mix of land use classes and different soil types, Landsat satellite image was used to obtain ground cover information. The thematic layers such as the soil map, elevation map, rainfall map and ground cover map were created in Arc GIS 10.3. Then was set the values of Curve numbers in the study area, and by applying the SCS-CN method, the results showed that the surface runoff ranged from 94 to 165 mm in the study area, when rainfall rates were received from 204.07 to 284.6 mm. To find the relationship between rainfall and runoff rates, the straight line equation was used, That was found there a strong correlation between runoff and precipitation rates. The value of the determination coefficient was 73% and the correlation coefficient between them 85%. Through these results, the study recommends taking advantage of runoff rates by reserving them at collection of sub basins and then using them for agricultural purposes in the vicinity. This would be better than reserving water from the total area of the basin, which is 2,283 square kilometres, and then will evaporate or infiltrate before reaching the dam lake.

TI  - Evapotranspiration in the Tono Reservoir Catchment in Upper East Region of Ghana Estimated by a Novel TSEB Approach from ASTER Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is dynamic and influences water resource distribution. Sustainable management of water resources requires accurate estimations of the individual components that result in evapotranspiration, including the daily net radiation (DNR). Daily ET is more useful than the evaporative fraction (EF) provided by remote sensing ET models, and to account for daily variations, EF is usually combined with the DNR. DNR exhibits diurnal and spatiotemporal variations due to landscape heterogeneity. In the modified Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) approach by Zhuang and Wu, 2015, ecophysiological constraint functions of temperature and moisture of plants based on atmospheric moisture and vegetation indices were introduced, but the DNR was not spatially accounted for in the estimation of the daily ET. This research adopted a novel approach that accounts for spatiotemporal variations in estimated daily ET by incorporating the Bisht and Bras DNR model in the modified version of the TSEB model. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery over the Tono irrigation watershed within the Upper East Region of Ghana and Southern Burkina Faso were used. We estimated the energy fluxes of latent and sensible heat as well as the net radiation and soil heat fluxes from the satellite images and compared our results with ground-based measurements from an eddy covariance (EC) station established by the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) within the watershed area. We noticed a similarity between our model estimated fluxes and ET with the ground-based EC station measurements. Eight different land use/cover types were identified in the study area, and each of these contributed significantly to the overall ET variations between the two study periods: December 2009 and December 2017. For instance, due to a higher leaf area index (LAI) for all vegetation types in December 2009 than in December 2017, the ET for December 2017 was higher than that for December 2009. We also noticed that the land use/cover types within the footprint area of the EC station were only six out of the eight. Generally, all the surface energy fluxes increased from December 2009 to December 2017. Mean ET varied from 3.576 to 4.486 (mm/d) for December 2009 while from 4.502 to 5.280 (mm/d) for December 2017 across the different land use/cover classes. Knowledge of the dynamics of evapotranspiration and adoption of cost-effective methods to estimate its individual components in an effective and efficient way is critical to water resources management. Our findings provide a tool for all water stakeholders within watersheds to manage water resources in an engaging and cost-effective way.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a severe climate fact that mainly results from low rainfall leading to serious threat of water shortages an ecological system of South Asia. Due to the current drought conditions and vegetation dynamics, the situation could further be intensified over South Asia. Thus, we study the drought impacts on vegetation dynamics over South Asia, aimed to find out the spatiotemporal differences in vegetation dynamics and seasons at which vegetation is determined by drought. Our approach is based on the using of advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and (NASA's MERRA) air temperature and rainfall data (1990-2015). Due to the low vegetation and dryness in South Asia, the NDVI is more helpful in describing the drought condition. From April to October, there were fast improvements in NDVI, VHI, and VCI. During September, the monthly VHI and VCI were stabilized and enhanced in October once more and in December again indicated a declining trend. The PCI, TCI, VCI, and VHI monthly values confirmed that in 2001, an extreme drought year, and continuous up to 2003, which lead the maximum drought in the South Asia regions. A considerably significantly correlation value in summer (JJA) and autumn (SON) seasons are showed between precipitation and NDVI. While the relationship between NVSWI and NDVI presented considerably high relationship in DJF, JJA, and SON, which specify an excellent indication for monitoring water stress. From 1990 to 2015, the difference of vegetation trend was obvious showed among various regions. The drought frequency was reducing trends from 1990 to 2015 over South Asia.

TI  - Consistency of Radiometric Satellite Data over Lakes and Coastal Waters with Local Field Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 mission launched its first satellite Sentinel-3A in 2016 to be followed by Sentinel-3B and Sentinel-3C to provide long-term operational measurements over Earth. Sentinel-3A and 3B are in full operational status, allowing global coverage in less than two days, usable to monitor optical water quality and provide data for environmental studies. However, due to limited ground truth data, the product quality has not yet been analyzed in detail with the fiducial reference measurement (FRM) dataset. Here, we use the fully characterized ground truth FRM dataset for validating Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) radiometric products over optically complex Estonian inland waters and Baltic Sea coastal areas. As consistency between satellite and local data depends on uncertainty in field measurements, filtering of the in situ data has been made based on the uncertainty for the final comparison. We have compared various atmospheric correction methods and found POLYMER (POLYnomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS) to be most suitable for optically complex waters under study in terms of product accuracy, amount of usable data and also being least influenced by the adjacency effect.

TI  - Possibility of an earthquake prediction based on monitoring crustal deformation anomalies and thermal anomalies at the epicenter of earthquakes with oblique thrust faulting
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Is it possible to predict location, time and magnitude of earthquakes through identifying their precursors based on remotely sensed data? Earthquakes are usually preceded by unusual natural incidents that are considered as earthquake precursors. With the recent advances in remote sensing techniques which have made it possible monitoring the earth's surface with different sensors, scientists are now able to better study earthquake precursors. Thus, the present study aims at developing the algorithm of classic PS-InSAR processing for obtaining crustal deformation values at the epicenter of earthquakes with magnitude larger than 5.0 on the Richter scale and with oblique thrust faulting and then after calculating temperature values using remotely sensed thermal imagery at the epicenter of same earthquakes; thermal and crustal deformation anomalies were calculated using data mining techniques before earthquake occurrence. In the next stage, taking the correlation between thermal anomalies and crustal deformation anomalies at the epicenter of the study earthquakes into account, an integrated technique was proposed to predict probable magnitude and time of oblique thrust earthquakes occurrence over the earthquake-prone areas. Eventually, the validity of the proposed algorithm was evaluated for an earthquake with a different focal mechanism. The analysis results of the thermal anomalies and crustal deformation anomalies at the epicenter of April 16, 2016, Japan-Kumamoto earthquake of magnitude 7.0 with strike-slip faulting, showed completely different trends than the suggested patterns by the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation in the Sahel Using a New Ensemble-Contextual Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many tropical areas, evapotranspiration is the most important but least known component of the water cycle. An innovative method, named E3S (for EVASPA S-SEBI Sahel), was developed to provide spatially-distributed estimates of daily actual evapotranspiration (ETd) from remote sensing data in the Sahel. This new method combines the strengths of a contextual approach that is used to estimate the evaporative fraction (EF) from surface temperature vs. albedo scatterograms and of an ensemble approach that derives ETd estimates from a weighted average of evapotranspiration estimated from several EF methods. In this work, the two combined approaches were derived from the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) model and the EVapotranspiration Assessment from SPAce (EVASPA) tool. Main innovative aspects concern (i) ensemble predictions of ETd through the implementation of a dynamic weighting scheme of several evapotranspiration estimations, (ii) epistemic uncertainty of the estimation of ETd from the analysis of the variability of evapotranspiration estimates, and (iii) a new cloud filtering method that significantly improves the detection of cloud edges that negatively affect EF determination. E3S was applied to MODIS/TERRA and AQUA datasets acquired during the 2005-2008 period over the mesoscale AMMA-CATCH (Analyse Multidisciplinaire de la Mousson Africaine-Couplage de l'Atmosphere Tropicale et du Cycle Hydrologique) observatory in South-West Niger. E3S estimates of instantaneous and daily available energy, evaporative fraction, and evapotranspiration were evaluated at a local scale based on two field-monitored plots representing the two main ecosystem types in the area-a millet crop and a fallow savannah bush. In addition to these ground-based observations, the local scale evaluation was performed against continuous simulations by a locally-calibrated soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model for the two plots. The RMSE (root mean square error) from this comparison for E3S's ETd estimates from combined AQUA/TERRA sources was 0.5 mmday(-1), and the determination coefficient was 0.90. E3S significantly improved representation of the evapotranspiration seasonality, compared with a classical implementation of S-SEBI or with the original EVASPA's non-weighted ensemble scheme. At the mesoscale, ETd estimates were obtained with an average epistemic uncertainty of 0.4 mmday(-1). Comparisons with the reference 0.25 degrees-resolution GLEAM (global land evaporation Amsterdam model) product showed good agreement. These results suggested that E3S could be used to produce reliable continuous regional estimations at a kilometric resolution, consistent with land and water management requirements in the Sahel. Moreover, all these innovations could be easily transposed to other contextual approaches.

TI  - Regression Wavelet Analysis for Near-Lossless Remote Sensing Data Compression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regression wavelet analysis (RWA) is one of the current state-of-the-art lossless compression techniques for remote sensing data. This article presents the first regression-based near-lossless compression method. It is built upon RWA, a quantizer, and a feedback loop to compensate the quantization error. Our near-lossless RWA (NLRWA) proposal can be followed by any entropy coding technique. Here, the NLRWA is coupled with a bitplane-based coder that supports progressive decoding. This successfully enables gradual quality refinement and lossless and near-lossless recovery. A smart strategy for selecting the NLRWA quantization steps is also included. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art lossless and the near-lossless compression methods in terms of compression ratios and quality retrieval.

TI  - Human progress and drought sensitivity behavior
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Human progress is the satisfaction of human needs associated with life quality, social and economic justice. Considering that climate had significant effect on socio-economic behavior of Earth populations, the objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between human progress and drought sensitivity behavior in Minas Gerais State, Brazil.Methods: The human progress variable was generated by principal component analysis, considering the factors: Territorial occupation of the population, dependency ratio, urbanization degree, income, habitation, health, education, sanitation, security and human development index. The moisture index product was generated based on map algebra calculation in GIS, using WorldClim precipitation and MODIS evapotranspiration products. Nonlinear least squares method and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm fit an exponential model to the moisture index (independent) and human progress (dependent) variables. Covariance and crossed-covariance functions were used to characterize the structure and magnitude of spatial dependence between the human progress and the moisture index co-variable.Results: Couple modeling human progress and moisture index variability generated the human drought sensitivity behavior variable, representing the effects of regional climate in Homo sapiens population. The generated human drought sensitivity behavior values were inverted, i.e. lower and higher human drought sensitivity behavior values indicated higher and lower human sensitivity to drought, respectively. Adaptive management capacity with more capable governments combining economic and engineering solutions to maximize species, habitat, ecosystem survival and resilience, could generate best mitigation solutions to reduce potential impacts of climatic spatial variation in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.

TI  - Detection of enzootic circulation of a new strain of West Nile virus lineage 1 in sentinel chickens in the north of Tunisia
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tunisia has experienced various West Nile disease outbreaks. Notwithstanding the serological and molecular confirmations in humans, horses and birds, the human surveillance system can still be improved. Three sentinel chicken flocks were placed in different Tunisian endemic regions and followed up from September 2016 to January 2017. A total of 422 sera from Sejnene (north of Tunisia), 392 from Moknine (east coast of Tunisia) and 386 from Tozeur (south of Tunisia) were tested for West Nile-specific antibodies and viral RNA. The WNV elisa positive rate in sentinel chickens in Sejnene was 10.7% (95% CI: 5.08-21.52). No positive samples were detected in Moknine. In Tozeur, the overall serological elisa positive rate during the study period was 9.8% (95% CI:4.35-21.03). West Nile virus nucleic acid was detected in two chickens in Sejnene.Phylogenetic analysis of one of the detected partial NS3 gene sequences showed that recent Tunisian WNV strain belong to WNV lineage 1 and is closely related to Italian strains detected in mosquitoes in 2016 and in a sparrow hawk in 2017. This report showed the circulation, first molecular detection and sequencing of WNV lineage 1 in chickens in the north of Tunisia and highlights the use of poultry as a surveillance tool to detect WNV transmission in a peri-domestic area.

TI  - Precipitation and Minimum Temperature are Primary Climatic Controls of Alpine Grassland Autumn Phenology on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn phenology is a crucial indicator for identifying the alpine grassland growing season's end date on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which intensely controls biogeochemical cycles in this ecosystem. Although autumn phenology is thought to be mainly influenced by the preseason temperature, precipitation, and insolation in alpine grasslands, the relative contributions of these climatic factors on the QTP remain uncertain. To quantify the impacts of climatic factors on autumn phenology, we built stepwise linear regression models for 91 meteorological stations on the QTP using in situ herb brown-off dates, remotely sensed autumn phenological metrics, and a multi-factor climate dataset during an optimum length period. The results show that autumn precipitation has the most extensive influence on interannual variation in alpine grassland autumn phenology. On average, a 10 mm increase in autumn precipitation during the optimum length period may lead to a delay of 0.2 to 4 days in the middle senescence date (P < 0.05) across the alpine grasslands. The daily minimum air temperature is the second most important controlling factor, namely, a 1 degrees C increase in the mean autumn minimum temperature during the optimum length period may induce a delay of 1.6 to 9.3 days in the middle senescence date (P < 0.05) across the alpine grasslands. Sunshine duration is the third extensive controlling factor. However, its influence is spatially limited. Moreover, the relative humidity and wind speed also have strong influences at a few stations. Further analysis indicates that the autumn phenology at stations with less autumn precipitation is more sensitive to precipitation variation than at stations with more autumn precipitation. This implies that autumn drought in arid regions would intensely accelerate the leaf senescence of alpine grasslands. This study suggests that precipitation should be considered for improving process-based autumn phenology models in QTP alpine grasslands.

TI  - Use of Hyperion for Mangrove Forest Carbon Stock Assessment in Bhitarkanika Forest Reserve: A Contribution Towards Blue Carbon Initiative
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest coastal ecosystems contain significant amount of carbon stocks and contribute to approximately 15% of the total carbon sequestered in ocean sediments. The present study aims at exploring the ability of Earth Observation EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor in estimating aboveground carbon stocks in mangrove forests. Bhitarkanika mangrove forest has been used as case study, where field measurements of the biomass and carbon were acquired simultaneously with the satellite data. The spatial distribution of most dominant mangrove species was identified using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier, which was implemented using the spectral profiles extracted from the hyperspectral data. SAM performed well, identifying the total area that each of the major species covers (overall kappa = 0.81). From the hyperspectral images, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) were applied to assess the carbon stocks of the various species using machine learning (Linear, Polynomial, Logarithmic, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoidal Function) models. NDVI and EVI is generated using covariance matrix based band selection algorithm. All the five machine learning models were tested between the carbon measured in the field sampling and the carbon estimated by the vegetation indices NDVI and EVI was satisfactory (Pearson correlation coefficient, R, of 86.98% for EVI and of 84.1% for NDVI), with the RBF model showing the best results in comparison to other models. As such, the aboveground carbon stocks for species-wise mangrove for the study area was estimated. Our study findings confirm that hyperspectral images such as those from Hyperion can be used to perform species-wise mangrove analysis and assess the carbon stocks with satisfactory accuracy.

AB  - The aim of this research is to introduce a novel ensemble approach using Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), frequency ratio (FR), and random forest (RF) models for groundwater-potential mapping (GWPM) in Bastam watershed, Iran. This region suffers from freshwater shortages and the identification of new groundwater sites is a critical need. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) were used to reduce time and financial costs of rapid assessment of groundwater resources. Seventeen physiographical, hydrological, and geological groundwater conditioning factors (GWCFs) were derived from a spatial geo-database. Groundwater data were gathered in field surveys and well-yield data were acquired from the Iranian Department of Water Resources Management for 89 locations with high yield potential values >= 11 m(3) h(-1). These data were mapped in a GIS. From these locations, 62 (70%) were randomly selected to be used for model training, and the remaining 27 (30%) were used for validation of the model. The relative weights of the GWCFs were determined with an RF model. For GWPM, 220 randomly selected points in the study area and their final weights were determined with the VIKOR model. A groundwater potential map was created by interpolating the values at these points using Kriging in GIS. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was plotted for the groundwater potential map. The success rate curve (SRC) was computed for the training dataset, and the prediction rate curve (PRC) was calculated for the validation dataset. Results of RF analysis show that land use and land cover, lithology, and elevation are the most significant determinants of groundwater occurrence. The validation results show that the ensemble model had excellent prediction performance (PRC = 0.934) and goodness-of-fit (SRC = 0.925) and reasonably high classification accuracy. The results of this study could aid management of groundwater resources and assist planners and decision makers in groundwater-investment planning to achieve sustainability.

TI  - The impact of sea bottom effects on the retrieval of water constituent concentrations from MERIS and OLCI images in shallow tidal waters supported by radiative transfer modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many coastal waters include large areas of Optically Shallow Waters (OSWs) where the sea-bottom affects above-water observations of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs [sr(-1)]). If not treated, the effect of bottom reflectance will interfere with the correct retrieval of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) from hyperspectral and multi-spectral remote sensing observations. To study this phenomenon in more detail, the existing semi-infinite 2SeaColour Radiative Transfer (RT) model was modified into a finite water layer model, bounded by a diffusely reflecting surface at the sea-bottom. From simulations with the new model, called Water - Sea Bottom (WSB) model, it was observed that a ratio of spectral bands in the Near-Infrared, bands 750 nm and 900 nm, is nearly insensitive to the WCCs and increases with the shallowness of the water, and therefore can be used as a robust index to detect OSWs. The newly established Near-Infrared Bottom Effect Index (NISEI) was applied to a series of satellite observations over the Wadden Sea during high and low tidal phases. Images from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) were processed to retrieve WCCs of the study area. The results indicate that the sea-bottom effect in OSWs affects the accuracy of atmospheric correction and retrievals. On the other hand, applying the NIBEI to flag OSWs improves the reliability and consistency of WCCs maps. The application of proposed NIBEI on satellite images requires only Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances at 750 nm and 900 nm and does not depend on atmospheric correction and ancillary local input data (e.g., bathymetry map, bottom type, empirical coefficients, in-situ measurements). As a result, the proposed NISEI can readily be applied to detect OSWs on various ocean colour remote sensors in various shallow coastal regions.

TI  - Sea Breeze Damage Estimation Method using Sentinel of Remote Sensing Satellite Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea breeze damage estimation method using Sentinel of remote sensing satellite data is proposed. There are two kinds of sea breeze damage. Namely, one is vegetation degradation due to sea salt from sea breeze and the other one is leaf lodging due to strong winds from sea breeze. Kyushu, Japan had severe storm due to the typhoon #17 during from 21 September to 23 September 2019. Optical sensor and Synthetic Aperture Radar: SAR onboard remote sensing satellite are used for disaster relief. NDVI and false colored imagery data derived from the Sentinel-1 and 2 data are used for disaster relief. Through experiments, it is found that sea salt damage on rice paddy fields in particular can be relieved by NDVI and false colored imagery data while rice lodging can also be relieved by SAR data.

TI  - Minimally invasive surgery for laryngopharyngeal cancer: Multicenter feasibility study of a combination strategy involving transoral surgery and real-time indocyanine green fluorescence-navigated sentinel node navigation surgery
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node navigation surgery using indocyanine green (ICG-SNNS) can be performed in the operation room. The combination of minimally invasive transoral surgery (TOS) with ICG-SNNS can provide functional preservation options for both primary lesions and lymph node (LN) metastasis. This multicenter feasibility study of this strategy was conducted in Japan. Methods Patients with clinical T1 or T2, N0 oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, or supraglottic cancer were enrolled. The identification rate of sentinel nodes, delayed cervical LN metastasis in 2 years, and survival rate were assessed. Results Twenty-two patients (10 oropharynx, 8 hypopharynx, 4 supraglottic cancer) were enrolled. The identification rate was 100%. One case had delayed nodal metastasis. The accuracy was 95.5%, sensitivity was 75%, and specificity was 100%. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 100%, overall survival was 72.3%, and disease-free survival was 60.5%. Conclusions The combination of TOS with ICG-SNNS is feasible as a minimally invasive strategy and has favorable oncological outcomes.

TI  - Dendritic cells and <i>Brucella</i> spp. interaction: the sentinel host and the stealthy pathogen
T2  - FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - As dendritic cells (DCs) are among the first cells to encounter antigens, these cells trigger both innate and T cell responses, and are the most potent antigen-presenting cells. Brucella spp., which is an intracellular facultative and stealthy pathogen, is able to evade the bactericidal activities of professional phagocytes. Several studies have demonstrated that Brucella can survive and replicate intracellularly, thereby provoking impaired maturation of DCs. Therefore, the interaction between DCs and Brucella becomes an interesting model to study the immune response. In this review, we first will describe the most common techniques for DCs differentiation in vitro as well as general features of brucellosis. Then, the interaction of DCs and Brucella, including pathogen recognition, molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis, and intracellular trafficking of Brucella to subvert innate response, will be reviewed. Finally, we will debate diversity in immunological DC response and the controversial role of DC activation against Brucella infection.

TI  - Evaluation of polarimetric capabilities of dual polarized Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X data to improve the PSInSAR algorithm using amplitude dispersion index optimization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric data is an additional source of information in PSI technique to improve its performance in land subsidence estimation. The combination of polarimetric data and radar interferometry can lead to an increase in coherence and the number of PS pixels. In this paper, we evaluated and compared the dual polarized Sentinel-1A (S1A) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) data to improve the PSInSAR algorithm. The improvement of this research is based on minimizing Amplitude Dispersion Index (ADI) by finding the optimum scattering mechanism to increase the number of PSC and PS pixels. The proposed method was tested using a dataset of 40 dual-pol SAR data (VV/VH) acquired by S1A and 20 dual-pol SAR data (HH/VV) acquired by TSX. The results revealed that using the TSX data, the number of PS pixels increased about 3 times in ESPO method than using the conventional channels, e.g., HH, and VV. This increase in S1A data was about 1.7 times in ESPO method. In addition, we investigated the efficiency of the three polarimetric optimization methods i.e. ESPO, BGSM, and Best for the dual polarized S1A and TSX data. Results showed that the PS density increased about 1.9 times in BGSM and about 1.5 times in Best method in TSX data. However, in S1A data, PS density increased about 1.1 times in BGSM. The Best method was not successful in increasing the PS density using the S1A data. Also, the effectiveness of the method was evaluated in urban and non-urban regions. The experimental results showed that the method was successful in significantly increasing the number of final PS pixels in both regions.

TI  - Assimilation of Sentinel 1 and SMAP - based satellite soil moisture retrievals into SWAT hydrological model: the impact of satellite revisit time and product spatial resolution on flood simulations in small basins
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In runoff generation process, soil moisture plays an important role as it controls the magnitude of the flood events in response to the rainfall inputs. In this study, we investigated the ability of a new era of satellite soil moisture retrievals to improve the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) daily discharge simulations via soil moisture data assimilation for two small ( < 500 km(2)) and hydrologically different catchments located in Central Italy. We ingested 1) the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) Enhanced L3 Radiometer Global Daily 9 km EASE-Grid soil moisture, 2) the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) H113 soil moisture product released within the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) which has a nearly daily temporal resolution and sampling of 12.5 km, and 3) a fused ASCAT/Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite soil moisture product named SCATSAR-SWI with temporal and spatial sampling of 1 day and 1 lam, respectively into SWAT hydrological model via the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF).Different configurations were tested with the aim of exploring the effect of the hydrological regime, the land use conditions, the spatial sampling and the revisit time of the products (which controls the amount of available data to be potentially ingested).Results show a general improvement of SWAT discharge simulations for all products in terms of error and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency index. In particular, we found a relatively good behavior of both the active and the passive products in terms of low flows improvement especially for the catchment characterized by a higher baseflow component. The benefit of the higher spatial resolution of SCATSAR-SWI obtained via S1 over ASCAT was small, likely due to very challenging areas for the S1 retrieval. Eventually, better performances were obtained for the passive product in the more forested catchment.With the aim of exploring the benefit of having more frequent satellite soil moisture observations to be ingested, we tested the performance of the ASCAT product with a reduced temporal sampling obtained by temporally matching ASCAT observations to that of SMAP. The results show a significant reduction of the performance of ASCAT, suggesting that the correction frequency (due to the higher number of observations available) for small catchments is an important aspect for improving flood forecasting as it helps to adjust more frequently the pre-storm soil moisture conditions.

TI  - Implementation of an antenatal late-preterm corticosteroid protocol at a high-volume tertiary care center
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY MFM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since publication of the sentinel antenatal late-preterm steroids clinical trial, the use of antenatal steroids has become a routine aspect of the management of pregnancies at risk for late-preterm delivery. However, in practice, the administration of antenatal corticosteroids in the late-preterm period is widely varied across provider and institution, and the process of implementation of this new practice as well as outcomes associated with implementation are not well understood.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate institutional adherence to an antenatal late-preterm corticosteroid protocol and to assess neonatal outcomes associated with its introduction.STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of all women with singleton pregnancies admitted between 34 and 36 5/7 weeks' who presented in the year before ("preprotocol": November 2012 to October 2013) and after implementation ("postprotocol": April 2016 to March 2017). The protocol recommends corticosteroid administration to women 34 to 36 5/7 weeks' gestation at risk for preterm birth who have not received prior corticosteroids. Women with fetal anomalies or pregestational or gestational diabetes were excluded from analysis. The frequency with which eligible women received corticosteroids and ineligible women were appropriately excluded (adherence) was calculated on a monthly basis. Neonatal outcomes of interest were hypoglycemia, receipt of dextrose, birthweight, 5-minute Apgar less than 7, receipt of surfactant, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal intensive care unit length of stay, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, culture-positive sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and death. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare neonatal outcomes between (1) all women in the postprotocol cohort to those in the preprotocol cohort and (2) only women who received adherent care in the postprotocol cohort to all women in the preprotocol cohort.RESULTS: A total of 452 women were included in the preprotocol cohort and 451 in the postprotocol cohort. The majority of the postprotocol women (n = 366, 81.2%) received adherent care. Women in both cohorts were similar, with the exception that women in the postprotocol cohort were more likely to be nulliparous (P = .013). Compared to the preprotocol period, neonates of women in the postprotocol period had significantly higher odds of hypoglycemia <50 mg/dL in the first 24 hours of life (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.80), without improvements in respiratory outcomes. Results were similar when restricting the analysis to only women in the postprotocol cohort who received adherent care (glucose <50 mg/dL: adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.03). No differences in composite respiratory morbidity or other neonatal outcomes were observed.CONCLUSION: Uptake of a new institutional protocol for antenatal late-preterm corticosteroids was rapid. Compared with historic controls, neonates exposed to antenatal late-preterm corticosteroid experienced increased odds of hypoglycemia, without significant improvements in respiratory morbidities.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change (2000-2014) in the Rio de la Plata Grasslands: An Analysis Based on MODIS NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Latin America in general and the Rio de la Plata Grasslands (RPG) in particular, are one of the regions in the world with the highest rates of change in land use/land cover (LULC) in recent times. Despite the magnitude of this change process, LULC descriptions in the RPG are far from being complete, even more those that evaluate LULC change through time. In this work we described LULC and its changes over time for the first 14 years of the 21st century and for the entire grassland biome of the Rio de la Plata, one of the most extensive grassland regions in the world. We performed simple but exhaustive classifications at regional level based on vegetation phenology, using extensive LULC field database, time series of MODIS NDVI satellite images and decision trees classifiers, generating an annual map for all RPG. The used technique achieved very good levels of accuracy at the regional (94.3%-95.5%) and sub-regional (78.2%-97.6%) scales, with commission and omission errors generally low (Min = 0.6, Max = 10.3, Median = 5.7, and Min = 0, Max = 41.8, Median = 6.8 for regional and sub regional classification respectively) and evenly distributed, but fails when LULC classifications are generated in years when the climate is very different from those used to generate spectral signatures and train decision trees, or when the NDVI time series accumulates large volumes of lost data. Our results show that the RPG are immersed in a strong process of land use change, mainly due to the advance of the agricultural frontier and at the expense of loss of grassland areas. The agricultural area increased 23% in the analyzed period, adding over than 50,000 Km(2) of new crops. Most agricultural expansion, and therefore the greatest losses of grassland, concentrates on both sides of Uruguay river (Mesopotamic Pampa and the western portion of Southern and Northern Campos) and the western portion of Inland Pampa. The generated maps open the door for more detailed and spatially explicit modeling of many important aspects of ecosystem functioning, for quantification in the provision of ecosystem services and for more efficient management of natural resources.

AB  - Remote sensing applications in agricultural practices are comprehensively reliable and cover a multidisciplinary fundamental interest both in local and regional level. Significantly, vegetation indices are the foremost essential in remote sensing applied for agricultural activities related to vegetation and/or water, particularly in an arid environment. Adequate water resources management plans are based on better fulfilling the water demand and supply equation. In arid environments, this equation is barely achieved due to water resources limitations. Remote sensing techniques improve the water resources management schemes by using five different water radiometric indices of Sentinel-2. Each of them plays a specific role in the quantification of soil/plant water content based on the interpretation of map surface water features and monitors the dynamics of surface water. The study area is located within the main agricultural region of Wadi As-Sirhan. The area is characterized by flourishing agricultural activities. Remote sensing data acquired by Sentinal-2 proved to be statistically sufficient to estimate soil water content in two different climatic conditions. Statistically, estimated winter indices are with better fit than summer indices. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index and second Normalized Difference Water Index best fitted winter soil water content estimations. Meanwhile, RMSE showed no differences between Normalized Difference Water Index and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index for both climatic conditions.

TI  - Physicochemical properties of degradable vegetable-based oils on minimum quantity lubrication milling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing attention being paid to environmental and health problems in metal machining, developing an environmentally friendly cutting fluid is an urgent need. Degradable vegetable oils with non-toxicity and renewability are becoming increasingly popular. However, the mechanism of physicochemical properties of different vegetable oils is not clear on minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) milling. In the study, five typical vegetable oils (i.e., cottonseed, palm, castor, soybean, and peanut) were selected as base oil to experimentally evaluate the lubrication performance of the tool-workpiece interface compared with synthetic cutting fluid. With Grade 45 steel as workpiece material, the lubrication performance was evaluated in terms of milling force, surface roughness and surface morphology, as well as the composition, molecular structure, and viscosity of vegetable oils. Results showed that the vegetable-based oils achieved lower milling force and better surface quality than the synthetic cutting fluid. Among them, palm oil obtained the lowest milling force (F-x = 309 N, F-y = 154 N) at 7.76% and 13.6% lower than that of synthetic cutting fluids. The surface quality obtained by vegetable-based oils is superior to that of the synthetic cutting fluid, and the cottonseed and palm MQL acquired the best surface, while soybean obtained the worst surface. Furthermore, the results of surface roughness are consistent with those of surface morphology. Finally, according to the analysis of composition and molecular structure, palm and cottonseed with high content of saturated fatty acids are more suitable as MQL base oils.

TI  - Relationship Between Global Plasmapause Characteristics and Plasmapause Structures in the Frame of Interchange Instability Mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies based on CLUSTER, CRRES, and especially on THEMIS satellite data have revealed the statistical behavior of the global plasmapause such as eastward azimuthal plasmapause propagation and radial plasmapause motion between 21 and 07 magnetic local times (MLTs) most likely at postmidnight. The results are shown to be in a good agreement with characteristics of the plasmapause modeled using interchange instability mechanism. The present study is based on the plasmapause modeled with the mentioned physical mechanism, and it aims to link the observed global plasmapause dynamic with formation and evolution of plasmapause structures. We investigated two plasmapause datasets obtained using real Kp values and certain type of time-dependent changes in the Kp (thereafter Kp jumps) as input in the simulations. The Kp jumps include sharp Kp increase, sharp Kp decrease, short-time burst enhancement (increase-decrease within 3 hr) in Kp, and their combinations in order to obtain plumes, shoulders, and notches, the structures most often observed in the nature. The cross-correlation analyses is applied to the modeled plasmapause and to the geomagnetic Kp index at different 1-hr MLT bins. We have shown that the cross-correlation curves provide deeper insight in the physical processes related to the plasmapause dynamic and evolution. Their behavior is interpreted as the imprint of the plasmapause structure passages through specific MLT sector. Taking into account that the plasmapause in the single events shows very complex and different behaviors, the most important finding of the present study is the simple explanation of what causes global plasmapause motions and deformation in time.

AB  - Water Surface Elevation (WSE) is an important hydrometric observation, useful to calibrate hydrological models, predict floods, and assess climate change. However, the number of in-situ gauging stations is in decline worldwide. Satellite altimetry, including the recently launched satellite missions (e.g. the radar altimetry missions Cryosat 2, Jason 3, Sentinel 3A/B and the LIDAR mission ICESat-2), can determine WSE only in rivers which are more than ca. 100 m wide. WSE measurements in small streams currently remain limited to the few existing in-situ stations or to time-consuming in-situ surveys. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can acquire real-time WSE observations during periods of hydrological interest (but with flight limitations in extreme weather conditions), within short survey times and with automatic or semi-automatic flight operations. UAS-borne photogrammetry is a well-known technique that can estimate land elevation with an accuracy as high as a few cm, similarly UAS-borne LIDAR can estimate land elevation but without requiring Ground Control Points (GCPs). However, both techniques face limitations in estimating WSE: water transparency and lack of stable visual key points on the Water Surface (WS) complicate the UAS-borne photogrammetric estimates of WSE, while the LIDAR reflection from the water surface is generally not strong enough to be captured by most of the UAS-borne LIDAR systems currently available on the market. Thus, LIDAR and photogrammetry generally require extraction of the elevation of the "water-edge" points, i.e. points at the interface between land and water, for identifying the WSE. We demonstrate highly accurate WSE observations with a new radar altimetry solution, which comprises a 77 GHz radar chip with full waveform analysis and an accurate dual frequency differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) system. The radar altimetry solution shows the lowest standard deviation (sigma) and RMSE on WSE estimates, ca. 1.5 cm and ca. 3 cm respectively, whilst photogrammetry and LIDAR show a sigma and an RMSE at decimetre level. Radar altimetry also requires a significantly shorter survey and processing time compared to LIDAR and especially to photogrammetry.

TI  - Postfire recruitment failure in Scots pine forests of southern Siberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire disturbances effect changes in vegetation communities that in turn influence climate. Such changes in boreal forest ecosystems can persist over decadal time scales or longer. In the ecotone between boreal forest and steppe in the region southeast of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, shifts between the two vegetation types may be precipitated by variations in site specific conditions, as well as disturbance characteristics such as fire frequency and severity. Warmer, drier conditions in the region have been associated with a decrease in fire return intervals and greater burn severity that may, in turn, drive conversion of forests to steppe vegetation at a greater rate than has occurred prior to the onset of warming and drying. Stand-replacing fires in Pinus sylvestris stands in southern Siberia may lead to recruitment failure postfire, particularly on southwest to west-facing slopes, which are more often dominated by grasses. This study uses a combination of field data and remotely sensed indices of vegetation and moisture to distinguish between recruitment pathways in southern Siberia, and to study the influence of factors related to soils, topography, fire severity and winter snow cover on these.We expected that recruitment success would be associated with lower burn severity (higher NBR), higher greenness (NDVI) and moisture (NDMI), and winter snow (NDSI) postfire. We also expected phenological characteristics to differ among recruitment paths. Prior to burning, our sites are broadly similar in terms of remotely sensed indices of moisture (NDMI), vegetation (NDVI), and winter fractional snow cover (NDSI), but recruitment failure sites are generally drier and less green postfire. Initial differences in greenness and moisture among sites characterized by abundant recruitment (AR), intermediate recruitment (IR) and recruitment failure (RF) become more pronounced over the initial decades postfire. The earliest separability of AR and RF sites using remotely sensed indices occurs in the winter months 3-4 years postfire, during which time NDSI is highest for AR sites and lowest for RF. Although seasonality was important with regard to distinguishing among AR, IR and RF index values, the timing of phenological events such as start and end of season did not differ significantly among the sites.

TI  - Feasibility of tundra vegetation height retrieval from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of vegetation height for the circumpolar Arctic tundra biome is of interest for a wide range of applications, including biomass and habitat studies as well as permafrost modelling in the context of climate change. To date, only indices from multispectral data have been used in these environments to address biomass and vegetation changes over time. The retrieval of vegetation height itself has not been attempted so far over larger areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) holds promise for canopy modeling over large extents, but the high variability of near-surface soil moisture during the snow-free season is a major challenge for application of SAR in tundra for such a purpose. We hypothesized that tundra vegetation height can be derived from multispectral indices as well as from C-band SAR data acquired in winter (close to zero liquid water content). To test our hypothesis, we used C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. Results show that vegetation height can be derived with an RMSE of 44 cm from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 54 cm from Tasseled Cap Wetness index (TC). Retrieval from C-band SAR shows similar performance, but C-VV is more suitable than C-HH to derive vegetation height (RMSEs of 48 and 56 cm respectively). An exponential relationship with in situ height was evident for all tested parameters (NDVI, TC, C-VV and C-HH) suggesting that the C-band SAR and multi-spectral approaches possess similar capabilities including tundra biomass retrieval. Errors might occur in specific settings as a result of high surface roughness, high photosynthetic activity in wetlands or high snow density. We therefore introduce a method for combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to address the ambiguities related to Arctic wetlands and barren rockfields. Snow-related deviations occur within tundra fire scars in permafrost areas in the case of C-VV use. The impact decreases with age of the fire scar, following permafrost and vegetation recovery. The evaluation of masked C-VV retrievals across different regions, tundra types and sources (in situ and circumpolar vegetation community classification from satellite data) suggests pan-Arctic applicability to map current conditions for heights up to 160 cm. The presented methodology will allow for new applications and provide advanced insight into changing environmental conditions in the Arctic.

TI  - Toward the Detection of Permafrost Using Land-Surface Temperature Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is degrading under current warming conditions, disrupting infrastructure, releasing carbon from soils, and altering seasonal water availability. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively map the change in the extent and depth of permafrost. We used satellite images of land-surface temperature to recognize and map the zero curtain, i.e., the isothermal period of ground temperature during seasonal freeze and thaw, as a precursor for delineating permafrost boundaries from remotely sensed thermal-infrared data. The phase transition of moisture in the ground allows the zero curtain to occur when near-surface soil moisture thaws or freezes, and also when ice-rich permafrost thaws or freezes. We propose that mapping the zero curtain is a precursor to mapping permafrost at shallow depths. We used ASTER and a MODIS-Aqua daily afternoon land-surface temperature (LST) timeseries to recognize the zero curtain at the 1-km scale as a "proof of concept." Our regional mapping of the zero curtain over an area around the 7000 m high volcano Ojos del Salado in Chile suggests that the zero curtain can be mapped over arid regions of the world. It also indicates that surface heterogeneity, snow cover, and cloud cover can hinder the effectiveness of our approach. To be of practical use in many areas, it may be helpful to reduce the topographic and compositional heterogeneity in order to increase the LST accuracy. The necessary finer spatial resolution to reduce these problems is provided by ASTER (90 m).

TI  - Nanosystems for Improved Targeted Therapies in Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with limited therapeutic options. Since its incidence has been rapidly rising in recent years, the study of new targeted therapeutic strategies has increased. The implication of nanoscience in the development of alternative targeted therapies for melanoma has multiple benefits and could significantly improve the outcome of melanoma patients. In this paper, we review the most recent progress in the field of targeted therapies, emphasizing the impact of nanoscale materials on the targeting and controlled release of anti-tumor drugs. The applications of nanomedicine in the management of melanoma are extensive and refer to sentinel lymph node mapping, chemotherapy, and RNA interference; each of these applications harboring the potential to develop efficient and personalized diagnostic techniques and therapies. Further research, especially in clinical trials, is needed to establish whether fighting melanoma on the nanoscale level represents the key to reaching a critical inflection point in mankind's battle with metastatic melanoma.

TI  - A Double-Thermostad Warm-Core Ring of the Gulf Stream
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - An unusual double-thermostad warm-core ring of the Gulf Stream was discovered in the Slope Sea, south of Georges Bank, during the R/V Endeavor cruise 578 in May 2016. The ring's stratification was peculiar as it included two thermostads at, respectively, 100-200 m (core T = 18.14 degrees C, S = 36.52) and 250-500 m (core T = 16.70 degrees C, S = 36.35). Extensive use of satellite data (SST imagery and SSH maps) allowed the life history of this ring to be reconstructed, with independent SST and SSH data mutually corroborating each other. The double-thermostad ring was formed by vertical alignment of two preexisting warm-core anticyclonic rings of the Gulf Stream. The first ring spawned by the Gulf Stream in February has cooled by similar to 2 degrees C before merging in April with the second ring spawned by the Gulf Stream in March. During vertical alignment of these rings, the warmer ring overrode the colder ring, thereby forming the double-thermostad ring surveyed in May 2016. From ADCP sections through the ring, the upper and lower thermostads had different core relative vorticities of -0.65f and -0.77f, respectively, where f is the local Coriolis parameter. An in-depth literature survey has confirmed that this is the first report of a double-thermostad warm-core ring of the Gulf Stream and one of the best-documented cases of vertical alignment of two eddies ever observed in the World Ocean.

TI  - Role of gamma probe-assisted intraoperative sentinel lymph node evaluation in predicting axillary breast cancer metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy is a universally accepted technique to identify patients who are candidates for axillary lymph node dissection during breast cancer surgery. However, there is controversy over its use in patients who underwent preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This study aimed to examine the diagnostic value of gamma probe-assisted intraoperative sentinel lymph node examination with frozen section in breast cancer patients who had undergone preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods This retrospective study included 94 tumors diagnosed with stage IIA, IIB or IIIA invasive breast cancer with locoregional lymph node metastasis who underwent surgical treatment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Intraoperatively, axillary sentinel lymph node sampling was done using radioactive colloid and gamma probe and materials were examined with frozen section method. Patients with positive sentinel nodes underwent axillary resection. Histopathological examination of all surgical samples was done postoperatively. Results In 87 of 94 tumors (92.6%), a sentinel lymph node could be identified using the method. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the method for predicting axillary macro metastasis were 85.7, 86.5 and 86.2%, respectively, with 5.7% false negative rate. Conclusions Sentinel lymph node identification using preoperative scintigraphy and intraoperative use of gamma probe seems to be a feasible and efficient method in terms of differentiating patients that require axillary lymph node dissection during breast cancer surgery, even when they have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further large prospective studies allowing subgroup analyses are warranted.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites that make significant contributions to the global persistence of biodiversity, but identification of sites alone is not sufficient to ensure their conservation. Monitoring is essential if pressures on these sites are to be identified, priorities set and appropriate responses developed. Here, we describe how analysis of freely available data on a cloud-processing platform (Google Earth Engine) can be used to assess changes in three example remotely sensed threat indicators (fire frequency, tree loss and night-time lights) over time on KBAs in Africa. We develop easily repeatable methods with shared code that could be applied across any geographic area and could be adapted and applied to other datasets as they become available. Fire frequency was found to have increased significantly on 12.4% of KBAs and 15.9% of ecoregions, whilst rates of forest loss increased significantly on 24.3% of KBAs and 22.6% of ecoregions. There was also evidence of significant increases in night-time lights on over half (53.3%) of KBAs and 39.6% of ecoregions between 1992 and 2013, and on 11.6% of KBAs and 53.0% of ecoregions between 2014 and 2018.

TI  - Monte Carlo-Based Quantification of Uncertainties in Determining Ocean Remote Sensing Reflectance from Underwater Fixed-Depth Radiometry Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new framework that enables evaluation of the in situ ocean color radiometry measurement uncertainty is presented. The study was conducted on the multispectral data from a permanent mooring deployed in clear open ocean water. The uncertainty is evaluated for each component of the measurement equation and data processing step that leads to deriving the remote sensing reflectance. The Monte Carlo method was selected to handle the data complexity such as correlation and nonlinearity in an efficient manner. The results are presented for a prescreened dataset that is suitable for system vicarious calibration applications. The framework provides uncertainty value per measurement taking into consideration environmental conditions present during acquisition. A summary value is calculated from the statistics of the individual uncertainties per each spectral channel. This summary value is below 4% (k = 1) for the blue and green spectral range. For the red spectral channels, the summary uncertainty value increases to approximately 5%. The presented method helps to understand the significance of various uncertainty components and to provide a way of identifying major contributors. This can be used for efficient system performance improvement in the future.

TI  - A semi-empirical approach for modeling the vegetation thermal infrared directional anisotropy of canopies based on using vegetation indices
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of the surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiance provides an estimate of the land surface temperature (LST). However, any TIR measurement must be acquired under a certain geometry observation, which may refer to strong directional anisotropies. Although physical radiative transfer models can provide high precision directional brightness temperature simulation, they are too complex for processing large volumes of satellite data. With the objective to compare TIR measures acquired under different viewing angles, the topic of angular normalization issue for retrieved LSTs could be treated based on semi-empirical modelling. In this paper, we consider such category of models to simulate the directional anisotropy of surface brightness temperatures in combination with visible and near-infrared (VNIR) data. In these models, the vegetation fraction and the hot spot effect are depicted by a vegetation index and a brightness factor, respectively. An evaluation of the method is performed with both synthetic and measured datasets. The directional anisotropies that are fitted by this semi-empirical model demonstrate good agreement with an extensive synthetic dataset that is generated with the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model. An evaluation using airborne multi-angle TIR data also reveals that this model performs well when predicting BT directional anisotropies, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of less than 0.31 degrees C over a maize-planted area. Relative to Roujean-Lagouarde (RL) and Vinnikov models using only TIR data, the proposed model offers better performances. In addition, for future use with satellite data, the proposed model using observations at different times and the combination with VNIR BRDF model are also evaluated, and good results are obtained. It yields a promising approach for the angular normalization of LST and mosaics of fine-scale images.

AB  - The mandate of the ICRC as granted by the Geneva Conventions is to act as a 'guardian of International Humanitarian Law' on the frontlines of conflicts. While its humanitarian relief operations have contributed to its international reputation, this monitoring function is rather unknown to the public. In this paper, I pay specific attention to activities carried out by ICRC delegates to protect various categories of victims in times of war. By focusing on the ways in which delegates interpret the principles ('neutrality', 'impartiality', 'confidentiality') that guide their actions, I seek to decipher the organisation's ethos and worldview. I highlight the hopes as well as the frustrations and disappointments generated by myriad administrative techniques devised to engage parties to a conflict in a 'confidential dialogue' on the conduct of hostilities. Finally, I examine how these techniques, built on the hope in the possibility of communication, are changing as a result of external sources of pressure for 'evidence-based programming', turning personalised case-based monitoring into a new form of 'audit culture' based on statistical evidence. Paradoxically, relying on numbers to realise the utopia of 'humanising war' makes the very 'humans' who are supposed to benefit from it disappear from view.

T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of illustrated examples is presented here to demonstrate the capabilities of ground-level monitoring using InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar). Greater London is an ideal area to demonstrate and validate measurements derived using InSAR; its continuous urban fabric and the regular acquisition of SAR images from high-resolution sensors, such as TerraSAR-X, allows detection and monitoring of over 1.7 million measurement points with millimetre-scale accuracy. The results, some of which are shown here, reveal fascinating spatial and temporal patterns of ground motion across London and demonstrate the benefit of using high-resolution InSAR technologies in engineering applications. Interpreting the motion patterns can be challenging, however, owing to their complex and sometimes mysterious causes; we therefore welcome any assistance in doing so and we hope this photographic feature serves to trigger interest.Thematic collection: This article is part of the Measurement and monitoring collection available at: https://www.lyellcollection.org/cc/measurement-and-monitoring.

TI  - Mapping and Quantifying the Human-Environment Interactions in Middle Egypt Using Machine Learning and Satellite Data Fusion Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth in rural areas of Egypt is rapidly transforming the landscape. New cities are appearing in desert areas while existing cities and villages within the Nile floodplain are growing and pushing agricultural areas into the desert. To enable control and planning of the urban transformation, these rapid changes need to be mapped with high precision and frequency. Urban detection in rural areas in optical remote sensing is problematic when urban structures are built using the same materials as their surroundings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-temporal classification approach based on satellite data fusion and artificial neural networks. We applied the proposed methodology to data of the Egyptian regions of El-Minya and part of Asyut governorates collected from 1998 until 2015. The produced multi-temporal land cover maps capture the evolution of the area and improve the urban detection of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Sentinel-2 Prototype Land Cover 20 m map of Africa and the Global Human Settlements Layer from the Joint Research Center (JRC). The extension of urban and agricultural areas increased over 65 km(2) and 200 km(2), respectively, during the entire period, with an accelerated increase analysed during the last period (2010-2015). Finally, we identified the trends in urban population density as well as the relationship between farmed and built-up land.

TI  - Factors associated with sentinel lymph node status and prognostic role of completion lymph node dissection for thick melanoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is useful for the prognostic stratification of patients with thick melanoma. Identifying which variables are associated with SLN involvement and establishing risk in different subgroups of patients could be useful for guiding the indication of SLN biopsy. The value of complete lymph node dissection (CLND) in patients with a positive SLN biopsy is currently under debate.Materials and methods: To identify factors associated with SLN involvement in thick melanoma we performed a multicentric retrospective cohort study involving 660 patients with thick melanoma who had undergone SLN biopsy. To analyze the role of CLND in thick melanoma patients with a positive SLN biopsy, we built a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model for melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and compared 217 patients who had undergone CLND with 44 who had not.Results: The logistic regression analysis showed that age, histologic subtype, ulceration, microscopic satellitosis, and lymphovascular invasion were associated with nodal disease. The CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) decision tree showed ulceration to be the most important predictor of lymphatic involvement. For nonulcerated melanomas, the histologic subtype lentigo maligna melanoma was associated with a low rate of SLN involvement (4.3%). No significant differences were observed for DFS and MSS between the CLND performed and not-performed groups. Nodal status on CLND was associated with differences in DFS and MSS rates.Conclusion: We identified subgroups of thick melanoma patients with a low likelihood of SLN involvement. CLND does not offer survival benefit, but provides prognostic information. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Field Study of Mass Balance, and Hydrology of the West Khangri Nup Glacier (Khumbu, Everest)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The depiction of glaciers' dynamics in the high altitudes of Himalaya and the hydrological fluxes therein is often limited. Although sparse seasonal (snow/ice) melt data may be available, dense precipitation networks are not available everywhere, and especially in the highest area, and the assessment of accumulation processes and mass balance may be difficult. Hydrological fluxes are little measured in the high altitudes, and few studies are available covering flow modeling and flow partitioning. Here, we investigate the snow accumulation, ice melt, and mass balance of West Khangri Nup (WKN) glacier (0.23 km(2), mean altitude 5494 m asl), which is a part of the Khumbu glacier in the Everest region, where information of precipitation and hydro-glaciological dynamics in the highest altitudes was made available recently in fulfillment of several research projects. Weather, glaciological, snow pits, hydrologic, and isotopic data gathered during field campaigns (2010-2014) on the glacier and at the EVK2CNR Pyramid site were used to (i) set up the Poli-Hydro glacio-hydrological model to describe ice and snow melt and hydrological flows from the glacier, and (ii) investigate seasonal snow dynamics on this high region of the glacier. Coupling ice ablation data and Poli-Hydro simulation for ca. 5 years (January 2010-June 2014), we estimate that the WKN depleted ca.-10.46 m of ice water equivalent per year m IWE year(-1) (i.e., annually ca. -2.32 meter of water equivalent per year m WE year(-1)). Then, using snowpack density and isotopic (delta O-18) profiles on the WKN, we demonstrate that the local snowpack is recent (Fall-Winter 2013-2014) and that significant snow accumulation did not occur recently, so this area has not been a significant one of accumulation recently. Analysis of recent snow cover from LANDSAT images also confirms snow dynamics as depicted. Our study presents original data and results, and it complements present studies covering glaciers' mass balance as well as an investigation of accumulation zones in the Everest region and the Himalayas, which is also potentially helpful in the assessment of future dynamics under ongoing climate change.

TI  - Submesoscale processes in the coastal margins of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Trafalgar - Alboran connection
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present manuscript analyses the role of the submesoscale hydrodynamic patterns close to the coastal margin of the Strait of Gibraltar in the exchange of properties between the western side of the Strait and the western Alboran Sea. To achieve this goal a multi-approach analysis was performed using several datasets obtained during an oceanographic survey, drifters, satellite data and numerical simulation experiments.Three areas were identified: Trafalgar, Camarinal and the north-western corner of the Alboran Sea, in which the water exhibits a high residence time and relatively high phytoplankton concentrations. In addition, evidence of transport processes that take place along the coastal margin is shown between Trafalgar and the Alboran Sea, These transport processes seem to connect the phytoplankton that grows in the Gulf of Cadiz strip, in response to the nutrients supplied by the Guadalquivir River, to the phytoplankton populations in the western Alboran Sea. Furthermore, the transport of properties along this margin is dearly disrupted by strong and persistent easterly winds.

TI  - Beyond deforestation: Land cover transitions in Mexico
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conversion of land cover is one of the main causes of global environmental change and identifying the regions where sustained trends of land change are occurring provides useful information for land and resources management. For all ecoregions in Mexico, we analyzed land use changes over 14 years (2001-2014) using MODIS images (250 m) and identified regions that had significant gains or loss of woody vegetation, pasturelands, or croplands. The land use patterns varied greatly among the 40 major ecoregions, but in general, woody vegetation and cropland cover increased while pastures decreased. In contrast to previous studies, much of the increase in croplands did not correspond with hotspots of decline in pastures but occurred in the Sonora and Chihuahuan deserts ecoregions in northern Mexico. Industrial cotton, sorghum, and pecans production for export where the major crops responsible for the increase in these ecoregions. Similar to patterns in the rest of Latin America, pasture expansion mainly occurred in ecoregions in the tropical moist forest biome (e.g. Veracruz and PetenVeracruz ecoregions). The ecoregions that experienced the greatest increase in woody vegetation were the Balsas dry forest ecoregion along the Pacific coast and Trans Mexican volcanic oak-pine ecoregion. In both regions, rural-urban migration appears to be an important driver of the transition from grasslands to woody vegetation, while the conversion of croplands to woody vegetation in the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion was clearly associated with drug related violence. This study documents how the complex interactions among national and international demand for agricultural products, national policies, demography, violence and climate change are affecting land change across Mexico.

TI  - Reconstruction and Characterization of Full-Length Begomovirus and Alphasatellite Genomes Infecting Pepper through Metagenomics
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In northwestern Argentina (NWA), pepper crops are threatened by the emergence of begomoviruses due to the spread of its vector, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). The genus Begomovirus includes pathogens that can have a monopartite or bipartite genome and are occasionally associated with sub-viral particles called satellites. This study characterized the diversity of begomovirus and alphasatellite species infecting pepper in NWA using a metagenomic approach. Using RCA-NGS (rolling circle amplification-next generation sequencing), 19 full-length begomovirus genomes (DNA-A and DNA-B) and one alphasatellite were assembled. This ecogenomic approach revealed six begomoviruses in single infections: soybean blistering mosaic virus (SbBMV), tomato yellow spot virus (ToYSV), tomato yellow vein streak virus (ToYVSV), tomato dwarf leaf virus (ToDfLV), sida golden mosaic Brazil virus (SiGMBRV), and a new proposed species, named pepper blistering leaf virus (PepBLV). SbBMV was the most frequently detected species, followed by ToYSV. Moreover, a new alphasatellite associated with ToYSV, named tomato yellow spot alphasatellite 2 (ToYSA-2), was reported for the first time in Argentina. For the Americas, this was the first report of an alphasatellite found in a crop (pepper) and in a weed (Leonurus japonicus). We also detected intra-species and inter-species recombination.

TI  - Land surface phenology from VEGETATION and PROBA-V data. Assessment over deciduous forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology has been widely retrieved although no consensus exists on the optimal satellite dataset and the method to extract phenology metrics. This study is the first comprehensive comparison of vegetation variables and methods to retrieve land surface phenology for 1999-2017 time series of Copernicus Global Land products derived from SPOT-VEGETATION and PROBA-V data. We investigated the sensitivity of phenology to (I) the input vegetation variable: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), and fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER); (II) the smoothing and gap filling method for deriving seasonal trajectories; and (III) the method to extract phonological metrics: thresholds based on a percentile of the annual amplitude of the vegetation variable, autoregressive moving averages, logistic function fitting, and first derivative methods. We validated the derived satellite phenological metrics (start of the season (SoS) and end of the season (EoS)) using available ground observations of Betula pendula, B. alleghaniensis, Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, and Quercus rubra in Europe (Pan-European PEP725 network) and the USA (National Phenology Network, USA-NPN). The threshold-based method applied to the smoothed and gap-filled LAI V2 time series agreed best with the ground phonology, with root mean square errors of (similar to)10 d and (similar to)25 d for the timing of SoS and EoS respectively. This research is expected to contribute for the operational retrieval of land surface phenology within the Copernicus Global Land Service.

TI  - Statistical approach of factors controlling drainage network patterns in arid areas. Application to the Eastern Anti Atlas (Morocco)
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have revealed that the complexity in the distribution of drainage network patterns is not random and controlled by major parameters, variable in space but also throughout geological time. Drainage networks in the Eastern Anti-Atlas of Morocco consist of complex spatial arrangements with various types of patterns, such as trellis, angular, dendritic and parallel. The objective was to distinguish, quantify and rank the relationship that may exist between the different drainage networks patterns, geology and geomorphology. A total of 230 basins were extracted from the ASTER-GDEM Elevation Data (USGS), which were assigned 16 parameters reflecting their topography, morphometry, slope and geology. The statistical treatment of the dataset (16 variables x 230 observations) was carried out through principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), in order to investigate the complexity of drainage network patterns and their distribution. The PCA showed that the topographical, slope and geological parameters, i.e. primarily the parameter associated with structural control, best explains the variation in the type of the drainage pattern. The LDA made it possible to distinguish between the four types of drainage patterns with a success rate of 90%, using 3 discriminant functions that were better correlated with geological and slope parameters. LDA and AHC statistical treatments show confusion between the parallel, trellis and angular patterns, on the one hand, due to similar factors responsible for their formation, and on the other because of transitions phenomenon from one drainage pattern to another over time or space. Such possible drainage network shifting may be explained by the geological events that have occurred in the Eastern Anti Atlas from Lower Mesozoic to the Quaternary.

TI  - Assessing the ecological vulnerability of forest landscape to agricultural frontier expansion in the Central Highlands of Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation in human-dominated tropical landscapes ensures provision of major ecosystem services. However, conservation goals are threatened by growing demands for agricultural products. As the expansion of agricultural frontiers continues to exert increasing pressure on forest cover, it is crucial to provide indicators on forest vulnerability to improve our understanding of forest dynamics and prioritize management actions by local decision-makers. The purpose of this study is to develop a rigorous methodological framework to assess forest ecological vulnerability. We aim at evaluating the potential of remote sensing to characterize forest landscape dynamics in spatial and temporal dimensions. We present an innovative method that spatially integrates current landscape mosaic mapping with 45 years of landscape trajectories using Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. We derive indicators of exposure to cropland expansion, sensitivity linked with forest degradation and fragmentation, and forest capacity to respond based on forest landscape composition in Di Linh district in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. We map current forest-agricultural mosaics with high accuracy to assess landscape intensification (kappa index = 0.78). We also map the expansion of the agricultural frontier and highlighted heterogeneous agricultural encroachment on forested areas (kappa index = 0.72-0.93). Finally, we identify degradation and fragmentation trajectories that affect forest cover at different rates and intensity. Combined, these indicators pinpoint hotspots of forest vulnerability. This study provides tailored management responses and levers for action by local decision makers. The accessibility of multi-dimensional remote sensing data and the developed landscape approach open promising perspectives for continuously monitoring agricultural frontiers.

TI  - Field spectroscopy data from non-arable, grass-dominated objects in an intensively used agricultural landscape in East Anglia, UK
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Remote sensing of vegetation provides important information for ecological applications and environmental assessments. The association between vegetation composition and structure with its spectral signal can most fully be assessed with hyperspectral data. Particularly field spectroscopy data can improve such understanding as the spectral data can be linked with the vegetation under consideration without the geographic registration uncertainties of aerial or satellite imagery. The data provided in this article contain field spectroscopy measurements from non-arable, grass-dominated objects on four farms in an intensively used agricultural landscape in the South-East of the UK. Detailed data on the plant species composition of the objects are also supplied with this article to support further analysis. Reuse potential includes linking the vegetation data with the spectral response using spectral unmixing techniques to map certain plant species or including the field spectroscopy data in a larger study with data from a wider area. This data article is related to the paper 'Classifying grass-dominated habitats from remotely sensed data: the influence of spectral resolution, acquisition time and the vegetation classification system on accuracy and thematic resolution' (Bradter et al., 2019) in which the ability to classify the recorded vegetation from the field spectroscopy data was analysed.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Urban Wetlands in an Indian Megacity over the Past 50 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian megacities have attracted much scientific attention in the context of global urbanization, but few quantitative studies analyze wetland transformation in the rural-urban interface. With its rampant growth and transformation from a tree-lined "Garden City" to a busy megalopolis with often-blocked highways and large built-up areas, Bengaluru (Karnataka, S-India) is a good example for assessing how urbanization has led to the acute degradation of wetlands. We therefore investigated long-term land cover and wetland changes from 1965 to 2018 based on an object-based classification of multi-temporal Corona and Landsat images. To quantify and compare the dynamics of open water surfaces and vegetation, we defined the potential wetland areas (PWA) along the rural-urban gradient and linked our analyses to an index describing the degree of urbanization (survey stratification index (SSI)). During the five decades studied, built-up areas in the Bengaluru Urban district increased ten-fold, with the highest growth rate from 2014 to 2018 (+ 8% annual change). Patches of lake wetlands were highly dynamic in space and time, partly reflecting highly variable annual rainfall patterns ranging from 501 mm in 1965 to 1374 mm in 2005 and monsoon-driven alterations in the hydrologic regime. While water bodies and flooded areas shrunk from 64 km(2) in 1965 to 55 km(2) in 2018, in 1965, the total rural wetland area with an SSI > 0.5 was twice as high as in 2018. The rural-urban land cover pattern within potential wetland areas changed drastically during this period. This is reflected, for example, by a four-fold increase in the wetland area with an SSI of 0.3, as compared to a decline by 43% in wetland area with an SSI of 0.8. While, in urban areas, wetlands were mostly lost to construction, in areas with a rural character, open water bodies were mainly transformed into green space. The detected changes in urban wetlands were likely accompanied by ecological regime changes, triggering deteriorations in ecosystem services (ESS) which merit further research.

TI  - Rapid multispectral data sampling using Google Earth Engine
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of cloud-based GIS tools has enabled the rapid exploration and processing of geospatial datasets. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides a library of algorithms and a powerful application programming interface (API) to produce flexible cloud-based applications that leverage Google's computing infrastructure for geospatial analysis. We introduce "Spectral Point", a new GUI tool developed in GEE that allows users to explore, process and extract multispectral data rapidly within a single browser window. The ability to access and measure spectral signals from surface deposits using the entire available Landsat and Sentinel 2 archive is of tremendous benefit to geomorphic research, removing the need to download and process terabytes worth of imagery. Spectral values from composite imagery collected in GEE that relate to changes in surface mineral composition agree with corresponding point values using conventional desktop Landsat processing. The "Spectral Point" tool makes it fast and simple to extract quantitative, contrast-corrected brightness data from multispectral imagery compared conventional desktop-based approaches. At the same time, the user needs no experience developing code, proprietary third-party software or dedicated high-performance computing and only a modern web browser. The "Spectral Point" tool has many potential applications in the remote study of Earth's surface; for example, we explore a case study from the western United States that demonstrates how the tool can be used for mapping, geochronology, and estimating weathering rates for Quaternary landforms. With increasing numbers of satellites, we are now faced with a growing deluge of geospatial data. Cloud-based solutions to mapping, field reconnaissance and image processing will be increasingly necessary to handle this valuable but untapped satellite image resource. "Spectral Point" is an example of a new generation of web-based remote sensing tools available for Earth scientists, leveraging the revolution in cloud-based processing power and access to entire satellite image archives.

TI  - Intercomparison of Machine-Learning Methods for Estimating Surface Shortwave and Photosynthetically Active Radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived estimates of downward surface shortwave radiation (SSR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are a part of the surface radiation budget, an essential climate variable (ECV) required by climate and vegetation models. Ground measurements are insufficient for generating long-term, global measurements of surface radiation, primarily due to spatial limitations; however, remotely sensed Earth observations offer freely available, multi-day, global coverage of radiance that can be used to derive SSR and PAR estimates. Satellite-derived SSR and PAR estimates are generated by computing the radiative transfer inversion of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements, and require ancillary data on the atmospheric condition. To reduce computational costs, often the radiative transfer calculations are done offline and large look-up tables (LUTs) are generated to derive estimates more quickly. Recently studies have begun exploring the use of machine-learning techniques, such as neural networks, to try to improve computational efficiency. Here, nine machine-learning methods were tested to model SSR and PAR using minimal input data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) observations at 1 km spatial resolution. The aim was to reduce the input data requirements to create the most robust model possible. The bootstrap aggregated decision tree (Bagged Tree), Gaussian Process Regression, and Neural Network yielded the best results with minimal training data requirements: an R-2 of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.78 respectively, a bias of 0 +/- 6, 0 +/- 6, and 0 +/- 5 W/m(2), and an RMSE of 140 +/- 7, 135 +/- 8, and 138 +/- 7 W/m(2), respectively, for all-sky condition total surface shortwave radiation and viewing angles less than 55 degrees. Viewing angles above 55 degrees were excluded because the residual analysis showed exponential error growth above 55 degrees. A simple, robust model for estimating SSR and PAR using machine-learning methods is useful for a variety of climate system studies. Future studies may focus on developing high temporal resolution direct and diffuse estimates of SSR and PAR as most current models estimate only total SSR or PAR.

TI  - Monitoring Mega-Crown Leaf Turnover from Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns of tropical leaf renewal are poorly understood and poorly parameterized in modern Earth System Models due to lack of data. Remote sensing has great potential for sampling leaf phenology across tropical landscapes but until now has been impeded by lack of ground-truthing, cloudiness, poor spatial resolution, and the cryptic nature of incremental leaf turnover in many tropical plants. To our knowledge, satellite data have never been used to monitor individual crown leaf phenology in the tropics, an innovation that would be a major breakthrough for individual and species-level ecology and improve climate change predictions for the tropics. In this paper, we assessed whether satellite data can detect leaf turnover for individual trees using ground observations of a candidate tropical tree species, Moabi (Baillonella toxisperma), which has a mega-crown visible from space. We identified and delineated Moabi crowns at Lope NP, Gabon from satellite imagery using ground coordinates and extracted high spatial and temporal resolution, optical, and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) timeseries data for each tree. We normalized these data relative to the surrounding forest canopy and combined them with concurrent monthly crown observations of new, mature, and senescent leaves recorded from the ground. We analyzed the relationship between satellite and ground observations using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Ground observations of leaf turnover were significantly correlated with optical indices derived from Sentinel-2 optical data (the normalized difference vegetation index and the green leaf index), but not with SAR data derived from Sentinel-1. We demonstrate, perhaps for the first time, how the leaf phenology of individual large-canopied tropical trees can directly influence the spectral signature of satellite pixels through time. Additionally, while the level of uncertainty in our model predictions is still very high, we believe this study shows that we are near the threshold for orbital monitoring of individual crowns within tropical forests, even in challenging locations, such as cloudy Gabon. Further technical advances in remote sensing instruments into the spatial and temporal scales relevant to organismal biological processes will unlock great potential to improve our understanding of the Earth system.

TI  - Towards Routine Mapping of Shallow Bathymetry in Environments with Variable Turbidity: Contribution of Sentinel-2A/B Satellites Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has significant potential to enhance our knowledge of Earth's coastal regions. However, SDB still has limitations when applied to the turbid, but optically shallow, nearshore regions that encompass large areas of the world's coastal zone. Turbid water produces false shoaling in the imagery, constraining SDB for its routine application. This paper provides a framework that enables us to derive valid SDB over moderately turbid environments by using the high revisit time (5-day) of the Sentinel-2A/B twin mission from the Copernicus programme. The proposed methodology incorporates a robust atmospheric correction, a multi-scene compositing method to reduce the impact of turbidity, and a switching model to improve mapping in shallow water. Two study sites in United States are explored due to their varying water transparency conditions. Our results show that the approach yields accurate SDB, with median errors of under 0.5 m for depths 0-13 m when validated with lidar surveys, errors that favorably compare to uses of SDB in clear water. The approach allows for the semi-automated creation of bathymetric maps at 10 m spatial resolution, with manual intervention potentially limited only to the calibration to the absolute SDB. It also returns turbidity data to indicate areas that may still have residual shoaling bias. Because minimal in-situ information is required, this computationally-efficient technique has the potential for automated implementation, allowing rapid and repeated application in more environments than most existing methods, thereby helping with a range of issues in coastal research, management, and navigation.

TI  - Droughts Amplify Differences Between the Energy Balance Components of Amazon Forests and Croplands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts can exert a strong influence on the regional energy balance of the Amazon and Cerrado, as can the replacement of native vegetation by croplands. What remains unclear is how these two forcing factors interact and whether land cover changes fundamentally alter the sensitivity of the energy balance components to drought events. To fill this gap, we used remote sensing data to evaluate the impacts of drought on evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and albedo on cultivated areas, savannas, and forests. Our results (for seasonal drought) indicate that increases in monthly dryness across Mato Grosso state (southern Amazonia and northern Cerrado) drive greater increases in LST and albedo in croplands than in forests. Furthermore, during the 2007 and 2010 droughts, croplands became hotter (0.1-0.8 degrees C) than savannas (0.3-0.6 degrees C) and forests (0.2-0.3 degrees C). However, forest ET was consistently higher than ET in all other land uses. This finding likely indicates that forests can access deeper soil water during droughts. Overall, our findings suggest that forest remnants can play a fundamental role in the mitigation of the negative impacts of extreme drought events, contributing to a higher ET and lower LST.

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Advances in close-range and remote sensing technologies drive innovations in forest resource assessments and monitoring at varying scales. Data acquired with airborne and spaceborne platforms provide us with higher spatial resolution, more frequent coverage and increased spectral information. Recent developments in ground-based sensors have advanced three dimensional (3D) measurements, low-cost permanent systems and community-based monitoring of forests. The REDD+ mechanism has moved the remote sensing community in advancing and developing forest geospatial products which can be used by countries for the international reporting and national forest monitoring. However, there still is an urgent need to better understand the options and limitations of remote and close-range sensing techniques in the field of degradation and forest change assessment. This Special Issue contains 12 studies that provided insight into new advances in the field of remote sensing for forest management and REDD+. This includes developments into algorithm development using satellite data; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); airborne and terrestrial LiDAR; as well as forest reference emissions level (FREL) frameworks.

TI  - Prevention of Disasters Related to Extreme Natural Ground Deformation Events by Applying Spatial Modeling in Urban Areas (Quito, Ecuador)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is a spatial technique based on obtaining the phase differences of two radar images, acquired by a satellite from separate orbits and at different times, to obtain a ground displacement image of a study area, This image is called interferogram. On the other hand, space syntax is a technique within architecture that is applied to quantify and describe the level of ease of population movement through any urban space in a city. It analyzes the flow, transit, displacement, accessibility and concentration of the population in areas of basic services, health, security, commerce and entertainment. What would happen if an earthquake greater than 6 or 7 Moment Magnitude-Mw occurs in these areas of intense concentration of the population that are in buildings constructed on intense deformations of the land? With respect to the seismic risk in the city of Quito, many studies related to seismic risks have been published, but there are no studies that relate the deformation of the land (INSAR) with the space syntax, so this article presents a new vision in the joint application of these tools, a useful vision for urban planners and designers, considering the occurrence of a major earthquake in areas of buildings that are located on intense land deformations and have high population concentrations. This study has been prepared in two phases: in the first phase, the built-up areas concentrated in the greatest terrain deformations by accumulated displacement obtained using the APS estimation & multitemporal analysis by PSI-InSAR time series analysis methodology and Sentinel 1A and 1B satellite images were categorized. In the second phase, through the space syntax's theory and the use of DepthmapX, the movement patterns and traffic flows of the population were determined by means of graphs of spaces interconnected by streets (axial maps), to predict the spatial behavior of humans and its concentration in the mentioned sites. Finally, the results were integrated, determining the degree of exposure of the population found in built areas with high to very high displacement and an intense population concentration.

TI  - Assessing opportunities to support coral reef climate change refugia in MPAs: A case study at the Revillagigedo Archipelago
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reef refugia are habitats which possess physical, biological and ecological characteristics that make them likely to be relatively resilient to future climate change. Identification of refugia locations will be important to ensure suitable marine conservation planning is undertaken to protect sites where coral ecosystems will be better preserved now and in the future. This paper presents (1) a review of current knowledge of the oceanographic conditions and coral community in the Revillagigedo Archipelago Large Scale Marine Protected Area, (2) the first assessment of the potential for the Revillagigedo Archipelago to act as a climate refugia site for corals and coral reefs in the eastern tropical Pacific, and (3) consequent management and learning opportunities, to inform reef conservation both locally and globally. Through utilising published literature, remote and in situ environmental data, and field observations it was found that the Revillagigedo area exhibits a combination of distinctive characteristics in the coral community and in oceanographic processes which support conditions of refugia. The potential for refugia is further enhanced due to the absence of significant secondary anthropogenic stressors. This leads to a recommendation to establish the Revillagigedo as a globally significant 'sentinel site' where, through long-term monitoring of oceanographic conditions and of the coral and associated ecosystems, the effects of climate change can be quantified, and the effectiveness of specific refugia attributes established. This information may then be used to underpin the recognition of potential coral refugia elsewhere, and to guide MPA designation and management decisions to enhance their effectiveness.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background/purpose: The Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) is indicated for use as a cerebral protection device to capture and remove embolic material during transcatheter aortic valve procedures and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. Robust data on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure associated with the Sentinel device are limited.Methods/materials: We analyzed postmarketing surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2017 through 2019, yielding 43 reports.Results: Of the 43 reports of major complications involving Sentinel devices, 23 involved either death (3) or injury (20) related to the device. The 3 deaths were due to stroke, while 18 of the 20 injuries were reported as stroke. The other 20 reports were related to device modes of failure. Modes of failure were due to damaged device (5), difficulty retrieving/resheathing the device (5); package contamination (4), difficulty deploying the device (3), and, finally, complications with preparation (3).Conclusions: Our analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, the Sentinel Cerebral Protection System may be associated with complications, including death, stroke, vascular injury, and difficulties with the device itself. The MAUDE database serves as an important tool for both physicians and manufacturers to optimize performance and clinical outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Extending Landsat 8: Retrieval of an Orange <i>contra</i>-Band for Inland Water Quality Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 has found successful application in inland and coastal water remote sensing. Its radiometric specification and high spatial resolution allows quantification of water-leaving radiance while resolving small water bodies. However, its limited multispectral band set restricts the range of water quality parameters that can be retrieved. Identification of cyanobacteria biomass has been demonstrated for sensors with a band centered near 620 nm, the absorption peak of the diagnostic pigment phycocyanin. While OLI lacks such a band in the orange region, superposition of the available multispectral and panchromatic bands suggests that it can be calculated by a scaled difference. A set of 428 in situ spectra acquired in diverse lakes in Belgium and The Netherlands was used to develop and test an orange contra-band retrieval algorithm, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 5.39% and a bias of -0.88% in the presence of sensor noise. Atmospheric compensation error propagated to the orange contra-band was observed to maintain about the same magnitude (13% higher) observed for the red band and thus results in minimal additional effects for possible base line subtraction or band ratio algorithms for phycocyanin estimation. Generality of the algorithm for different reflectance shapes was tested against a set of published average coastal and inland Optical Water Types, showing robust retrieval for all but relatively clear water types (Secchi disk depth > 6 m and chlorophyll a<mml:semantics><1.6</mml:semantics> mg m<mml:semantics>-3</mml:semantics>). The algorithm was further validated with 79 matchups against the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) orange band for 10 globally distributed lakes. The retrieved band is shown to convey information independent from the adjacent bands under variable phycocyanin concentrations. An example application using Landsat 8 imagery is provided for a known cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Erie, US. The method is distributed in the ACOLITE atmospheric correction code. The contra-band approach is generic and can be applied to other sensors with overlapping bands. Recommendations are also provided for development of future sensors with broad spectral bands with the objective to maximize the accuracy of possible spectral enhancements.

TI  - MRI Volume Changes of Axillary Lymph Nodes as Predictor of Pathologic Complete Responses to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Early prediction of pathologic response can impact patient management and treatment planning for patients with breast cancer. This study analyzed patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (N = 132). Axillary lymph node initial volume could not discriminate between patients who achieved pathologic complete response and those who did not, whereas the rate of volume changes was informative.Introduction: Longitudinal monitoring of breast tumor volume over the course of chemotherapy is informative of pathologic response. This study aims to determine whether axillary lymph node (aLN) volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could augment the prediction accuracy of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: Level-2a curated data from the I-SPY-1 TRIAL (2002-2006) were used. Patients had stage 2 or 3 breast cancer. MRI was acquired pre-, during, and post-NAC. A subset with visible aLNs on MRI was identified (N = 132). Prediction of pathologic complete response (PCR) was made using breast tumor volume changes, nodal volume changes, and combined breast tumor and nodal volume changes with sub-stratification with and without large lymph nodes (3 mL or similar to 1.79 cm diameter cutoff). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to quantify prediction performance. Results: The rate of change of aLN and breast tumor volume were informative of pathologic response, with prediction being most informative early in treatment (area under the curve (AUC), 0.57-0.87) compared with later in treatment (AUC, 0.50-0.75). Larger aLN volume was associated with hormone receptor negativity, with the largest nodal volume for triple negative subtypes. Sub-stratification by node size improved predictive performance, with the best predictive model for large nodes having AUC of 0.87. Conclusion: aLN MRI offers clinically relevant information and has the potential to predict treatment response to NAC in patients with breast cancer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Glacial Aerodynamic Roughness Estimates: Uncertainty, Sensitivity, and Precision in Field Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculation of the sensible and latent heat (turbulent) fluxes is required in order to close the surface energy budget of glaciers and model glacial melt. The aerodynamic roughness length, z(0), is a key parameter in the bulk approach to calculating sensible heat flux; yet, z(0) is commonly considered simply as a tuning parameter or generalized between surfaces and over time. Spatially and temporally distributed observations of z(0) over ice are rare. Both direct (from wind towers and sonic anemometers) and indirect (from microtopographic surveys) measurements of z(0) are subject to sensitivities and uncertainties that are often unstated or overlooked. In this study, we present a quantitative evaluation of aerodynamic profile-based and microtopographic methods and their effect on z(0) using data collected from Storglaciaren and Sydostra Kaskasatjakkaglaciaren, Tarfala Valley, Arctic Sweden. Aggressive data filters discard most of the wind tower data but still produce realistic z(0) values of 1.9 mm and 2 mm. Despite uncertainty introduced by scale and resolution dependence, microtopographic methods produced estimates of z(0) comparable to wind tower values and those found on similar surfaces. We conclude that (1) in the absence of direct turbulent flux measurements from sonic anemometers, the profile and microtopographic methods provide realistic z(0) values, (2) both 2D and 3D microtopographic methods are dependent on scale, resolution, and the chosen detrending method, and (3) careful calibration of these parameters could enable glacier-wide investigations of z(0) from remotely sensed data, including those increasingly available from satellite platforms.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Images and GIS: Comparisons of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) has been widely and effectively implemented by machine learning (ML) models based on remote sensing (RS) images and Geographic Information System (GIS). However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability.

TI  - Evolution of evapotranspiration models using thermal and shortwave remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) from the land surface is an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle. Since the advent of Earth observation by satellites, various models have been developed to use thermal and shortwave remote sensing data for ET estimation. In this review, we provide a brief account of the key milestones in the history of remote sensing ET model development in two categories: temperature-based and conductance-based models. Temperature-based ET models utilize land surface temperature (LST) observed through thermal remote sensing to calculate the sensible heat flux from which ET is estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance or to estimate the evaporative fraction from which ET is derived from the available energy. Models of various complexities have been developed to estimate ET from surfaces of different vegetation fractions. One-source models combine soil and vegetation into a composite surface for ET estimation, while two-source models estimate ET of soil and vegetation components separately. Image contexture-based triangular and trapezoid models are simple and effective temperature-based ET models based on spatial and/or temporal variation patterns of LST. Several effective temporal scaling schemes are available for extending instantaneous temperature-based ET estimation to daily or longer time periods. Conductance-based ET models usually use the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation to estimate ET with shortwave remote sensing data. A key put to these models is canopy conductance to water vapor, which depends on canopy structure and leaf stomatal conductance. Shortwave remote sensing data are used to determine canopy structural parameters, and stomatal conductance can be estimated in different ways. Based on the principle of the coupling between carbon and water cycles, stomatal conductance can be reliably derived from the plant photosynthesis rate. Three types of photosynthesis models are available for deriving stomata] or canopy conductance: (1) big-leaf models for the total canopy conductance, (2) two-big-leaf models for canopy conductances for sunlit and shaded leaf groups, and (3) two-leaf models for stomatal conductances for the average sunlit and shaded leaves separately. Correspondingly, there are also big-leaf, two-big-leaf and two-leaf ET models based on these conductances. The main difference among them is the level of aggregation of conductances before the P-M equation is used for ET estimation, with big-leaf models having the highest aggregation. Since the relationship between ET and conductance is nonlinear, this aggregation causes negative bias errors, with the big-leaf models having the largest bias. It is apparent from the existing literature that two-leaf conductance-based ET models have the least bias in comparison with flux measurements. Based on this review, we make the following recommendations for future work: (1) improving key remote sensing products needed for ET mapping purposes, including soil moisture, foliage clumping index, and leaf carboxylation rate, (2) combining temperature-based and conductance-based models for regional ET estimation, (3) refining methodologies for tight coupling between carbon and water cycles, (4) fully utilizing vegetation structural and biochemical parameters that can now be reliably retrieved from shortwave remote sensing, and (5) to improve regional and global ET monitoring capacity.

TI  - A New Deep Learning Network for Automatic Bridge Detection from SAR Images Based on Balanced and Attention Mechanism
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bridge detection from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images has very important strategic significance and practical value, but there are still many challenges in end-to-end bridge detection. In this paper, a new deep learning-based network is proposed to identify bridges from SAR images, namely, multi-resolution attention and balance network (MABN). It mainly includes three parts, the attention and balanced feature pyramid (ABFP) network, the region proposal network (RPN), and the classification and regression. First, the ABFP network extracts various features from SAR images, which integrates the ResNeXt backbone network, balanced feature pyramid, and the attention mechanism. Second, extracted features are used by RPN to generate candidate boxes of different resolutions and fused. Furthermore, the candidate boxes are combined with the features extracted by the ABFP network through the region of interest (ROI) pooling strategy. Finally, the detection results of the bridges are produced by the classification and regression module. In addition, intersection over union (IOU) balanced sampling and balanced L1 loss functions are introduced for optimal training of the classification and regression network. In the experiment, TerraSAR data with 3-m resolution and Gaofen-3 data with 1-m resolution are used, and the results are compared with faster R-CNN and SSD. The proposed network has achieved the highest detection precision (P) and average precision (AP) among the three networks, as 0.877 and 0.896, respectively, with the recall rate (RR) as 0.917. Compared with the other two networks, the false alarm targets and missed targets of the proposed network in this paper are greatly reduced, so the precision is greatly improved.

TI  - A New Framework for Automatic Airports Extraction from SAR Images Using Multi-Level Dual Attention Mechanism
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of airports from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is of great significance in various research fields. However, it is challenging to distinguish the airport from surrounding objects in SAR images. In this paper, a new framework, multi-level and densely dual attention (MDDA) network is proposed to extract airport runway areas (runways, taxiways, and parking lots) in SAR images to achieve automatic airport detection. The framework consists of three parts: down-sampling of original SAR images, MDDA network for feature extraction and classification, and up-sampling of airports extraction results. First, down-sampling is employed to obtain a medium-resolution SAR image from the high-resolution SAR images to ensure the samples (500 x 500) can contain adequate information about airports. The dataset is then input to the MDDA network, which contains an encoder and a decoder. The encoder uses ResNet_101 to extract four-level features with different resolutions, and the decoder performs fusion and further feature extraction on these features. The decoder integrates the chained residual pooling network (CRP_Net) and the dual attention fusion and extraction (DAFE) module. The CRP_Net module mainly uses chained residual pooling and multi-feature fusion to extract advanced semantic features. In the DAFE module, position attention module (PAM) and channel attention mechanism (CAM) are combined with weighted filtering. The entire decoding network is constructed in a densely connected manner to enhance the gradient transmission among features and take full advantage of them. Finally, the airport results extracted by the decoding network were up-sampled by bilinear interpolation to accomplish airport extraction from high-resolution SAR images. To verify the proposed framework, experiments were performed using Gaofen-3 SAR images with 1 m resolution, and three different airports were selected for accuracy evaluation. The results showed that the mean pixels accuracy (MPA) and mean intersection over union (MIoU) of the MDDA network was 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, which is much higher than RefineNet and DeepLabV3. Therefore, MDDA can achieve automatic airport extraction from high-resolution SAR images with satisfying accuracy.

CP  - International Conference on Geo-Information Technology and its Applications (ICGITA)
CL  - Nanchang, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Diverse urban environmental elements provide health and amenity value for residents. People are willing to pay a premium for a better environment. Thus, it is essential to assess the benefits and values of these environmental elements. However, limited by the interpretability of the machine learning model, existing studies cannot fully excavate the complex nonlinear relationships between housing prices and environmental elements, as well as the spatial variations of impacts of urban environmental elements on housing prices. This study explored the impacts of urban environmental elements on residential housing prices based on multisource data in Shanghai. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was introduced to explain the impacts of urban environmental elements on housing prices. By combining the ensemble learning model and SHAP, the contributions of environmental characteristics derived from street view data and remote sensing data were computed and mapped. The experimental results show that all the urban environmental characteristics account for 16 percent of housing prices in Shanghai. The relationships between housing prices and two green characteristics (green view index from street view data and urban green coverage rate from remote sensing) are both nonlinear. Shanghai's homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for green only when the green view index or urban green coverage rate are of higher value. However, there are significant differences between the impacts of the green view index and urban green coverage rate on housing prices. The sky view index has a negative influence on housing prices, which is probably because the high-density and high-rise residential area often has better living facilities. Residents in Shanghai are willing to pay a premium for high urban water coverage. The case of Shanghai shows that the proposed framework is practical and efficient. This framework is believed to provide a tool to inform the decisions of housing buyers, property developers and policies concerning land-selling and buying, property development and urban environment improvement.

TI  - Human Activities and Climate Variability Affecting Inland Water Surface Area in a High Latitude River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal changes in the surface area of inland water bodies have important implications in regional water resources, flood control, and drought hazard prediction. Although inland water bodies have been investigated intensively, few studies have looked at the effect of human activities and climate variability on surface area of inland waters at a larger scale over time and space. In this study, we used MODIS (MOD13Q1) images to determine water surface area extent at 250 m spatial resolution. We then applied this algorithm with MOD13Q1 images taken at 16-day intervals from 2000 to 2018 to a large river basin in China's northeast high latitude region with dense stream network and abundant wetlands to investigate spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of inland water bodies. The study identified 209 ponds, lakes, and reservoirs with an average total surface area of 2080 km(2) in the past 19 years. The total water surface area fluctuated largely from 942 km(2) to 5169 km(2), corresponding to rainfall intensity and flood. We found that the total water surface area in this high latitude river basin showed an increasing trend during the study period, while the annual precipitation amount in the river basin also had an increasing trend concurrently. Precipitation and irrigation significantly contributed to the monthly change of water surface area, which reached the highest during June and August. The increase of water surface area was significant in the lower basin floodplain region, where agricultural irrigation using groundwater for rice production has progressed. Four nationally important wetland preserves (Zhalong, Xianghai, Momoge, and Chagan Lake) in the river basin made up nearly 50% of the basin's total water surface area, of which Zhalong, Xianghai, and Momoge are designated by The Ramsar Convention as wetland sites of international importance. Seasonally, these water bodies reached their maximal surface area in August, when both the monsoon weather and agricultural discharge prevailed. This study demonstrates that water surface area in a high latitude river basin is affected by both human activities and climate variation, implying that high latitude regions will likely experience more changes in surface water distribution as global climate change continues and agriculture becomes intensified.

TI  - Spatial variability and agglomeration of soil salinity in Minjiang estuary wetland, Southeast China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial variability and agglomeration of soil salinity is of great significance for the sustainable development of estuarine wetland. Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing image , digital elevation mode and soil surface samples of Minjiang estuary wetland of Fuzhou were used as the data sources. The correlation analysis and principal component analysis were combined to select significant environmental variables and to reduce their dimensions. We analyzed the spatial variability of soil salinity with support vector regression ordinary kriging model ( SVROK) and regression kriging model ( RIB) , and quantified spatial agglomeration of soil salinity by the spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results showed that three principal components ( PCs) extracted by the principal component analysis could explain at least 85% of the total variance in the original dataset and reflected the comprehensive information of vegetation cover, soil properties and topography. Both soil salinity and its residuals were affected by structural factors and random factors. The SVROK model based on principal component ( PCs) as input variables can more accurately reflect the spatial variability of soil salinity, with a trend of "higher in the north and lower in the south". The Moran' s I of soil salinity was more than 0.5 , with significant positive spatial autocorrelation and a higher spatial aggregation degree , displaying the spatial agglomeration characteristics of " high value agglomeration, high value widespread , high value surrounded by low value".

TI  - Construction of Nighttime Cloud Layer Height and Classification of Cloud Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A cloud structure construction algorithm adapted for the nighttime condition is proposed and evaluated. The algorithm expands the vertical information inferred from spaceborne radar and lidar via matching of infrared (IR) radiances and other properties at off-nadir locations with their counterparts that are collocated with active footprints. This nighttime spectral radiance matching (NSRM) method is tested using measurements from CloudSat/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Cloud layer heights are estimated up to 400 km on both sides of the ground track and reconstructed with the dead zone setting for an approximate evaluation of the reliability. By mimicking off-nadir pixels with a dead zone around pixels along the ground track, reconstruction of nadir profiles shows that, at 200 km from the ground track, the cloud top height (CTH) and the cloud base height (CBH) reconstructed by the NSRM method are within 1.49 km and 1.81 km of the original measurements, respectively. The constructed cloud structure is utilized for cloud classification in the nighttime. The same method is applied to the daytime measurements for comparison with collocated MODIS classification based on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) standard. The comparison of eight cloud types over the expanded distance shows good agreement in general.

TI  - Retrieval of Fine-Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in Semiarid Urban Areas Using Landsat Data: A Case Study in Urumqi, NW China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD) represents the light attenuation by aerosols and is an important threat to urban air quality, production activities, human health, and sustainable urban development in arid and semiarid regions. To some extent, the AOD reflects the extent of regional air pollution and is often characterized by significant spatiotemporal dynamics. However, detailed local AOD information is ambiguous at best due to limited monitoring techniques. Currently, the availability of abundant satellite data and constantly updated AOD extraction algorithms offer unprecedented perspectives for high-resolution AOD extraction and long-time series analysis. This study, based on the long-term sequence MOD09A1 data from 2010 to 2018 and lookup table generation, uses the improved deep blue algorithm (DB) to conduct fine-resolution (500 m) AOD (at 550 nm wavelength) remote sensing (RS) estimation on Landsat TM/OLI data from the Urumqi region, analyzes the spatiotemporal AOD variation characteristics in Urumqi and combines gray relational analysis (GRA) and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to analyze AOD influence factors and simulate pollutant propagation trajectories in representative periods. The results demonstrate that the improved DB algorithm has a high inversion accuracy for continuous AOD inversion at a high spatial resolution in urban areas. The spatial AOD distribution in Urumqi declines from urban to suburban areas, and higher AODs are concentrated in cities and along roads. Among these areas, Xinshi District has the highest AOD, and Urumqi County has the lowest AOD. The seasonal AOD variation characteristics are distinct, and the AOD order is spring (0.411) > summer (0.285) > autumn (0.203), with the largest variation in spring. The average AOD in Urumqi is 0.187, and the interannual variation generally shows an upward trend. However, from 2010 to 2018, AOD first declined gradually and then declined significantly. Thereafter, AOD reached its lowest value in 2015 (0.076), followed by a significant AOD increase, reaching a peak in 2016 (0.354). This shows that coal to natural gas (NG) project implementation in Urumqi promoted the improvement of Urumqi's atmospheric environment. According to GRA, the temperature has the largest impact on the AOD in Urumqi (0.699). Combined with the HYSPLIT model, it was found that the aerosols observed over Urumqi were associated with long-range transport from Central Asia, and these aerosols can affect the entire northern part of China through long-distance transport.

TI  - Research Progress for In-Flight Calibration of the Large View Polarized Multispectral Camera
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The large view, polarized and multispectral camera detects the angular and polarized two more dimensional information than a traditional optical multi-spectral camera, and has great advances especially in aerosol remote sensing. So, near the year of 2020, a number of satellites loading multi-angle and polarized camera would be launched in different countries. As a high quantitative sensor, its in-flight calibration has always been attractive. Due to the lack of onboard calibration instrument and the low spatial resolution, the natural scenery targets are selected to be vicarious optic references for the calibration. Multi-angel polarized camera has several parameters to be calibrated. The radiometric calibration of polarized camera includes intensity and polarization parameters. Different calibration parameters are calibrated using many natural targets by many methods which are developed in parallel. The Gaofen-5 launched in 2018 is the first satellite loading polarized sensor of China, also the only operational satellite in the world this time. In view of many new polarized camera aerospace plans in European and American countries and China, the vicarious calibration for polarized camera is necessary to overview. In this paper, the optical structure and the spectral settings of the large view, polarized and multispectral camera are presented. The optical transfer model of camera is introduced. The in-flight calibration theory and method of each camera parameter is classified into three categories including absolute radiometric intensity, relative radiometric intensity and polarization. For a specified calibration coefficient, the natural target and calibration flow are introduced for the in-flight calibration. The method system is formed for the in-flight radiometric calibration of the large view, polarized and multispectral camera. Also, the general validation methods of calibration are concluded. The inflight calibration of the new large view, polarized and multispectral camera will inherit the original research and use special natural scenery to carry out calibration. In the same kind of future remote sensing camera, new style in-flight radiometric calibration will be based on the instruments and its calibrator onboard the same satellite platform, ground-based artificial optical source and others. China, Europe and America have planned some future polarized camera, jointly considering the research basis of authors, preliminary design and prospects for the future on-orbit calibration method are given. A polarized multispectral camera mainly serves the remote sensing monitoring of atmospheric particulate matter, which is very important for the atmospheric environment problems currently concerned in China. A continuous in-flight calibration can ensure the accuracy of satellite remote sensing retrieved products. This overview of in-flight calibration research and the preliminary design for the future calibration method will provide method and model references for the remote sensing application system of the planned satellite.

TI  - Identification of Sugarcane with NDVI Time Series Based on HJ-1 CCD and MODIS Fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is currently difficult to acquire the clear-sky data with high spatial resolutions in spring and summer in the southern region of China, making it impossible to carry out timely and fine monitoring of sugarcane planting information. Thus, Fusui, a sugarcane producing county in Guangxi, was selected in this paper to analyze the NDVI characteristics and change rules during the whole growth period of sugarcane based on MODIS and HJ-1 CCD remote sensing data, which were fused into 30 m resolution NDVI time series data with high accuracy by using the spatial and temporal fusion model of multi-source remote sensing data ESTRAFM. In addition, the NDVI change rate and sample automatic training threshold were used to construct the sugarcane planting information identification model. The results showed that the fused images showed a high similarity with the observed images, indicating good fusion quality. Moreover, the correlation coefficients in the sugarcane planting area reached 0.953, and AD, AAD and SD were 0.033, 0.019 and 0.007, respectively. The NDVI change rate model was used to identify the sugarcane planting information in different time phases of 113 d, 129 d, 145 d, 193 d and 209 d in spring and summer, and the overall accuracy was 92.17%, 92.58%, 91.78%, 90.52% and 91.17%, respectively. The established model also achieved good results in 2017 with the overall accuracies are 88.44%, 87.79%, 89.79%, 88.34% for 113 d, 145 d, 193 d and 209 d.

TI  - An End-to-End Oil-Spill Monitoring Method for Multisensory Satellite Images Based on Deep Semantic Segmentation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote-sensing images, a detected oil-spill area is usually affected by spot noise and uneven intensity, which leads to poor segmentation of the oil-spill area. This paper introduced a deep semantic segmentation method that combined a deep-convolution neural network with the fully connected conditional random field to form an end-to-end connection. On the basis of Resnet, it first roughly segmented a multisource remote-sensing image as input by the deep convolutional neural network. Then, we used the Gaussian pairwise method and mean-field approximation. The conditional random field was established as the output of the recurrent neural network. The oil-spill area on the sea surface was monitored by the multisource remote-sensing image and was estimated by optical image. We experimentally compared the proposed method with other models on the dataset established by the multisensory satellite image. Results showed that the method improved classification accuracy and captured fine details of the oil-spill area. The mean intersection over the union was 82.1%, and the monitoring effect was obviously improved.

TI  - Research on an Urban Building Area Extraction Method with High-Resolution PolSAR Imaging Based on Adaptive Neighborhood Selection Neighborhoods for Preserving Embedding
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature extraction of an urban area is one of the most important directions of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) applications. Ahigh-resolution PolSAR image has the characteristics of high dimensions and nonlinearity. Therefore, to find intrinsic features for target recognition, a building area extraction method for PolSAR images based on the Adaptive Neighborhoods selection Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (ANSNPE) algorithm is proposed. First, 52 features are extracted by using the Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and five polarization decomposition methods. The feature set is divided into 20 dimensions, 36 dimensions, and 52 dimensions. Next, the ANSNPE algorithm is applied to the training samples, and the projection matrix is obtained for the test image to extract the new features. Lastly, the Support Vector machine (SVM) classifier and post processing are used to extract the building area, and the accuracy is evaluated. Comparative experiments are conducted using Radarsat-2, and the results show that the ANSNPE algorithm could effectively extract the building area and that it had a better generalization ability; the projection matrix is obtained using the training data and could be directly applied to the new sample, and the building area extraction accuracy is above 80%. The combination of polarization and texture features provide a wealth of information that is more conducive to the extraction of building areas.

TI  - Wall-to-wall spatial prediction of growing stock volume based on Italian National Forest Inventory plots and remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial predictions of forest variables are required for supporting modern national and sub-national forest planning strategies, especially in the framework of a climate change scenario. Nowadays methods for constructing wall-to-wall maps and calculating small-area estimates of forest parameters are becoming essential components of most advanced National Forest Inventory (NFI) programs. Such methods are based on the assumption of a relationship between the forest variables and predictor variables that are available for the entire forest area. Many commonly used predictors are based on data obtained from active or passive remote sensing technologies. Italy has almost 40% of its land area covered by forests. Because of the great diversity of Italian forests with respect to composition, structure and management and underlying climatic, morphological and soil conditions, a relevant question is whether methods successfully used in less complex temperate and boreal forests may be applied successfully at country level in Italy.For a study area of more than 48,657 km(2) in central Italy of which 43% is covered by forest, the study presents the results of a test regarding wall-to-wall, spatially explicit estimation of forest growing stock volume (GSV) based on field measurement of 1350 plots during the last Italian NFI. For the same area, we used potential predictor variables that are available across the whole of Italy: cloud-free mosaics of multispectral optical satellite imagery (Landsat 5 TM), microwave sensor data (JAXA PALSAR), a canopy height model (CHM) from satellite LiDAR, and auxiliary variables from climate, temperature and precipitation maps, soil maps, and a digital terrain model.Two non-parametric (random forests and k-NN) and two parametric (multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression) prediction methods were tested to produce wall-to-wall map of growing stock volume at 23-m resolution. Pixel level predictions were used to produce small-area, province-level model-assisted estimates. The performances of all the methods were compared in terms of percent root mean-square error using a leave-one-out procedure and an independent dataset was used for validation. Results were comparable to those available for other ecological regions using similar predictors, but random forests produced the most accurate results with a pixel level R-2 = 0.69 and RMSE% = 37.2% against the independent validation dataset. Model-assisted estimates were more precise than the original design-based estimates provided by the NFI.

TI  - Pathology of Melanoma
T2  - SURGICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy arising from melanocytes in the skin and rarely in extracutaneous sites. The understanding of pathology of melanoma has evolved over the years, with the initial classifications based on the clinical and microscopic features to the current use of immunohistochemistry and genetic sequencing. The depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis are still the most important prognostic features of melanoma. Other important prognostic features include ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, mitosis, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This article reviews the pathology of melanoma and its precursor lesions, along with the recent advances in pathologic diagnosis of melanoma.

TI  - Increasing omission of radiation therapy and sentinel node biopsy in elderly patients with early stage, hormone-positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prospective evidence demonstrates that there is limited benefit of axillary staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or radiation therapy (RT) in patients over age 70 with clinical stage I, hormone-positive breast cancer. The clinical impact of this literature is unknown. Our hypothesis is that omission of SLNB and RT has increased over time in these patients, and patient and tumor characteristics can predict when omission strategies are used. A single-center tumor registry was queried for all patients over age 70 with ER+, Her2/neu-negative, clinical T1N0 invasive breast cancer from 2009 to 2017, who underwent breast conservation (n = 141). Date of treatment, age, tumor characteristics, use of SLNB, and use of RT were evaluated. The trend of treatment strategy over time was evaluated. Multivariable analysis was performed on the subgroup of patients after publication of the long-term follow-up CALGB 9343 data(1). Patients undergoing treatment with omission of RT and SLNB increased over the study period (P = .0006). Patients who did not receive RT were older (78.76 years +/- 5.48 vs 73.37 +/- 3.63, P < .01). There was no difference between tumor grade and size between uses of RT. Of patients who received SLNB (n = 84), only 3 (3.5%) had a positive LN. On multivariable analysis of patients who were treated after publication of the CALGB 9343 data (2014-2017), only age was predictive of being treated with RT (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.88). Omission of both RT and SLNB are increasing in clinical practice in appropriately selected patients. The likelihood that patients are offered omission of these interventions increases with age. Low nodal positivity rates suggest that this strategy may be underutilized. Tumor grade and size were not predictive of omission of RT in this group of low-risk patients. Long-term data are needed as these approaches are increasingly adopted.

TI  - <i>God Loves not the Wrongdoers</i> (<i>zalimun</i>): Formulaic Repetition as a Rhetorical Strategy in the Qur'an
T2  - JOURNAL OF QURANIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qur'an contains various types of repetition. One of them is the formula, a sequence of words or roots that occurs more than once in a text corpus. The formula as a literary feature is applied differently throughout the Qur'anic text. In the later material, for example, formulae often function as so-called clausulae, i.e. concluding rhymed phrases of a long verse or passage that transform the discourse to a metatextual level. In this study, I suggest, through formulaic and semantic field analysis, that the Qur'an strategically uses such repeated formulae and clausulae as a versatile rhetorical tool to persuade its listeners of fundamental tenets that form part of the Qur' anic worldview: the formula is an indicator of a specific worldview, a carrier of this worldview's key messages. Through a case study of the 40 yultibbulla yultibbu (God loves/does not love) formulae in the Qur'an, the article shows that this short repeated phrase is used continually to remind the listeners of God's love (or lack of love) and the means by which it can be either obtained or lost. Even though the formula occurs in a multitude of thematic contexts, each time it is read or recited it transcends the message to a metatextual level, thereby engaging the listeners to make a choice regarding their own status. The Qur'anic employment of formulae should therefore be discussed not only as a stylistic characteristic of the text but also as part of a deliberate didactic and rhetorical strategy.

TI  - Towards the assimilation of satellite reflectance into semi-distributed ensemble snowpack simulations
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Snow Science Workshop (ISSW)
CL  - Innsbruck, AUSTRIA
AB  - Uncertainties of snowpack models and of their meteorological forcings limit their use by avalanche hazard forecasters, or for glaciological and hydrological studies. The spatialized simulations currently available for avalanche hazard forecasting are only assimilating sparse meteorological observations. As suggested by recent studies, their forecasting skills could be significantly improved by assimilating satellite data such as snow reflectances from satellites in the visible and the near-infrared spectra. Indeed, these data can help constrain the microstructural properties of surface snow and light absorbing impurities content, which in turn affect the surface energy and mass budgets. This paper investigates the prerequisites of satellite data assimilation into a detailed snowpack model. An ensemble version of Meteo-France operational snowpack forecasting system (named S2M) was built for this study. This operational system runs on topographic classes instead of grid points, so-called 'semi-distributed' approach. Each class corresponds to one of the 23 mountain massifs of the French Alps (about 1000 km(2) each), an altitudinal range (by step of 300 m) and aspect (by step of 45 degrees). We assess the feasability of satellite data assimilation in such a semi-distributed geometry. Ensemble simulations are compared with satellite observations from MODIS and Sentinel-2, and with in-situ reflectance observations. The study focuses on the 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 winters in the Grandes-Rousses massif. Substantial Pearson R-2 correlations (0.75-0.90) of MODIS observations with simulations are found over the domain. This suggests that assimilating it could have an impact on the spatialized snowpack forecasting system. However, observations contain significant biases (0.1-0.2 in reflectance) which prevent their direct assimilation. MODIS spectral band ratios seem to be much less biased. This may open the way to an operational assimilation of MODIS reflectances into the Meteo-France snowpack modelling system.

TI  - Progressive Disease in Sentinel-negative Melanoma Patients: Biological Differences and Importance of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Among the most important prognostic factors in melanoma is the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. Materials and Methods: Using our electronic database we identified 109 of 890 SLN-negative patients with progressive disease (PD). These patients were characterized for melanoma type, molecular type, sequence and extent of metastatic spread. Results: A total of 61 of 109 SLN-negative patients had PD in the SLN-basin indicating false-negative SLN (group-1). Forty eight of 109 patients had PD at distant sites and were therefore impossible to be identified using SLN biopsy (group-2). Despite distant spread these patients had significantly more single organ metastasis (p<0.001) and significantly longer disease-free-survival (p=0.001) compared to group-1. Additionally, to significant differences on a molecular basis between the two groups (p=0.01), all lentigo maligna and spindle-cell-melanomas belonged to group-2 and all, except one lentigo maligna melanoma, had single visceral metastasis. Conclusion: Two different biological groups among SLN-negative patients with PD were demonstrated. Extravascular-migratory-metastasis, rather than hematogenous spread, might be responsible for the observed PD with single organ involvement.

TI  - Discrimination of species composition types of a grazed pasture landscape using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Species composition is one of the important measurable indices of alpha diversity and hence aligns with the measurable Essential Biodiversity Variables meant to fulfil the Aichi Biodiversity Targets by 2020. Graziers also seek for pasture fields with varied species composition for their livestock, but visual determination of the species composition is not practicable for graziers with large fields. Consequently, this study demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (Si) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (S2) to discriminate pasture fields with single-species composition, two-species composition and multi-species composition for a pastoral landscape in Australia. The study used K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to evaluate the strengths of S1-alone and S2-alone features and the combination of these S1 and S2 features to discriminate the composition types. For the S1 experiment, KNN which was the reference classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 0.85 while RF and SVM produced 0.74 and 0.89, respectively. The S2 experiment produced accuracies higher than the Si in that the overall performance of the KNN classifier was 0.87 while RF and SVM were 0.93 and 0.89, respectively. The combination of the 51 and S2 features elicited the highest accuracy estimates of the classifiers in that the KNN classifier recorded 0.89 while RF and SVM produced 0.96 and 0.93, respectively. In conclusion, the inclusion of S1 features improve the classifiers created with S2 features only.

AB  - This article intends to draw up a study on the rescue of memory and ancestry present in the novel Poncia Vicencio by Conceicao Evaristo, during the character's life in the unfolding of the plot, taking into account the marks of ancestry that manifest themselves in Poncia, since childhood up to adulthood. The objective is to identify how the ancestral memory of Poncia Vicencio is rescued during the novel by Conceicao Evaristo. We have as a theoretical basis for the issues of mymoria Le Goff (1990), which helps us understand how personal and social memory is built over the years; Oliveira (2006), who deals with african worldview in Brazil, where he discusses a Brazilian Afrodescendant philosophy; besides Duarte; Fonseca (2003). For this, a documentary and bibliographic analysis was performed in a brief synthesis of the work seeking to understand the concepts of memory, ancestry, which motivated Poncia to leave for the capital, in addition to seeking to understand how the ancestral memory present in Conceicao Evaristo's novel occurred.

In this method, SDFC process is first applied to reduce the equivalent frequency and Radon chirp rate-quadratic chirp rate algorithm is then performed to obtain the estimates. Both simulated and real-data results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in the water and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere. Low spatio-temporal resolution, about 25-40 km and 2-3 days, of the commonly used global microwave SM products limits their application at regional scales. In this study, we developed an algorithm to improve the SM spatio-temporal resolution using multi-source remote sensing data and a machine-learning model named the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN). First, six high spatial resolution input variables, including Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Longitude (Lon) and Latitude (Lat), were selected and gap-filled to obtain high spatio-temporal resolution inputs. Then, the GRNN was trained at a low spatio-temporal resolution to obtain the relationship between SM and input variables. Finally, the trained GRNN was driven by the high spatio-temporal resolution input variables to obtain high spatio-temporal resolution SM. We used the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) SM over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) to test the algorithm. The results show that the algorithm could successfully improve the spatio-temporal resolution of FY-3B SM from 0.25 degrees and 2-3 days to 0.05 degrees and 1-day over the TP. The improved SM is consistent with the original product in terms of both spatial distribution and temporal variation. The high spatio-temporal resolution SM allows a better understanding of the diurnal and seasonal variations of SM at the regional scale, consequently enhancing ecological and hydrological applications, especially under climate change.

TI  - Mapping soybean planting area in midwest Brazil with remotely sensed images and phenology-based algorithm using the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean is the main crop of the Brazilian agribusiness. The near-real-time monitoring of this crop is important in the production estimate, identification of the progress, and location of the crops. It is also crucial for governmental surveillance institutions regarding sanitary break. Thus, this study aimed to estimate and map soybean areas in almost real time using temporal series multispectral images and vegetation indices (near-infrared and red) in the Google Earth Engine system in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. A multitemporal algorithm of the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) of MODIS, OLI, and MSI images of the 2016/2017 crop yr(-1) was created from the identification of soybean areas using the Perpendicular Crop Enhancement Index (PCEI). The use of the MODIS images for the monitoring of soybean areas using the Google Earth Engine platform was a viable and promising automated alternative for large-scale soybean area estimates.

TI  - Urban sprawl on natural lands: analyzing and predicting the trend of land use changes and sprawl in Mazandaran city region, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes, sprawl and its implications for natural lands (garden, agricultural and cultivated lands) have received increasing consideration in many countries and regions over the past decades. However, our knowledge of analysis of land use changes and urban sprawl resulted by the loss of natural land is still unclear specifically in developing countries such as Iran. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyze and predict the trend of land use changes and sprawl since 1986-2040 in Mazandaran city region in the northern part of Iran. In this regard, the SLEUTH and Land Transformation Models (LTM) were used to predict the use of natural lands. The data used in this study included satellite images of remote sensing (Landsat TM) in 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2015. Results show that the process of destruction of natural lands has intensified in favor of construction process, in a way that built-up lands with a growth rate of 4.79% changed from 30.91 km(2) in 1986 to 120.04 km(2) in 2015. It is predicted that built-up lands will increase by 4.82% growth in 2040. While, garden lands will have 1.3% decrease because of its adjacent to urban lands and locating in the built-up areas. Most changes in forest lands have been reduced by 1.8% if these lands are highly valued as national and regional potentials and may change the animal and plant species cycle. Agricultural lands have been reduced by 1.12%, but due to the fact that the largest share of land in the study area is cultivated and its decline is less than that of other lands. The trend of land use changes indicates that the region will inevitably develop and expand in the future. But, its consequences can be controlled by applying suitable policies and solutions.

TI  - Something old, something new: revisiting the diamondback moth (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) life table after 65 years
T2  - CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly 65 years ago, D.G. Harcourt developed the first of 74 life tables of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), on the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and at nearby sites. This work is cited whenever authors discuss the life history of the diamondback moth and its parasitoids in Canada. Since Harcourt's study, climate change, urbanisation, and crop diversity may have altered the population dynamics of both the diamondback moth and its natural enemy community in the original study area. To follow up on Harcourt's work, we used two approaches to build life tables to describe mortality factors in the field and the natural enemies attacking diamondback moth in Ottawa: destructive sampling of mature cabbage, Brassica oleracea Linnaeus (Brassicaceae), plants similar to Harcourt's approach and a modern sentinel-based approach with an enemy exclusion cage treatment. After 65 years, the primary parasitoids attacking diamondback moth remained the same, although more parasitoid diversity was revealed by the destructive sampling technique. Total mortality and parasitism levels also remained similar. In one notable difference, we attributed more diamondback mortality to predation. Overall, however, diamondback moth population dynamics have changed little in Ottawa in the decades since Harcourt's studies.

TI  - Quantifying the Relative Importance of Climate Change and Human Activities on Selected Wetland Ecosystems in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities are important factors driving changes in wetland ecosystems. It is therefore crucial to quantitatively characterize the relative importance of these stressors in wetlands. Previous such analyses have generally not distinguished between wetland types, or have focused on individual wetland types. In this study, three representative wetland areas of the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River Basin (HRB) were selected as the study area. An object-based classification was used with Landsat TM data to extract the spatial distribution of wetland in 1990, 2000 and 2010. We then quantified the relative importance of climate change and human activities on the wetlands by using the R package "relaimpo" package. The results indicated that: (1) the effects of human activities on wetland changes were greater (contribution rate of 63.57%) than climate change in the HRB. Specifically, there were differences in the relative importance of climate change and human activities for wetlands in different regions. Wetlands of the upper reaches were more affected by climate change, while wetlands in the middle and lower reaches were more affected by human activities; (2) climate change had a greater impact (contribution rate of 65.72%) on low intensity wetland loss, while human activities had a greater impact on moderate and severe intensity wetland loss, with respective contribution rates of 57.22% and 70.35%; (3) climate change had a larger effect on the shrub and forested wetland changes, with respective contribution rates of 58.33% and 52.58%. However, human activities had a larger effect on herbaceous wetland changes, with a contribution rate of 72.28%. Our study provides a useful framework for wetland assessment and management, and could be a useful tool for developing wetland utilization and protection approaches, particularly in sensitive environments in mid- and high-latitude areas.

TI  - Urban tree composition, diversity and structural characteristics in North-western Nigeria
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees composition and diversity are gaining more relevance for academic, urban planning and sustainability purposes. Despite their free ecosystem services, little is documented on urban trees especially in developing countries such as Nigeria. This study assessed the composition, diversity, structural characteristics and provenance of trees in two cities of North-western Nigeria. Landsat images for 2015 were used to classify each city into five broad land cover classes to facilitate stratified sampling. Data on tree species, height, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and provenance was collected from a total of 373 plots of 30 x 30 m dimension. A total of 1558 trees belonging to 56 species in 46 genera and 22 families were assessed with generally more categories of native than exotic species but higher populations of exotic stems. Azadirachta indica and Mangifera indica were the most dominant species in both cities while Meliaceae, Anacardiaceae, Fabaceae, Moraceae and Combretaceae were the dominant families. Lower diversity (H' = 1.8), lower evenness (J = 0.53) and lower mean density (42.4 trees/ha) were recorded in Sokoto compared to Zaria (H' = 3.30, J = 0.84 and density = 50.48 trees/ha). A one-way ANOVA revealed significant difference in these parameters across the land cover types within the cities except mean height which was not significantly different in Sokoto. An independent samples t-test also revealed significantly different mean height, diameter and Basal Area (BA) but similar plot densities between the cities. Urban tree composition, diversity and structural characteristics vary significantly between these two cities in North-western Nigeria and though exotic species have fewer categories, their stems are gradually dominating the cities. This may cause alterations in tree species composition and diversity and possibly, biotic homogenization. This calls for expanded tree planting with more emphasis on the native species.

TI  - Morphological change assessment from intertidal to river-dominated zones using multiple-satellite imagery: A case study of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding river bank and shoreline dynamics is important for ecological conservation, livelihood stabilization, water resources management and hazard mitigation, but this is always a difficult task because the river and coastal morphology is influenced by both natural processes and human activities. The Vietnamese Mekong Delta with its dense population of 17 million people and a complex river system under the impacts of both natural and artificial drivers was chosen as a case study to understand erosion and accretion mechanisms of deltas. Sedimentation plays a critical role in sustaining the livelihoods of population, biodiversity, and food production, but long-term and large-scale sediment dynamics studies on huge sediment starvation due to dams and sand mining were limited. Remote sensing data analysis with the cloud-computing-based Google Earth Engine for the period from 1989 to 2014 has exhibited that both regional and local drivers and hydrological characteristics of each region were responsible for river bank erosion and accretion. In the river-dominated zone, the levels of erosion and accretion are from medium rates (1-5 miyear) to high rates (> 5 miyear), and erosion processes commonly occur along the Mekong River branch (Tien River). In the tidal-dominated zone, the river banks were quite stable, and erosion processes with medium levels mainly occurred at river segments near estuaries, except for the Ba Lai estuary. In the coastal zone, erosion and sedimentation alternatively took place at a rapid rate. The main erosion mechanisms were toe-scour and lower slope erosion in the river-dominated zone, the tidal fluctuation-related soil collapses in the tidal-dominated zone, and monsoon-influenced erosion in the coastal zone. Engineering or alternative solutions should be chosen appropriately to maximize the efficiency of protection for each region, while more monitoring programs are required to provide more reliable data to study erosion and sedimentation processes.

TI  - The generalisability of randomised clinical trials: an interim external validity analysis of the ongoing SENOMAC trial in sentinel lymph node-positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose None of the key randomised trials on the omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in sentinel lymph-positive breast cancer have reported external validity, even though results indicate selection bias. Our aim was to assess the external validity of the ongoing randomised SENOMAC trial by comparing characteristics of Swedish SENOMAC trial participants with non-included eligible patients registered in the Swedish National Breast Cancer Register (NKBC). Methods In the ongoing non-inferiority European SENOMAC trial, clinically node-negative cT1-T3 breast cancer patients with up to two sentinel lymph node macrometastases are randomised to undergo completion ALND or not. Both breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy are eligible interventions. Data from NKBC were extracted for the years 2016 and 2017, and patient and tumour characteristics compared with Swedish trial participants from the same years. Results Overall, 306 NKBC cases from non-participating and 847 NKBC cases from participating sites (excluding SENOMAC participants) were compared with 463 SENOMAC trial participants. Patients belonging to the middle age groups (p = 0.015), with smaller tumours (p = 0.013) treated by breast-conserving therapy (50.3 versus 47.1 versus 65.2%, p < 0.001) and less nodal tumour burden (only 1 macrometastasis in 78.8 versus 79.9 versus 87.3%, p = 0.001) were over-represented in the trial population. Time trends indicated, however, that differences may be mitigated over time. Conclusions This interim external validity analysis specifically addresses selection mechanisms during an ongoing trial, potentially increasing generalisability by the time full accrual is reached. Similar validity checks should be an integral part of prospective clinical trials.

TI  - Ovitraps Provide a Reliable Estimate of <i>Wolbachia</i> Frequency during <i>w</i>MelBr Strain Deployment in a Geographically Isolated <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Population
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deployment of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia has been identified as a promising strategy to reduce dengue, chikungunya, and Zika transmission. We investigated whether sampling larvae from ovitraps can provide reliable estimates on Wolbachia frequency during releases, as compared to the expensive adult-based BG-Sentinel. We conducted pilot releases in a semi-field system (SFS) divided into six cages of 21 m(2), each with five ovitraps. Five treatments were chosen to represent different points of a hypothetical invasion curve: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of Wolbachia frequency. Collected eggs were counted and hatched, and the individuals from a net sample of 27% of larvae per treatment were screened for Wolbachia presence by RT-qPCR. Ovitrap positioning had no effect on egg hatching rate. Treatment strongly affected the number of eggs collected and also the hatching rate, especially when Wolbachia was at a 10% frequency. A second observation was done during the release of Wolbachia in Rio under a population replacement approach when bacterium frequency was estimated using 30 BG-Sentinel traps and 45 ovitraps simultaneously. By individually screening 35% (N = 3904) of larvae collected by RT-qPCR, we were able to produce a similar invasion curve to the one observed when all adults were individually screened. If sampling is reduced to 20%, monitoring Wolbachia frequency with 45 ovitraps would be roughly half the cost of screening all adult mosquitoes captured by 30 BG-Sentinels. Our findings support the scale-up of Wolbachia releases, especially in areas with limited resources to afford massive trapping with BG-Sentinel traps.

TI  - Coastal Turbidity Derived From PROBA-V Global Vegetation Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation) is a global vegetation monitoring satellite. The spectral quality of the data and the coverage of PROBA-V over coastal waters provide opportunities to expand its use to other applications. This study tests PROBA-V data for the retrieval of turbidity in the North Sea region. In the first step, clouds were masked and an atmospheric correction, using an adapted version of iCOR, was performed. The resulted water leaving radiance reflectance was validated against AERONET-OC stations, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.884 in the RED band. Next, turbidity values were retrieved using the RED band. The PROBA-V retrieved turbidity data was compared with turbidity data from CEFAS Smartbuoys and ad-hoc measurement campaigns. This resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.69. Finally, a time series of 1.5 year of PROBA-V derived turbidity data was plotted over MODIS data to check consistencies in both datasets. Seasonal dynamics were noted with high turbidity in autumn and winter and low values in spring and summer. For low values, PROBA-V and MODIS yielded similar results, but while MODIS seems to saturate around 50 FNU, PROBA-V can reach values up till almost 80 FNU.

TI  - Cloud Detection Based on High Resolution Stereo Pairs of the Geostationary Meteosat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the considerable impact of clouds on the energy balance in the atmosphere and on the earth surface, they are of great importance for various applications in meteorology or remote sensing. An important aspect of the cloud research studies is the detection of cloudy pixels from the processing of satellite images. In this research, we investigated a stereographic method on a new set of Meteosat images, namely the combination of the high resolution visible (HRV) channel of the Meteosat-8 Indian Ocean Data Coverage (IODC) as a stereo pair with the HRV channel of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Meteosat-10 image at 0 degrees E. In addition, an approach based on the outputs from stereo analysis was proposed to detect cloudy pixels. This approach is introduced with a 2D-scatterplot based on the parallax value and the minimum intersection distance. The mentioned scatterplot was applied to determine/detect cloudy pixels in various image subsets with different amounts of cloud cover. Apart from the general advantage of the applied stereography method, which only depends on geometric relationships, the cloud detection results are also improved because: (1) The stereo pair is the HRV bands of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) sensor, with the highest spatial resolution available from the Meteosat geostationary platform; and (2) the time difference between the image pairs is nearly 5 s, which improves the matching results and also decreases the effect of cloud movements. In order to prove this improvement, the results of this stereo-based approach were compared with three different reflectance-based target detection techniques, including the adaptive coherent estimator (ACE), constrained energy minimization (CEM), and matched filter (MF). The comparison of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) detection curves and the area under these curves (AUC) showed better detection results with the proposed method. The AUC value was 0.79, 0.90, 0.90, and 0.93 respectively for ACE, CEM, MF, and the proposed stereo-based detection approach. The results of this research shall enable a more realistic modelling of down-welling solar irradiance in the future.

TI  - Semi-automated detection of landslide timing using harmonic modelling of satellite imagery, Buckinghorse River, Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We manually detected and mapped 66 landslides from Landsat imagery over a 33-year period from 1985 to 2017 in the Buckinghorse River region, British Columbia, Canada. We semi-automatically determined landslide timing using the cumulative difference (CD) between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a fitted harmonic sinusoidal curve (CDNDVI). The semi-automated dating method was capable of determining the timing of 80% of the landslides using CDNDVI and 85% of the landslides after detrending CDNDVI (dCDNDVI). The CDNDVI method generally detects landslides too early and the dCDNDVI method is generally too late. Mean absolute errors (in days) are lower for the dCDNDVI (208 and 188) than the CDNDVI (227 and 267), respectively. This study, however, has many examples of extreme outliers with very large errors (> 1000 days). Our method is portable to other remote regions as long as vegetation anomalies can be used as an indicator for landslide activity. We conclude that the timeseries of images available in the Landsat Archive are useful for landslide mapping, but the pixel size limits the size of the landslides that can be mapped.

This study argues that information on the dynamics of ecosystem services is essential for understanding and monitoring the impact of land management. We studied two regulating ecosystem services (i. erosion prevention, ii. regulation of water flows) and two provisioning services (iii. provision of forage, iv. biomass for essential oil production) in thicket vegetation and agricultural fields in the Baviaanskloof, South Africa. Using models based on Sentinel-2 data, calibrated with field measurements, we estimated the monthly supply of ecosystem services and assessed their intra-annual variability within vegetation cover types. We illustrated how the dynamic supply of ecosystem services related to temporal variations in their demand. We also found large spatial variability of the ecosystem service supply within a single vegetation cover type. In contrast to thicket vegetation, agricultural land showed larger temporal and spatial variability in the ecosystem service supply due to the effect of more intensive management. Knowledge of intra-annual dynamics is essential to jointly assess the temporal variation of supply and demand throughout the year to evaluate if the provision of ecosystem services occurs when most needed.

TI  - Evaluation of ASTER GDEM2, SRTMv3.0, ALOS AW3D30 and TanDEM-X DEMs for the Peruvian Andes against highly accurate GNSS ground control points and geomorphological-hydrological metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an analysis for Peru of the vertical accuracy and derived geomorphological parameters of three, freely available Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with 30-m grid sizes and one commercially available 12-m DEM: ASTER GDEM2, SRTMv3.0 (hereafter called SRTM3), ALOS World 3D (AW3D30) and 12-m TanDEM-X. Their elevation values were compared against values measured with a dual-frequency Trimble 5800 Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver with two antennas in static relative positioning. A total of 139 ground control points (GCPs) with elevations of up to 4334 m above sea level (asl). were obtained from four topographically contrasting regions along the flat, arid coast, the semi-dry Andes and the Amazon rainforest. The combined results of the four areas showed that the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.907 m, SRTM3 5.113 m and AW3D30 6.246 m. For the two areas where TanDEM-X was investigated, a RMSE of 1.666 m was obtained. When considering each area individually, of the three 30-m DEMs, SRTM3 performed best in all areas, while ASTER GDEM2 was always performing worst. The standard deviation (SD) of the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 varied much more between the four study areas than the SD of SRTM3 and TanDEM-X. It was possible to establish linear correlations with R-2 > 0.95 between the GNSS-measured and DEM-derived elevation values for all areas and all DEMs, which can be used to correct ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 for Peru. No relationship was found between absolute elevation and residuals. Slope angle of > 15 degrees, however, correlated to much higher residuals for SRTM3 and AW3D30, whereas a constant increase in residual correlated to a constant increase in slope angle for TanDEM-X. In general, the highest residuals corresponded to the highest slope classes. A comparison of absolute elevation values and slope angles of selected areas between ASTER GDEM2 and SRTM3, as well as between AW3D30 and SRTM3, showed in all cases more deviation from true values in areas with steeper slopes. This effect seems independent of vegetation. The presence of buildings however, severely affected performance of ASTER GDEM2. For some areas, AW3D30 suffered from mismatch between adjacent scenes and horizontal and oblique stripping. An analysis of drainage networks showed that all three 30-m DEMs were capable of producing a similar number of Strahler orders, total number of channels, minimum and maximum channel length and accumulative channel length. All DEMs produced accurate networks in the upper reaches of the catchments, but suffered in flat areas such as wide fluvial valleys and sink-filled areas. ASTER GDEM2 in particular produced parallel river channels and unnatural short cuts. Our results agreed well with those of other studies elsewhere around the world and showed that i) the vertical error is much less than those officially reported for all DEMs; ii) slope is the most determinant factor in DEM accuracy. We conclude that SRTM3 delivers the most stable performance in almost all tests and is therefore the DEM of choice for landscape analysis in Peru. TanDEM-X 12 m performed very well in our elevation accuracy test and could become a worthy successor to SRTM3.

TI  - What caused differential impacts on high-speed railway station area development? Evidence from global nighttime light data
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of High-Speed Rail (HSR) to influence urban development has received considerable attention. However, due to lack of statistical data, there are few studies examining HSR-led urban development from a national perspective. Using the brightness of nighttime lights as a proxy for economic development, this manuscript begins to offer a more complete picture of development around 124 HSR station areas in China. Moreover, the manuscript explores the causes of different development patterns among China's HSR station areas. Empirical results reveal three main findings. 1) HSR station areas with high nighttime light brightness are mainly located in Beijing, Tianjin, Yangtze River delta city cluster and Pearl River delta city cluster. HSR station areas with relatively rapid growth in nighttime light brightness are mostly distributed in Hebei province, Henan province and Anhui province. 2) The level of urban economic development, the level of city rank and the location of HSR stations are three important factors affecting the development of HSR station areas. 3) The factors affecting the development of new and existing HSR station areas are distinct from one another. The influence of the overall urban economic development level on the development of new HSR station areas is larger than such influence on existing station areas where HSR has been added to existing infrastructure. The level of city ranking and the location of HSR stations significantly affect the development around new HSR stations, but have no significant impact on the development surrounding pre-existing HSR stations.

TI  - Geometry Aware Evaluation of Handcrafted Superpixel-Based Features and Convolutional Neural Networks for Land Cover Mapping Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In land cover mapping at a high spatial resolution, pixel values alone are not always sufficient to recognize the more complex classes. Contextual features (computed with a sliding kernel or other kind of spatial support) can be discriminating for certain land cover classes, for example, different levels of urban density, or classes containing heterogeneous pixels, such as orchards and vineyards. However, the reference data used for training the supervised classifier are almost always sparsely labeled, in other words, not every pixel of the training area is labeled. This makes the selection of an appropriate contextual classification method for land cover mapping problematic. Indeed, the current state-of-the art contextual classification model, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN), encounters issues when the geometry of the desired output is absent from the training set. Data-driven methods like D-CNN rely heavily on the availability of extensive training labels to learn both the feature extraction and classification steps. With a sparse training set, sharp corners are rounded, and thin elongated elements may be either thickened, or entirely lost. Alternatively, there are several methods based on the manual selection of contextual features in a chosen neighborhood, guided by the knowledge of the data and past experience from similar problems. Such approaches should not be as sensitive to sparsely labeled data, as they do not rely on any training data for feature extraction. This paper presents a new process for including contextual information in an image classification scheme: the Histogram Of Auto Context Classes in Superpixels (HACCS), which involves classifying an image using the local class histograms as contextual features. These histograms are calculated within superpixels of different sizes in order to provide a multi-scale characterization of the neighborhood, while preserving the geometry of the image objects. This method is evaluated on two data sets presenting different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions, and each case is compared with a D-CNN in terms of class accuracy, but also of the quality of the geometry in the produced map. Experiments on the Sentinel-2 time series show that HACCS provides equivalent thematic accuracy compared to the D-CNN, while exhibiting a higher degree of geometric accuracy. On very high spatial resolution imagery (SPOT-7), the D-CNN provides significantly stronger thematic accuracy, but this comes at the cost of a lower level of geometric accuracy.

TI  - Lower extremity lymphedema in patients with gynecologic malignancies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lower extremity lymphedema is a chronic, often irreversible condition that affects many patients treated for gynecologic malignancies, with published rates as high as 70% in select populations. It has consistently been shown to affect multiple quality of life metrics. This review focuses on the pathophysiology, incidence, trends, and risk factors associated with lower extremity lymphedema secondary to the treatment of cervical, endometrial, ovarian, and vulvar cancers in the era of sentinel lymph node mapping. We review traditional and contemporary approaches to diagnosis and staging, and discuss new technologies and imaging modalities. Finally, we review the data-based treatment of lower extremity lymphedema and discuss experimental treatments currently being developed. This review highlights the need for more prospective studies and objective metrics, so that we may better evaluate and serve these patients.

TI  - Inferring the Creep Settlement Behavior of Rockfill in Reclaimed Lands by Advanced SAR Interferometry and Numerical Modeling: An Example from Arabian Gulf
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Advanced Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (A-DInSAR) is becaming a key-technique for monitoring ground deformations. The potential of A-DInSAR for settlement monitoring is exploited in this paper through the investigation of a reclaimed land in Dubai (UAE). Time histories of displacements were obtained from COSMO-SkyMed satellite images over the period between 2011 to 2016, allowing to derive the long-term deformation of the entire artificial island. Special attention was paid on long-term settlement of the hydraulically-placed rockfill of the peripheral rubble-mound revetments. The A-DInSAR results have been compared with results derived from numerical analyses and with field surveys, proving the relation between observed and modeled displacements. The study has also revealed that rockfill long-term settlement (creep) rate is significantly dependent on the aging (time since placement). In the analyzed time-frame (2011-2016) it has been observed that recently placed rockfill experienced creep rate up to ten times higher than the creep rate measured for similar rockfill structures placed 30 years earlier. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that static compression by preloading and dynamic or impact densification induced by wave forces proved to have also a significant impact on reducing the creep rate of the rockfill.

TI  - Catching Geomorphological Response to Volcanic Activity on Steep Slope Volcanoes Using Multi-Platform Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geomorphological evolution of the volcanic Island of Stromboli (Italy) between July 2010 and June 2019 has been reconstructed by using multi-temporal, multi-platform remote sensing data. Digital elevation models (DEMs) from PLEIADES-1 tri-stereo images and from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions allowed for topographic changes estimation. Data were comprised of high-spatial-resolution (QUICKBIRD) and moderate spatial resolution (SENTINEL-2) satellite images that allowed for the mapping of areas that were affected by major lithological and morphological changes. PLEIADES tri-stereo and LiDAR DEMs have been quantitatively and qualitatively compared and, although there are artefacts in the smaller structures (e.g., ridges and valleys), there is still a clear consistency between the two DEMs for the larger structures (as the main valleys and ridges). The period between July 2010 and May 2012 showed only minor changes consisting of volcanoclastic sedimentation and some overflows outside the crater. Otherwise, between May 2012 and May 2017, large topographic changes occurred that were related to the emplacement of the 2014 lava flow in the NE part of the Sciara del Fuoco and to the accumulation of a volcaniclastic wedge in the central part of the Sciara del Fuoco. Between 2017 and 2019, minor changes were again detected due to small accumulation next to the crater terrace and the erosion in lower Sciara del Fuoco.

TI  - Variations in fish habitat fragmentation caused by marine reclamation activities in the Bohai coastal region, China
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the development of the social economy and population density pressure, coastal reclamation activities have rapidly increased throughout coastal regions in China and have had a significant negative impact on fish habitat fragmentation (especially on the habitat of the early life history stage of fish, ELHSF). However, few studies have focused on the negative ecological impacts of reclamation patches on ELHSF habitats (such as spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds). Data on marine reclamation were extracted from 49 Landsat remote sensing images from 7 different periods from 1985 to 2015, and ichthyoplankton data from 1982 to 2014 were compiled. The trend of fragmentation showed that the number of artificial heterogeneous patches significantly increased, and the isolation of habitat landscape became more intense. As a result, the spatial patterns of ichthyoplankton habitat rapidly transformed from a continuous and integral distribution to a divided and fragmented distribution, which drastically changed numerous environmental factors and deeply reshaped normal fish recruitment activities by impacting the number and abundance of ELHSF.

TI  - Remote sensing of ice motion in Antarctica - A review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The Antarctic Ice Sheet holds 91% of the global ice mass making it the biggest potential contributor to global sea-level-rise. In order to evaluate the ice sheet's present and future response to global climate change, detailed information about spatial and temporal ice mass dynamics is required. While ice sheet surface mass balance can be estimated from regional climate models, ice discharge is often determined from spaceborne measurements of ice thickness and ice motion at selected flux gates. The retrieval of ice motion is not only critical for analysing the rate of ice transport into the ocean but also for investigating the spatial and temporal pattern or the driving forcings of Antarctic ice flow dynamics.This study provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art spaceborne ice velocity measurements in Antarctica. Based on 201 scientific papers, published over the last three decades, our analysis revealed a dominant interest in local and regional scale investigations. Yet, the launch of the ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1 SAR satellites in the 1990s dramatically increased data coverage over the Antarctic continent and enabled the first circum-antarctic velocity product to be published in the late 2000s. In recent years, the improved imaging capabilities of Landsat 8 led to a shift towards using mainly optical satellite data and enabled great advances in circum-antarctic velocity mapping. Data from the currently operating Sentinel-1/-2 missions was applied in fewer studies but will play a crucial role in future ice motion studies e.g. as part of ESA CCI projects. In addition, we found a growing interest in high temporal resolution velocity change analyses. Based on the reviewed studies, we moreover summarized the highly dynamic and locally variable flow pattern over the Antarctic continent being in accordance with varying local and regional driving mechanisms.Despite the great advances in spaceborne ice velocity mapping in Antarctica, we report some major drawbacks and discuss future challenges and requirements. To start with, our study uncovered strong variations regarding the spatial availability of investigations. While we found an aggregation of studies over selected glaciers, we report a major lack of studies in all three Antarctic sectors. Additionally, many velocity datasets were created with strongly heterogeneous output parameters and were provided at coarse temporal resolution or at point-based measurement locations only. Future studies should consequently aim at creating more uniform ice motion products at defined spatial and temporal coverage and resolution standards and at analysing particularly the least studied glaciers.

TI  - Breast and axillary surgery in malignant breast disease: a review focused on literature of 2018 and 2019
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review There have been fundamental changes in the surgical approach to breast cancer management over the last decades. The primary objective of achieving locoregional control, however, remains unchanged. Recent findings In addition to strategies optimizing systemic treatment and radiotherapy, current discussions focus on improving the surgical approach to breast cancer. Especially in view of the increasingly pivotal role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy NAT/NAC (NACT), gauging the extent of tissue removal in the breast and the width of resection margins in breast-conserving surgery is highly important, as is the extent of axillary surgery. Although sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive patients always underwent axillary lymph node dissection in the past, this paradigm has been challenged in recent years. Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) has emerged as a new staging option in biopsy-proven node-positive patients who convert to clinical node negativity (cN0) after NACT. TAD combines the removal of the SLN and of the target lymph node marked prior to NACT. The accuracy of axillary staging both before and after NACT plays an important role for prognostication and multidisciplinary treatment plans, while its extent has significant effects on patients' arm morbidity and quality of life. The current review focuses on recent evidence regarding surgical management of the breast and axilla in patients with primary breast cancer based on a PubMed and EMBASE literature search for publication years 2018 and 2019.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to measure the ozone vertical distribution (OVD) in the upper troposphere-stratosphere by differential absorption lidar (DIAL) at 299/341 nm and 308/353 nm and to compare and analyze the results against satellite data. A lidar complex for measuring the OVD in the altitude range approximate to(5-45) km has been created. Here we analyze the results of ozone lidar measurements at wavelengths of 299/341 nm and 308/353 nm in 2018 at Siberian Lidar Station (SLS) and compare them with satellite (MLS/Aura and IASI/MetOp) measurements of OVD. The retrieved lidar OVD profiles in the upper troposphere-stratosphere in comparison with MLS/Aura and IASI/MetOp profiles, as well as the stitched OVD profile in comparison with the mid-latitude Krueger model, confirm the prospects of using the pairs of ozone sounding wavelengths 299/341 and 308/353 nm.

TI  - Estimating winter wheat yield based on a light use efficiency model and wheat variety data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based models are important tools for monitoring regional and global crop yields, because remotely sensed data is able to offer temporally and spatially continuous crop growth information over large areas. However, tracking inter-annual variability in crop yields remains a major challenge. Taking this challenge, a light use efficiency model (EC-LUE) is used to estimate winter wheat yield with 30-m spatial resolution Landsat data. Moreover, we integrate winter wheat variety data by considering different percentages of harvested organs to total crop organs. Using county-level statistical yield data for Kansas, United States, model validation shows that the EC-LUE model combined with wheat variety data can effectively capture the spatial variations of winter wheat yields. Specifically, the proposed method significantly improves model simulation performance for the inter-annual variation of yields during 2008-2017 and can explain 82% of the inter-annual yield variation. This method proposed in this study proves to be available for future applications of crop yield estimations on a larger scale. The great potential of incorporating satellite observations with crop variety data to monitor crop yield, and improve agricultural management is therefore indicated.

TI  - Oncologic outcome after completing or abandoning (radical) hysterectomy in patients with cervical cancer and intraoperative detection of lymph node positivity; ABRAX (ABandoning RAd hyst in cerviX cancer)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The management of patients with intraoperative detection of lymph node involvement remains controversial. The most significant aspect is the decision regarding the completion of the cervical procedure, such as hysterectomy, radical hysterectomy, or a fertility sparing procedure.Primary objective The primary objective of the ABandoning RAd hyst in cerviX cancer (ABRAX) trial is to determine whether the completion of the cervical procedure (ie, radical hysterectomy) improves oncological outcome in patients with intraoperatively detected lymph node involvement before they are referred for definitive chemoradiation.Study hypothesis We hypothesize that, in patients with intraoperative lymph node involvement, completion of radical hysterectomy or other cervical procedure does not improve the oncological outcome of definitive chemoradiation.Trial design The ABRAX trial is a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Patients with negative lymph nodes in clinical staging, in whom lymph node involvement is detected intraoperatively, are included. Completion or abandonment of the planned cervical procedure stratifies the cohort into two subgroups in which oncological outcome and morbidity will be compared.Major Inclusion/Exclusion criteria Patients with early stage (pT1a-pT2b) cervical cancer, who did not have positive lymph nodes on preoperative imaging, who were scheduled for primary surgical treatment, and in whom metastatic involvement of pelvic lymph node was found during surgery either as a grossly (macroscopically) involved or on intraoperative pathology assessment will be enrolled. Patients can be included irrespective of surgical approach (minimal invasive surgery or laparotomy) and type of cervical procedure performed (hysterectomy, radical hysterectomy, or a fertility sparing procedure).Primary endpoint The primary endpoint of this retrospective study is a progression free survival in two subgroups with abandoned or completed cervical procedure followed by definitive chemoradiation in both groups.Sample size The assumed sample size is 718 patients (in total for both groups).Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting results Estimated end of data collection: December 2019; estimated date of presenting results: Q2/3 2020.

TI  - Mapping Forested Wetland Inundation in the Delmarva Peninsula, USA Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Delmarva Peninsula in the eastern United States is partially characterized by thousands of small, forested, depressional wetlands that are highly sensitive to weather variability and climate change, but provide critical ecosystem services. Due to the relatively small size of these depressional wetlands and their occurrence under forest canopy cover, it is very challenging to map their inundation status based on existing remote sensing data and traditional classification approaches. In this study, we applied a state-of-the-art U-Net semantic segmentation network to map forested wetland inundation in the Delmarva area by integrating leaf-off WorldView-3 (WV3) multispectral data with fine spatial resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) intensity and topographic data, including a digital elevation model (DEM) and topographic wetness index (TWI). Wetland inundation labels generated from lidar intensity were used for model training and validation. The wetland inundation map results were also validated using field data, and compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and a random forest output from a previous study. Our results demonstrate that our deep learning model can accurately determine inundation status with an overall accuracy of 95% (Kappa = 0.90) compared to field data and high overlap (IoU = 70%) with lidar intensity-derived inundation labels. The integration of topographic metrics in deep learning models can improve the classification accuracy for depressional wetlands. This study highlights the great potential of deep learning models to improve the accuracy of wetland inundation maps through use of high-resolution optical and lidar remote sensing datasets.

TI  - The Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (SIFIS) Onboard the First Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite (TECIS-1): Specifications and Prospects
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global monitoring of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) using satellite-based observations provides a new way of monitoring the status of terrestrial vegetation photosynthesis on a global scale. Several global SIF products that make use of atmospheric satellite data have been successfully developed in recent decades. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite (TECIS-1), the first Chinese terrestrial ecosystem carbon inventory satellite, which is due to be launched in 2021, will carry an imaging spectrometer specifically designed for SIF monitoring. Here, we use an extensive set of simulated data derived from the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) and Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) models to evaluate and optimize the specifications of the SIF Imaging Spectrometer (SIFIS) onboard TECIS for accurate SIF retrievals. The wide spectral range of 670-780 nm was recommended to obtain the SIF at both the red and far-red bands. The results illustrate that the combination of a spectral resolution (SR) of 0.1 nm and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 127 performs better than an SR of 0.3 nm and SNR of 322 or an SR of 0.5 nm and SNR of 472 nm. The resulting SIF retrievals have a root-mean-squared (RMS) diff* value of 0.15 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) at the far-red band and 0.43 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) at the red band. This compares with 0.20 and 0.26 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) at the far-red band and 0.62 and 1.30 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) at the red band for the other two configurations described above. Given an SR of 0.3 nm, the increase in the SNR can also improve the SIF retrieval at both bands. If the SNR is improved to 450, the RMS diff* will be 0.17 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) at the far-red band and 0.47 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) at the red band. Therefore, the SIFIS onboard TECIS-1 will provide another set of observations dedicated to monitoring SIF at the global scale, which will benefit investigations of terrestrial vegetation photosynthesis from space.

TI  - Glacial Lake Changes and Identification of Potentially Dangerous Glacial Lakes in the Yi'ong Zangbo River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern Tibetan Plateau, where monsoonal temperate glaciers are most developed, has a huge number of glacial lakes. Based on Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, 192 glacial lakes with a total area of 45.73 +/- 6.18 km(2) in 2016 were delineated in the Yi'ong Zangbo River Basin. Glacial lakes with areas of less than 0.1 km(2) accounted for 81.77% of the total number, and glacial lakes located above 4500 m elevation comprised 83.33%. Dramatic glacier melting caused by climate warming has occurred, resulting in the formation and expansion of glacial lakes and the increase of potential glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) risk. From 1970 to 2016, the total area of glaciers in the basin has decreased by 35.39%, whereas the number and total area of glacial lakes have, respectively, increased by 86 and 1.59 km(2). In that time, 110 new glacial lakes emerged, whereas 24 of the original lakes disappeared. The newly formed lakes have a smaller mean area but higher mean elevation than the lakes that disappeared. Based on five indicators, a first-order method was used to identify glacial lakes that pose potential threats. We identified 10 lakes with very high, 7 with high, 31 with medium, and 19 with low GLOF susceptibility, out of 67 moraine-dammed glacial lakes with areas larger than 0.02 km(2). Understanding the behavior of glaciers and glacial lakes is a vital aspect of GLOFs disaster management, and the monitoring of glacial lakes should be strengthened.

TI  - Spatial modelling of groundwater quality across a land use and land cover gradient in Limpopo Province, South Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variability of groundwater quality in rural Mokopane District is investigated. This was achieved by evaluating the variability in groundwater physio-chemical parameters in relation to Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)using Kriging geo-statistical technique and key groundwater physio-chemical parameters namely; ammonia, lead, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), nitrates and chloride. Firstly, we derived the LULC from 30-m Landsat 8-OLI satellite data, with an overall accuracy of 76.67%. Water quality parameters were modelled in geographic information systems using the kriging interpolation technique. We then compared measured water quality and the drinking standards recommended by the South African Water Quality Standards (SAWS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline standards for drinking water. Results indicated that there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the levels of physio-chemical contents between borehole water and standard values according to the SAWS and WHO. For example, TDS in Mosesetjane exceeded both SAWS and WHO drinking water levels. Nitrate concentrations were also high on the first and second quarter with concentration levels of 5.56-29 mg/l and 30.9 mg/l in Mosesetjane, respectively. However, lead and ammonia were found to be evenly distributed in all the four quarters, but exhibited some slight deviations from the standard levels (+/- 4.7 mg/l) in selected quarters. Results also indicated significant differences in TDS, chloride and nitrate concentrations across different LULC types. Subsistence farming and built-up areas were the main LULC types that were found to have high concentrations of TDS, ammonia and nitrates, exceeding the recommended standards. However, lead and ammonia, did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) and these parameters were fairly distributed, with less spatial variability. The second quarter, extending between October and December, and the fourth quarter, extending from April to June, exhibited high concentrations of nitrates, chloride and TDS during the wet season. On the other hand, the first and third quarter of the dry period were associated with low concentrations. This study indicated that LULC types and seasonal variability have influence on specific groundwater quality parameters.

TI  - Mapping land cover on Reunion Island in 2017 using satellite imagery and geospatial ground data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We here present a reference database and three land use maps produced in 2017 over the Reunion island using a machine learning based methodology. These maps are the result of a satellite image analysis performed using the Moringa land cover processing chain developed in our laboratory. The input dataset for map production consists of a single very high spatial resolution Pleiades images, a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and the aforementioned reference database. The Moringa chain adopts an object based approach: the Pleiades image provides spatial accuracy with the delineation of land samples via a segmentation process, the time series provides information on landscape and vegetation dynamics, the DTM provides information on topography and the reference database provides annotated samples (6256 polygons) for the supervised classification process and the validation of the results. The three land use maps follow a hierarchical nomenclature ranging from 4 classes for the least detailed level to 34 classes for the most detailed one. The validation of these maps shows a good quality of the results with overall accuracy rates ranging from 86% to 97%. The maps are freely accessible and used by researchers, land managers (State services and local authorities) and also private companies. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Mechanical thrombectomy in stroke - planning for service expansion using discrete event simulation.
T2  - Future healthcare journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a very effective, but highly time dependent, reperfusion technique in the management of acute ischaemic stroke caused by large artery occlusion. MT is provided by 24 neuroscience centres (NSCs) in the UK which receive patients directly ('mothership') and via transfer from district general hospitals (DGHs), the 'drip and ship' pathway. NSCs currently provide a within hours service but are working on service expansion to enable 24/7 availability. DGHs, too, will need to prepare for this service expansion to ensure good outcomes for their patients. We discuss options for service expansion in a DGH and regional stroke network in south-west England and use Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data and discrete event simulation to model and compare alternative workflow options to aid the planning process. We suggest that our modelled options could be considered by all NHS DGHs in their preparation for MT service expansion.

TI  - Local biophysical effects of land use and land cover change: towards an assessment tool for policy makers
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) affects the climate through both biogeochemical (BGC) and biophysical (BPH) mechanisms. While BGC effects are assessed at global scale and are at the heart of climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement, BPH effects are totally absent despite their increasingly recognized impact, especially at local scale. This stems from the complexity in characterizing their climate impacts both at local and global scale, which makes it impractical to offer clear advices for the development of climate policies. To overcome this barrier, we built a prototype for an assessment tool to evaluate the local BPH impact of a series of land cover transitions. It relies on a dedicated methodology, based on satellite remote sensing data, that can estimate the local change in near surface air temperature associated with BPH effects of potential LULCC. This tool follows a tiered methodological approach, using transparent methods and mirroring what is currently provided by the IPCC to estimate the BGC effects, i.e. through different levels of increasing methodological complexity, from Tier 1 (i.e. default method and factors) to Tier 2 (i.e. similar to Tier 1 but with higher level of details and complexity) and Tier 3 (i.e. tailored solution to address national circumstances). The prototype tool enables the evaluation of the local impacts of land-related BPH effects, therefore facilitating a scientifically informed and comprehensive assessment of land-based climate policies.

TI  - Validation of the AROME, ALADIN and WRF Meteorological Models for Flood Forecasting in Morocco
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are common in small Mediterranean watersheds and the alerts provided by real-time monitoring systems provide too short anticipation times to warn the population. In this context, there is a strong need to develop flood forecasting systems in particular for developing countries such as Morocco where floods have severe socio-economic impacts. In this study, the AROME (Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale), ALADIN (Aire Limited Dynamic Adaptation International Development) and WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) meteorological models are evaluated to forecast flood events in the Rheraya and Ourika basin located in the High-Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The model evaluation is performed by comparing for a set of flood events the observed and simulated probabilities of exceedances for different precipitation thresholds. In addition, two different flood forecasting approaches are compared: the first one relies on the coupling of meteorological forecasts with a hydrological model and the second one is a based on a linear relationship between event rainfall, antecedent soil moisture and runoff. Three different soil moisture products (in-situ measurements, European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI remote sensing data and ERA5 reanalysis) are compared to estimate the initial soil moisture conditions before flood events for both methods. Results showed that the WRF and AROME models better simulate precipitation amounts compared to ALADIN, indicating the added value of convection-permitting models. The regression -based flood forecasting method outperforms the hydrological model-based approach, and the maximum discharge is better reproduced when using the WRF forecasts in combination with ERA5. These results provide insights to implement robust flood forecasting approaches in the context of data scarcity that could be valuable for developing countries such as Morocco and other North African countries.

TI  - Towards a Multi-Temporal Deep Learning Approach for Mapping Urban Fabric Using Sentinel 2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The major part of the population lives in urban areas, and this is expected to increase in the future. The main challenges faced by cities currently and towards the future are the rapid urbanization, the increase in urban temperature and the urban heat island. Mapping and monitoring urban fabric (UF) to analyze the environmental impact of these phenomena is more necessary than ever. This coupled with the increased availability of Earth observation data and their growing temporal capabilities leads us to consider using temporal features for improving land use classification, especially in urban environments where the spectral overlap between classes makes it challenging. Urban land use classification thus remains a central question in remote sensing. Although some research studies have successfully used multi-temporal images such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 to improve land cover classification, urban land use mapping is rarely carried using the temporal dimension. This paper explores the use of Sentinel-2 data in a deep learning framework, by firstly assessing the temporal robustness of four popular fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) trained over single-date images for the classification of the urban footprint, and secondly, by proposing a multi-temporal FCN. A performance comparison between the proposed framework and a regular FCN is also conducted. In this study, we consider four UF classes typical of many European Western cities. Results show that training the proposed multi-date model on Sentinel 2 multi-temporal data achieved the best results with a Kappa coefficient increase of 2.72% and 6.40%, respectively for continuous UF and industrial facilities. Although a more definitive conclusion requires further testing, first results are promising because they confirm that integrating the temporal dimension with a high spatial resolution into urban land use classification may be a valuable strategy to discriminate among several urban categories.

TI  - Geospatial analysis in groundwater resources management as a tool for reclamation areas of New Valley (El-Oweinat), Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is the application of geospatial data and techniques on the evaluation of potential groundwater management and uses in south New Valley (East El-Oweinat area), western desert of Egypt. An integration of geophysical, hydrogeological and remote sensing data into a Geographic Information System (GIS) has been used to determine groundwater potential zones for sustainable development. In the hydrogeophysical study, correlation of subsurface lithofacles has been carried out in different directions based on well logging data (Gamma ray, SP and normal short and long resistivity logs). The aquifer and aquitard thicknesses have been determined in the intensive study area. Moreover, a relationship between borehole resistivity and the hydraulic characteristics has been constructed in order to calculate transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity. In the hydrogeological study, analyses of pumping tests have been carried out especially the step drawdown tests for the groundwater wells. These pumping tests will determine the well performance criteria such as well loss, aquifer loss, well efficiency and optimum pumping rates. In the Remote Sensing and GIS study, Landsat imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) have been processed, analyzed and managed in layers of data set. These data were used to gather current information for the surface topographic features such as elevation, slope, land use/cover and sand dunes in the study area. Sand dunes are located in the northwestern direction and are considered as a very low potentiality due to the effect of these dunes on the agricultural activities. Finally, an integration of these surface and subsurface geospatial characteristic into GIS environment has been carried out. Natural breaks classification method has been used in order to classify each thematic map. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used in order to create the final groundwater potentiality map. Four zones A, B, C and D have been selected to be the most potentiality zones with different capacities which can be used for drilling new groundwater wells.

TI  - Integrating aeromagnetic data and Landsat-8 imagery for detection of post-accretionary shear zones controlling hydrothermal alterations: The Allaqi-Heiani Suture zone, South Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) underwent a regional carbonation event with CO2 fluxes derived from the mantle and circulated along post-accretionary shear zones, thus affecting the redistribution of gold mineralization. Formerly, the analyses of remotely-sensed data have suggested regions of gold mineralization linked to the post-accretionary structured framework, but the results were insufficient for detailed prospecting in the ANS. In this research, aeromagnetic data and Landsat-8 imagery were integrated for delineating new high potential zones of gold mineralization in the Allaqi-Heiani Suture (AHS) zone, the ANS, South Eastern Desert (SED) of Egypt. Aero-magnetic data were enhanced using the Center for exploration targeting (CET) grid enhancement technique to detect the main structures that control hydrothermal alterations in the study area. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and ratios of spectral bands were applied to Landsat-8 data for mapping zones of hydrothermal alteration associated with gold mineralization. The traced structural elements from RTP, CET and Landsat-8 maps were statistically plotted and interpreted using rose diagrams. These diagrams indicated that the NW and NE trends are the most dominant in the RTP map and that the intersection zones obtained from the CET analysis are aligned along the NW-oriented trend. While the NNW, WNW and NE trends were the most dominant ones in Landsat maps. The integration of the results indicates several new high potential zones of gold and Cu/Ni mineralization types, which are mostly concentrated at the western part of the AHS zone. The hydrothermal alteration zones and associated gold mineralization are strongly linked to NW, NE, E-W and WNW trending lineaments. The approach used in this study can be applied to other parts of the ANS and other regions with similar geological conditions around the world. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Anonymous reporting of medical errors from The Egyptian Neonatal Safety Training Network
T2  - PEDIATRICS AND NEONATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: ENSTN is the first database to collect incidents and medical errors in NICU in Egypt. To ensure confidential and anonymous reporting system, identify the nature of medical errors and grade of harm as well as the risk factors. To promote patient safety culture and aid to decrease mortality and morbidity due to medical errors in NICU.Methods: Data reported by one University hospital and 12 non-University hospitals were collected through internet-based system on our webpage. Incident reporting icon in English and Arabic languages with standard structured data entry format was developed during the ENSTN project life time (www.egyneosafety.net). The system provides confidential and anonymous reporting. The number and types of reported events and factors that contributed to the events were verified and validated.Results: In total, 2724 incidents were verified. The majority of incidents were from the English versions 2699 while Arabic version 25 incidents. English first version 866 incidents, second 155 and third final versions 1678 incidents. The most frequent events categories were equipment/devices in 29.94%, and treatment/medication errors in 29.68%. Incident classification showed that 43.20% of incidents were adverse events, 5.928% were sentinel, 50.166% near miss and 0. 222% intentionally unsafe act, while 0.481% of incidents were not determined by reporters. The most frequent contributory factors were related to medication errors (28.34%), education/training (28.26%), and communication problems (27.82%). Serious patient harm was reported in 2.945%, death in 4.528% and minor harm in 25.259% of reported incidents.Conclusions: The ENSTN incidents reporting system successfully demonstrated the most common types and causes of medical errors in NICUs and underlying contributing factors. These findings suggest need multidisciplinary collaborative training. The ENSTN educational forum may play a role in reducing medical errors. Copyright (C) 2019, Taiwan Pediatric Association.

TI  - Predation Pressure on Sentinel Insect Prey along a Riverside Urbanization Gradient in Hungary
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most important global trends which causes habitat reduction and alteration which are, in turn, the main reasons for the well-documented reduction in structural and functional diversity in urbanized environments. In contrast, effects on ecological mechanisms are less known. Predation is one of the most important ecological functions because of its community-structuring effects. We studied six forest habitats along a riverside urbanization gradient in Szeged, a major city in southern Hungary, crossed by the river Tisza, to describe how extreme events (e.g., floods) as primary selective pressure act on adaptation in riparian habitats. We found a generally decreasing predation pressure from rural to urban habitats as predicted by the increasing disturbance hypothesis (higher predator abundances in rural than in urban habitats). The only predators that reacted differently to urbanization were ground active arthropods, where results conformed to the prediction of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (higher abundance in moderately disturbed suburban habitats). We did not find any evidence that communities exposed to extreme flood events were preadapted to the effects of urbanization. The probable reason is that changes accompanied by urbanization are much faster than natural landscape change, so the communities cannot adapt to them.

TI  - A multi-sensor approach to retrieve emissivity angular dependence over desert regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity is a directional quantity and most natural surfaces are anisotropic emitters. Experimental studies show that for homogeneous surfaces like bare soils, the emissivity decreases with view angle. Translation of the directionality of emissivity as obtained from experiments or models to satellite spatial scales of kilometers or more is challenging given the natural heterogeneity of the land surface at those scales. We propose a multi-sensor approach to retrieve TIR emissivity angular dependence from satellite observations. The method is based on simultaneous radiance measurements over stable and homogeneous targets, performed by multiple remote sensing platforms in low-earth orbit (MODIS/VIIRS) and geostationary orbits (SEVIRI) with different viewing configurations. In the case of homogeneous scenes, we assume that differences in observed brightness temperatures are exclusively due to differences in the atmospheric optical path and in surface emissivity within each view angle, as surface temperature is the same for both sensors. We then use radiative transfer simulations to derive the emissivity changes between the sensors due to the viewing position. It is shown that emissivity values decrease with view angle for all thermal infrared channels considered, with the highest variations for channel centered at 8.7 mu m, followed by 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, respectively. The MODIS MYD21 product agrees with the multi-sensor approach for the 8.7 mu m channel but shows negligible dependence on view angle for 10.8 and 12.0 mu m bands. Results suggest that the emissivity calibration curve used in the MYD21 algorithm restricts the retrieval of the full angular variation of emissivity at these channels. A sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed multi-sensor method is robust, with reduced impact of the uncertainty of the atmospheric correction on the retrieval. The impact of emissivity angular dependence on retrieved LST may be as high as 3.0 and 1.0 K, respectively, for the GSW and the TES algorithms for angles up to 65 degrees.

TI  - Toward Spatio-Spectral Analysis of Sentinel-2 Time Series Data for Land Cover Mapping
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern earth observation (EO) systems produce huge volumes of images with the objective to monitor the earth surface. Due to the high revisit time of EO systems, such as Sentinel-2 constellation, satellite image time series (SITS) is continuously produced allowing to improve the monitoring of spatiotemporal phenomena. How to efficiently analyze SITS considering both spectral and spatial information is still an open question in the remote sensing field. To deal with SITS classification, in this letter, we propose a spatio-spectral classification framework that leverages the mathematical morphology to extract spatial characteristics from SITS data and combines them with the already available spectral and temporal information. Experiments carried out on two study sites characterized by different heterogeneous land covers have demonstrated the significance of our proposal and the value to combine spatial as well as spectral information in the context of SITS land cover classification.

TI  - On the Use of Weighted Least-Squares Approaches for Differential Interferometric SAR Analyses: The Weighted Adaptive Variable-lEngth (WAVE) Technique
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper concentrates on the study of the Weighted Least-squares (WLS) approaches for the generation of ground displacement time-series through Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) methods. Usually, within the DInSAR framework, the Weighted Least-squares (WLS) techniques have principally been applied for improving the performance of the phase unwrapping operations as well as for better conveying the inversion of sequences of unwrapped interferograms to generate ground displacement maps. In both cases, the identification of low-coherent areas, where the standard deviation of the phase is high, is requested. In this paper, a WLS method that extends the usability of the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm in regions with medium-to-low coherence is presented. In particular, the proposed method relies on the adaptive selection and exploitation, pixel-by-pixel, of the medium-to-high coherent interferograms, only, so as to discard the noisy phase measurements. The selected interferometric phase values are then inverted by solving a WLS optimization problem. Noteworthy, the adopted, pixel-dependent selection of the "good" interferograms to be inverted may lead the available SAR data to be grouped into several disjointed subsets, which are then connected, exploiting the Weighted Singular Value Decomposition (WSVD) method. However, in some critical noisy regions, it may also happen that discarding of the incoherent interferograms may lead to rejecting some SAR acquisitions from the generated ground displacement time-series, at the cost of the reduced temporal sampling of the data measurements. Thus, variable-length ground displacement time-series are generated. The mathematical framework of the developed technique, which is named Weighted Adaptive Variable-lEngth (WAVE), is detailed in the manuscript. The presented experiments have been carried out by applying the WAVE technique to a SAR dataset acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) sensors over the Basilicata region, Southern Italy. A cross-comparison analysis between the conventional and the WAVE method has also been provided.

TI  - Estimation of Wind Direction in Tropical Cyclones Using C-Band Dual-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under extreme weather conditions, the imprints of kilometer-scale marine atmospheric boundary layer roll vortices on the ocean surface are clearly visible in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of storms. Therefore, information about wind direction in storms can be obtained by analyzing SAR image features caused by boundary layer rolls. VH-polarized SAR imagery captures the structural features of storms well and shows prominent image gradients along the radial directions of the storm. The signal-to-noise ratios of VH-polarized images are small in low wind speed areas, but they are large in the same regions of VV-polarized images. Also, the capability of retrieving the atmospheric rolls orientation in VV-polarization is found to be sensitive to incidence angle, with better performances for larger incidence angles. Thus, there is the potential to retrieve the storm's wind directions using a combination of the VH- and VV-polarized SAR observations. In this article, we use the local gradient method to estimate tropical cyclone (TC) wind directions from C-band RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A dual-polarization (VV & x002B; VH) SAR imagery. As a case study, wind directions with a spatial resolution of 25 km are derived by using both wide-swath VV- and VH-polarized SAR imagery over two hurricanes (Earl and Bertha) and one Typhoon (Meranti). We compare wind directions derived from ten dual-polarization SAR images with collocated wind directions from buoys, Global Positioning System (GPS) dropsondes, scatterometer, and radiometer. Statistical comparisons show that the wind direction bias and root-mean-square error are, respectively, -0.54 & x00B0; and 14.78 & x00B0; for VV-polarization, 0.38 & x00B0; and 14.25 & x00B0; for VH-polarization, 0.20 & x00B0; and 13.30 & x00B0; for VV- and VH-polarization, suggesting dual-polarization SAR is more suitable for the estimation of TC wind directions than VV- or VH-polarization SAR.

TI  - Compositing the Minimum NDVI for Daily Water Surface Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Capturing high frequency water surface dynamics via optical remote sensing is important for understanding hydro-ecological processes over seasonally flooded wetlands. However, it is a difficult task due to the presence of clouds on satellite images. This study proposed the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Minimum Value Composite (MinVC) algorithm to generate daily water surface data at a 250-m resolution. The algorithm selected pixelwise minimum values from the combined daily Terra and Aqua MODIS NDVI data within a 15-day moving window. Consisting mainly of cloud and water surface information, the MinVC NDVI data were segmented for water surfaces over the Poyang Lake, China (2000-2017) by using an edge detection model. The water surface mapping result was strongly correlated with the Landsat based result (R-2 = 0.914, root mean square error, RMSE = 223.7 km(2)), the cloud free MODIS image based result (R-2 = 0.824, RMSE = 356.7 km(2)), the recent Landsat-MODIS image fusion based result (R-2 = 0.765, RMSE = 403 km(2)), and the hydrodynamic modeling result (R-2 = 0.799). Compared to the equivalent eight-day MOD13 NDVI based on the Constraint View-Angle Maximum Value Composite (CV-MVC) algorithm, the daily MinVC NDVI highlighted water bodies by generating spatially homogenous water surface information. Consequently, the algorithm provided spatially and temporally continuous data for calculating water submersion times and trends in water surface area, which contribute to a better understanding of hydro-ecological processes over seasonally flooded wetlands. Within the framework of sensor intercalibration, the algorithm can be extended to incorporate multiple sensor data for improved water surface mapping.

TI  - Evaluation of a Long-Acting Opioid Restriction Policy: Does Restriction Reduce the Need for Naloxone Reversal?
T2  - HOSPITAL PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: After a sentinel event related to long-acting (LA) opioid administration at our institution and subsequent root cause analysis, an inpatient LA opioid restriction policy was implemented to improve patient safety. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of an inpatient LA opioid restriction policy on inpatient therapy utilization and to compare rates of naloxone reversal events among patients administered LA opioids before and after policy implementation. Methods: To evaluate the first objective, an electronic medical record report was created to capture all inpatient LA opioid orders prescribed to adults at our institution between March 1, 2014, and July 30, 2017. Utilization was compared before and after policy implementation and use controlled for by patient days. To evaluate the second objective, naloxone administrations were identified via a query of the medical record between March 1, 2014, and July 30, 2017. Naloxone reversal events were independently evaluated by 2 trained reviewers, and a third when discrepancies existed. Rates of naloxone reversal events related to LA opioid administration were compared between the pre- and post-policy phase. Results: The results of our first objective demonstrate that policy implementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in LA opioid utilization that was sustained throughout the study duration. For our second objective, among the 144 patients deemed to have an opioid-related naloxone reversal event, a LA opioid was administered to 12 patients (18.9%) in the pre-policy phase and 17 patients (15.9%) in the post-policy phase. This difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.629, confidence interval [CI] = 0.711-3.732, P = .248). Conclusion: A LA opioid restriction policy significantly reduced LA opioid utilization at our institution. Despite this, we did not find a significant reduction in inpatient naloxone reversals related to LA opioids. Further study is warranted to identify an optimal method to reduce LA opioid-related toxicity.

TI  - Identifying determinants of straw open field burning in northeast China: Toward greening agriculture base in newly industrializing countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil depletion caused by SB and its negative repercussions on food safety and the sustainable development of agriculture are essential concerns in newly industrializing countries. Understanding and curtailing SB in specific regions is related to the analysis of its structural characteristics and justice transition. Due to the banning policy in China, the large-scale interview of farmers' motivations and behavior regarding SB is impracticable. As such, we attempted to improve the understanding of the influencing factors of SB in northeast China (a commodity grain base) by applying the up-scaling method, by using MODIS fire data on cropland, statistical socioeconomic data, and resource and environment data as well as factor analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. We found that bio-physical factors, agricultural input-output, economic development, and crop types are significant determinants of the intensity of SB. In the end, we asserted policy implications for addressing SB in northeast China.

TI  - Prediction of plant diversity in grasslands using Sentinel-1 and-2 satellite image time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of grasslands plant diversity using satellite image time series is considered in this article. Fifteen months of freely available Sentinel optical and radar data were used to predict taxonomic and functional diversity at the pixel scale (10 m x 10 m) over a large geographical extent (40,000 km(2)). 415 field measurements were collected in 83 grasslands to train and validate several statistical learning methods. The objective was to link the satellite spectro-temporal data to the plant diversity indices. Among the several diversity indices tested, Simpson and Shannon indices were best predicted with a coefficient of determination around 0.4 using a Random Forest predictor and Sentinel-2 data. The use of Sentinel-1 data was not found to improve significantly the prediction accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm and the Sentinel-2 time series, the prediction of the Simpson index was performed. The resulting map highlights the intra-parcel variability and demonstrates the capacity of satellite image time series to monitor grasslands plant taxonomic diversity from an ecological viewpoint.

TI  - Multi-Scale Evaluation of Drone-Based Multispectral Surface Reflectance and Vegetation Indices in Operational Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact multi-spectral sensors that can be mounted on lightweight drones are now widely available and applied within the geo- and environmental sciences. However; the spatial consistency and radiometric quality of data from such sensors is relatively poorly explored beyond the lab; in operational settings and against other sensors. This study explores the extent to which accurate hemispherical-conical reflectance factors (HCRF) and vegetation indices (specifically: normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and chlorophyll red-edge index (CHL)) can be derived from a low-cost multispectral drone-mounted sensor (Parrot Sequoia). The drone datasets were assessed using reference panels and a high quality 1 m resolution reference dataset collected near-simultaneously by an airborne imaging spectrometer (HyPlant). Relative errors relating to the radiometric calibration to HCRF values were in the 4 to 15% range whereas deviations assessed for a maize field case study were larger (5 to 28%). Drone-derived vegetation indices showed relatively good agreement for NDVI with both HyPlant and Sentinel 2 products (R-2 = 0.91). The HCRF; NDVI and CHL products from the Sequoia showed bias for high and low reflective surfaces. The spatial consistency of the products was high with minimal view angle effects in visible bands. In summary; compact multi-spectral sensors such as the Parrot Sequoia show good potential for use in index-based vegetation monitoring studies across scales but care must be taken when assuming derived HCRF to represent the true optical properties of the imaged surface.

TI  - Extent of axillary surgery in inflammatory breast cancer: a survival analysis of 3500 patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive variant for which axillary lymph node (LN) dissection following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) remains standard of care. But with increasingly effective systemic therapy, it is unclear whether more limited axillary surgery may be appropriate in some IBC patients. We sought to examine whether extent of axillary LN surgery was associated with overall survival (OS) for IBC. Methods Female breast cancer patients with non-metastatic IBC (cT4d) diagnosed 2010-2014 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the association between extent of axillary surgery (<= 9 vs >= 10 LNs removed) and OS after adjusting for covariates, including post-NACT nodal status (ypN0 vs ypN1-3) and radiotherapy receipt (yes/no). Results 3471 patients were included: 597 (17.2%) had cN0 disease, 1833 (52.8%) had cN1 disease, and 1041 (30%) had cN2-3 disease. 49.9% of cN0 patients were confirmed to be ypN0 on post-NACT surgical pathology. Being ypN0 (vs ypN1-3) was associated with improved adjusted OS for all patients. Radiotherapy was associated with improved adjusted OS for cN1 and cN2-3 patients but not for cN0 patients. Regardless of ypN status, there was a trend towards improved adjusted OS with having >= 10 (vs <= 9) LNs removed for cN2-3 patients (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60-1.01, p = 0.06) but not for cN0 patients (p = 0.83). Conclusions A majority of IBC patients in our study presented with node-positive disease, and for those presenting with cN2-3 disease, more extensive axillary surgery is potentially associated with improved survival. For cN0 patients, however, more extensive axillary surgery was not associated with a survival benefit, suggesting an opportunity for more personalized care.

TI  - Tidal Wetland Gross Primary Production Across the Continental United States, 2000-2019
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - We mapped tidal wetland gross primary production (GPP) with unprecedented detail for multiple wetland types across the continental United States (CONUS) at 16-day intervals for the years 2000-2019. To accomplish this task, we developed the spatially explicit Blue Carbon (BC) model, which combined tidal wetland cover and field-based eddy covariance tower data into a single Bayesian framework, and used a super computer network and remote sensing imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index). We found a strong fit between the BC model and eddy covariance data from 10 different towers (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.001, root-mean-square error = 1.22 g C/m(2)/day, average error was 7% with a mean bias of nearly zero). When compared with NASA's MOD17 GPP product, which uses a generalized terrestrial algorithm, the BC model reduced error by approximately half (MOD17 had r(2) = 0.45, p < 0.001, root-mean-square error of 3.38 g C/m(2)/day, average error of 15%). The BC model also included mixed pixels in areas not covered by MOD17, which comprised approximately 16.8% of CONUS tidal wetland GPP. Results showed that across CONUS between 2000 and 2019, the average daily GPP per m(2) was 4.32 +/- 2.45 g C/m(2)/day. The total annual GPP for the CONUS was 39.65 +/- 0.89 Tg C/year. GPP for the Gulf Coast was nearly double that of the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts combined. Louisiana alone accounted for 15.78 +/- 0.75 Tg C/year, with its Atchafalaya/Vermillion Bay basin at 4.72 +/- 0.14 Tg C/year. The BC model provides a robust platform for integrating data from disparate sources and exploring regional trends in GPP across tidal wetlands.

TI  - A Prospective Study of the Causes of Bruises in Premobile Infants
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study had 2 objectives. First, to determine the behavior of physicians evaluating premobile infants with bruises. Second, and most importantly, to learn whether infants with unexplained bruising who had been initially evaluated by primary care and emergency department (ED) physicians are as likely to have their bruises attributed to child abuse as those children evaluated by child abuse physicians.Methods: Primary care, ED, and child abuse pediatricians (CAPs) in King County, Washington, San Mateo, Calif, Albuquerque, NM, La Crosse, Wis, and Torrance, Calif prospectively identified and studied infants younger than 6 months with less than 6 bruises, which were judged by the evaluating clinician to be explained or unexplained after their initial clinical examination.Results: Between March 1, 2010, andMarch 1, 2017, 63 infants with initially explained and 46 infants with initially unexplained bruises were identified. Infants with unexplained bruises had complete coagulation and abuse evaluations less frequently if they were initially identified by primary care pediatricians or ED providers than by CAPs. After imaging, laboratory, and follow-up, 54.2% (26) of the infants with initially unexplained bruises, including 2 who had been initially diagnosed with accidental injuries, were diagnosed as abused. Three (6.2%) infants had accidental bruising, 6 (12.4%) abuse mimics, 1 (2.5%) self-injury, 1 (2.5%) medical injury, and 11 (22.9%) remained of unknown causation. None had causal coagulation disorders. A total of 65.4% of the 26 abused infants had occult injuries detected by their imaging and laboratory evaluations. Six (23.1%) abused infants were not diagnosed until after they sustained subsequent injuries. Three (11.5%) were recognized abused by police investigation alone. Thirty-eight percent of the abused, bruised infants had a single bruise. Clinicians' estimates of abuse likelihood based on their initial clinical evaluation were inaccurate. Primary care, ED, and child abuse physicians identified abused infants at similar rates.Conclusions: More than half of premobile infants with initially unexplained bruises were found to be abused. Abuse was as likely for infants identified by primary care and ED providers as for those identified by CAPs. Currently, physicians often do not obtain full abuse evaluations in premobile infants with unexplained bruising. Their initial clinical judgment about abuse likelihood was inadequate. Bruised infants often have clinically occult abusive injuries or will sustain subsequent serious abuse. Bruised infants should have full abuse evaluations and referral for Protective Services and police assessments.

TI  - Machine learning models to quantify and map daily global solar radiation and photovoltaic power
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global solar radiation (R-s) reaching Earth's surface is the primary information for the design and application of solar energy-related systems. High-resolution R-s measurements are limited owing to the high costs of measuring devices, and their stringent operational maintenance procedures. This study evaluated a newly developed machine learning model, namely the hybrid particle swarm optimization and extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), to accurately predict daily R-s. The newly proposed model was compared with five other machine learning models, namely the original ELM, support vector machine, generalized regression neural networks, M5 model tree, and autoencoder, under two training scenarios using long-term R-s and other climatic data taken during 1961-2016 from seven stations located on the Loess Plateau of China. Overall, the PSO-ELM with full climatic data as inputs provided more accurate R-s estimations. We also calculated the daily R-s at fifty other stations without R-s measurements on the Loess Plateau using the PSO-ELM model, as well as the potential photovoltaic (PV) power using an empirical PV power model, and then generated high-resolution (0.25 degrees) R-s and PV power data to investigate the patterns of R-s and PV power. Significant reductions in R-s (- 6.49 MJ m(-2) per year, p < 0.05) and PV power (- 0.46 kWh m(-2) per year, p < 0.05) were observed. The northwestern parts of the study area exhibited more R-s and PV power and are therefore considered more favorable for solar energy-related applications. Our study confirms the effectiveness of the PSO-ELM for solar energy modeling, particularly in areas where in-situ measurements are unavailable.

TI  - Developing an empirical model from Landsat data series for monitoring water salinity in coastal Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop an empirical model from Landsat data series to monitor the water salinity of coastal Bangladesh efficiently. Such a model can substitute expensive conventional techniques for assessing remote water quality. A set of equations connecting sensors 5 TM and 8 OLI were generated using multiple regression analysis. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were carried out to enhance the quality of satellite images. Total 13 compositions of different bands including blue, green and red were considered to find the Coefficient of Determination (r(2)) with the field level EC (electrical conductivity) values collected from 74 sampling locations. Salinity data mainly EC values of coastal water were collected from primary and secondary sources. Considering the r(2) values, significant band compositions were identified and then employed to generate linear equations. Such equation for Landsat 5 TM could detect water salinity (i.e. EC) accurately of around 82%. Similarly, the r(2) value for Landsat 8 OLI was found as 0.76 that can confirm the applicability of Landsat data series to detect the change of salinity level of coastal water for a long period. The availability of coastal water was delineated by NDWI whereas salinity level was assessed using the developed equations for the year 2001 and 2019. Interestingly, it was observed that coastal areas having lower level of EC almost vanished whereas those of having higher level of EC were increased significantly between 2001 and 2019. Such increase in coastal water salinity is the result of combined effects of climatic and anthropogenic factors, which can pose a considerable risk to the coastal inhabitants including freshwater scarcity, food insecurity, and health hazard.

TI  - Monitoring pinyon-juniper cover and aboveground biomass across the Great Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the mid-1800s pinyon-juniper (PJ) woodlands have been encroaching into sagebrush-steppe shrublands and grasslands such that they now comprise 40% of the total forest and woodland area of the Intermountain West of the United States. More recently, PJ ecosystems in select areas have experienced dramatic reductions in area and biomass due to extreme drought, wildfire, and management. Due to the vast area of PJ ecosystems, tracking these changes in woodland tree cover is essential for understanding their consequences for carbon accounting efforts, as well as ecosystem structure and functioning. Here we present a carbon monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for characterizing total aboveground biomass stocks and flux of PJ ecosystems across the Great Basin. This is achieved through a two-stage remote sensing approach by first using spatial wavelet analysis to rapidly sample tree cover from very high-resolution imagery (1m), and then training a Random Forest model which maps tree cover across the region from 2000 to 2016 using temporally-segmented Landsat spectral indices obtained from the LandTrendr algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Estimates of cover were validated against field data from the SageSTEP project (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 10% cover). Biomass estimated from cover-based allometry was higher than estimates from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) at the plot-level (bias = 5 Mg ha(-1) and RMSE = 15.5 Mg ha(-1)) due in part to differences in tree-level biomass allometrics. County-level aggregation of biomass closely matched estimates from the FIA (R-2 = 0.97) after correcting for bias at the plot level. Even after many previous decades of encroachment, we find forest area (i.e. areas with >= 10% cover) increasing at a steady rate of 0.46% per year, but 80% of the 9.86 Tg increase in biomass is attributable to infilling of existing forest. This suggests that the known consequences of encroachment such as reduced water availability, impacts to biodiversity, and risk of severe wildfire may have been increasing across the region in recent years despite the actions of sagebrush steppe restoration initiatives.

TI  - ASSOCIATIVE MEANING IN RELIGIOUS WORLDVIEW EXPRESSION
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the reflection of the notion,god. in the Yakut and Russian language consciousnesses, which has been analysed on the material from a free-associative experiment. Associative meanings help us uncover those patterns of traditional behaviour which cause the inclusion of the stimulus within a particular system of relations, characteristic of a given ethnic group. The language consciousnesses of the Yakut and Russian people living in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), as well as the specificity of their religious worldview were investigated on respondents, ranging in age from 16 to 21. Our subjects fell into three groups (approximately 230 people in each group): Russians; Urban Yakuts, who considered Russian as their main or only language of communication; Rural Yakuts, who considered Yakut as their predominant language of communication. A comparative analysis of the associative fields of the stimulus word 'god' (/ bog, / tangara) allowed us to distinguish the common features in the worldviews that exist in the Yakut and Russian consciousnesses (reactions faith, heaven, church, the Sun, the cross, paradise, light, etc.). As for the differences, Rural Yakuts responded with holy spirit of the upper world/ / ajyy, spirits of the middle world/ / ichchi, upper world/ / uohee dojdu and others, which reflect the traditional religious ideas of the Yakuts about the structure of the world and the existence of several gods and different spirits, which the Yakut people from cities seem to have lost. Overall, the results of the research may be used as material to illustrate the components of the world image preserved in the everyday consciousnesses of the representatives of different ethnic cultures.

TI  - EVALUATING VARIOUS METHODS OF VEGETATIVE COVER CHANGE TREND ANALYSIS USING SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING PRODUCTIONS (CASE STUDY: SISTAN PLAIN IN EASTERN IRAN)
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As vegetation of any region can change over time due to various natural and human factors, the study of changes in the vegetation trend, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, has always been of great importance for the management of water and soil resources as well as vegetation. In this study, the NDVI products of Terra Satellite MODIS sensor (MOD13A3), with a spatial resolution of 1x1 km for a 15-year statistical period (2000-2014), were used to study the changes in the vegetation trend on a pixel-based scale during April, May and June in Sistan plain in eastern Iran. Four statistical methods, namely, simple moving average, simple exponential smoothing, double exponential ordering, and classical linear regression were used to detect long-term changes in the vegetation trend of this plain. The error rates of the models were then calculated using the three indicators of mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean square deviation (MSD) and mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD). Analysis of these indicators showed that classical linear regression was the best model for detecting changes in the vegetation trend thanks to its lower error than others. Based on the selected statistical method, the most increasing and decreasing changes in the NDVI values were observed in the northeast, and the east and center of the plain, respectively. Finally, it was found that the use of trend analysis along with the classic linear regression method in a pixel-based scale could be a suitable method for revealing long-term vegetation changes in an arid and hyper arid climate.

TI  - Modelling surface heat island intensity according to differences of biophysical characteristics: A case study of Amol city, Iran
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important environmental phenomena in urban environments is urban heat island, which plays a big role in understanding anthropogenic activities. The main objective of this study is to present a novel approach based on the differences of the biophysical characteristics between built-up and non-built-up land to model Surface Heat Island Intensity (SUHII). To do so, several datasets such as Landsat images, MODIS products of MOD07L2 and MOD11A1, and data recorded at the local meteorological station for the period of 1985-2017 for Amol, Iran were used. Land Surface Temperature (LST) was calculated from single-channel algorithm and SUHII was calculated using the Surface Urban Heat Island Ratio Index (SUHIRI) as well as the surface biophysical characteristics. Finally, based on Least Squares Adjustment (LSA) model, the influence coefficient of the difference of each biophysical parameter between built-up and non-built-up land on the SUHII was calculated. The results show that the average LST of the built-up land exceeds of that for the non-built-up LST by 2.9 degrees C. In the study area, SUHII varies by time within 1985-2017. The standard deviation of the differences between the characteristics of brightness, greenness and surface wetness of the built-up and non-built-up land was 0.36, 0.76 and 1.17, respectively. The LSA model results show that the difference in the brightness of the built-up and non-built-up land relative to the two parameters of greenness and wetness has a greater effect on the SUHII. The coefficient of determination and root mean square error between the observed SUHII and the LSA-based calculation for the training set were 0.80 and 0.06, and for the testing set 0.75 and 0.08, respectively. The results of this study indicate the significant effect of the differences in the biophysical characteristics of land on the SUHII and the effectiveness of the model presented in the study to model the SUHII.

TI  - Interpreting the volcanological processes of Kamchatka, based on multi-sensor satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanoes are complex environmental systems that pose challenges to scientific study, due to their inherently hazardous nature and in many cases, remote locations. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a useful tool for assessing both ongoing activity and retrospective eruptions. This paper represents an initial application of a multi-sensor approach, in part to demonstrate its strengths and limitations in a single volcanic region that is fairly well monitored in situ. We utilize data from five NASA satellite-based instruments, having up to 18 years of global observations, to conduct in-depth investigations of eight volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) that were active between 2000 and 2018. From 169 eruptive plumes observed, we performed detailed plume-dynamics analysis in eighty-two cases for which sufficiently favorable observations were obtained. Plume heights from MISR and CALIOP, microphysical particle properties (e.g. fine ash, sulfates) from MISR, thermal anomalies generated by lava features from MODIS, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from OMI and OMPS are all considered. Evidence of eruption evolution over months-to-years was identified at Shiveluch, Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky, Zhupanovsky, Koryaksky and Kambalny. In cases with extensive data coverage (Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky and Zhupanovsky), underlying subsurface dynamics is inferred, corroborated where possible with detailed ground-based data records. The 1.1 km resolution of the particle property retrievals from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument capture downwind plume-particle evolution in many cases. Comparison of changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD), retrieved effective particle size (REPS) and retrieved effective particle absorption (REPA) map to six plume transport regimes, indicating varying degrees of downwind particle aggregation, deposition, and/or new particle formation. Distinct meteorological conditions are identified as likely driving these evolutionary processes, most notably the atmospheric static stability and wind shear at plume altitude. This approach can be applied to volcanic plumes globally, including those for which surface monitoring is limited or entirely absent.

TI  - Transport of dispersed oil compounds to the seafloor by sinking phytoplankton aggregates: A modeling study
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Up to 20% of the oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was deposited as degraded oil compounds on the seafloor. Much of that deposition was likely due to dispersed oil compounds having been integrated into fast-sinking aggregates, which transported it effectively to depth. Understanding the details of this oil transport mechanism, and predicting its potential magnitude, is important for the management and mitigation of future oil spills.The 1-D model described here simulates a) a diatom bloom and the resulting formation of aggregates via coagulation of cells, b) the scavenging of dispersed oil compounds by these aggregates as they sink through the water column, c) the degradation of diatom carbon and oil carbon during transit, and d) the ultimate deposition of aggregates and oil compounds to the seafloor. The model is parameterized using primarily field- and laboratory-collected data and the model results are compared to sediment trap data. Specifically, one large diatom sedimentation event observed shortly after the Deepwater well was capped was modeled. The comparison of simulation results to field data assesses the model's ability to explain the observed sedimentation event and tests our understanding of the main mechanisms driving such an event.The model results indicate that diatom carbon and oil compounds captured in the trap were linked to a sedimentation event that reached peak intensity just before the trap was deployed. The model simulations predict the measured sedimentation rates of oil compounds and organic carbon reasonably well, indicating that the key mechanisms driving this process were captured by the model. In the baseline case, which simulates the sedimentation of a large Skeletonema bloom in late August 2010, about 10% of the dispersed oil compounds lingering in the water were deposited to the seafloor. The ability of a sinking diatom bloom to scavenge dispersed oil compounds from the water column and deposit them to depth is a robust result of the model over a range of parameter variations. These results suggest that a model that combines satellite data on phytoplankton blooms with water column dispersed oil concentrations to estimate potential oil compound deposistion rates may be able to provide decision makers with guidance during an oil spill. However, additional, independent validation of the model is necessary before it can be adapted for use in an operational setting.

TI  - Resistance to echinocandin antifungal agents in the United Kingdom in clinical isolates of <i>Candida glabrata</i>: Fifteen years of interpretation and assessment
T2  - MEDICAL MYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Candidemia is widely reported as the fourth most common form of bloodstream infection worldwide. Reports of breakthrough cases of candidemia are increasing, especially in the context of a move away from azole antifungals as prophylactic or first line treatment toward the use of echinocandin agents. The global evaluation of echinocandin antifungal susceptibility since 2003 has included switches in testing methodologies and the move to a sentinel echinocandin approach for classification reporting. This study compiles previously unpublished data from echinocandin susceptibility testing of UK clinical isolates of C. glabrata received at the Public Health England Mycology Reference Laboratory from 2003 to 2016 and reevaluates the prevalence of resistance in light of currently accepted testing protocols. From 2015 onward, FKS gene mutation detection using a novel Pyrosequencing (R) assay was assessed as a predictor of echinocandin resistance alongside conventional susceptibility testing. Overall, our data show that echinocandin resistance in UK isolates of C. glabrata is a rare phenomenon and prevalence has not appreciably increased in the last 14 years. The pyrosequencing assay was able to successfully detect hot spot mutations in FKS1 and FKS2, although not all isolates that exhibited phenotypic resistance demonstrated detectable hot spot mutations. We propose that a rapid genomic based detection method for FKS mutations, as part of a multifactorial approach to susceptibility testing, could help provide accurate and timely management decisions especially in regions where echinocandin resistance has been reported to be emerging in this important pathogen.

TI  - Remote sensing of glacier and ice sheet grounding lines: A review
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The precise positioning and long-term monitoring of the grounding line, forming the boundary between grounded and floating ice of marine ice sheets and tidewater glaciers, is critical for assessing ice sheet/glacier stability, ice sheet/glacier mass balance calculations and numerical ice modelling. However, mapping of the grounding line is a challenging task, since it is a subglacial and transient feature. Remote sensing techniques do not map the grounding line directly but locate surface features in the grounding zone that serve as proxies for the true grounding line position. The large variety of methods, products and publications, as well as an inconsistent use of terminology additionally complicate the topic. We present the first detailed review of existing remote sensing techniques and data for grounding line mapping. Benefits and limitations of the different techniques and data sources are discussed and illustrated with examples. We identify a present tradeoff between accuracy and both spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the derived grounding line products. Rather new methods like Sentinel-1-SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Differential Range Offset Tracking (DROT) and Pseudo Crossover Radar Altimetry (PCRA) offer the potential for recent measurements and to fill gaps in some areas. Nevertheless, there is a high demand of new spaceborne radar sensors that provide time series of very short repeat pass data to enable regular grounding line monitoring with most accurate Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) on a continental scale.

TI  - The Image of the "Alien" in Epistolary Works by Nikolay Karamzin
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is aimed at understanding the image of the "alien" in Nikolay Karamzin's letters to different addressees. Epistolary works are considered as a significant part of Karamzin's creative heritage. The author of the work states the fact that the writer's private correspondence expands the boundaries of documentariness through the principles and techniques of an artistic understanding of reality; therefore, the form and ideological content of the letters, the motivational complex manifested in them, the key images, their subjective organization reflect Karamzin's characteristic methods of a literary presentation of reality, the organization principles of an epistolary dialogue with the addressee, in which the connection between "own" and "alien", Russia and Europe, "us" and "them" are comprehended among other things. Various levels of Karamzin's self-reflection are given through the correlation of "own" and "alien", as well his specific epistolary behavior, which is based on special strategies of the author's self-presentation. The image of the author, like the image of the addressee, the character of Karamzin's letters, influence their imagology. Foreign cultural images, one of which in particular is Don Quixote, which is an expression of humanistic ideas promoting the welfare of all humankind, patriotism, worldwide responsiveness, a kind of quintessence of the author's idealistic attitudes, also contribute to the comprehension and translation of his own worldview. The image of the "alien" is revealed in a special way in the motive structure of Karamzin's letters, in particular, in the motive of the native land. At the same time, the philosophy of the "alien" space becomes an instrument for the life-building of the author of the letters, contributes to the declaration of his value system: "own" (holy Russia, Fatherland, home) is truly valuable, it requires constructive endeavour, "alien" is ephemeral, distracting from real things. Obviously, the image of the "alien" in Karamzin's letters is inseparable from the image of the "own", thoughts about the fate of Russia; it is inextricably linked with Karamzin's political pedagogy and moral and philosophical ideals. The consideration of Karamzin's letters through the prism of the image of the "alien" makes it possible to highlight significant aspects of the author's worldview, consider the dynamics of characteristic elements of his poetics that appear in the letters and are determined by the writer's life and creative way. Karamzin's letters represent an example of how an epistolary text interacts with the literary tradition, participates in the creative activity of its author, and, not at least, becomes productive for national prose development in general and epistolary works in particular, how it influences the development of national consciousness.

TI  - Multi-decadal patterns of vegetation succession after tundra fire on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) is one of the warmest parts of the Arctic tundra biome and tundra fires are common in its upland areas. Here, we combine field measurements, Landsat observations, and quantitative cover maps for tundra plant functional types (PFTs) to characterize multi-decadal succession and landscape change after fire in lichen-dominated upland tundra of the YKD, where extensive wildfires occurred in 1971-1972, 1985, 2006-2007, and 2015. Unburned tundra was characterized by abundant lichens, and low lichen cover was consistently associated with historical fire. While we observed some successional patterns that were consistent with earlier work in Alaskan tussock tundra, other patterns were not. In the landscape we studied, a large proportion of pre-fire moss cover and surface peat tended to survive fire, which favors survival of existing vascular plants and limits opportunities for seed recruitment. Although shrub cover was much higher in 1985 and 1971-1972 burns than in unburned tundra, tall shrubs (>0.5 m height) were rare and the PFT maps indicate high landscape-scale variability in the degree and persistence of shrub increase after fire. Fire has induced persistent changes in species composition and structure of upland tundra on the YKD, but the lichen-dominated fuels and thick surface peat appear to have limited the potential for severe fire and accompanying edaphic changes. Soil thaw depths were about 10 cm deeper in 2006-2007 burns than in unburned tundra, but were similar to unburned tundra in 1985 and 1971-1972 burns. Historically, repeat fire has been rare on the YKD, and the functional diversity of vegetation has recovered within several decades post-fire. Our findings provide a basis for predicting and monitoring post-fire tundra succession on the YKD and elsewhere.

TI  - TOPPLING ORANGES: DEATH, DISABILITY, DECLINE, AND READMISSION OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING ELDERLY PATIENTS AFTER AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Every emergency department (ED) faces both a rising tide and a revolving door of elderly patients. Unplanned short-term returns after a recent ED evaluation or hospital admission are sentinel events. Consequences include substantial functional decline, reduced health-related quality of life, and increased risk of dependency or death. Returning families, unaware of the significant likelihood of deterioration after an ED or hospital discharge, often harbor suspicions that something was missed. Literature describing the significant likelihood of functional decline in elderly patients after ED or hospital discharge is presented. Suggestions for incorporating the potential for subsequent deterioration into the evaluation of elderly ED patients and the discussions surrounding disposition decisions are included. Discussion: In addition to impacting patients and families, posthospitalization decline and short-term readmissions create serious burdens for hospitals and their EDs. Education, vigilance, specialized geriatric EDs, dedicated inpatient units, and ED access to outpatient services for the elderly can aid in the recognition and mitigation of postvisit functional decline and associated returns. Financial incentives for reducing short-term readmissions can translate into novel approaches and referral arrangements. Conclusions: Currently, and for the foreseeable future, EDs are integral to predicting, identifying, and preventing functional decline in the elderly. For now, we are all Geriatric EDs.

TI  - Object-Based Shadow Index via Illumination Intensity from High Resolution Satellite Images over Urban Areas
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - For multi-spectral remote sensing imagery, accurate shadow extraction is of great significance for overcoming the information loss caused by high buildings and the solar incidence angle in urban remote sensing. However, diverse solar illumination conditions, similarities between shadows, and other dark land features bring uncertainties and deviations to shadow extraction processes and results. In this paper, we classify shadows as either strong or weak based on the ratio between ambient light intensity and direct light intensity, and use the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA), which is a multi-scale segmentation method based on spectral and shape heterogeneity, to reduce the interference of salt and pepper noise and relieve the error of misdiagnosing land covers with high reflectivity in shaded regions as unshaded ones. Subsequently, an object-based shadow index (OSI) is presented according to the illumination intensities of different reflectance features, as well as using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and near infrared (NIR) band to highlight shadows and eliminate water body interference. The data from three high-spatial-resolution satellites-WorldView-2 (WV-2), WorldView-3 (WV-3), and GaoFen-2 (GF-2)-were used to test the methods and verify the robustness of the OSI. The results show that the OSI index performed well regarding both strong and weak shadows with the user accuracy and the producer accuracy both above 90%, while the four other existing indexes that were tested were not effective at diverse solar illumination conditions. In addition, all the disturbances from water body were excluded well when using the OSI, except for the GF-2 data in weak shadows.

TI  - Recent Surge Behavior of Walsh Glacier Revealed by Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many surge-type glaciers are present on the St. Elias Mountains, but a detailed study on the surge behavior of the glaciers is still missing. In this study, we used remote sensing data to reveal detailed glacier surge behavior, focusing on the recent surge at Walsh Glacier, which was reported to have surged once in the 1960s. Glacial velocities were derived using a cross-correlation algorithm, and changes in the medial moraines were interpreted based on Landsat images. The digital elevation model (DEM) difference method was applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEMs to evaluate the surface elevation of the glacier. The results showed that the surge initiated near the conjunction of the eastern and northern branches, and then quickly spread downward. The surge period was almost three years, with an active phase of less than two years. The advancing speed of the surge front was much large than the maximum ice velocity of approximate to 14 m/d observed during the active phase. Summer speed-ups and a winter speed-up in ice velocity were observed from velocity data, with the speed-ups being more obvious during the active phase. Changes in the glacier velocity and the medial moraines suggested that the eastern branch was more affected by the surge. The DEM differencing results showed that the receiving zone thickened up to about 140 m, and the upstream reservoir zone became thinner. These surge behaviors, as characterized by remote sensing data, gave us more detailed insights into the surge dynamics of Walsh Glacier.

TI  - Analysis of cropping patterns in Sudan's Gash Spate Irrigation System using Landsat 8 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spate irrigation has been conducted in eastern Sudan's Gash Delta; however, availability of data necessary to understand actual conditions is limited. Therefore, we identified annual land cover types (irrigated crop land, non-crop land, and shrub land) in the Gash spate irrigation system using images obtained from Landsat 8. Further, we analyzed spatial cropping patterns and crop-fallow rotation characteristics for six irrigation blocks (Kassala, Mekali, Degain, Tendelai, Metateib, and Hadaliya) based on land-cover classification. To classify , land cover types, we compared three vegetation indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and examined six water-related indices, including the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Comparing the accuracy of these indices shows that NDVI and NDWIGS1 calculated from green and short-wave infrared performs best for land cover classification. We identified irrigated areas with a decision tree model using NDVI and NDWIGS1 time series data. The results showed that irrigated areas vary annually and are determined by available water resources from the Gash River. We found that the coefficient of variation of the irrigated areas is lower in the upper irrigation blocks (Kassala and Mekali) and higher in the lower irrigation blocks. We investigated crop-fallow rotation patterns and show that a two-year rotation pattern, in which irrigation and fallowing are conducted alternately, is dominant in the two upper irrigation blocks (Kassala and Mekali), while a three-year rotation pattern in which land lies fallow for two years is the main type adopted in the two lower irrigation blocks (Metateib and Hadaliya).

TI  - Detecting tree mortality with Landsat-derived spectral indices: Improving ecological accuracy by examining uncertainty
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived fire severity metrics are a foundational tool used to estimate fire effects at the landscape scale. Changes in surface characteristics permit reasonably accurate delineation between burned and unburned areas, but variability in severity within burned areas is much more challenging to detect. Previous studies have relied primarily on categorical data to calibrate severity indices in terms of classification accuracy, but this approach does not readily translate into an expected amount of error in terms of actual tree mortality. We addressed this issue by examining a dataset of 40,370 geolocated trees that burned in the 2013 California Rim Fire using 36 Landsat-derived burn severity indices.The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) performed reliably well, but the differenced SWIR:NIR ratio most accurately predicted percent basal area mortality and the differenced normalized vegetation index (dNDVI) most accurately predicted percent mortality of stems >= 10 cm diameter at breast height. Relativized versions of dNBR did not consistently improve accuracy; the relativized burn ratio (RBR) was generally equivalent to dNBR while RdNBR had consistently lower accuracy.There was a high degree of variability in observed tree mortality, especially at intermediate spectral index values. This translated into a considerable amount of uncertainty at the landscape scale, with an expected range in estimated percent basal area mortality greater than 37% for half of the area burned (> 50,000 ha). In other words, a 37% range in predicted mortality rate was insufficient to capture the observed mortality rate for half of the area burned. Uncertainty was even greater for percent stem mortality, with half of the area burned exceeding a 46% range in predicted mortality rate. The high degree of uncertainty in tree mortality that we observed challenges the confidence with which Landsat-derived spectral indices have been used to measure fire effects, and this has broad implications for research and management related to post-fire landscape complexity, distribution of seed sources, or persistence of fire refugia. We suggest ways to account for uncertainty that will facilitate a more nuanced and ecologically-accurate interpretation of fire effects.This study makes three key contributions to the field of remote sensing of fire effects: 1) we conducted the most comprehensive comparison to date of all previously published severity indices using the largest contiguous set of georeferenced tree mortality field data and revealed that the accuracy of both absolute and relative spectral indices depends on the tree mortality metric of interest;2) we conducted this study in a single, large fire that enabled us to isolate variability due to intrinsic, within-landscape factors without the additional variance due to extrinsic factors associated with different biogeographies or climatic conditions; and 3) we identified the range in tree mortality that may be indistinguishable based on spectral indices derived from Landsat satellites, and we demonstrated how this variability translates into a considerable amount of uncertainty in fire effects at the landscape scale.

TI  - PlanetScope and Landsat 8 Imageries for Bathymetry Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry has a great importance in coastal projects. Obtaining proper bathymetric information is necessary for navigation, numerical modeling, and coastal zone management studies. Over the past three decades, a number of measuring protocols have been validated for bathymetry mapping, either by means of echosounding or LIght Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). Although these traditional methods hold a high vertical accuracy, they may have limitations in accessibility for some areas. Remote sensing (RS) techniques can be alternatively utilized for bathymetry extraction and update for such cases. The satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) can be analytically or empirically obtained based on various RS datasets with different spatiotemporal resolution. The current study proposes a methodology to spatially enhance the Landsat-derived bathymetry. Two different satellite images, i.e., Landsat and PlantScope with a spatial resolution of 30 and 3 m respectively have been assessed in bathymetry mapping. The Landsat image resolution has been spatially enhanced to match the Planetscope resolution. The panchromatic band of the Landsat image has been downscaled and used for pan-sharpening the multispectral bands. The bathymetry was empirically estimated from the blue and green spectral bands using the linear model by Lyzenga. The SDB model was calibrated using field measurements of water depths observed by a single beam echosounder. The Bathymetry detection methodology has been applied in an area of the Northern coast of Egypt. The SDB from the PlanetScope, Landsat 8 OLI, and Enhanced Landsat 8 OLI were assessed using error analysis. It was found that the Enhanced Landsat has a comparable result with the PlanetScope. The root mean square error is 0.38 and 0.43 m for PlanetScope and Enhanced Landsat, respectively. The current methodology was also tested by the ratio transform model for SDB and the results revealed the same conclusion as the linear model. Thus, the developed algorithm provides SDB using free Landsat images that is of comparable accuracy to the relatively expensive PlanetScope SDB.

TI  - Expansion of Eastern Redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i> L.) into the Deciduous Woodlands within the Forest-Prairie Ecotone of Kansas
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - North America's midcontinent forest-prairie ecotone is currently exhibiting extensive eastern redcedar (ERC) (Juniperus virginiana L.) encroachment. Rapid expansion of ERC has major impacts on the species composition and forest structure within this region and suppresses previously dominant oak (Quercus) species. In Kansas, the growing-stock volume of ERC increased by 15,000% during 1965-2010. The overarching goal of this study was to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of ERC in the forest-prairie ecotone of Kansas and understand its effects on deciduous forests. This was achieved through two specific objectives: (i) characterize an effective image classification approach to map ERC expansion, and (ii) assess ERC expansion between 1986 and 2017 in three study areas within the forest-prairie ecotone of Kansas, and especially expansion into deciduous forests. The analysis was based on satellite imagery acquired by Landsat TM and OLI sensors during 1986-2017. The use of multi-seasonal layer-stacks with a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-supervised classification was found to be the most effective approach to classify ERC distribution with high accuracy. The overall accuracies for the change maps generated for the three study areas ranged between 0.95 (95 CI: +/- 0.02) and 0.96 (+/- 0.03). The total ERC cover increased in excess of 6000 acres in each study area during the 30-year period. The estimated percent increase of ERC cover was 139%, 539%, and 283% for the Tuttle Creek reservoir, Perry reservoir, and Bourbon County north study areas, respectively. This astounding rate of expansion had significant impacts on the deciduous forests where the conversion of deciduous woodlands to ERC, as a percentage of the total encroachment, were 48%, 56%, and 71%, for the Tuttle Creek reservoir, Perry reservoir, and Bourbon County north study areas, respectively. These results strongly affirm that control measures should be implemented immediately to restore the threatened deciduous woodlands of the region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characteristics of ozone pollution and policy implications in Northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground-level ozone (O-3) pollution has become an emerging air quality issue in China. To effectively mitigate ozone pollution in Northeast China (NEC), this study focuses on its characteristics based on the surface ozone, meteorological data, and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data. Statistical methods are applied to analyze the effects of meteorology on O-3 pollution. The results show that the area and annual averaged maximum 8-h average O-3 concentrations rose from 81.3 to 87.4 mu g/m(3) during 2015-2018 and the nonattainment days kept increasing. The ground-observed O-3 concentrations and OMI ozone vertical column densities (VCDs) displayed the pattern of highs in the southwest and lows the northeast of the NEC region with the exceedance areas mainly located over the Liaoning and Jilin provinces in spring and summer. The long-term series of O-3, HCHO and NO2 VCDs averaged over NEC all exhibited annual upward trends. Indicated by the OMI HCHO/NO2 ratio, the seasonal and spatial O-3 -VOCs-NO sensitivities in NEC provide the control measure guidance for government agencies. Also the ozone control measure needs to consider the biogenic emissions along with the anthropogenic VOCs emissions due to the vast forest areas and large-scale agricultural production in NEC. The ozone pollution episodes in NEC were correlated with weather conditions of high temperature, low relative humidity, long sunshine duration and southwesterly wind in summer and the impact of the East Asia summer monsoon cannot be ignored. Future investigation into VOCs' measurements and emission inventories are much needed for ozone pollution control in NEC.

TI  - Identification of Dominant Factors Affecting Soil Erosion and Water Yield within Ecological Red Line Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil conservation and water retention are important metrics for designating key ecological functional areas and ecological red line (ERL) areas. However, research on the quantitative identification of dominant environmental factors in different ecological red line areas remains relatively inadequate, which is unfavorable for the zone-based management of ecological functional areas. This paper presents a case study of Beijing's ERL areas. In order to objectively reflect the ecological characteristics of ERL areas in Beijing, which is mainly dominated by mountainous areas, the application of remote sensing data at a high resolution is important for the improvement of model calculation and spatial heterogeneity. Based on multi-source remote sensing data, meteorological and soil observations as well as soil erosion and water yield were calculated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Combining the influencing factors, including slope, precipitation, land use type, vegetation coverage, geomorphological type, and elevation, a quantitative attribution analysis was performed on soil erosion and water yield in Beijing's ERL areas using the geographical detector. The power of each influencing factor and their interaction factors in explaining the spatial distribution of soil erosion or water yield varied significantly among different ERL areas. Vegetation coverage was the dominant factor affecting soil erosion in Beijing's ERL areas, explaining greater than 30% of its spatial heterogeneity. Land use type could explain the spatial heterogeneity of water yield more than 60%. In addition, the combination of vegetation coverage and slope was found to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of soil erosion (>55% in various ERL areas). The superposition of land use type and slope explained greater than 70% of the spatial distribution for water yield in ERL areas. The geographical detector results indicated that the high soil erosion risk areas and high water yield areas varied significantly among different ERL areas. Thus, in efforts to enhance ERL protection, focus should be placed on the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion and water yield in different ERL areas.

TI  - Land Cover Changes and Drivers in the Water Source Area of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MR-SNWDP) in China, with construction beginning in 2003, diverts water from Danjiangkou Reservoir to North China for residential, agriculture and industrial use. The water source area of the MR-SNWDP is the region that is most sensitive to and most affected by the construction of this water diversion project. In this study, we used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and HJ-1A/B images from 2000 to 2015 by an object-based approach with a hierarchical classification method for mapping land cover in the water source area. The changes in land cover were illuminated by transfer matrixes, single dynamic degree, slope zones and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The results indicated that the area of cropland decreased by 31% and was replaced mainly by shrub over the past 15 years, whereas forest and settlements showed continuous increases of 29.2% and 77.7%, respectively. The changes in cropland were obvious in all slope zones and decreased most remarkably (-43.8%) in the slope zone above 25 degrees. Compared to the FVC of forest and shrub, significant improvement was exhibited in the FVC of grassland, with a growth rate of 16.6%. We concluded that local policies, including economic development, water conservation and immigration resulting from the construction of the MR-SNWDP, were the main drivers of land cover changes; notably, they stimulated the substantial and rapid expansion of settlements, doubled the wetlands and drove the transformation from cropland to settlements in immigration areas.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is potentially the most dangerous form of skin tumor and causes 90% of skin cancer mortality. A unique collaboration of multidisciplinary experts from the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on CM diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. The diagnosis of melanoma can be made clinically and shall always be confirmed through dermatoscopy. If a melanoma is suspected, a histopathological examination is required. Sequential digital dermatoscopy and full-body photography can be used in risk persons to detect the development of melanomas at an earlier stage. Where available, confocal reflectance microscopy can improve clinical diagnosis in special cases. Melanoma shall be classified according to the 8th version of the AJCC classification. Thin melanomas up to 0.8 mm tumor thickness does not require further imaging diagnostics. From stage IB onwards, examinations with lymph node sonography are recommended, but no further imaging examinations. From stage IIC whole-body examinations with CT or PET-CT in combination with brain MRI are recommended. From stage III and higher, mutation testing is recommended, particularly for BRAF V600 mutation. It is important to provide a structured follow-up to detect relapses and secondary primary melanomas as early as possible. There is no evidence to support the frequency and extent of examinations. A stage-based follow-up scheme is proposed, which, according to the experience of the guideline group, covers the minimum requirements; further studies may be considered. This guideline is valid until the end of 2021. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A unique collaboration of multidisciplinary experts from the European Dermatology Forum, the European Association of Dermato-Oncology and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on cutaneous melanoma diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. Cutaneous melanomas are excised with 1- to 2-cm safety margins. Sentinel lymph node dissection shall be performed as a staging procedure in patients with tumour thickness >= 1.0 mm or >= 0.8 mm with additional histological risk factors, although there is as yet no clear survival benefit for this approach. Therapeutic decisions in stage III/IV patients should be primarily made by an interdisciplinary oncology team ("Tumor Board"). Adjuvant therapies in stage III/IV patients are primarily anti-PD-1, independent of mutational status, or dabrafenib plus trametinib for BRAF-mutant patients. In distant metastasis, either resected or not, systemic treatment is indicated. For first-line treatment, particularly in BRAF wild-type patients, immunotherapy with PD-1 antibodies alone or in combination with CTLA-4 antibodies shall be considered. In particular scenarios for patients with stage IV melanoma and a BRAF-V600 E/K mutation, first-line therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors can be offered as an alternative to immunotherapy. In patients with primary resistance to immunotherapy and harbouring a BRAF-V600 E/K mutation, this therapy shall be offered in second-line. Systemic therapy in stage III/IV melanoma is a rapidly changing landscape, and it is likely that these recommendations may change in the near future. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation in the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter: A study in fourth largest urban agglomeration in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to atmospheric particulate matter is still a serious concern in the developing countries, as the incremental concentrations of PM10 continues to exceed. Limited literature has been reported on spatial - temporal variability of PM10 and its relationship with vegetation using remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques. The data for the study were collected in four geographically distinct areas (i.e., Adyar, Anna Nagar, Kilpauk and T. Nagar)in the fourth largest urban agglomeration, Chennai city, India during 2013 to 2018. The spatial variability has been identified for PM10 in selected locations, as well as concentration variation in different seasons was also investigated. It was observed that the levels of PM10 pollution were higher within vicinity of the industrial zone. However, the seasonal variation especially dry monsoon season effect makes the level higher in concentration. The changes in vegetative cover in the study area were studied using Landsat-8 imageries for the period 2013-2018. The Landsat-8 imageries were used to obtain the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which aids in studying the vegetative cover. The study shows that with increase in NDVI values there is a decrease in the concentration of particulate matter. This shows that measures need to be taken in the study area to increase the vegetative cover, so that the effect of pollutants can be alleviated in the atmosphere. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Linear spectral unmixing algorithm for modelling suspended sediment concentration of flash floods, upper Tekeze River, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are the highest sediment transporting agent, but are inaccessible for in-situ sampling and have rarely been analyzed by remote sensing technology. Laboratory and field experiments were done to develop linear spectral unmixing (LSU) remote sensing model and evaluate its performance in simulating the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in flash floods. The models were developed from continuous monitoring in the laboratory and the onsite spectral signature of river bed sediment deposits and flash floods in the Tekeze River and in its tributary, the Tsirare River. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the variability of correlations between reflectance and SSCs. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square of error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the generated models. The results found that the Pearson correlation coefficient between SSCs and reflectance varied based on the level of the SSCs, geological colors, and grain sizes. The performance of the LSU model and empirical remote sensing approaches were computed to be R2 = 0.92, and RMSE = +/- 0.76 g/l in the Tsirare River and R2 = 0.91, and RMSE = +/- 0.73 g/l in the Tekeze River and R2 = 0.81, RMSE = +/- 2.65 g/l in the Tsirare river and R2 = 0.76, RMSE = +/- 10.87 g/l in the Tekeze River, respectively. Hence, the LSU approach of remote sensing was found to be relatively accurate in monitoring and modeling the variability of SSCs that could be applied to the upper Tekeze River basin.

TI  - Advancing Learning Assignments in Remote Sensing of the Environment Through Simulation Games
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental remote sensing has faced increasing satellite data availability, advanced algorithms for thematic analysis, and novel concepts of ground truth. For that reason, contents and concepts of learning and teaching remote sensing are constantly evolving. This eventually leads to the intuition of methodologically linking academic learning assignments with case-related scopes of application. In order to render case-related learning possible, smart teaching and interactive learning contexts are appreciated and required for remote sensing. That is due to the fact that those contexts are considered promising to trigger and gradually foster students' comprehensive interdisciplinary thinking. To this end, the following contribution introduces the case-related concept of applying simulation games as a promising didactic format in teaching/learning assignments of remote sensing. As to methodology, participating students have been invited to take on individual roles bound to technology-related profiles (e.g., satellite-mission planning, irrigation, etc.) Based on the scenario, stakeholder teams have been requested to elaborate, analyze and negotiate viable solutions for soil moisture monitoring in a defined context. Collaboration has been encouraged by providing the protected, specifically designed remoSSoil-incubator environment. This letter-type paper aims to introduce the simulation game technique in the context of remote sensing as a type of scholarly teaching; it evaluates learning outcomes by adopting certain techniques of scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL); and it provides food for thought of replicating, adapting and enhancing simulation games as an innovative, disruptive next-generation learning environment in remote sensing.

TI  - Deriving Tidal Structure From Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In shallow coastal regions, tides often control the water flux, which in turn directs sediment transport, nutrient delivery, and geochemical gradients. However, tides in shallow areas are spatially heterogeneous, making it challenging to constrain the geographic structure of tidal phase and amplitude without extensive networks of tide gauges. We present a simple remote sensing method for deriving tidal structure from satellite time series. Our method is based on two observations: (1) Tidally driven variations in water depth can be detected as changes in pixel intensity in optical satellite imagery, and (2) repeating passes by an orbiting satellite capture a region at different phases of the tidal cycle. By stacking multiple satellite acquisitions of a shallow bank, we can compute the relative tidal phase and amplitude for each pixel location, thereby resolving a detailed map of tidal propagation and attenuation. While our method requires a set of local water-depth measurements to calibrate the color-to-depth relationship and compute tidal amplitude (in meters), our method can produce spatial estimates of tidal phase and relative amplitude without any site-specific calibration data. As an illustration of the method, we use Landsat imagery to derive the spatial structure of tides on the Great Bahama Bank, estimating tidal phase and amplitude with mean absolute errors of 15 min and 0.15 m, respectively.

TI  - Synthesizing Remote Sensing and Biophysical Measures to Evaluate Human-wildlife Conflicts: The Case of Wild Boar Crop Raiding in Rural China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop raiding by wild boars is a growing problem worldwide with potentially damaging consequences for rural dwellers' cooperation with conservation policies. Still, limited resources inhibit continuous monitoring, and there is uncertainty about the relationship between the biophysical realities of crop raiding and humans' perceptions and responses. By integrating data from camera traps, remote sensors, and household surveys, this study establishes an empirical model of wild boar population density that can be applied to multiple years to estimate changes in distribution over time. It also correlates historical estimates of boar population distribution with human-reported trends to support the model's validity and assess local perceptions of crop raiding. Although the model proved useful in coniferous and bamboo forests, it is less useful in mixed broadleaf, evergreen broadleaf, and deciduous forests. Results also show alignment between perceptions of crop raiding and actual boar populations, corroborating farmers' perceptions which are increasingly dismissed as a less reliable source of information in human-wildlife conflict research. The modeling techniques demonstrated here may provide conservation practitioners with a cost-effective way to maintain up-to-date estimates of the spatial distribution of wild boar and resultant crop raiding.

TI  - The German Novel of the 1960-70s: Artistic Conception, of History
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the German-language literature of the 1960-70s, novelistic prose emerged, which not only narrated about the German identity but also appealed to international solidarity and the formation of historical worldview. The German novel of the second half of the 20th century, associated with the original artistic conception of the history of a yet divided Germany, was given new meaning in the works of such writers as Johannes Bobrowski, Erwin Strittmatter, Franz Fuhmann, and Jurek Becker. Bobrowski's artistic style laid the foundation for a generation of writers following his original creative legacy. Thus, the goal of the study is to consider the perception and rethinking of Bobrowski's artistic experience by the writers. This manifested in their interpretation of the "multicultural" writer's creative method, reliving their childhood years, and introducing the reader to the history of their homeland using new literary devices.

TI  - Deforestation and Connectivity among Protected Areas of Tanzania
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) in Tanzania had been established originally for the goal of habitat, landscape and biodiversity conservation. However, human activities such as agricultural expansion and wood harvesting pose challenges to the conservation objectives. We monitored a decade of deforestation within 708 PAs and their unprotected buffer areas, analyzed deforestation by PA management regimes, and assessed connectivity among PAs. Data came from a Landsat based wall-to-wall forest to non-forest change map for the period 2002-2013, developed for the definition of Tanzania's National Forest Reference Emissions Level (FREL). Deforestation data were extracted in a series of concentric bands that allow pairwise comparison and correlation analysis between the inside of PAs and the external buffer areas. Half of the PAs exhibit either no deforestation or significantly less deforestation than the unprotected buffer areas. A small proportion (10%; n = 71) are responsible for more than 90% of the total deforestation; but these few PAs represent more than 75% of the total area under protection. While about half of the PAs are connected to one or more other PAs, the remaining half, most of which are Forest Reserves, are isolated. Furthermore, deforestation inside isolated PAs is significantly correlated with deforestation in the unprotected buffer areas, suggesting pressure from land use outside PAs. Management regimes varied in reducing deforestation inside PA territories, but differences in protection status within a management regime are also large. Deforestation as percentages of land area and forested areas of PAs was largest for Forest Reserves and Game Controlled areas, while most National Parks, Nature Reserves and Forest Plantations generally retained large proportions of their forest cover. Areas of immediate management concern include the few PAs with a disproportionately large contribution to the total deforestation, and the sizeable number of PAs being isolated. Future protection should account for landscapes outside protected areas, engage local communities and establish new PAs or corridors such as village-managed forest areas.

TI  - Towards an automated approach to map flooded areas from Sentinel-2 MSI data and soft integration of water spectral features
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we propose an approach for mapping flooded areas from Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) data based on soft fuzzy integration of evidence scores derived from both band combinations (i.e. Spectral Indices - SIs) and components of the Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) colour transformation. Evidence scores are integrated with Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators, which model user's decision attitude varying smoothly between optimistic and pessimistic approach. Output is a map of global evidence degree showing the plausibility of being flooded for each pixel of the input Sentinel-2 (S2) image. Algorithm set up and validation were carried out with data over three sites in Italy where water surfaces are extracted from stable water bodies (lakes and rivers), natural hazard flooding, and irrigated paddy rice fields. Validation showed more than satisfactory accuracy for the OR-like OWA operators (F-score > 0.90) with performance slightly decreased (F-score < 0.75) over heterogeneous conditions (e.g. rice fields). The algorithm was applied with no changes and/or tuning to independent sites from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) activations to simulate operational conditions. Over these sites, the proposed approach achieved greater, more consistent and robust mapping accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on the segmentation of single input features. Moreover, OWA operators offer an appealing way of combining and aggregating multiple information in decision making by modelling uncertainty in decision process.

AB  - The paper proposes a transparent approach for mapping the status of environmental phenomena from multisource information based on both soft computing and machine learning. It is transparent, intended as human understandable as far as the employed criteria, and both knowledge and data-driven. It exploits remote sensing experts' interpretations to define the contributing factors from which partial evidence of the environmental status are computed by processing multispectral images. Furthermore, it computes an environmental status indicator (ESI) map by aggregating the partial evidence degrees through a learning mechanism, exploiting volunteered geographic information (VGI). The approach is capable of capturing the specificities of local context, as well as to cope with the subjectivity of experts' interpretations. The proposal is applied to map the status of standing water areas (i.e., water bodies and rivers and human-driven or natural hazard flooding) using multispectral optical images by ESA Sentinel-2 sources. VGI comprises georeferenced observations created both in situ by agronomists using a mobile application and by photointerpreters interacting with a geographic information system (GIS) using several information layers. Results of the validation experiments were performed in three areas of Northern Italy characterized by distinct ecosystems. The proposal showed better performances than traditional methods based on single spectral indexes.

AB  - This study aims to determine the shoreline changes along the Black Sea Coast of Istanbul, which has been occurred in 7 years from 2009 to 2016. For this purpose, remote sensing technology used to detect the shorelines in the study period and geographic information system was established for determining the general and specific changes along the shoreline. In this context, geometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to the data as the preprocessing of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager images. Then after, the Black Sea Shoreline data of Istanbul was extracted by applying supervised classification using maximum likelihood classification algorithm and normalized difference water index to Landsat images. As the following stage of the study, the changes along Black Sea Shoreline were determined using the digital shoreline analysis system software based on the extracted shoreline data. As a result of the study maximum negative and positive distances were determined similarly for the outputs of both applied methodologies as approximately -438 and 466 m. The study concluded that the most significant change along the shoreline was observed at the European side of the city, at a location close to the construction area of Istanbul Airport.

TI  - Monitoring Grass Phenology and Hydrological Dynamics of an Oak-Grass Savanna Ecosystem Using Sentinel-2 and Terrestrial Photography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual grasslands are an essential component of oak savanna ecosystems as the primary source of fodder for livestock and wildlife. Drought resistance adaptation has led them to complete their life cycle before serious soil and plant water deficits develop, resulting in a close link between grass phenology and soil water dynamics. In this work, these links were explored using a combination of terrestrial photography, satellite imagery and hydrological ground measurements. We obtained key phenological parameters of the grass cycle from terrestrial camera data using the Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCCc) index. These parameters were compared with those provided by time-series of vegetation indices (VI) obtained from Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites and time-series of abiotic variables, which defined the hydrology of the system. The results showed that the phenological parameters estimated by the S2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and soil moisture (SM) (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) presented the best agreement with ground-derived observations compared to those provided by other vegetation indices and abiotic variables. The study of NDVI and SM dynamics, that was extended over four growing seasons (July 2015-May 2019), showed that the seasonality of both variables was highly synchronized, with the best agreements at the beginning and at the end of the dry seasons. However, stage changes were estimated first by SM, followed by NDVI, with a delay of between 3 and 10 days. These results support the use of a multi-approach method to monitor the phenology and the influence of the soil moisture dynamic under the study conditions.

TI  - Both near-surface and satellite remote sensing confirm drought legacy effect on tropical forest leaf phenology after 2015/2016 ENSO drought
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon forest leaf phenology patterns have often been inferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). But reliable MODIS detection of seasonal and interannual leaf phenology patterns has also been questioned and is generally not validated with field observation. Here we compare inter-annual patterns of local-scale upper canopy leaf phenology and demography derived from tower-mounted phenocams at two upland forest sites in the Central Amazon, to corresponding satellite vegetation indices retrieved from MODIS-MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction). We focus on forest response to an unprecedented drought caused by the El Nino of 2015-16. At both sites, multi-year phenocam data showed post-drought shifts in leaf demography. These were consistent with MODIS-MAIAC anomalies in two vegetation indices. Specifically, a precocious leaf flush at both sites during the first two post-drought months, Feb-Mar 2016, caused (1) an anomalous decrease in flushing trees in Jun Jul of 2016 and (2) an increase of trees with early mature stage leaves (2-4 mo age) in Apr-May-Jun of 2016. At both sites, these two phenological anomalies showed up in MODIS-MAIAC as, respectively, (1) a strong negative anomaly in Gcc (Green chromatic coordinate), which prior work has shown to be sensitive to the abundance of leaves 0-1 mo old, and (2) a strong positive anomaly in EVI, which is sensitive to abundance of leaves 2-4 mo age. A shift to sub-optimal seasonal leaf age mix is expected to change the ecosystem-scale intrinsic photosynthetic capacity for similar to 18 month after the drought.

TI  - The Current Configuration of the OSTIA System for Operational Production of Foundation Sea Surface Temperature and Ice Concentration Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system generates global, daily, gap-filled foundation sea surface temperature (SST) fields from satellite data and in situ observations. The SSTs have uncertainty information provided with them and an ice concentration (IC) analysis is also produced. Additionally, a global, hourly diurnal skin SST product is output each day. The system is run in near real time to produce data for use in applications such as numerical weather prediction. Data production is monitored routinely and outputs are available from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS; marine.copernicus.eu). As an operational product, the OSTIA system is continuously under development. For example, since the original descriptor paper was published, the underlying data assimilation scheme that is used to generate the foundation SST analyses has been updated. Various publications have described these changes but a full description is not available in a single place. This technical note focuses on the production of the foundation SST and IC analyses by OSTIA and aims to provide a comprehensive description of the current system configuration.

TI  - An effective quality analysis of XML web data using hybrid clustering and classification approach
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective quality analysis of XML web data using clustering and classification approach is used in our proposed method. XML is turning into a standard in representation of data, it is attractive to support keyword search in XML database. A keyword search searches for words anyplace in record. It is developed as best worldview for finding data on web. The most imperative prerequisite for the keyword search is to rank the consequences of question so that the most pertinent outcomes show up. Here, we gather more XML documents. Followed by that, feature extraction occurs. Since the selected feature contains both relevant as well as irrelevant features it is essential to filter the irrelevant features. For the purpose of selecting, the relevant features probability-based feature selection method is used. Then for clustering the relevant features on the basis of keywords weighted fuzzy c means clustering algorithm is used. In order to assess the XML data quality, optimal neural network (ONN) classifier is utilized. In this ONN classifier in order to select the optimal weights, whale optimization algorithm is used. Thus, the web pages are effectively ranked. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed using clustering and classification accuracy, RMSE, and search time. The proposed method is implemented in JAVA.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - North-east India is constituted of highly diverse ecosystems with unique characteristics with high dependency on primary sector income (86% on agriculture). It is very crucial to look into the issues like agriculture, ecosystem services and sociocultural aspects of endemic population, while urban areas are expanding. This paper examines the issues pertinent to peri-urban expansion with a case study from the biggest city of the region, Guwahati. The scope for sustainable development planning in peri-urban region through analysing spatial, economic, social, institutional and environmental aspects has been incorporated in this paper. Landscape research has been enhanced with temporal and spatial analysis of land-use and land-cover change for better landscape management. Remotely sensed data are the most important data source for land-cover change trajectories over three decades at three points of time (1991, 2001 and 2011) for the selected study landscape. This research explores the temporal composition of the main land-use land-cover classes. The major changes in land-use land-cover classes observed from the study are reduction in natural land cover (from 83.57 to 61.85%) and increase in built-up area (from 0.96 to 15.39%) and agricultural (from 6.01 to 15.59%) uses. Despite the intensification of agricultural land area, there has been decrease in agricultural livelihoods and subsequent reduction in income contribution from natural resource-based livelihoods. These findings on land-use land-cover change can be inferred as the impacts of peri-urbanization leading to degradation of agricultural land, deforestation, deterioration of wetland and wild habitat destruction.

TI  - Phenological Dynamics Characterization of Alignment Trees with Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Vegetation Indices Time Series Reconstruction Methodology Adapted to Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel methodology for the characterization of tree vegetation phenology, based on vegetation indices time series reconstruction and adapted to urban areas. The methodology is based on a pixel by pixel curve fitting classification, together with a subsequent Savitzky-Golay filtering of raw phenological curves from pixels classified as vegetation. Moreover, the new method is conceived to face specificities of urban environments such as: the high heterogeneity of impervious/natural elements, the 3D structure of the city inducing shadows, the restricted spatial extent of individual tree crowns and the strong biodiversity of urban vegetation. Three vegetation indices have been studied: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index 1 (NDRE1), which are mainly linked to chlorophyll content and leaf density and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) mostly correlated to water content and leaf density. The methodology has been designed to allow the analysis of annual and intra-annual vegetation phenological dynamics. Then, different annual and intra-annual criteria for phenology characterization are proposed and criticized. To show the applicability of the methodology, this article focuses on Sentinel-2 (S-2) imagery covering 2018 and the study of groups of London planes in an alignment structure in the French city of Toulouse. Results showed that the new method allows the ability to (1) describe the heterogeneity of phenologies from London planes exposed to different environmental conditions (urban canyons, proximity with a source of water) and (2) to detect intra-annual phenological dynamics linked to changes in meteorological conditions.

TI  - Flood mapping under vegetation using single SAR acquisitions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables 24-hour, all-weather flood monitoring. However, accurate detection of inundated areas can be hindered by the extremely complicated electromagnetic interaction phenomena between microwave pulses, and horizontal and vertical targets. This manuscript focuses on the problem of inundation mapping in areas with emerging vegetation, where spatial and seasonal heterogeneity makes the systematic distinction between dry and flooded backscatter response even more difficult. In this context, image interpretation algorithms have mostly used detailed field data and reference image(s) to implement electromagnetic models or change detection techniques. However, field data are rare, and despite the increasing availability of SAR acquisitions, adequate reference image(s) might not be readily available, especially for fine resolution acquisitions. To by-pass this problem, this study presents an algorithm for automatic flood mapping in areas with emerging vegetation when only single SAR acquisitions and common ancillary data are available. First, probability binning is used for statistical analysis of the backscatter response of wet and dry vegetation for different land cover types. This analysis is then complemented with information on land use, morphology and context within a fuzzy logic approach. The algorithm was applied to three fine resolution images (one ALOS-PALSAR and two COSMO-SkyMed) acquired during the January 2011 flood in the Condamine-Balonne catchment (Australia). Flood extent layers derived from optical images were used as validation data, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm had an overall accuracy higher than 80% for all case studies. Notwithstanding the difficulty to fully discriminate between dry and flooded vegetation backscatter heterogeneity using a single SAR image, this paper provides an automatic, data parsimonious algorithm for the detection of floods under vegetation.

TI  - EVI Time-Series Breakpoint Detection Using Convolutional Networks for Online Deforestation Monitoring in Chaco Forest
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dry Chaco Forest has the highest absolute deforestation rates of all Argentinian forests (current deforestation rate of 150 000 ha yr(-1), 0.85% yr(-1)). The deforestation process is seen as a breakpoint in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series, associated with the change from a typical forest phenology pattern to something else (e.g., bare soil, pasture, and cropland). Therefore, to monitor this process, a near real-time time-series breakpoint-detection model is needed. In this article, we exploited the 18-year-long MODIS EVI time-series data to train a temporal pattern classification model based on convolutional neural networks. Model architecture parameters (optimizer, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, and so on) were selected using an optimization procedure. The trained model then tries to estimate the probability that a given "time-series segment" corresponds to a deforestation event. The model was validated using in situ data derived from high-resolution images. Results are promising, since the model presents good performance for the validation data set [F1-score = 0.85, f(pr) = 0.0012 (of the order of the true deforestation rate), t(pr) = 0.8, for a sample size = 50 x 10(3)] and average performance in a yearly analysis (F1-score = 0.6, sample size = 1120x10(3)). Model performance was studied using two diagnostic tools: activation maps and model ensemble error estimations. Results show that proposed model presents good extrapolation capabilities, but its maximum F1-score is bounded by error in the available data set (in particular, mislabeled deforestation events).

T2  - NUKLEARMEDIZIN-NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim SPECT using Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-camSPECT) and ultrasound (US) are useful diagnostic modalities in pediatric nephrology. Former studies proved SPECT/US fusion to be a problem-solving tool for thyroid and sentinel lymph node imaging. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of real-time DMSA-camSPECT/US fusion in children and to evaluate the technical implementation.Methods Subsequent to a clinical indicated DMSA-camSPECT showing a mostly normal result, 10 children received a SPECT/US fusion. The magnetic sensor-navigated equipment allows a real-time superposition of three-dimensional SPECT data to live US images according to the position of the transducer.Results 100 % of still images and 90 % of cine-loops were sufficient to depict the kidney; at least one sufficient camSPECT/US fusion loop could be accomplished for every kidney examined. Limitations are mainly caused by standard difficulties of conventional US.Conclusion Real-time DMSA-camSPECT/US is feasible in depiction of renal parenchyma. This newly implemented application broadens the scope of SPECT/US fusion imaging.

TI  - Cosmo-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X datasets for geomorphological mapping in the eastern of Marajo Island, Amazon coast
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon coast is marked by the high discharge of sediments and freshwater, macrotidal influence, a wide continental shelf, extensive flood plains and lowered plateaus which make it unique as a delta and estuary landscape. Further, the tropical climate imposes heavy rains and incessant cloudiness that render microwave systems more suitable for cartography. This study proposed to recognize and map the Amazon coastal environments through the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar, provided by Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) systems. The SAR datasets consisted of interferometric and stereo pairs, restricted to single-revisit and obtained with small interval (1-11 days), under steeper (theta < 35 degrees) and shallow (theta >= 35 degrees) incidence angles, and during the rainy and dry seasons. From the 4 acquisitions of X-band SAR data, attributes such as the backscattering coefficient, coefficient of variation, texture, coherence, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) were derived, adding each variable in 5 scenarios. These combinations resulted in 20 models, which were submitted individually to the machine learning (ML) classification approach by Random Forest (RF). The backscattering and altimetry described the coastal environments which shared ambiguity and high dispersion, with the lowest separability for vegetated environments such as Mangrove, Vegetated Coastal Plateau and Vegetated Fluvial Marine Terrace. The coherence provided by interferometry was weak (<0.44), even during the dry season, in the other hand, the cross-correlation was strong (>0.60), during the rainy and dry season showing more suitability for radargrammetry on the Amazon coast. The RF models resulted in Kappa coefficient between 0.39 to 0.70, indicating that the use of X-band SAR images at an incidence angle greater than 44 degrees and obtained in the dry season is more appropriated for the morphological mapping. The RF models given by TSX achieved the higher mapping accuracies per scenario of SAR products, in order of 0.48 to 0.63. Despite this, the best classification was carried out by 19 RF model with 0.70, provided by CSK in shallow incidence composed by intensity, texture, coherence and stereo DSM. The CSK and TSX data allowed to map the Amazon coast precisely, based on X-band at single polarization, high spatial resolution and revisit, which has demonstrated the support for detailed cartography scale (1:50,000) and frequent updating (monthly up to yearly).

TI  - Thermal Infrared Spectral Characteristics of Bunker Fuel Oil to Determine Oil-Film Thickness and API
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important method for monitoring marine oil-spill accidents. However, methods for measuring oil-film thickness remain insufficient. Due to the stable differences in the surface emissivity and temperature of oil and water, the oil film can be detected using thermal infrared. This study measured emissivity of seven different oil-film thicknesses and seven different American Petroleum Institute (API) densities, and analyzed the spectral characteristics. Results show an optimal wavelength position for oil-film thickness and fuel API density monitoring is 12.55 mu m. Principal component analysis and continuum removal methods were used for data processing. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to establish relationships between emissivity and oil slick thicknesses and API densities. Oil-film thickness and fuel API density data were analyzed by principal component analysis and continuum removal before regression analysis. The spectral emissivity data was convolved into Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal bands to determine potential of the sensor in oil-film detection. The result shows that neither could be used to estimate thickness. The AVHRR-4 band and band 12 and 13 of the ASTER could be used to separate oils from water and have potential to distinguish different oil types.

TI  - Feasibility of Using MODIS Products to Simulate Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) in Boreal Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a novel approach to gain information about plant activity from remote sensing observations. However, there are currently no continuous SIF data produced at high spatial resolutions. Many previous studies have discussed the relationship between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) and showed a significant correlation between them, but few researchers have focused on forests, which are one the most important terrestrial ecosystems. This study takes Greater Khingan Mountains, a typical boreal forest in China, as an example to explore the feasibility of using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF data to simulate continuous SIF at higher spatial resolutions. The results show that there is no significant correlation between SIF and MODIS GPP at a spatial resolution of 1 km; however, significant correlations between SIF and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were found during growing seasons. Furthermore, the broadleaf forest has a higher SIF than coniferous forest because of the difference in leaf and canopy bio-chemical and structural characteristic. When using MODIS EVI to model SIF, linear regression models show average performance (R-2 = 0.58, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 0.14 from Julian day 145 to 257) at a 16-day time scale. However, when using MODIS EVI and temperature, multiple regressions perform better (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.13 from Julian day 145 to 241). An important contribution of this paper is the analysis of the relationships between SIF and vegetation indices at different spatial resolutions and the finding that the relationships became closer with a decrease in spatial resolution. From this research, we conclude that the SIF of the boreal forest investigated can mainly be explained by EVI and air temperature.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of the FROM-GLC30 Land Cover Dataset Based on Watershed Sampling Units: A Continental-Scale Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information plays an essential role in the study of global surface change. Multiple land cover datasets have been produced to meet various application needs. The FROM-GLC30 (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover) dataset is one of the latest land cover products with a resolution of 30 m, which is a relatively high resolution among global public datasets, and the accuracy of this dataset is of great concern in many related researches. The objective of this study was to calculate the accuracy of the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset at the continental scale and to explore the spatial variation differences of each land type accuracy in different regions. In this study, the visual interpretation land cover results at 20,936 small watershed sampling units based on high-resolution remote sensing images were used as the reference data covering 65 countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The reference data were verified by field survey in typical watersheds. Based on that, the accuracy assessment of the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset was carried out. The results showed (1) the area proportion of different land cover types in the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset was generally consistent with that of the reference data. (2) The overall accuracy of the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset was 72.78%, and was highest in West Asia-Northeast Africa, and lowest in South Asia. (3) Among all the seven land cover types, the accuracy of bareland and forest was relatively higher than that of others, and the accuracy of shrubland was the lowest. The accuracy for each land cover type differed among regions. The results of this work can provide useful information for land cover accuracy assessment researches at a large scale and promote the further practical applications of the open-source land cover datasets.

AB  - Background objectives: Sentinel surveillance among severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients can help identify the spread and extent of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. We describe here the positivity for COVID-19 among SARI patients and their characteristics. Methods: SARI patients admitted at 41 sentinel sites from February 15, 2020 onwards were tested for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, targeting E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network for analysis. Results: A total of 104 (1.8%) of the 5,911 SARI patients tested were positive for COVID-19. These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 States/Union Territories. The COVID-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years. In all, 40 (39.2%) COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel. Interpretation conclusions: COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting COVID-19 cases among SARI patients. Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts.

TI  - Evaluation of topographic correction methods for LULC preparation based on multi-source DEMs and Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic shadows of irregular mountains obstruct the analysis of satellite images in hilly areas. Due to this effect, there is high variability in the reflectance response of similar vegetation types, i.e. sunny areas show more than actual reflectance, whereas shaded areas show less than expected reflectance. In this study, we have evaluated the performance of five topographic correction methods, namely Cosine, C-Huang Wei, semi empirical C, SCS + C and Variable Empirical Coefficient Algorithm (VECA) depending on the solar incidence angle and exitance angle. The two well-known digital elevation models (DEM) i.e. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and TanDEM-X have been used for the study. The efficiency of the correction methods is assessed on Landsat-8 satellite image using three criteria: visual interpretation, statistical assessment and classification accuracy assessment. As seen from the statistical analysis, VECA and C-correction method provides good correction of topography for both SRTM and TanDEM-X elevation models. We have used support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification of topographically corrected images. Our results show that VECA and C-correction method increased classification accuracy from 65.60% (for uncorrected image) to 82.40% for SRTM and 64.00% to 80.00% for TanDEM-X respectively. The highest accuracy of classification is obtained using VECA/C method with SRTM DEM. However, the SCS + C-correction method impressively reduced the visual topography effects.

TI  - Influence of the El Nino Phenomenon on Shoreline Evolution. Case Study: Callao Bay, Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the long-term behavior of the coastlines in the vicinity of river mouths and estuaries usually relies on the mean (predicted) values of the sediment discharge from the river. However, this approach does not consider low frequency, severe events, such as El Nino (EN), that can have a large effect on coastlines. While the effects of an EN on flooding and droughts are well studied, little information exists about its effects on coastal zones, and especially on the evolution of coastlines. In early 2017, an EN occurred in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the country of Peru was affected with high precipitation levels, and extreme river discharges and flooding. During this event, in the district of Lima, the Rimac River discharged a huge amount of sediment into the Callao Bay, and the shoreline accreted approximately 1 km, demonstrating the significant effects that an EN can have on coastal zones. To explore these effects, this paper studies the influence of an EN on shoreline evolution in the Callao Bay by analyzing Landsat images from 1985-2019 to understand the shoreline evolution and identify changes to the coastline. Results show that when an extraordinary EN occurs (e.g., 1982-1983, 1997-1998, and 2017), the shoreline experiences high accretion compared to when a smaller, or no EN occurs. During these events, a significant delta forms at the south end of the bay, and the redistribution of the accumulated sediment by wave action causes the accretion of the adjacent coastlines for as far as 7 km north of the river mouth. This shows the importance of these events for the wellbeing of coastlines adjacent to river mouths affected by EN.

TI  - USEFULNESS OF SENTINEL-2 VISIBLE LIGHT SATELLITE PHOTOS FOR SURVEYS OF HYDRODYNAMIC PHENOMENA IN POLISH CARPATHIAN STORAGE RESERVOIRS
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the research presented in this paper was the recognition of potentials and drawbacks of visible light photos taken by the Sentinel-2 satellites as a source of data for hydrodynamic issues regarding dammed reservoirs located in the Polish Carpathian foothills. The authors analyzed the photos of five reservoirs: Goczalkowice, Tresna, Dobczyce, Czorsztyn and Solina. Depending on the object's geographic location, one can expect one or two photos taken during each 5-day period. No more than 1/5 of the taken photos of the given locations contain a non-obscured view of the water bodies. Visibility varies throughout the year along with the expected clear sky percentage; and the probability of obtaining a clear picture is lower than this value. In the Polish Carpathians, the best visibility occurs in August, while the worst in December. The chance of getting a clear view is lower during high discharge periods than in low discharge ones. In the clear photos the authors identified density currents of different nature: turbidity, reverse turbidity (i.e. clear water entering a turbid area), eutrophic and thermal. The currents can also be seen as sub-glacial ones. The shapes of the visible currents can be used for calibration and validation of hydrodynamic numerical models of the reservoirs. The authors obtained a good accordance between the shapes of the currents visible on the photos and the water velocity field predicted by a numerical simulation with the FESWMS model for the hydrological and meteorological input variables set to follow the actual conditions that day.

TI  - Vegetation Phenological Changes in Multiple Landforms and Responses to Climate Change
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is highly sensitive to climate change, and the phenological responses of vegetation to climate factors vary over time and space. Research on the vegetation phenology in different climatic regimes will help clarify the key factors affecting vegetation changes. In this paper, based on a time-series reconstruction of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data using the Savitzky-Golay filtering method, the phenology parameters of vegetation were extracted, and the Spatio-temporal changes from 2001 to 2016 were analyzed. Moreover, the response characteristics of the vegetation phenology to climate changes, such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours, were discussed. The results showed that the responses of vegetation phenology to climatic factors varied within different climatic regimes and that the Spatio-temporal responses were primarily controlled by the local climatic and topographic conditions. The following were the three key findings. (1) The start of the growing season (SOS) has a regular variation with the latitude, and that in the north is later than that in the south. (2) In arid areas in the north, the SOS is mainly affected by the temperature, and the end of the growing season (EOS) is affected by precipitation, while in humid areas in the south, the SOS is mainly affected by precipitation, and the EOS is affected by the temperature. (3) Human activities play an important role in vegetation phenology changes. These findings would help predict and evaluate the stability of different ecosystems.

TI  - Prestroke Disability Predicts Adverse Poststroke Outcome A Registry-Based Prospective Cohort Study of Acute Stroke
T2  - STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose-Information on what effect disability before stroke can have on stroke outcome is lacking. We assessed prestroke disability in relation to poststroke hospital outcome.Methods-Analysis of prospectively collected data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. A total of 1656 men (mean age +/- SD =73.1 +/- 13.2 years) and 1653 women (79.3 +/- 13.0 years) were admitted to hyperacute stroke units with acute stroke in 4 major UK between 2014 and 2016. Prestroke disability, assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS), was tested against poststroke adverse outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and coexisting morbidities.Results-Compared with patients with prestroke mRS score =0, individuals with prestroke mRS scores =3, 4, or 5 had greater adjusted risks of moderately severe or severe stroke on arrival (4.4% versus 16.7%; odds ratio [OR], 3.2 [95% CI, 2.3-4.6] P<0.001); urinary tract infection or pneumonia within 7 days of admission (9.6% versus 35.9%; OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.8-4.8] P<0.001); mortality (7.2% versus 37.1%; OR, 4.9 [95% CI, 3.7-6.5] P<0.001); requiring help with activities of daily living on discharge (12.3% versus 26.7%; OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.3-4.1] P<0.001); and transferred to new care home (2.4% versus 9.4%; OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.3] P=0.002). Patients with mRS scores =1 or 2 had intermediate risk of adverse outcomes. Overall, those with a mRS score =1 or 2 had length of stay on hyperacute stroke units extended by 5.3 days (95% CI, 2.8-7.7; P<0.001) and mRS score =3, 4 or 5 by 7.2 days (95% CI, 4.0-10.5; P<0.001).Conclusions-Individuals with evidence of prestroke disability, assessed by mRS, had significantly increased risk of poststroke adverse outcomes and longer length of stay on hyperacute stroke units and higher level of care on discharge.

TI  - Monitoring Droughts in the Greater Changbai Mountains Using Multiple Remote Sensing-Based Drought Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various drought indices have been developed to monitor drought conditions. Each index has typical characteristics that make it applicable to a specific environment. In this study, six popular drought indices, namely, precipitation condition index (PCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), vegetation health index (VHI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), and temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), have been used to monitor droughts in the Greater Changbai Mountains(GCM) in recent years. The spatial pattern and temporal trend of droughts in this area in the period 2001-2018 were explored by calculating these indices from multi-source remote sensing data. Significant spatial-temporal variations were identified. The results of a slope analysis along with the F-statistic test showed that up to 20% of the study area showed a significant increasing or decreasing trend in drought. It was found that some drought indices cannot be explained by meteorological observations because of the time lag between meteorological drought and vegetation response. The drought condition and its changing pattern differ from various land cover types and indices, but the relative drought situation of different landforms is consistent among all indices. This work provides a basic reference for reasonably choosing drought indices for monitoring drought in the GCM to gain a better understanding of the ecosystem conditions and environment.

TI  - Bidirectional Segmented Detection of Land Use Change Based on Object-Level Multivariate Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision information regarding the location, time, and type of land use change is integral to understanding global changes. Time series (TS) analysis of remote sensing images is a powerful method for land use change detection. To address the complexity of sample selection and the salt-and-pepper noise of pixels, we propose a bidirectional segmented detection (BSD) method based on object-level, multivariate TS, that detects the type and time of land use change from Landsat images. In the proposed method, based on the multiresolution segmentation of objects, three dimensions of object-level TS are constructed using the median of the following indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference built index (NDBI), and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). Then, BSD with forward and backward detection is performed on the segmented objects to identify the types and times of land use change. Experimental results indicate that the proposed BSD method effectively detects the type and time of land use change with an overall accuracy of 90.49% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.86. It was also observed that the median value of a segmented object is more representative than the commonly used mean value. In addition, compared with traditional methods such as LandTrendr, the proposed method is competitive in terms of time efficiency and accuracy. Thus, the BSD method can promote efficient and accurate land use change detection.

TI  - Some properties of linear sufficiency and the BLUPs in the linear mixed model
T2  - STATISTICAL PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we consider the linear sufficiency of Fy for X beta, for Zu and for X beta + Zu, when dealing with the linear mixed model y = X beta + Zu + e. In particular, we explore the relations between these sufficiency properties. The usual definition of linear sufficiency means, for example, that the BLUE of X beta under the original model can be obtained as AFy for some matrix A. Liu et al. (JMultivar Anal 99:1503-1517, 2008) introduced a slightly different definition for the linear sufficiency and we study its relation to the standard definition. We also consider the conditions under which BLUEs and/or BLUPs under one mixed model continue to be BLUEs and/or BLUPs under the other mixed model. In particular, we describe the mutual relations of the conditions. These problems were approached differently by Rong and Liu (Stat Pap 51:445-453, 2010) and we will show how their results are related to those obtained by our approach.

T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we describe how both the existing degree of price correspondence and tradability are important factors explaining why and the extent to which grain price relationships adjust due to growing condition variations. For a set of maize and millet markets in Niger and Nigeria with different agro-ecological characteristics and strengths of price relationships, we use normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to identify years with weather-related production shocks. We then measure the degree to which price transmission between the commercial hub and reference market in each country in the anomalous weather years varies from that in normal years.

TI  - Fractures distribution and basement-cover interaction in a polytectonic domain: A case study from the Saghro Massif (Eastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - From the Neoproterozoic to Cenozoic, different extensional and transpressional tectonics events occurred during the Pan-African, Variscan and Alpine orogenic cycles in the Precambrian and Paleozoic terrains of the Saghro Massif of the eastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco. This makes it a key zone to investigate fault distribution and basement-cover interactions. The present research aims to elaborate a detailed fracturation map and the structural interpretation of the Precambrian and Paleozoic outcrops in the northeastern part of the Saghro Massif. Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 Oli images were used in conjunction with Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The remote sensing study was completed by an integrated interpretation including structural data from existing geological maps and our field investigations. The results show four fault systems, namely N-S to NNE-SSW, NE-SW to ENE-WSW, ENE to E-W, and NW-SE to WNW-ESE. Faults and folds geometry in the Paleozoic and Mezo-Cenozoic terrains were controlled by the reactivation of inherited basement structures such as faults and alternate competent and incompetent formations. The major mechanical discontinuities between Precambrian, Paleozoic and MesozoicCenozoic terrains restrain the propagation of fractures from top to bottom during the Variscan and Atlasic orogenesis. The structural map established in this work helps to improve significantly the existing geological maps and to understand the architecture of the High Atlas foreland and overprinting relationships in the Saghro polytectonic massif.

TI  - Application of Cumulative Distribution Functions to Compositing Precipitable Water with Low Earth Orbit Satellite Data
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water (PW) is a leading indicator of severe weather, such as heavy rainfall. The National Meteorological Satellite Center receives observation data directly from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, including NOAA-18, 19, MetOp-A, B, and Suomi-NPP, and generates level 2 products in near real time for the East Asia region. In this study, PW data were retrieved from the abovementioned sources and composited to determine meteorologically significant PW fields from all available data sources considering the boundary layer (BL), middle layer (ML), high layer (HL), and total column. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching was performed for PW retrieved from the five satellites within specific time windows in order to integrate them and minimize their differences. The PW composite data were matched to reference PW CDF data from the Unified Model (UM) Regional Data Assimilation Prediction System (RDAPS) analysis data, which are updated according to selected time windows. PW data were composited for 03:00-09:00, 09:00-15:00, 15:00-21:00, and 21:00-03:00 UTC time windows. PW data composited during the summer and winter seasons in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were then validated. The results show improvements in composite Total Precipitable Water and BL PW from Suomi-NPP of approximately 15% and 40% (RMSE), respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim was to evaluate sentinel node detection capacity by means of a magnetic probe in 11 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma at stages T1-T2 received submucosal injections of a superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agent (SPIO). A magnetic probe was used for sentinel node biopsy. The use of SPIO and magnetic probes in the early stages of oral cancer may offer an alternative to conventional radioisotope techniques and/or elective neck dissection.

TI  - A Healthy Park Needs Healthy Vegetation: The Story of Gorongosa National Park in the 21st Century
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding trends or changes in biomass and biodiversity around conservation areas in Africa is important and has economic and societal impacts on the surrounding communities. Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique was established under unique conditions due to its complex history. In this study, we used a time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to explore seasonal trends in biomass between 2000 and 2016. In addition, vegetation directional persistence was created. This product is derived from the seasonal NDVI time series-based analysis and represents the accumulation of directional change in NDVI relative to a fixed benchmark (2000-2004). Trends in precipitation from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) was explored from 2000-2016. Different vegetation covers are also considered across various landscapes, including a comparison between the Lower Gorongosa (savanna), Mount Gorongosa (rainforest), and surrounding buffer zones. Important findings include a decline in precipitation over the time of study, which most likely drives the observed decrease in NDVI. In terms of vegetation persistence, Lower Gorongosa had stronger positive trends than the buffer zone, and Mount Gorongosa had higher negative persistence overall. Directional persistence also varied by vegetation type. These are valuable findings for park managers and conservationists across the world.

TI  - The MODIS Global Vegetation Fractional Cover Product 2001-2018: Characteristics of Vegetation Fractional Cover in Grasslands and Savanna Woodlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation Fractional Cover (VFC) is an important global indicator of land cover change, land use practice and landscape, and ecosystem function. In this study, we present the Global Vegetation Fractional Cover Product (GVFCP) and explore the levels and trends in VFC across World Grassland Type (WGT) Ecoregions considering variation associated with Global Livestock Production Systems (GLPS). Long-term average levels and trends in fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (F-PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (F-NPV), and bare soil (F-BS) are mapped, and variation among GLPS types within WGT Divisions and Ecoregions is explored. Analysis also focused on the savanna-woodland WGT Formations. Many WGT Divisions showed wide variation in long-term average VFC and trends in VFC across GLPS types. Results showed large areas of many ecoregions experiencing significant positive and negative trends in VFC. East Africa, Patagonia, and the Mitchell Grasslands of Australia exhibited large areas of negative trends in F-NPV and positive trends F-BS. These trends may reflect interactions between extended drought, heavy livestock utilization, expanded agriculture, and other land use changes. Compared to previous studies, explicit measurement of F-NPV revealed interesting additional information about vegetation cover and trends in many ecoregions. The Australian and Global products are available via the GEOGLAM RAPP (Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Rangeland and Pasture Productivity) website, and the scientific community is encouraged to utilize the data and contribute to improved validation.

TI  - Use of SAR and Optical Time Series for Tropical Forest Disturbance Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent cloud cover and fast regrowth often hamper topical forest disturbance monitoring with optical data. This study aims at overcoming these limitations by combining dense time series of optical (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) and SAR data (Sentinel-1) for forest disturbance mapping at test sites in Peru and Gabon. We compare the accuracies of the individual disturbance maps from optical and SAR time series with the accuracies of the combined map. We further evaluate the detection accuracies by disturbance patch size and by an area-based sampling approach. The results show that the individual optical and SAR based forest disturbance detections are highly complementary, and their combination improves all accuracy measures. The overall accuracies increase by about 3% in both areas, producer accuracies of the disturbed forest class increase by up to 25% in Peru when compared to only using one sensor type. The assessment by disturbance patch size shows that the amount of detections of very small disturbances (< 0.2 ha) can almost be doubled by using both data sets: for Gabon 30% as compared to 15.7-17.5%, for Peru 80% as compared to 48.6-65.7%.

TI  - Bringing Earth Observation to Schools with Digital Integrated Learning Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital integrated learning environments (ILEs) for earth observation described in this article are bringing the complex topic of earth observation into classrooms. They are intended to give pupils with no prior experience in remote sensing the opportunity to solve tasks with earth observation data by using the same means that professionals have at hand. These learning environments integrate remote sensing tools and background knowledge in a comprehensive e-learning environment. They are tailored for use in schools, whereby the curriculum typically does not include earth observation, teachers are generally not familiar with its concepts, and the technical infrastructure is still not quite ready for digital teaching resources. To make the learning environments applicable, the special demands and obstacles presented by a school environment have to be considered. These obstacles are used to derive the requirements for the use of satellite data in school classes and create classroom resources in terms of technology, didactics, and e-learning. The concept itself was developed ten years ago, and since, then multiple applications have been created and used in classes. Data from an online questionnaire focuses on the specific qualities of the learning modules, enabling us to assess whether the concept works, and where there is need for improvement. The results show that the learning environments are being used, and that they continue to open the minds of pupils and teachers alike to a new perspective on the earth.

TI  - Synthesis of L-Band SAR and Forest Heights Derived from TanDEM-X DEM and 3 Digital Terrain Models for Biomass Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compared the accuracies of above-ground biomass (AGB) estimated by integrating ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased-Array-Type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) data and TanDEM-X-derived forest heights (TDX heights) at four scales from 1/4 to 25 ha in a hemi-boreal forest in Japan. The TDX heights developed in this study included nine canopy height models (CHMs) and three model-based forest heights (ModelHs); the nine CHMs were derived from the three digital surface models (DSMs) of (I) TDX 12 m DEM (digital elevation model) product, (II) TDX 90 m DEM product and (III) TDX 5 m DSM, which we developed from two TDX-TSX (TerraSAR-X) image pairs for reference, and the three digital terrain models (DTMs) of (i) an airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based DTM (LiDAR DTM), (ii) a topography-based DTM and (iii) the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM; the three ModelHs were developed from the two TDX-TSX image pairs used in (III) and the three DTMs (i to iii) with the Sinc inversion model. In total, 12 AGB estimation models were developed for comparison. In this study, we included the C-band SRTM DEM as one of the DTMs. According to Walker et al. (2007), the SRTM DEM serves as a DTM for most of the Earth's surface, except for the areas with extensive tree and/or shrub coverage, e.g., the boreal and Amazon regions. As our test site is located in a hemi-boreal zone with medium forest cover, we tested the ability of the SRTM DEM to serve as a DTM in our test site. This study especially aimed to analyze the capability of the two TDX DEM products (I and II) to estimate AGB in practice in the hemi-boreal region, and to examine how the different forest height creation methods (the simple DSM and DTM subtraction for the nine CHMs and the Sinc inversion model-based approach for the three ModelHs) and the different spatial resolutions of the three DSMs and three DTMs affected the AGB estimation results. We also conducted the slope-class analysis to see how the varying slopes influenced the AGB estimation accuracies. The results show that the combined use of the PALSAR data and the CHM derived from (I) TDX 12 m DEM and (i) LiDAR DTM achieved the highest AGB estimation accuracies across the scales (R-2 ranged from 0.82 to 0.97), but the CHMs derived from (I) TDX 12 m DEM and another two DTMs, (ii) and (iii), showed low R-2 values at any scales. In contrast, the two CHMs derived from (II) TDX 90 m DEM and both (i) LiDAR DTM and (iii) SRTM DEM showed high R-2 values > 0.87 and 0.78, respectively, at the scales > 9.0 ha, but they yielded much lower R-2 values at smaller scales. The three ModelHs gave the lowest R-2 values across the scales (R-2 ranged from 0.39 to 0.60). Analyzed by slope class at the 1.0 ha scale, however, all the 12 AGB estimation models yielded high R-2 values > 0.66 at the lowest slope class (0 degrees to 9.9 degrees), including the three ModelHs (R-2 ranged between 0.68 to 0.69). The two CHMs derived from (II) TDX 90 m DEM and both (i) LiDAR DTM and (iii) SRTM DEM showed R-2 values of 0.80 and 0.71, respectively, at the lowest slope class, while the CHM derived from (I) TDX 12 m DEM and (i) LiDAR DTM showed high R-2 values across the slope classes (R-2 > 0.82). The results show that (I) TDX 12 m DEM had a high capability to estimate AGB, with a high accuracy across the scales and the slope classes in the form of CHM, but the use of (i) LiDAR DTM was required.On the other hand, (II) TDX 90 m DEM was able to achieve high AGB estimation accuracies not only with (i) LiDAR DTM, but also with (iii) SRTM DEM in the form of CHM, but it was limited to large scales > 9.0 ha; however, all the models developed in this study have the possibility to achieve higher AGB estimation accuracies at the 1.0 ha scale in flat terrains with slope < 10 degrees. The analysis showed the strengths and limitations of each model, and it also indicates that the data creation methods, the spatial resolutions of datasets and topographic features affects the effective spatial scales for AGB mapping, and the optimal combinations of these features should be chosen to obtain high AGB estimation accuracies.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) was launched on June 29, 2018, to the International Space Station (ISS). Landsats 7 and 8 were launched on April 15, 1999 and February 11, 2013, respectively. The thermal channels of all three instruments have been validated at the Lake Tahoe, CA/NV, USA, and Salton Sea, CA, USA, automated validation sites. These sites have been used to validate a large number of thermal infrared radiometers including ASTER, MODIS, and VIIRS. We have validated 41 cloud-free ECOSTRESS scenes acquired between July 29, 2018 and June 23, 2019; 625 cloud-free Landsat 7 scenes acquired between June 30, 1999 and February 7, 2019; and 375 cloud-free Landsat 8 scenes acquired between March 10, 2013 and February 8, 2019. Validation involved propagating ground measurements to equivalent at-sensor (vicarious) values and comparing them to the measurements obtained from the sensor using its on-board calibration (OBC). The overall correlation between the in situ measurements and at-sensor radiance for the thermal channels from all three instruments was excellent with R-2 of 0.98-0.99 in all the spectral channels. All three instruments were shown to meet or improve on their preflight absolute radiometric accuracy requirement with absolute radiometric values of better than +/- 1 K at 300 K. All three instruments were also shown to have in-flight noise equivalent delta temperatures which were similar to their preflight values and between 0.1 and 0.3 K depending on the spectral channel.

TI  - Object Detection in High-Resolution Panchromatic Images Using Deep Models and Spatial Template Matching
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic object detection from remote sensing images has attracted a significant attention due to its importance in both military and civilian fields. However, the low confidence of the candidates restricts the recognition of potential objects, and the unreasonable predicted boxes result in false positives (FPs). To address these issues, an accurate and fast object detection method called the refined single-shot multibox detector (RSSD) is proposed, consisting of a single-shot multibox detector (SSD), a refined network (RefinedNet), and a class-specific spatial template matching (STM) module. In the training stage, fed with augmented samples in diverse variation, the SSD can efficiently extract multiscale features for object classification and location. Meanwhile, RefinedNet is trained with cropped objects from the training set to further enhance the ability to distinguish each class of objects and the background. Class-specific spatial templates are also constructed from the statistics of objects of each class to provide reliable object templates. During the test phase, RefinedNet improves the confidence of potential objects from the predicted results of SSD and suppresses that of the background, which promotes the detection rate. Furthermore, several grotesque candidates are rejected by the well-designed class-specific spatial templates, thus reducing the false alarm rate. These three parts constitute a monolithic architecture, which contributes to the detection accuracy and maintains the speed. Experiments on high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images of satellites GaoFen-2 and JiLin-1 demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed modules and the whole framework.

TI  - Urban air temperature model using GOES-16 LST and a diurnal regressive neural network algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban air temperature model is presented using the enterprise GOES-16 land surface temperature product. The model is constructed by fitting the difference between ground-truth air temperature data against satellite LST using a Gaussian function. A time-match algorithm aligns the ground and satellite measurements within 5-min of one another, and the resulting matched values are compared over ten months to investigate their correlation. Land cover, latitude, longitude, local time, and elevation are input to a regressive neural network to fit each unique GOES-16 pixel according to ground-based properties. Over 150 ground stations and satellite pixels throughout the continental U.S. are used near urban areas to construct the diurnal Gaussian relationship and approximate air temperature. Statistics from a five month validation period generates an RMSE of 2.6 K, a bias of 0.8 K, and R-2 of 0.86, which are in strong competition with other studies at lower resolution, less geographic integration, and less temporal resolvability. The algorithm also produced strong spatial correlations with a high resolution numerical model, resulting in a mean RMSE value of 2.1 K for nearly 7000 pixels. The overall presentation of this model aims to simplify the calculation of air temperature from satellite LST and create a successful model that performs well in heterogeneous environments. The improvement of urban air temperature calculations will also result in improved satellite land surface products such as relative humidity and heat index.

TI  - Remote sensing retrieval of maize residue cover on soil heterogeneous background
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize stalk mulching is a conservation tillage method that has been currently promoted in northeastern China Plain. Remote sensing estimation of regional crop residue cover (CRC) can quickly obtain the information of straw mulching in a large area, which plays an important role in monitoring and popularizing the work of straw mulching. In this study, the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), simple tillage index (STI), normalized difference residue index (NDRI), and normalized difference index 7 (NDI7) were extracted from Sentinel-2A image and used to establish a linear regression model for CRC and spectral indices in Lishu County of Jilin Province. The results showed that soils had strong spatial heterogeneity in the study area, which would lead to a significant impact on the spectral index regression model. Using soil texture classification (zoning) to establish regression model could improve the inversion accuracy. Soil spatial heterogeneity would increase the estimation error of the model. The four spectral indices had a strong correlation with CRC, among which the NDTI and STI models performed better. The zonal linear regression model based on NDTI and STI verified that R-2 was 0.84 and RMSE was 13.3%, which was better than the non-zonal model (R-2 was 0.75 and RMSE was 16.5%) and thus effectively improved the inversion accuracy.

TI  - A multivariable optical remote sensing image feature discretization method applied to marine vessel targets recognition
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective extraction of continuous features in ocean optical remote sensing image is the key to achieve the automatic detection and identification for marine vessel targets. Since many of the existing data mining algorithms can only deal with discrete attributes, it is necessary to transform the continuous features into discrete ones for adapting to these intelligent algorithms. However, most of the current discretization methods do not consider the mutual exclusion within the attribute set when selecting breakpoints, and cannot guarantee that the indiscernible relationship of information system is not destroyed. Obviously, they are not suitable for processing ocean optical remote sensing data with multiple features. Aiming at this problem, a multivariable optical remote sensing image feature discretization method applied to marine vessel targets recognition is presented in this paper. Firstly, the information equivalent model of remote sensing image is established based on the theories of information entropy and rough set. Secondly, the change extent of indiscernible relationship in the model before and after discretization is evaluated. Thirdly, multiple scans are executed for each band until the termination condition is satisfied for generating the optimal number of intervals. Finally, we carry out the simulation analysis of the high-resolution remote sensing image data collected near the coast of South China Sea. In addition, we also compare the proposed method with the current mainstream discretization algorithms. Experiments validate that the proposed method has better comprehensive performance in terms of interval number, data consistency, running time, prediction accuracy and recognition rate.

TI  - Some Thoughts on Measuring Earthquake Deformation Using Optical Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical imagery has been proven to be an effective tool for measuring earthquake deformation in continental regions since its first application in the 1999 Izmit earthquake. In this article, we compile and analyze all the earthquakes that have been investigated with optical image matching by 2019, based on which we comment on various issues regarding measuring earthquake deformation with optical imagery. New generations of very high-resolution (VHR) data are effective for earthquake studies, but orthorectification of the VHR images is the major source of error, which is often ignored. We found that the displacements derived from the WorldView images strongly correlate with the errors in the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) that was used in orthorectification. Based on the observed correlation between displacements and topography, we propose a new DEM-based method using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3-D DEM to reduce the orthorectification errors. Combining the published optical data of earthquake deformation, we re-analyze the coseismic slip distribution and shallow slip deficit (SSD). The SSD model states that the coseismic slip in many strike-slip earthquakes decreases in magnitude toward the surface, but this model remains arguable because the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-derived slip is usually not well-constrained at shallow depths due to decorrelation. Because optical matching directly measures the surface slip, we re-examine the slip distribution of 11 strike-slip earthquakes and find that the SSD model may primarily be artifacts in the InSAR measurements. It is therefore of great importance to include the optical data in earthquake studies to constrain coseismic slip inversions.

TI  - Landslide Monitoring Using Change Detection in Multitemporal Optical Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a kind of geologic hazard triggered by anthropogenic or natural factors. Change detection is an important technique to extract the landslide area from pre- and postdisaster images. As landslides are similar in spectrum to bare land and it is difficult to absolutely calibrate the radiation of multitemporal images, the detection method may lead to significant errors or omissions. By modeling the relative relationship between adjacent pixels from multitemporal images, errors or omissions and illumination influences will be reduced during detection. With the aim of extracting landslides with an automatic and robust process, this letter proposes a practical method based on multitemporal data and spatiotemporal model. First, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and built-up area presence index (PanTex) features series were produced, which can reflect changes in vegetated and built-up areas, respectively. Then, we used a spatiotemporal context (STC) model to detect landslide from feature series. Finally, the landslide map could be derived. The proposed method was applied to detect landslide using GaoFen (GF) series satellite. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

TI  - Fusion of Sentinel-1 with Official Topographic and Cadastral Geodata for Crop-Type Enriched LULC Mapping Using FOSS and Open Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop-type maps are urgently needed as input data for various applications, leading to improved planning and more sustainable use of resources. Satellite remote sensing is the optimal tool to provide such data. Images from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensors are preferably used as they work regardless of cloud coverage during image acquisition. However, processing of SAR is more complicated and the sensors have development potential. Dealing with such a complexity, current studies should aim to be reproducible, open, and built upon free and open-source software (FOSS). Thereby, the data can be reused to develop and validate new algorithms or improve the ones already in use. This paper presents a case study of crop classification from microwave remote sensing, relying on open data and open software only. We used 70 multitemporal microwave remote sensing images from the Sentinel-1 satellite. A high-resolution, high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) assisted the preprocessing. The multi-data approach (MDA) was used as a framework enabling to demonstrate the benefits of including external cadastral data. It was used to identify the agricultural area prior to the classification and to create land use/land cover (LULC) maps which also include the annually changing crop types that are usually missing in official geodata. All the software used in this study is open-source, such as the Sentinel Application Toolbox (SNAP), Orfeo Toolbox, R, and QGIS. The produced geodata, all input data, and several intermediate data are openly shared in a research database. Validation using an independent validation dataset showed a high overall accuracy of 96.7% with differentiation into 11 different crop-classes.

TI  - Historical Aerial Surveys Map Long-Term Changes of Forest Cover and Structure in the Central Congo Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the impact of tropical forest disturbances on atmospheric carbon emissions, biodiversity, and ecosystem productivity, accurate long-term reporting of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) change in the pre-satellite era (<1972) is an imperative. Here, we used a combination of historical (1958) aerial photography and contemporary remote sensing data to map long-term changes in the extent and structure of the tropical forest surrounding Yangambi (DR Congo) in the central Congo Basin. Our study leveraged structure-from-motion and a convolutional neural network-based LULC classifier, using synthetic landscape-based image augmentation to map historical forest cover across a large orthomosaic (similar to 93,431 ha) geo-referenced to similar to 4.7 +/- 4.3 m at submeter resolution. A comparison with contemporary LULC data showed a shift from previously highly regular industrial deforestation of large areas to discrete smallholder farming clearing, increasing landscape fragmentation and providing opportunties for substantial forest regrowth. We estimated aboveground carbon gains through reforestation to range from 811 to 1592 Gg C, partially offsetting historical deforestation (2416 Gg C), in our study area. Efforts to quantify long-term canopy texture changes and their link to aboveground carbon had limited to no success. Our analysis provides methods and insights into key spatial and temporal patterns of deforestation and reforestation at a multi-decadal scale, providing a historical context for past and ongoing forest research in the area.

TI  - Characterizing and Mitigating Sensor Generated Spatial Correlations in Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In hyperspectral imaging (HSI), the spatial contribution to each pixel is non-uniform and extends past the traditionally square spatial boundaries designated by the pixel resolution, resulting in sensor-generated blurring effects. The spatial contribution to each pixel can be characterized by the net point spread function, which is overlooked in many airborne HSI applications. The objective of this study was to characterize and mitigate sensor blurring effects in airborne HSI data with simple tools, emphasizing the importance of point spread functions. Two algorithms were developed to (1) quantify spatial correlations and (2) use a theoretically derived point spread function to perform deconvolution. Both algorithms were used to characterize and mitigate sensor blurring effects on a simulated scene with known spectral and spatial variability. The first algorithm showed that sensor blurring modified the spatial correlation structure in the simulated scene, removing 54.0%-75.4% of the known spatial variability. Sensor blurring effects were also shown to remove 31.1%-38.9% of the known spectral variability. The second algorithm mitigated sensor-generated spatial correlations. After deconvolution, the spatial variability of the image was within 23.3% of the known value. Similarly, the deconvolved image was within 6.8% of the known spectral variability. When tested on real-world HSI data, the algorithms sharpened the imagery while characterizing the spatial correlation structure of the dataset, showing the implications of sensor blurring. This study substantiates the importance of point spread functions in the assessment and application of airborne HSI data, providing simple tools that are approachable for all end-users.

TI  - Temporal variation of stocking rate and primary production in the face of drought and land use change
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland stocking rate is subjected to opposite forces. On the one hand, it is expected to fluctuate with interannual variations of aboveground net primary production (ANPP). On the other hand, it is expected to be stabilized by human interventions aimed at keeping a constant monetary flow. The global drought experienced during the first decade of the current century decreased ANPP in many regions. Argentinean rangelands suffered such drought amid an expansion of crop area. We assessed the relative impact of precipitation trends and human interventions on stocking rate and its components across a wide ANPP gradient in Argentina (from 1000 to 7000 kg.ha(-1).year(-1)). We estimated ANPP through remote sensing, from 2001 to 2009, and gathered data on beef cattle stocking numbers per class and rangeland area (n = 67 political districts of Argentina) from 2002 to 2009. All the significant temporal trends of ANPP were negative (36% of the districts). Fifty-one percent of the districts showed a significant temporal trend of stocking rate. Despite the negative trend of ANPP, stocking rate increased in 76% of these districts. The decrease in the remaining 24% was less than expected from the reduction of ANPP. Positive trends of stocking rate were associated with an increase of total livestock in the same rangeland area, and negative ones with a decrease of total stocking and an increase of total rangeland area. Steers accounted for most of the stocking rate changes. As expected from this decoupling between stocking and ANPP, the interannual CV of stocking rate was about half the CV of ANPP. In the face of drought and strong land use changes, human interventions uncoupled or softened the response of stocking rate to ANPP. These responses were probably driven by economic factors and may have profound negative consequences on ecological sustainability.

TI  - Geometry and development of Zindapir Anticlinorium, Sulaiman Range, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface geological (field and Landsat images) and subsurface geophysical (seismic reflection and borehole) data were analyzed for geometry and development of N-S oriented frontal Zindapir anticlinorium in the Sulaiman Range, Pakistan. The anticlinorium with its four segments of structural relief (salients), north to south as Dhodak, Rodho, Affiband, and Zindapir, extends over about 130 km with east-vergence of the fold axis, of general NS trend, highly oblique to the plate convergence vector. Based on seismic and well data correlation, sedimentary strata are interpreted with an east to west increase in thickness over the basement, along the western passive margin of the Indian plate. The basement is modelled to have NS trend with gentle similar to 2.5 degrees westward dip. NS well correlation along the fold axis and seismic reflection interpretation depict structural relief of 2-4 km along different salient's. Based on seismic reflection profiles, shallow-rooted pop-ups in Tertiary and Cretaceous strata are interpreted, contrary to their earlier interpretation as thick-skinned structures. The core of the anticlinorium is occupied with duplication of Jurassic and older (Triassic) strata, of flat-ramp-flat geometry, as a fault-bend fold, and an anticlinal stack, due to variable shortening from edges to the centre (across strike) of the anticline. It is interpreted to develop along lateral ramps, oblique to the direction of tectonic transport, along the eastern edge of the Sulaiman fold belt (SFB). Shortening along the Zindapir anticlinorium reflects a fraction of 37 mm/yr convergence along thrust faults of flat-and-ramp geometry. The Zindapir anticlinorium serves an example for better understanding of oblique mountain fronts, active tectonics, and hydrocarbon exploration in the region.

TI  - Modifying an Image Fusion Approach for High Spatiotemporal LST Retrieval in Surface Dryness and Evapotranspiration Estimations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) satellite images are generally employed to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) data in remote sensing. LST data have been widely used in evapotranspiration (ET) estimation based on satellite observations over broad regions, as well as the surface dryness associated with vegetation index. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) can provide LST data with a 30-m spatial resolution. However, rapid changes in environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture, will affect the dynamics of ET. Therefore, ET estimation needs a high temporal resolution as well as a high spatial resolution for daily, diurnal, or even hourly analysis. A challenge with satellite observations is that higher-spatial-resolution sensors have a lower temporal resolution, and vice versa. Previous studies solved this limitation by developing a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) for visible images. In this study, with the primary mechanism (thermal emission) of TIRS, surface emissivity is used in the proposed spatial and temporal adaptive emissivity fusion model (STAEFM) as a modification of the original STARFM for fusing TIR images instead of reflectance. For high a temporal resolution, the advanced Himawari imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite is explored. Thus, Landsat-like TIR images with a 10-minute temporal resolution can be synthesized by fusing TIR images of Himawari-8 AHI and Landsat-8 TIRS. The performance of the STAEFM to retrieve LST was compared with the STARFM and enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) based on the similarity to the observed Landsat image and differences with air temperature. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of the STAEFM image is more than 42 dB, while the values for STARFM and ESTARFM images are around 31 and 38 dB, respectively. The differences of LST and air temperature data collected from five meteorological stations are 1.53 degrees C to 4.93 degrees C, which are smaller compared with STARFM's and ESATRFM's. The examination of the case study showed reasonable results of hourly LST, dryness index, and ET retrieval, indicating significant potential for the proposed STAEFM to provide very-high-spatiotemporal-resolution (30 m every 10 min) TIR images for surface dryness and ET monitoring.

AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus that belongs to family Flaviviridae and emerged as one of the most pivotal form of viral encephalitis. The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquito vector and is an etiological agent of acute zoonotic infection. In this study, we investigated distribution and density over 3-year period in central regions of Korean peninsula. We selected two cities as mosquito-collecting locations and subdivided them into five collection sites; downtown Incheon Metropolitan City as a typical urban area, and the Hwaseong-si area as a rural area. A total of 35,445 female culicine mosquitoes were collected using black light traps or BG SentinelT traps from March to November 2016-2018. Aedes (Ae.) vexans nipponii was the most frequently collected specimens (48.91%), followed by Culex (Cx.) pipiens (32.05%), Ochlerotatus (Och.) dorsalis (13.58%), Och. koreicus (1.68%), and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (1.49%). In the urban area, Cx. pipiens was the predominant species (92.21%) and the other species accounted for <5% of the total mosquitoes collected. However, in the rural area, Ae. vexans nipponii had the highest population (61.90%), followed by Och. dorsalis (17.10%), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (1.84%) and Och, koreicus (1.78%). Culicine mosquitoes were identified at the species level, placed in pools of up to 30 mosquitoes each, and screened for flavivirus RNA using the SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. Three of the assayed 1092 pools were positive for Chaoyang virus from Ae. vexans nipponii and Japanese encephalitis virus from Cx. pipiens. The maximum likelihood estimations (the estimated number of virus-positive mosquitoes/1000 mosquitoes) for Ae. vexans nipponii positive for Chaoyang virus and Cx. pipiens for Japanese encephalitis virus were 3.095 and 0.20, respectively. The results of our study demonstrate that although mosquito-borne diseases were not detected in the potential vectors, enhanced monitoring and long-term surveillance of these vector viruses are of great public health importance.

TI  - Seasonal Water Change Assessment at Mahanadi River, India using Multi-temporal Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes in river water vary seasonally as well as locationally, and the assessment is essential. In this study, we used the recent technique of post-classification by using the Google earth engine (GEE) to map the seasonal changes in Mahanadi river of Odisha. However, some fixed problems results during the rainy season that affects the livelihood system of Cuttack such as flooding, drowning of children and waste material deposit. Therefore, this study conducted 1) to map and analyse the water density changes and 2) to analyse the seasonal variation of river water to resolve and prevent problem shortcomings. Our results showed that nine types of variation can be found in the Mahanadi River each year. The increase and decrease of intensity of surface water analysed, and it varies in between -130 to 70 m(3)/nf. The highest frequency change is 2900 Hz near Cuttack city. The pi diagram provides the percentage of seasonal variation that can be observed as permanent water (30%), new seasonal (28%), ephemeral (12%), permanent to seasonal (7%) and seasonal (10%). The analysis is helpful and effective to assess the seasonal variation that can provide a platform for the development of Cuttack city that lies in Mahanadi delta.

TI  - Numerical modelling of tidally generated internal wave radiation from the Andaman Sea into the Bay of Bengal
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-diurnal internal waves generated by tides in a high resolution numerical model that includes the Andaman Sea archipelago are found to propagate into the central Bay of Bengal and reach the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. The waves are also present in subsurface temperature records from RAMA moorings, and their propagation speed across the Bay of Bengal agrees well with satellite remote sensing from MODIS imagery in spite of the hydrostatic nature of the model. The internal waves are simulated by a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere prediction system, exchanging surface fluxes between the air and sea at high frequency and at high resolution. For the ocean, a hydrostatic model including diurnal and semi-diurnal tides provides a 2 km resolution representation of the entire Bay of Bengal. In the ocean model simulations, the semi-diurnal internal waves interact with the mesoscale circulation and surface waves and modify the flow and the stratification. By comparing coupled ocean-wave model runs with tides and without tides, but forced by identical surface fluxes from the atmosphere, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides act to cool the core of the thermocline while increasing the temperature above and below it along the pathway of the internal waves, a result that likely is due to vertical mixing by the waves.

TI  - Sea Fog Identification from GOCI Images Using CNN Transfer Learning Models
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an approaching method of identifying sea fog by using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data through applying a Convolution Neural Network Transfer Learning (CNN-TL) model. In this study, VGG19 and ResNet50, pre-trained CNN models, are used for their high identification performance. The training and testing datasets were extracted from GOCI images for the area of coastal regions of the Korean Peninsula for six days in March 2015. With varying band combinations and changing whether Transfer Learning (TL) is applied, identification experiments were executed. TL enhanced the performance of the two models. Training data of CNN-TL showed up to 96.3% accuracy in matching, both with VGG19 and ResNet50, identically. Thus, it is revealed that CNN-TL is effective for the detection of sea fog from GOCI imagery.

TI  - Object-Based Mapping of Plastic Greenhouses with Scattered Distribution in Complex Land Cover Using Landsat 8 OLI Images: A Case Study in Xuzhou, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of plastic greenhouses (PGH) has been addressed by remote sensing mainly in areas with densely distributed PGH and simple land cover. However, there still remain substantial challenges in extracting the PGH with scattered distribution in some developing agricultural regions. This paper proposed a threshold model to extract the PGH with scattered distribution from Landsat 8 OLI (L8 OLI) images. The threshold model was created by seven discriminative features with the help of an object-based image analysis and spectral analysis. Then, the proposed model was successfully applied to extract the PGH in Xuzhou city of Jiangsu Province, China, a large area of 11,258 km(2) with scattered PGH distribution and complex land cover, in 2014 and 2018. A total of 18,000 random points were generated to evaluate the extraction accuracy. The evaluation results show that the overall accuracy was higher than 98%, the producer's accuracy was over 85%, and the user's accuracy was over 95%. A visual interpretation with the high-spatial-resolution Google Earth Images also manifests the effectiveness of our results. Meanwhile, the applications in different years demonstrate the temporal consistency of the results. The study indicates that our presented method has large potential to map the PGH in a large spatial scale over a long-term period.

TI  - Response of vegetation productivity patterns to rainfall in different habitats along a desert oasis transition zone.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape pattern analysis is an important method to understand the occurrence and development of ecological processes. In this study, we investigated the responses of vegetative productivity patterns of a gravel desert and a sandy desert ( with a size of 1650 hm2 each) in the desert -oasis transition zone to sporadic rainfall events by using the MODIS data from June 22 to June 29, 2017. The internal landscape changes of these two habitats were different from each other. The area without increase of vegetation productivity ( NDVI) in the gravel desert habitat was larger than that in sandy desert habitat. The change of vegetation productivity mainly occurred in the range of 0-0.01 in the gravel desert habitat, with its fluctuation area between 612.5 and 1200 hm2. For the sandy desert habitat, the increase of vegetation productivity was concentrated above 0.01, and the fluctuation area ranged from 150 to 1587.5 hm2. The landscape of the gravel desert habitat tended to be fragmented over time after rainfall events in the arid area, while the pattern of simple patches dominated the sandy desert habitat landscape.

TI  - A Novel Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Method for Combining Satellite Images with Different Resolutions Using a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is considered a feasible and cost-effective way to solve the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite sensors. Recently proposed learning-based spatiotemporal fusion methods can address the prediction of both phenological and land-cover change. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal data fusion method that uses a two-stream convolutional neural network. The method combines both forward and backward prediction to generate a target fine image, where temporal change-based and a spatial information-based mapping are simultaneously formed, addressing the prediction of both phenological and land-cover changes with better generalization ability and robustness. Comparative experimental results for the test datasets with phenological and land-cover changes verified the effectiveness of our method. Compared to existing learning-based spatiotemporal fusion methods, our method is more effective in predicting phenological change and directly reconstructing the prediction with complete spatial details without the need for auxiliary modulation.

TI  - A Kernel-Driven BRDF Approach to Correct Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery over Forested Areas with Rugged Topography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne hyper-spectral imaging has been proven to be an efficient means to provide new insights for the retrieval of biophysical variables. However, quantitative estimates of unbiased information derived from airborne hyperspectral measurements primarily require a correction of the anisotropic scattering properties of the land surface depicted by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Hitherto, angular BRDF correction methods rarely combined viewing-illumination geometry and topographic information to achieve a comprehensive understanding and quantification of the BRDF effects. This is in particular the case for forested areas, frequently underlaid by rugged topography. This paper describes a method to correct the BRDF effects of airborne hyperspectral imagery over forested areas overlying rugged topography, referred in the reminder of the paper as rugged topography-BRDF (RT-BRDF) correction. The local viewing and illumination geometry are calculated for each pixel based on the characteristics of the airborne scanner and the local topography, and these two variables are used to adapt the Ross-Thick-Maignan and Li-Transit-Reciprocal kernels in the case of rugged topography. The new BRDF model is fitted to the anisotropy of multi-line airborne hyperspectral data. The number of pixels is set at 35,000 in this study, based on a stratified random sampling method to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the viewing and illumination angles and to minimize the fitting error of the BRDF model for all bands. Based on multi-line airborne hyperspectral data acquired with the Chinese Academy of Forestry's LiDAR, CCD, and Hyperspectral system (CAF-LiCHy) in the Pu'er region (China), the results applying the RT-BRDF correction are compared with results from current empirical (C, and sun-canopy-sensor (SCS) adds C (SCS+C)) and semi-physical (SCS) topographic correction methods. Both quantitative assessment and visual inspection indicate that RT-BRDF, C, and SCS+C correction methods all reduce the topographic effects. However, the RT-BRDF method appears more efficient in reducing the variability in reflectance of overlapping areas in multiple flight-lines, with the advantage of reducing the BRDF effects caused by the combination of wide field of view (FOV) airborne scanner, rugged topography, and varying solar illumination angle over long flight time. Specifically, the average decrease in coefficient of variation (CV) is 3% and 3.5% for coniferous forest and broadleaved forest, respectively. This improvement is particularly marked in the near infrared (NIR) region (i.e., >750 nm). This finding opens new possible applications of airborne hyperspectral surveys over large areas.

TI  - Automated Plantation Mapping in Southeast Asia Using MODIS Data and Imperfect Visual Annotations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of large-scale tree plantations for commodity crop and timber production is a leading cause of tropical deforestation. While automated detection of plantations across large spatial scales and with high temporal resolution is critical to inform policies to reduce deforestation, such mapping is technically challenging. Thus, most available plantation maps rely on visual inspection of imagery, and many of them are limited to small areas for specific years. Here, we present an automated approach, which we call Plantation Analysis by Learning from Multiple Classes (PALM), for mapping plantations on an annual basis using satellite remote sensing data. Due to the heterogeneity of land cover classes, PALM utilizes ensemble learning to simultaneously incorporate training samples from multiple land cover classes over different years. After the ensemble learning, we further improve the performance by post-processing using a Hidden Markov Model. We implement the proposed automated approach using MODIS data in Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan). To validate the classification, we compare plantations detected using our approach with existing datasets developed through visual interpretation. Based on random sampling and comparison with high-resolution images, the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of our generated map are around 85% and 80% in our study region.

TI  - Speeding up 3D radiative transfer simulations: A physically based metamodel of canopy reflectance dependency on wavelength, leaf biochemical composition and soil reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A physically based metamodel is proposed to describe the dependency of canopy reflectance on the wavelength, leaf and soil optical properties. The four-stream solution is first applied to describe the interaction between the soil background and the vegetation layers. This leads to the calibration of four terms for a given canopy structure, observation configuration and leaf properties. This number can be reduced to two terms by using a linear approximation which shows a slight degradation when the multiple scattering contribution is significant. The dependency of each of the two or four terms on wavelength and leaf properties is described using the leaf total absorption coefficient. Our approach requires only 12 (linear approximation) to 24 (four-stream solution) simulations of a reference model to describe the full canopy reflectance dependency on wavelength, leaf and soil properties. The approach was evaluated against reference canopy reflectance simulations using the ray tracing LuxCoreRender model. LuxCoreRender was first compared against reference radiative transfer models. The reference dataset corresponds to a range of detailed 3D maize canopies showing variation of leaf and background properties and one heterogeneous scene including vegetation elements of different shapes that is classically used for model inter-comparison exercises under different view and sun directions in a set of wavebands. Results demonstrate that our approach provides an accurate description of the dependency of canopy reflectance on wavelength, leaf and soil properties with RMSE = 0.0017 for the four-stream solution and RMSE = 0.0022 for the linear approximation. The proposed approach appears therefore computationally effective and well suited to generate a large number of canopy reflectance simulations with detailed 3D radiative transfer models that can be used to retrieve vegetation characteristics from remote sensing observations.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry over Chinese rivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry observations of water surface elevation (WSE) have become an important data source to supplement river gauge records. Sentinel-3 is the first radar altimetry mission operating with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter at global scale and with a new on-board tracking system (i.e. open-loop), which has great potential in terms of delivering reliable observations of inland water bodies for the next two decades (several future missions include an open-loop tracking mode). In this context, it is very important to investigate the data quality at an early stage. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of Sentinel-3A (S3A) is conducted at 50 virtual stations (VS) located on a wide range of rivers in China.The evaluation of Level 1 data shows that, over mountain rivers, a good prior surface elevation estimate on-board is vital to deliver useful datasets using the S3A open-loop tracking system. The Open-Loop Tracking Command version 5 (OLTC V5) has significantly improved the placement of the range window, which was misplaced and resulted in lack of data over many mountain rivers prior to OLTC V5 (March 2019). However, application of S3A over mountain rivers still requires careful evaluation, especially before March 2019.Four retrackers are evaluated including a physical SAR Altimetry Mode Studies and Applications retracker (SAMOSA+), a traditional Offset Center Of Gravity (OCOG), a Primary Peak Center Of Gravity (PPCOG), and a modified Multiple Waveform Persistent Peak (MWaPP+) retracker. For 26 VSs in plain areas, retracked WSE data achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.12 m to 0.9 m. The comparison of retracking methods reveals that SAMOSA+, OCOG, and PPCOG are unable to handle multi-peak waveforms. But the MWaPP+ can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimated WSE over large rivers, especially when the waveforms are contaminated.Moreover, our result shows no considerable difference between medium (ca. 300 m wide) and large (wider than 500 m) rivers. Instead, surrounding topography and homogeneity of surroundings are very important factors influencing the shape of a waveform. For rivers surrounded by lakes, man-made channels etc., special care must be taken when processing altimetry data. Dedicated retracking methods, such as MWaPP+, and sophisticated methods for outlier detection are needed to improve precision over such rivers, as demonstrated here for the Yangtze River.

TI  - Deep neural network algorithm for estimating maize biomass based on simulated Sentinel 2A vegetation indices and leaf area index
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of biomass is necessary for evaluating crop growth and predicting crop yield. Biomass is also a key trait in increasing grain yield by crop breeding. The aims of this study were (i) to identify the best vegetation indices for estimating maize biomass, (ii) to investigate the relationship between biomass and leaf area index (LAI) at several growth stages, and (iii) to evaluate a biomass model using measured vegetation indices or simulated vegetation indices of Sentinel 2A and LAI using a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm. The results showed that biomass was associated with all vegetation indices. The three-band water index (TBWI) was the best vegetation index for estimating biomass and the corresponding R-2, RMSE, and RRMSE were 0.76, 2.84 t ha(-1), and 38.22% respectively. LAI was highly correlated with biomass (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.27 t ha(-1), and RRMSE = 30.55%). Estimated biomass based on 15 hyperspectral vegetation indices was in a high agreement with measured biomass using the DNN algorithm (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 1.96 t ha(-1), and RRMSE = 26.43%). Biomass estimation accuracy was further increased when LAI was combined with the 15 vegetation indices (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.49 t ha(-1), and RRMSE = 20.05%). Relationships between the hyperspectral vegetation indices and biomass differed from relationships between simulated Sentinel 2A vegetation indices and biomass. Biomass estimation from the hyperspectral vegetation indices was more accurate than that from the simulated Sentinel 2A vegetation indices (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 1.84 t ha(-1), and RRMSE = 24.76%). The DNN algorithm was effective in improving the estimation accuracy of biomass. It provides a guideline for estimating biomass of maize using remote sensing technology and the DNN algorithm in this region.

TI  - Study of satellite-derived cloud microphysical parameters for tropical cyclones over the North Indian Ocean (2010-2013)
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive study of the cloud microphysics of 18 tropical cyclones (TCs) over the North Indian Ocean was carried out for the period 2010-2013. This was done using MODIS cloud microphysical properties covering tracks of TCs from early development to dissipation. The temporal analysis of cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud phase shows demarcating features during the different stages of TC. The dominance of cumulonimbus clouds, high fraction of precipitating clouds and high percentage of ice clouds during the mature stage of TCs have been demonstrated in light of COT, CER and cloud phase. Thus, CMPs can provide adequate information about the life cycle of TCs. Further, a complete dataset and associated statistics were computed for different stages and spatio-temporal structure of the TC. It has been found that cloud effective radius has mean (standard deviation) of 25.45 (+/- 3.94) microns during early development, 23.88 (+/- 5.71) microns and 22.55 (+/- 4.03) during maturity and dissipation stages respectively. Similarly, the cloud optical thickness has mean (standard deviation) of 15.61 (+/- 9.77) during early development, 21.87 (+/- 21.48) and 14.66 (+/- 10.70) during maturity and dissipation stages respectively. While analyzing the spatial structure, an interesting feature of high cloud effective radius has been observed in the eye region and clouds in this region are found to be of low opacity. These observations corroborate earlier reports on stratocumulus cloud decks observed within a cyclone eye.

TI  - Surface materials and landforms as controls on InSAR permanent and transient responses to precipitation events in a hyperarid desert, Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based monitoring and remote sensing of extreme rain events in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, Chile, reveal a complex relationship between precipitation, soil types and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence. These integrated analyses allow examination of temporal and spatial variations of the soil moisture response between locations dominated by sulfate soils and those with immature, silicate-mineral soils. The radar dataset captures at least four separate rain events within the 2015-2017 timeframe, two of which were regionally devastating. The lack of vegetation in this region allows us to discriminate between contributions to the InSAR coherence from permanent changes of the landscape (e.g., erosion or deposition) and transient changes associated with soil moisture variability. The spatial distribution and character of the transient InSAR response depends strongly on soil type, and is remarkably repeatable between rain events. The areas that experienced permanent changes included river channels, steep slopes, playas, and sites of anthropogenic activity, such as roads, mines, or telescope construction. Ground-based observations of soil moisture after each event also exhibit a strong dependence on soil type. The observations presented here demonstrate how InSAR data can constrain variations in soil moisture with high spatial resolution over large regions, complementing the higher-sensitivity but sparser field sites and enabling discrimination of inter-event variability and analysis of longer-term changes in soil mineralogy in arid regions.

TI  - Genomic prediction for commercial traits using univariate and multivariate approaches in Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>)
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Over the past three decades, Nile tilapia industry has grown into a significant aquaculture industry spread over 120 tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world accounting for 7.4% of global aquaculture production in 2015. Across species, genomic selection has been shown to increase predictive ability and genetic gain, also extending into aquaculture. Hence, the aim of this paper is to compare the predictive abilities of pedigree- and genomic-based models in univariate and multivariate approaches, with the aim to utilise genomic selection in a Nile tilapia breeding program. A total of 1444 fish were genotyped (48,960 SNP loci) and phenotyped for body weight at harvest (BW), fillet weight (FW) and fillet yield (FY). The pedigree-based analysis utilized a deep pedigree, including 14 generations. Estimated breeding values (EBVs and GEBVs) were obtained with traditional pedigree-based (PBLUP) and genomic (GBLUP) models, using both univariate and multivariate approaches. Prediction accuracy and bias were evaluated using 5 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation with three different cross-validation approaches. Further, impact of these models and approaches on the genetic evaluation was assessed based on the ranking of the selection candidates.Results: GBLUP univariate models were found to increase the prediction accuracy and reduce bias of prediction compared to other PBLUP and multivariate approaches. Relative to pedigree-based models, prediction accuracy increased by -20% for FY, > 75% for FW and > 43% for BW. GBLUP models caused major re-ranking of the selection candidates. Within GBLUP models, there was no significant difference between rankings produced by univariate and multivariate approaches. The heritabilities using multivariate GBLUP models for BW, FW and FY were 0.19 +/- 0.04, 0.17 +/- 0.04 and 0.23 +/- 0.04 respectively. BW showed very high genetic correlation with FW (0.96 +/- 0.01) and a slightly negative genetic correlation with FY (-0.11 +/- 0.15).Conclusion: Predictive ability of genomic prediction models is substantially higher than for classical pedigree-based models. Genomic selection is therefore beneficial to the Nile tilapia breeding program, and it is recommended in routine genetic evaluations of commercial traits in the Nile tilapia breeding nucleus.

TI  - Injection-induced surface deformation and seismicity at the Hellisheidi geothermal field, Iceland
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Induced seismicity is often associated with fluid injection but only rarely linked to surface deformation. At the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant in south-west Iceland we observe up to 2 cm of surface displacements during 2011-2012, indicating expansion of the crust. The displacements occurred at the same time as a strong increase in seismicity was detected and coincide with the initial phase of geothermal wastewater reinjection at Hellisheidi. Reinjection started on September 1, 2011 with a flow rate of around 500 kg/s. Micro-seismicity increased immediately in the area north of the injection sites, with the largest seismic events in the sequence being two M4 earthquakes on October 15, 2011. Semi-continuous GPS sites installed on October 15 and 17, and on November 2, 2011 reveal a transient signal which indicates that most of the deformation occurred in the first months after the start of the injection. The surface deformation is evident in ascending TerraSAR-X data covering June 2011 to May 2012 as well. We use an inverse modeling approach and simulate both the InSAR and GPS data to find the most plausible cause of the deformation signal, investigating how surface deformation, seismicity and fluid injection may be connected to each other. We argue that fluid injection caused an increase in pore pressure which resulted in increased seismicity and fault slip. Both pore pressure increase and fault slip contribute to the surface deformation. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Environmental Determinants of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Abundance at a Northern Limit of Its Range in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a vector of arboviruses with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The northern limit of Ae. albopictus in the northeastern United States runs through New York state (NYS) and Connecticut. We present a landscape-level analysis of mosquito abundance measured by daily counts of Ae. albopictus from 338 trap sites in 12 counties during May-September 2017. During the study period, the mean number of Ae. albopictus caught per day of trapping across all sites was 3.21. We constructed four sets of negative binomial generalized linear models to evaluate how trapping methodology, land cover, as well as temperature and precipitation at multiple time intervals influenced Ae. albopictus abundance. Biogents-Sentinel (BGS) traps were 2.78 times as efficient as gravid traps and 1.49 times as efficient as CO2-baited CDC light traps. Greater proportions of low- and medium-intensity development and low proportions of deciduous cover around the trap site were positively associated with increased abundance, as were minimum winter temperature and March precipitation. The cumulative precipitation within a 28-day time window before the date of collection had a nonlinear relationship with abundance, such that greater cumulative precipitation was associated with increased abundance until approximately 70 mm, above which there was a decrease in abundance. We concluded that populations are established in Nassau, Suffolk, and New York City counties in NYS; north of these counties, the species is undergoing population invasion and establishment. We recommend that mosquito surveillance programs monitoring the northward invasion of Ae. albopictus place BGS traps at sites chosen with respect to land cover.

TI  - Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction over Shandong province and the impact of air pollution control as observed from synthetic satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol loading and trace gas emissions from agriculture crop residue burning has been one of the main factors leading to the deterioration of air quality especially during the harvest time in China. Here, we evaluate the contribution of atmospheric aerosol loading from biomass burning and its relationship to the air pollution control policy. We focused on Shandong province, China because it has the highest level of agriculture burning pollution in October. Satellite-based data related to biomass burning including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fire pixel counts from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), carbon monoxide (CO) from Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT), aerosol index (AI) and tropospheric NO2 from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and aerosol layer depths from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). These metrics were synthetically utilized to evaluate spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric aerosols during the agriculture crop residue burning month from 2006 to 2017. Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction and the impact of the air pollution control policy can be found in the CALIPSO aerosol types and MODIS fire pixel counts data. The AOD, NO2, CO, and AI over three different land covers (cropland, forest and impervious surfaces) were further obtained according to the land cover data set. The results indicated that there was an obvious decrease in all carbonaceous aerosol-related quantities after year 2012 when the local government began to enact and implement strict air pollution control policies, although a period (2-3 years) of transition after the policy implementation time was identified. We also found that CO is stable and low over the cropland versus forest and impervious surfaces; NO2 exhibits a continuously high value in the northern areas of the oil field. The impact of industry activity rather than straw burning should be also considered for NO2 and CO in certain areas.

TI  - Probabilistic Cloud Masking for the Generation of CM SAF Cloud Climate Data Records from AVHRR and SEVIRI Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud screening in satellite imagery is essential for enabling retrievals of atmospheric and surface properties. For climate data record (CDR) generation, cloud screening must be balanced, so both false cloud-free and false cloudy retrievals are minimized. Many methods used in recent CDRs show signs of clear-conservative cloud screening leading to overestimated cloudiness. This study presents a new cloud screening approach for Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) imagery based on the Bayesian discrimination theory. The method is trained on high-quality cloud observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. The method delivers results designed for optimally balanced cloud screening expressed as cloud probabilities together with information on for which clouds (minimum cloud optical thickness) the probabilities are valid. Cloud screening characteristics over 28 different Earth surface categories were estimated. Using independent CALIOP observations (including all observed clouds) in 2010 for validation, the total global hit rates for AVHRR data and the SEVIRI full disk were 82% and 85%, respectively. High-latitude oceans had the best performance, with a hit rate of approximately 93%. The results were compared to the CM SAF cLoud, Albedo, and surface RAdiation dataset from AVHRR data-second edition (CLARA-A2) CDR and showed general improvements over most global regions. Notably, the Kuipers' Skill Score improved, verifying a more balanced cloud screening. The new method will be used to prepare the new CLARA-A3 and CLAAS-3 (CLoud property dAtAset using SEVIRI, Edition 3) CDRs in the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) project.

TI  - Effect of Structural Uncertainty in Passive Microwave Soil Moisture Retrieval Algorithm
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave sensors use a radiative transfer model (RTM) to retrieve soil moisture (SM) using brightness temperatures (T-B) at low microwave frequencies. Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a key input to the RTM. Retrieval algorithms can analytically invert the RTM using dual-polarized T-B measurements to retrieve the VOD and SM concurrently. Algorithms in this regard typically use the tau-omega types of models, which consist of two third-order polynomial equations and, thus, can have multiple solutions. Through this work, we find that uncertainty occurs due to the structural indeterminacy that is inherent in all tau-omega types of models in passive microwave SM retrieval algorithms. In the process, a new analytical solution for concurrent VOD and SM retrieval is presented, along with two widely used existing analytical solutions. All three solutions are applied to a fixed framework of RTM to retrieve VOD and SM on a global scale, using X-band Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) T-B data. Results indicate that, with structural uncertainty, there ensues a noticeable impact on the VOD and SM retrievals. In an era where the sensitivity of retrieval algorithms is still being researched, we believe the structural indeterminacy of RTM identified here would contribute to uncertainty in the soil moisture retrievals.

TI  - Evolution of Near-Shore Outwash Fans and Permafrost Spreading Under Their Surface: A Case Study from Svalbard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents geomorphological analysis results for two outwash fans (sandurs), Elveflya and Nottingham, in the marginal zone of the Werenskiold Glacier in the south-west part of the Spitsbergen. The main goal of this study was to reconstruct the morphological evolution of these landforms and to identify the permafrost zone under their surface. For this purpose, age data of fossils were compiled and compared with newly exposed and dated fossil tundra in the layer glaciotectonically deformed by the forming glacier end moraine. Using this method, a time frame was identified for the glacier advance and for the simultaneous formation of the outwash plains. It was concluded that the Elveflya surface has been built-up with deposits since the Little Ice Age. Sediment deposition ended in the late 1960s, due to hydrographic changes and the redirection of all proglacial waters towards the Nottingham bay. A photointerpretation analysis based on two orthophotomaps and LANDSAT scenes allowed the identification of five microfans in Elveflya, of which two youngest fans have a twice shorter range than the other three. The sixth microfan is currently shaped by deposits washed from the slope of the end moraine. An additional focus was placed on a currently active sandur, which fills the Nottingham bay, in order to identify its growth rate. The average growth rate of this surface increased from 5700 m(2)year(-1) over the period of 1985-2000 to 24,900 m(2)year(-1) over the period of 2010-2017. Electromagnetic measurements carried out on the surfaces of the sandurs demonstrated that the electrical resistivity of the ground is high in the apex of the Elveflya fan (rho >= 1 k Omega.m) and low in its toe (typically rho < 200 Omega.m), as in the case of the Nottingham fan ground. In the interpretation advanced here, permafrost developed in the proximal part of the Elveflya sandur, which continues to be supplied by fresh groundwaters flowing from the glacier direction. Low electrical resistivity of the ground in the distal part of the outwash fan suggests the absence of ground ice in this zone, which is subjected to the intrusion of salty and comparatively warm seawater, reaching approximately 1 km inland under the surface of the low-elevated marine terrace. The identified zones additionally display different tendencies for vertical movements of the terrain surface, as identified with the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method. The proximal part of the Elveflya outwash fan is relatively stable, while its distal part lowers in the summer period by a maximum of 5 cm. The resulting morphological changes include linear cracks having lengths up to 580 m and an arc line consistent with the coastline.

TI  - Quantifying fire trends in boreal forests with Landsat time series and self-organized criticality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forests are globally extensive and store large amounts of carbon, but recent climate change has led to drier conditions and increasing fire activity. The objective of this study is to quantify trends in fire size and frequency using data spanning multiple scales in space and time. We use multi-temporal Landsat image compositing on Google Earth Engine and validate results with reference fire maps from the Canadian Park Service. We also interpret general fire trends through the concept of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). Our study site is Wood Buffalo National Park, which is a fire hot spot in Canada due to frequent lightning ignitions. The relativize differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) was the most accurate Landsat-based burn severity metric we evaluated (52.2% producer's accuracy, 87.6% user's accuracy). The Landsat-based burn severity maps provided a better fit for a linear relationship on the log-log scale of fire size and frequency than a manually drawn fire map. Landsat-based fire trends since 1990 conformed to a power-law distribution with a slope of 1.9, which is related to fractal dimensions of the satellite-based fire perimeter shapes. The unburned and low-severity patches within the burn severity mosaic influenced the power-law slope and associated fractal dimensionality. This study demonstrates a multi-scale and multi-dataset technique to quantify general fire trends and changing fire cycles in remote locations and establishes a baseline database for assessing future fire activity. Testing criticality by power laws helps to quantify emergent trends of contemporary fire regimes, which could inform the strategic application of prescribed fire and other management activities. Natural resource managers can utilize information from this study to understand local ecosystem adaptability to large fire events and ecosystem stability in the context of recent increasing fire activity.

TI  - Peatland subsidence and vegetation cover degradation as impacts of the 2015 El nino event revealed by Sentinel-1A SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the world's largest tropical peatland, mostly located in the southern province of Sumatra, the south of Kalimantan, and Papua. The catastrophic fires between June and October 2015 induced by the El Niiio event burnt most of these peatland areas. We analyzed spatio-temporal peat subsidence during pre- and post-fires in the peat hydrological unit of Sungai Sugihan Sungai Saleh (KHGSS), South Sumatra using Sentinel-1 images by applying DInSAR-SBAS algorithm. Based on our analysis, the linear subsidence rate after the 2015 peat fires increased by a factor 6.4 compared to that of pre-fires. Generally, the estimated subsidence is temporally well-correlated with the precipitation variation. In addition, the subsidence patterns are spatially correlated with the hotspot distribution, peat thickness, and drainage networks. Furthermore, we mapped vegetation cover over the KHGSS by using the Sentinel-1 images as well. The results show that the vegetation degradation is correlated with the hotspot distribution and the highly-degraded vegetation associated with the 2015 peat fires. It demonstrated that the 2015 El Nino event has significant impacts on increasing the amount of the subsidence and the vegetation degradation in KHGSS area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the problem of the formation of religious identity in modern youth under the influence of such postmodern cultural phenomena as rhizome and transgression. The authors investigate the modern religious virtual space in the field of which new religious formations are being developed and study the attitude of students to similar projects. The purpose of this article is to identify the degree and nature of the influence of the postmodern worldview on the religious identity of young Russians. For this, the features of the post-modern religious worldview are analysed and the level of dependence of the religious worldview of youth on the Internet space is revealed. The main markers of the influence of the postmodern worldview on the religiosity of youth including, first of all, acts of religious transgression are proposed. Basic sociological research methods were used as the main research methodology. The study revealed a number of reasons that influence the transformation of value orientations of young people. It was also found that a religious dialogue with the older generation and representatives of the Church is replaced with alternative models of gaining religious experience.

AB  - The phenomenon of "God" is the common feature of all religious, mystics, philosophical sciences and theology. And each group examines it according to its own worldview. Since the worldview of every thought field is commensurate with the conditions and view of each perspective. Then, the analysis and interpretation of each phenomenon will be influenced by the same particular worldview. Because the phenomenology position of mysticism is different, phenomenologists believe that ontology itself does not represent phenomena. Rather, humans understand it by looking at the phenomena and how they enter the spirit of the world. Kant has said that we understand things not as they are in themselves, but as they appear to us. As a mystic, Hafiz memorized the Holy Quran and observed the Shari'a approach on his attitude toward God and surveyed mystical discourse formation. And mystical worldview prevails significantly in the introduction and identification of the "God" phenomenon. Using a descriptive-analytical approach, this paper concludes that Hafiz Shirazi uses more formulation of mystical discourse to represent the context of cognition in such discourses.

TI  - The clinical significance of metastatic breast carcinoma to intramammary lymph node
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence of involved intramammary lymph node (intra-MLN) with breast carcinoma (BC) is rare. Its clinical significance and impact on the clinical decision making is unclear. A total of 113 BC cases with at least one positive intra-MLN were collected from 11 academic institutions. The inclusion criteria were subsequent axillary lymph node dissection, and the availability of information on T-stage, size of node metastasis, extranodal extension status, biomarkers status, and clinical follow-up. Stage 4 cases and/or neo-adjuvant treated patients were excluded. AJCC TN-stage was calculated twice, with and without intra-MLN. Five-year overall survival (OS) and relapse (local and/or distant)-free survival (RFS) were calculated and correlated with the clinicopathologic variables. Excluding intra-MLN, TN-stage correlated with OS (P = .016) but not with RFS (P = .19). However, when intra-MLN was included, TN-stage correlated with both OS (P < .001) and RFS (P = .016). In the multivariate analysis, when intra-MLN was excluded, only radiation therapy (RT) correlated with RFS (HR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.054-0.66, P = .009). However, when intra-MLN was included in the TN-stage both RT (HR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.45, P = .001) and TN-stage 3 (HR = 8.92, 95% CI: 1.47-54, P = .017) correlated with RFS. Tumor multifocality was the only variable correlated with OS when the intra-MLN involvement was excluded. When intra-MLN was included, multifocality became insignificant but TN-stage 3 correlated with OS (HR = 8.59, 95% CI: 1.06-69.71, P = .044). Positive intra-MLN is an independent factor in predicting both RFS and OS.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Relationships of Phytoplankton Blooms, Drought, and Rainstorms in Freshwater Reservoirs
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms, especially those composed of toxic phytoplankton, are a global threat to eutrophic and mesotrophic freshwater reservoirs. While extreme hydrologic events such as flooding and drought have been shown to control bloom onset and success, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these relationships are still unclear for mesotrophic reservoirs. In this study, the relationships between hydrologic events and phytoplankton in Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier, Georgia, United States, were characterized using historical and satellite datasets from 2008 to 2017 and statistical modeling. Results showed that the impact of stormflow and rainstorm events varied systematically from riverine to lacustrine reaches of the two reservoirs on weekly and monthly scales. Precipitation duration and stormflow were the most significant and best-fitting predictors of algal bloom biomass in deeper reaches of the two reservoirs, suggesting that algal blooms in more lacustrine environments may be better equipped for wet and stormy regimes than has been previously hypothesized.

TI  - An inventory-driven rock glacier status model (intact vs. relict) for South Tyrol, Eastern Italian Alps
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice presence in rock glaciers is a topic that is likely to gain importance in the future due to the expected decrease in water supply from glaciers and the increase of mass movements originating in periglacial areas. This makes it important to have at ones disposal inventories with complete information on the state of rock glaciers. This study presents a method to overcome incomplete information on the status of rock glaciers (i.e. intact vs. relict) recorded in regional scale inventories. The proposed data-driven modelling framework can be used to estimate the likelihood that rock glaciers contain frozen material. Potential predictor variables related to topography, environmental controls or the rock glacier appearance were derived from a digital terrain model (DTM), satellite data and gathered from existing data sets. An initial exploratory data analysis supported the heuristic selection of predictor variables. Three classification algorithms, namely logistic regression (GLM), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were trained on the basis of the available information on the status of rock glaciers within the territory of South Tyrol (Eastern Italian Alps). The resulting classification rules led to assign a binary label - intact or relict - to 235 unclassified rock glaciers present in the inventory. All models were validated quantitatively on spatially-independent test samples (spatial cross validation) and achieved highly satisfactory performance scores. Hereby, the less flexible statistically-based classifier (GLM) performed slightly better than the more flexible machine learning algorithms (SVM and RF). Spatial permutation-based variable importance assessment revealed that elevation and vegetation cover (based on NDVI) were the most relevant predictors. For more than 80% of the unclassified rock glaciers, all of the three models agreed on the spatially predicted rock glacier status. Only for a minor portion (12.3%), one model differed from the remaining two. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Kets and Their Culture. Research Problems in the 20th-21st Centuries (The Statement of the Problem)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kets are an indigenous people of Siberia whose culture is investigated by many Russian and foreign researchers. One can state now that an authentic view on the Kets' origin and ethnogenesis does not exist. In particular, there are assumptions of linguists and anthropologists concerning the contacts and similarities of the Kets and North American Indians, of the Kets and the Chinese, of the Kets and other peoples of Siberia, etc. The aim of the article is to reveal some problems of the Kets' culture research in the 20th and 21st centuries. The basic sources for this article are published articles by many researchers (linguists, anthropologists, ethnographers, etc.), results of the author's field and theoretical work. Since the beginning of the scientific study of the Kets, this people has lost many ethnic features. One of the main problems of the study of the Kets now (and back in the 19th and 20th centuries) is that it is unclear who the Kets were and are; in other words, what the criteria for determining an authentic representative of the Ket ethnos are. These criteria must be scientifically based and must be prepared before working with informants. The second problem is a wrong methodology of work with representatives of the ethnos. Researchers studied the Kets after the beginning of Russian assimilation when the Kets had cultural concepts typical for the Russian population. It is obvious that these cultural phenomena belonged to the modern Kets rather than to the native ones. Besides, researchers interviewed the Ket people from their own point of view, founded on peculiarities of the Russian culture and language, talked with informants in Russian, etc. This caused the obtrusion of new notions and researchers' worldview, which is inadmissible if we aim to describe and study an original ethnic culture. The third problem consists in the erroneous summarizing of the theoretical stage. It is clear that the primordial incorrect field research determines fallacious conclusions, contradictory outcomes, hypotheses, etc. These three problems are not new and typical for the 20th and 21st centuries and for the Kets exclusively, but they remain relevant and ever-present. The author concludes that the existing situation requires an integrated rethinking of research methods. Otherwise, the study of the Kets will be unproductive. In particularly, today, it is necessary to critically analyse the collected data, to correct methods of field work and of interviewing of informants.

TI  - Global and Local Tensor Sparse Approximation Models for Hyperspectral Image Destriping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a global and local tensor sparse approximation (GLTSA) model for removing the stripes in hyperspectral images (HSIs). HSIs can easily be degraded by unwanted stripes. Two intrinsic characteristics of the stripes are (1) global sparse distribution and (2) local smoothness along the stripe direction. Stripe-free hyperspectral images are smooth in spatial domain, with strong spectral correlation. Existing destriping approaches often do not fully investigate such intrinsic characteristics of the stripes in spatial and spectral domains simultaneously. Those methods may generate new artifacts in extreme areas, causing spectral distortion. The proposed GLTSA model applies two l0-norm regularizers to the stripe components and along-stripe gradient to improve the destriping performance. Two l1-norm regularizers are applied to the gradients of clean image in spatial and spectral domains. The double non-convex functions in GLTSA are converted to single non-convex function by mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Experiment results demonstrate that GLTSA is effective and outperforms existing competitive matrix-based and tensor-based destriping methods in visual, as well as quantitative, evaluation measures.

TI  - Improving the Applicability of Hydrologic Models for Food-Energy-Water Nexus Studies Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Food, energy, and water (FEW) nexus studies require reliable estimates of water availability, use, and demand. In this regard, spatially distributed hydrologic models are widely used to estimate not only streamflow (SF) but also different components of the water balance such as evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture (SM), and groundwater. For such studies, the traditional calibration approach of using SF observations is inadequate. To address this, we use state-of-the-art global remote sensing-based estimates of ET and SM with a multivariate calibration methodology to improve the applicability of a widely used spatially distributed hydrologic model (Noah-MP) for FEW nexus studies. Specifically, we conduct univariate and multivariate calibration experiments in the Mississippi river basin with ET, SM, and SF to understand the trade-offs in accurately simulating ET, SM, and SF simultaneously. Results from univariate calibration with just SF reveal that increased accuracy in SF at the cost of degrading the spatio-temporal accuracy of ET and SM, which is essential for FEW nexus studies. We show that multivariate calibration helps preserve the accuracy of all the components involved in calibration. The study emphasizes the importance of multiple sources of information, especially from satellite remote sensing, for improving FEW nexus studies.

TI  - Religious Values in Clinical Practice are Here to Stay
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research to date has shown that health professionals often practice according to personal values, including values based on faith, and that these values impact medicine in multiple ways. While some influence of personal values are inevitable, awareness of values is important so as to sustain beneficial practice without conflicting with the values of the patient. Detecting when own personal values, whether based on a theistic or atheistic worldview, are at work, is a daily challenge in clinical practice. Simultaneously ethical guidelines of tone-setting medical associations like American Medical Association, the British General Medical Council and Australian Medical Association have been updated to encompass physicians' right to practice medicine in accord with deeply held beliefs. Framed by this context, we discuss the concept of value-neutrality and value-based medical practice of physicians from both a cultural and ethical perspective, and reach the conclusion that the concept of a completely value-neutral physician, free from influence of personal values and filtering out value-laden information when talking to patients, is simply an unrealistic ideal in light of existing evidence. Still we have no reason to suspect that personal values, whether religious, spiritual, atheistic or agnostic, should hinder physicians from delivering professional and patient-centered care.

TI  - Statistical characterization of frost zones: Case of tea freeze damage in the Kenyan highlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent frost occurrences in the Kenyan highlands have had devastating effects on agricultural productivity. With inadequate management systems to mitigate the impacts, farmers have often had to bear the burden of losses resulting from frost damage. While agriculture in Kenya remains dependent on weather and climate, the agricultural economy of Kenya continues to suffer, underscoring the need for building local knowledge as basis for development of early warning systems. The current paper attempts to delineate frost zones by statistically characterizing them based on known risk factors related to topography (elevation, convexity, aspect, upslope flow length) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Through binary logistic regression, a logistic regression model was developed utilizing observation data (frost occurrence and non-occurrence) as a binary dependent variable to estimate the probability of frost occurrence. Assuming a 0.5 probability cut-off threshold between frost occurrence and non-occurrence, an overall accuracy of 81% with area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve of 0.88 was obtained. No evidence of lack of model fit was detected. This model outperforms the currently operational model that utilizes MODIS LST alone to detect frost zones in the Kenyan tea plantations. It provides an improved method for effective delineation of frost zones by incorporating local topographic characteristics.

TI  - Conspiracy theories in Russian security thinking
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on an analysis of around 500 texts from security-affiliated Russian academic journals and one newspaper over a ten-year period, this article details how conspiratorial ideas are spread, tolerated and legitimised within military institutions and official think tanks in Russia. Particular conspiracy theories systematically underpin a broader conspiratorial worldview, which in its basic orientation is anti-Western and illiberal, and which reinforces a perception of Russia as being under threat. As such, this phenomenon serves to justify and rationalise both Russian foreign policy conduct, as well as the targeted repression of various domestic groups as necessary for security reasons. We discuss whether the prevalence of conspiratorial ideas merely reflects an established worldview popular in certain circles or if it influences actual policy and outline some policy implications for the interpretation of Russian foreign policy conduct. The prevalence of conspiracy theories in renowned publications is a concern in itself since it hampers a genuine understanding of international affairs.

TI  - Inorganic suspended matter as an indicator of terrestrial influence in Baltic Sea coastal areas - Algorithm development and validation, and ecological relevance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) consists both of an organic (OSPM) and an inorganic fraction (ISPM) and the latter can be used as an indicator for coastal influence in the Baltic Sea. The concentration of SPM can be derived from particle scatter if the specific scattering properties of the respective water body are known. In this paper we show that likewise, ISPM can be derived reliably from remotely sensed particle scatter. An empirical algorithm between particle scatter (AC9 data) and ISPM concentration (measured gravimetrically) was derived from in-water measurements. This regional algorithm was then applied to the iop_bpart level 2 product (i.e. the particle scatter measured at 443 nm) derived from OLCI data on Sentinel-A (S3A) using the C2RCC neural network and validated against an independent data set. The standard error of the derived OLCI match-up data was 10%, and was thus within the goal of the mission requirements of Sentinel-3.The generated S3 composite images from spring and autumn 2018 show that in the Baltic Sea most of the ISPM falls out rather close to the shore, whereas only a very small proportion of ISPM is carried further off-shore. This is also supported by in situ ISPM transects measured in the coastal zone.The ISPM images clearly highlight the areas that are most strongly influenced by terrestrial matter. Differences between the NE Baltic and the SE Baltic proper can be explained by the difference in hydrology and coastal influence as well as bathymetry and wind-wave stirring. The method is of interest for coastal zone management and for assessing the effect of seasonal changes in terrestrial run-off and wind-driven resuspension of sediments. It can also be used to evaluate the effect of climate change which has led to an increase of extreme storm and flooding events that are usually accompanied by increased erosion and run-off from land. Last but not least, turbidity caused by particles influences the light conditions in inner coastal areas and bays, which has a profound effect on pelagic productivity, the maximum growth of macroalgae as well as fish behaviour.

TI  - Application of Sentinel 3 OLCI for chl-a retrieval over small inland water targets: Successes and challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication and increasing prevalence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms among global inland water bodies is becoming a major concern and requires direct attention. The European Space Agency recently launched the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Sentinel 3 satellite. The success of the mission will depend on extensive validation efforts for the development of accurate and robust in-water algorithms. In this study, four full atmospheric correction methods are assessed over four inland water reservoirs in South Africa, along with a suite of red/NIR based semi-analytic and band difference models for chl-a estimation which were applied to both full and partial atmospherically corrected data. In addition, we tested a novel duplicate pixel correction method to account for duplicate pixels induced by high observation zenith angles. Radiometric errors associated with OLCI Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances over small water targets were also investigated by modeling in situ reflectance measurements to at-sensor radiances using MODTRAN. Of the four atmospheric corrections, the 6SV1 radiative transfer code showed the most promise for producing reasonable reflectances when compared to in-situ measurements. Empirically derived band difference models outperformed all other chl-a retrieval methods on both partially and fully corrected reflectances. The Maximum Peak Height (MPH) algorithm applied to Bottom of Rayleigh Reflectance (BRR) performed best overall (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE(%) = 99), while the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) performed best on atmospherically corrected data using 6SV1 (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE(%) = 107). Semi-analytic chl-a retrieval methods proved very successful when applied to in situ R-rs, however, are not reliable when applied to low quality reflectance data. The SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC), an adjacency correction applied in conjunction with the image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR) processor, did not improve retrieval results for these small water targets.

TI  - Drainage basin delineation for outlet glaciers of Northeast Greenland based on Sentinel-1 ice velocities and TanDEM-X elevations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The drainage divides of ice sheets separate the overall glaciated area into multiple sectors. These drainage basins are essential for partitioning mass changes of the ice sheet, as they specify the area over which basin specific measurements are integrated. The delineation of drainage basins on ice sheets is challenging due to their gentle slopes accompanied by local terrain disturbances and complex patterns of ice movement. Until now, in Greenland the basins have been mostly delineated along the major ice divides, which results in large drainage sectors containing multiple outlet glaciers. However, when focusing on measuring glaciological parameters of individual outlet glaciers, more detailed drainage basin delineations are needed. Here we present for the first time a detailed and fully traceable approach that combines ice sheet wide velocity measurements by Sentinel-1 and the high resolution TanDEM-X global DEM to derive individual glacier drainage basins. We delineated catchments for the Northeast Greenland Ice Sheet with a modified watershed algorithm and present results for 31 drainage basins. Even though validation of drainage basins remains a difficult task, we estimated basin probabilities from Monte-Carlo experiments and applied the method to a variety of different ice velocity and DEM datasets finding discrepancies of up to 16% in the extent of catchment areas. The proposed approach has the potential to produce drainage areas for the entirety of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

TI  - K562 erythroleukemia line as a possible reticulocyte source to culture <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and its surrogates
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing an in vitro "red blood cell matrix" that would allow uninterrupted access to a stable, homogeneous reticulocyte population would facilitate the establishment of continuous, long-term in vitro Plasmodium vivax blood stage cultures. In this study, we have explored the suitability of the erythroleukemia K562 cell line as a continuous source of such reticulocytes and have investigated regulatory factors behind the terminal differentiation (and enucleation, in particular) of this cell line that can be used to drive the reticulocyte production process. The Duffy blood group antigen receptor (Fy), essential for P. vivax invasion, was stably introduced into K562 cells by lentiviral gene transfer. miRNA-26a-5p and miRNA-30a-5p were downregulated to promote erythroid differentiation and enucleation, resulting in a tenfold increase in the production of reticulocytes after stimulation with an induction cocktail compared with controls. Our results suggest an interplay in the mechanisms of action of miRNA-26a-5p and miRNA-30a-5p, which makes it necessary to downregulate both miRNAs to achieve a stable enucleation rate and Fy receptor expression. In the context of establishing P. vivax-permissive, stable, and reproducible reticulocytes, a higher enucleation rate may be desirable, which may be achieved by the targeting of further regulatory mechanisms in Fy-K562 cells; promoting the shift in hemoglobin production from fetal to adult may also be necessary. Despite the fact that K562 erythroleukemia cell lines are of neoplastic origin, this cell line offers a versatile model system to research the regulatory mechanisms underlying erythropoiesis.

TI  - Asbestos-Cement Roofing Identification Using Remote Sensing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the pathogenic nature of asbestos, a statutory ban on asbestos-containing products has been in place in Poland since 1997. In order to protect human health and the environment, it is crucial to estimate the quantity of asbestos-cement products in use. It has been evaluated that about 90% of them are roof coverings. Different methods are used to estimate the amount of asbestos-cement products, such as the use of indicators, field inventory, remote sensing data, and multi- and hyperspectral images; the latter are used for relatively small areas. Other methods are sought for the reliable estimation of the quantity of asbestos-containing products, as well as their spatial distribution. The objective of this paper is to present the use of convolutional neural networks for the identification of asbestos-cement roofing on aerial photographs in natural color (RGB) and color infrared (CIR) compositions. The study was conducted for the Chciny commune. Aerial photographs, each with the spatial resolution of 25 cm in RGB and CIR compositions, were used, and field studies were conducted to verify data and to develop a database for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) training. Network training was carried out using the TensorFlow and R-Keras libraries in the R programming environment. The classification was carried out using a convolutional neural network consisting of two convolutional blocks, a spatial dropout layer, and two blocks of fully connected perceptrons. Asbestos-cement roofing products were classified with the producer's accuracy of 89% and overall accuracy of 87% and 89%, depending on the image composition used. Attempts have been made at the identification of asbestos-cement roofing. They focus primarily on the use of hyperspectral data and multispectral imagery. The following classification algorithms were usually employed: Spectral Angle Mapper, Support Vector Machine, object classification, Spectral Feature Fitting, and decision trees. Previous studies undertaken by other researchers showed that low spectral resolution only allowed for a rough classification of roofing materials. The use of one coherent method would allow data comparison between regions. Determining the amount of asbestos-cement products in use is important for assessing environmental exposure to asbestos fibres, determining patterns of disease, and ultimately modelling potential solutions to counteract threats.

TI  - Blooming of <i>Gonyaulax polygramma</i> along the southeastern Arabian Sea: Influence of upwelling dynamics and anthropogenic activities
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of upwelling on the phytoplankton community was examined during the upwelling-relaxation period in the southeastern Arabian Sea. Elevated upwelling intensity during the summer monsoon season of 2016 resulted in the re-suspension of harmful dinoflagellates into the surface water. Further, the surplus of phosphorus (P) inputs into the coastal waters from estuarine runoff during the upwelling-relaxation period induced blooming of Gonyaulax polygramma (4.9 x 10(6) cells L-1). Results from canonical correspondence analysis revealed that elevated upwelling intensity, P and salinity during the year 2016 likely triggered the bloom of G. polygramma in the study region. HABs like G. polygramma threaten fish stocks such as sardines which have a vital role in the ecosystem. Studies on phytoplankton communities and nutrient dynamics in upwelling systems would be useful in predicting the incidence/toxic effects of harmful algal blooms as these regions have a high potential for fisheries.

TI  - MODIS based forest fire hotspot analysis and its relationship with climatic variables
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming caused an increase of forest fire events worldwide causing widespread forest degradation. Geospatial techniques aid in analysing climatic parameters to examine their relationship with forest fire. The research analyses time series forest fire events during 2001-2017 to deduce forest fire hotspots in PTR. MODIS forest fire spots was converted into points and hotspot analysis tool was used to map hotspot. The forest fire incidences were analysed with reference to climatic parameters viz. precipitation, solar radiation (SR), mean temperature and relative humidity (RH). The average RH was highest in May (0.69) and lowest in March (0.18), whereas high temperature with low RH was observed till the end of April. The SR was highest in April (27.24 MJ/m(2)) whereas lowest in May (15.68 MJ/m(2)). Satellite based land surface temperature (LST) was compared with fire spot and found that area having high temperature lies under high forest fire zone. The highest LST observed was 49.52 degrees C whereas the lowest was 29.40 degrees C. The study revealed that most forest fires occurred during March-April and total forest fire events was 1212. For accuracy assessment an analysis between fire pixels and post fire data from Landsat was shown, which showed that same areas were under forest fires during 2001-2017.

TI  - Change in forest and vegetation cover influencing distribution and uses of plants in the Kailash Sacred Landscape, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of vegetation and land-use change has been frequently used to assess the anthropogenic impacts on the distribution and uses of medicinal plant species. Using data from ecological investigations, remote sensing and participant observations, the nexus of socioeconomy, forest management and conservation of medicinal plants can be analyzed. In the current study, we employed a similar approach to study the impact of forest and vegetation cover, socioeconomic changes on plant distribution and use in remote and rural districts of Nepal. We have used remote-sensing data to analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) as proxies to analyze the changes in forest cover and vegetation. Informant interviews and group discussions were held with local participants to assess their opinion about the uses and distribution of plants, forests and vegetation. While the overall vegetation cover was decreasing, a fluctuated pattern was recorded with a reduction in NDVI from 2000 to 2008, and subsequent increase after that. A positive correlation between LAI and NDVI was found, but the index varied spatially and temporally and sometimes was negatively correlated as NDVI saturated and became insensitive. Due to decreasing old-growth primary forests, land-use changes, and increasing sociocultural transformations, we found that the tradition of transhumance and collection of indigenous medicinal plants were rapidly being changed and the non-indigenous plants were increasingly being collected from the accessible forest areas and human-derived landscapes. These changes help us conclude that the salient sites and species are being assimilated in the local traditions; making traditional systems more versatile, diverse and adaptive.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL CULTURE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONDITIONS OF EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: PROBLEMS AND PERSPECTIVES
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article relevance is stipulated by the necessity of finding ways to increase environmental safety level, forming planet population environmental culture, including in Russia, which strives to implement the sustainable development concept. The article objective is to analyze problems and reveal pedagogical conditions for raising the efficiency of forming environmental culture in school educational environment. The leading approach to investigating this problem was theoretical analysis. Besides, the polling data of 80 elementary school teachers were used so as to subjectively estimate the comfort degree of educational environment. As a result of theoretical analysis, the problems of developing environmental culture was found to be based upon contradictions between society demand in environmentally cultural, educated personality capable to join the process of protecting and investigating the environment, and insufficient development level of pupils' environmental culture. Thus, it was concluded environmental culture is a part of general culture connecting informational, technological (activity), and axiological layers. The performed research of psychological and pedagogical conditions for forming environmental culture can be useful for officials in the education sector, practical teachers, and all citizens interested in environmental education issues.

AB  - Many conventional cloud- and shadow-detection algorithms require meta-data such as sun angle and date of image collection. Moreover, detection results can vary a lot in actual images. We present simple and effective algorithms that do not require meta-data for detecting clouds and shadows in Landsat and Worldview images. Comparison with existing state-of-the-art algorithms, including a deep learning-based algorithm as well as a commercial algorithm, using actual satellite images, shows that the simple algorithms have comparable or even better performance than existing algorithms.

TI  - Quantifying forest loss and forest degradation in Myanmar's "home of teak"
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bago Mountain Range in Myanmar is known as the "home of teak" (Tectona grandis L. f.) because of its bountiful, naturally growing teak-bearing forests. Accelerating forest loss and degradation are threatening the sustainable production of teak in the region. Changes in land cover between 2000 and 2017 in four reserved forests of the Bago Mountain Range were mapped using supervised classification of Landsat imagery and training data collected in the field. A stratified random sample was used to collect reference data to assess accuracy of the maps and estimate area. Based on the reference sample, it was estimated that the forest area declined from 71 240 ha (standard error (SE) = 1524 ha) in 2000 to 40 891 ha (SE = 4404 ha) in 2017, whereas the area of degraded forests increased from 88 797 ha (SE = 1694 ha) to 97 013 ha (SE = 5395 ha). The annualized rates of gross forest loss and gross forest degradation were 1.03% and 0.97%, respectively, indicating that forest degradation paralleled forest loss. In many degraded areas, there is an opportunity to ameliorate the situation through silviculture. The 2017 map identifies bamboo-dominated degraded forests where enrichment planting or reforestation is recommended.

TI  - Immunologic and immunogenomic aspects of tumor progression
T2  - SEMINARS IN CANCER BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tumor progression to metastatic disease is characterized by continuous genetic alterations due to instability of the genome. Immune sensitivity was found to be linked to tumor mutational burden (TMB) and the resulting amount of neoantigens. However, APOBEC activity resulting in increase in TMB causes immune evasion. On the other hand, clonal or acquired genetic loss of HLA class I also hampers immune sensitivity of tumors. Rare amplification of the PD-Ll gene in cancers may render them sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors but involvement of broader regions of chromosome 9p may ultimately lead again to immune evasion due to inactivation of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway. Such genetic changes may occur not only in the primary tumor but at any phase of progression: in lymphatic as well as in visceral metastases. Accordingly, it is rational to monitor these changes continuously during disease progression similar to target therapies. Moreover, beside temporal variability, genomic features of tumors such as mutation profiles, as well as the tumor immune microenvironment also show considerable inter- and intratumoral spatial heterogeneity, suggesting the necessity of multiple sampling in biomarker studies.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods Applied to SAR Images for Forest Classification in Mediterranean Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, multifrequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR and Cosmo-SkyMed sensors were studied for forest classification in a test area in Central Italy (San Rossore), where detailed in-situ measurements were available. A preliminary discrimination of the main land cover classes and forest types was carried out by exploiting the synergy among L-, C- and X-bands and different polarizations. SAR data were preliminarily inspected to assess the capabilities of discriminating forest from non-forest and separating broadleaf from coniferous forests. The temporal average backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees) was computed for each sensor-polarization pair and labeled on a pixel basis according to the reference map. Seeral classification methods based on the machine learning framework were applied and alidated considering different features, in order to highlight the contribution of bands and polarizations, as well as to assess the classifiers' performance. The experimental results indicate that the different surface types are best identified by using all bands, followed by joint L- and X-bands. In the former case, the best oerall aerage accuracy (83.1%) is achieed by random forest classification. Finally, the classification maps on class edges are discussed to highlight the misclassification errors.

TI  - Agricultural Expansion in Mato Grosso from 1986-2000: A Bayesian Time Series Approach to Tracking Past Land Cover Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 5 has produced imagery for decades that can now be viewed and manipulated in Google Earth Engine, but a general, automated way of producing a coherent time series from these images-particularly over cloudy areas in the distant past-is elusive. Here, we create a land use and land cover (LULC) time series for part of tropical Mato Grosso, Brazil, using the Bayesian Updating of Land Cover: Unsupervised (BULC-U) technique. The algorithm built backward in time from the GlobCover 2009 data set, a multi-category global LULC data set at 300 m resolution for the year 2009, combining it with Landsat time series imagery to create a land cover time series for the period 1986-2000. Despite the substantial LULC differences between the 1990s and 2009 in this area, much of the landscape remained the same: we asked whether we could harness those similarities and differences to recreate an accurate version of the earlier LULC. The GlobCover basis and the Landsat-5 images shared neither a common spatial resolution nor time frame, But BULC-U successfully combined the labels from the coarser classification with the spatial detail of Landsat. The result was an accurate fine-scale time series that quantified the expansion of deforestation in the study area, which more than doubled in size during this time. Earth Engine directly enabled the fusion of these different data sets held in its catalog: its flexible treatment of spatial resolution, rapid prototyping, and overall processing speed permitted the development and testing of this study. Many would-be users of remote sensing data are currently limited by the need to have highly specialized knowledge to create classifications of older data. The approach shown here presents fewer obstacles to participation and allows a wide audience to create their own time series of past decades. By leveraging both the varied data catalog and the processing speed of Earth Engine, this research can contribute to the rapid advances underway in multi-temporal image classification techniques. Given Earth Engine's power and deep catalog, this research further opens up remote sensing to a rapidly growing community of researchers and managers who need to understand the long-term dynamics of terrestrial systems.

TI  - Diarrhoeal disease and subsequent risk of death in infants and children residing in low-income and middle-income countries: analysis of the GEMS case-control study and 12-month GEMS-1A follow-on study
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was a 3-year case-control study that measured the burden, aetiology, and consequences of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea (MSD) in children aged 0-59 months. GEMS-1A, a 12-month follow-on study, comprised two parallel case-control studies, one assessing MS D and the other less-severe diarrhoea (LSD). In this report, we analyse the risk of death with each diarrhoea type and the specific pathogens associated with fatal outcomes.Methods GEMS was a prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study done at seven sites in Africa and Asia. Children aged 0-59 months with MS D seeking care at sentinel health centres were recruited along with one to three randomly selected matched community control children without diarrhoea. In the 12-month GEMS-1A follow-on study, children with LSD and matched controls, in addition to children with MSD and matched controls, were recruited at six of the seven sites; only cases of MSD and controls were enrolled at the seventh site. We compared risk of death during the period between enrolment and one follow-up household visit done about 60 days later (range 50-90 days) in children with MSD and LSD and in their respective controls. Approximately 50 pathogens were detected using, as appropriate, classic bacteriology, immunoassays, gel-based PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Specimens from a subset of GEMS cases and controls were also tested by a TaqMan Array Card that compartmentalised probe-based qPCR for 32 enteropathogens.Findings 223 (2.0%) of 11108 children with MSD and 43 (0.3%) of 16369 matched controls died between study enrolment and the follow-up visit at about 60 days (hazard ratio [HRJ 8.16,95% CI 5.69-11.68, p<0 . 0001). 12 (0.4%) of 2962 children with LSD and seven (0.2%) of 4074 matched controls died during the follow-up period (HR 2.78, 95% CI 0.95-8.11, p=0-061). Risk of death was lower in children with dysenteric MSD than in children with nondysenteric MSD (HR 0-20, 95% CI 0.05-0-87, p=0.032), and lower in children with LSD than in those with nondysenteric MSD (HR 0-29,0-14-0-59, p=0.0006). In children younger than 24 months with MSD, infection with typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coil, enterotoxigenic E coii encoding heat-stable toxin, enteroaggregative E coil, Shigella spp (non-dysentery cases), Aeromonas spp, Cryptosporidium spp, and Entamoeba histoiytica increased risk of death. Of 61 deaths in children aged 12-59 months with non-dysenteric MSD, 31 occurred among 942 children qPCRpositive for Shigella spp and 30 deaths occurred in 1384 qPCR-negative children (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9, p=0.0090), showing that Shigella was strongly associated with increased risk of death.Interpretation Risk of death is increased following MSD and, to a lesser extent, LSD. Considering there are approximately three times more cases of LSD than MSD in the population, more deaths are expected among children with LSD than in those with MSD. Because the major attributable LSD-associated and MSD-associated pathogens are the same, implementing vaccines and rapid diagnosis and treatment interventions against these major pathogens are rational investments.

AB  - Heterogeneity is an essential characteristic of the geographic phenomenon. However, most existing researches concerning heterogeneity are based on the matrix. The bidimensional nature of the matrix cannot well support the multidimensional analysis of spatiotemporal field data. Here, we introduce an improved tensor-based feature analysis method for spatiotemporal field data with heterogeneous variation, by utilizing the similarity measurement in multidimensional space and feature capture of tensor decomposition. In this method, the heterogeneous spatiotemporal field data are reorganized first according to the similarity and difference within the data. The feature analysis by integrating the spatiotemporal coupling is then obtained by tensor decomposition. Since the reorganized data have a more consistent internal structure than original data, the feature analysis bias caused by heterogeneous variation in tensor decomposition can be effectively avoided. We demonstrate our method based on the climatic reanalysis field data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The comparison with conventional tensor decomposition showed that the proposed method can approximate the original data more accurately both in global and local regions. Especially in the area influenced by the complex modal aliasing and in the period time of the climatic anomaly events, the approximation accuracy can be significantly improved. The proposed method can also reveal the zonal variation of temperature gradient and abnormal variations of air temperature ignored in the conventional tensor method.

TI  - A preliminary evaluation of GOES-16 active fire product using Landsat-8 and VIIRS active fire data, and ground-based prescribed fire records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based active fire data provide indispensable information for monitoring global fire activity and understanding its impacts on climate and air quality. Yet the limited spatiotemporal sampling capacities of current satellites result in considerable uncertainties in fire observation and emissions estimation. The mitigation of these uncertainties mainly relies on new remote-sensing technology. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series observes fires across North and South Americas at an unprecedentedly spatiotemporal resolution of nominal 2 km every 5-15 min. This study evaluated the GOES-16 (the first GOES-R satellite) ABI active fire product using active fire data derived from the 30-m Landsat-8 and the 375-m and 750-m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and ground-based burning data across the southeastern Conterminous United States (CONUS) during the 2018 peak fire season. Specifically, we characterized the overall fire detection performance of the ABI active fire detections, estimated omission and commission errors, and evaluated ABI fire radiative power (FRP). The results showed that the ABI fire detection probability and its omission and commission errors were highly related to fire size and temporal period. ABI detection probability was higher than 95% for the fire pixel that contained over 114 Landsat-8 (30 m) fire detections or 11 VIIRS (375 m) detections. During a period of +/- 8 h, ABI detected 19% and 29% more fires observed by Landsat-8 and 375-m VIIRS, respectively. Correspondingly, the omission error could reduce by up to 33%. Further, ABI was able to detect 6-22% and 31-42% more ground-recorded fires than VIIRS in Georgia and Florida States, respectively, but ABI still missed many very small fires because ABI was hard to detect fires smaller than similar to 34.5 MW. Additionally, compared with 750-m VIIRS FRP, ABI FRP was similar to 30-50% larger in individual fire events but was overall similar at a regional scale.

TI  - Improved Winter Wheat Spatial Distribution Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using Semantic Features and Statistical Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of edge pixel classification is an important aspect of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract winter wheat spatial distribution information from remote sensing imagery. In this study, we established a method using prior knowledge obtained from statistical analysis to refine CNN classification results, named post-processing CNN (PP-CNN). First, we used an improved RefineNet model to roughly segment remote sensing imagery in order to obtain the initial winter wheat area and the category probability vector for each pixel. Second, we used manual labels as references and performed statistical analysis on the class probability vectors to determine the filtering conditions and select the pixels that required optimization. Third, based on the prior knowledge that winter wheat pixels were internally similar in color, texture, and other aspects, but different from other neighboring land-use types, the filtered pixels were post-processed to improve the classification accuracy. We used 63 Gaofen-2 images obtained from 2017 to 2019 of a representative Chinese winter wheat region (Feicheng, Shandong Province) to create the dataset and employed RefineNet and SegNet as standard CNN and conditional random field (CRF) as post-process methods, respectively, to conduct comparison experiments. PP-CNN's accuracy (94.4%), precision (93.9%), and recall (94.4%) were clearly superior, demonstrating its advantages for the improved refinement of edge areas during image classification.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Observations of Submesoscale Eddies in Coastal Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial variation in submesoscale eddies in the coastal region of Lianyungang (China) is studied over a period of nearly two years with high-resolution (0.03 degrees, about 3 km) observations of surface currents derived from high-frequency coastal radars (HFRs). The centers and boundaries of submesoscale eddies are identified based on a vector geometry (VG) method. A color index (CI) representing MODIS ocean color patterns with a resolution of 500 m is used to compute CI gradient parameters, from which submesoscale features are extracted using a modified eddy-extraction approach. The results show that surface currents derived from HFRs and the CI-derived gradient parameters have the ability to capture submesoscale processes (SPs). The typical radius of an eddy in this region is 2-4 km. Although no significant difference in eddy properties is observed between the HFR-derived current fields and CI-derived gradient parameters, the CI-derived gradient parameters show more detailed eddy structures due to a higher resolution. In general, the HFR-derived current fields capture the eddy form, evolution and dissipation. Meanwhile, the CI-derived gradient parameters show more SPs and fill a gap left by the HFR-derived currents. This study shows that the HFR and CI products have the ability to detect SPs in the ocean and contribute to SP analyses.

TI  - CLRS: Continual Learning Benchmark for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image scene classification has a high application value in the agricultural, military, as well as other fields. A large amount of remote sensing data is obtained every day. After learning the new batch data, scene classification algorithms based on deep learning face the problem of catastrophic forgetting, that is, they cannot maintain the performance of the old batch data. Therefore, it has become more and more important to ensure that the scene classification model has the ability of continual learning, that is, to learn new batch data without forgetting the performance of the old batch data. However, the existing remote sensing image scene classification datasets all use static benchmarks and lack the standard to divide the datasets into a number of sequential learning training batches, which largely limits the development of continual learning in remote sensing image scene classification. First, this study gives the criteria for training batches that have been partitioned into three continual learning scenarios, and proposes a large-scale remote sensing image scene classification database called the Continual Learning Benchmark for Remote Sensing (CLRS). The goal of CLRS is to help develop state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms in the field of remote sensing image scene classification. In addition, in this paper, a new method of constructing a large-scale remote sensing image classification database based on the target detection pretrained model is proposed, which can effectively reduce manual annotations. Finally, several mainstream continual learning methods are tested and analyzed under three continual learning scenarios, and the results can be used as a baseline for future work.

TI  - Mapping and Analyzing the Park Cooling Effect on Urban Heat Island in an Expanding City: A Case Study in Zhengzhou City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect has been extensively studied as a global issue. The urbanization process has been proved to be the main reason for this phenomenon. Over the past 20 years, the built-up area of Zhengzhou city has grown five times larger, and the UHI effect has become increasingly pressing for the city's inhabitants. Therefore, mitigating the UHI effect is an important research focus of the expanding capital city of the Henan province. In this study, the Landsat 8 image of July 2019 was selected from Landsat collection to obtain Land Surface Temperature (LST) by using Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method, and present land cover information by using spectral indices. Additionally, high-resolution Google Earth images were used to select 123 parks, grouped in five categories, to explore the impact factors on park cooling effect. Park Cooling Intensity (PCI) has been chosen as an indicator of the park cooling effect which will quantify its relation to park patch metrics. The results show that: (1) Among the five studied park types, the theme park category has the largest cooling effect while the linear park category has the lowest cooling effect; (2) The mean park LST and PCI of the samples are positively correlated with the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and with Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), but these are negatively correlated with the Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (NDISI). We can suppose that the increase of vegetation cover rate within water areas as well as the decrease of impervious surface in landscape planning and design will make future parks colder. (3) There is a correlation between the PCI and the park characteristics. The UHI effect could be mitigated by increasing of park size and reducing park fractal dimension (Frac_Dim) and perimeter-area ratio (Patario). (4) The PCI is influenced by the park itself and its surrounding area. These results will provide an important reference for future urban planning and urban park design to mitigate the urban heat island effect.

TI  - Chute cutoff-driven abandonment and sedimentation of meander bends along a fine-grained, non-vegetated, ephemeral river on the Bolivian Altiplano
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The origin and development of meandering river planforms has long been a focus of research in the geosciences. Most attention has focused on perennial meandering rivers with well developed riparian vegetation assemblages, and while increasing interest is turning towards the dynamics and sedimentology of ephemeral meandering rivers with sparse to no vegetation, additional field data are required. As a contribution, this study presents a remote-sensing and field-based analysis of chute cutoff-driven abandonment and sedimentation of meander bends along the fine-grained, non-vegetated, ephemeral Rio Colorado on the Bolivia Altiplano. Along the 25 km long sinuous study reach, located between 25 and 50 km upstream of the present-day margins of Salar de Uyuni, quasi-regular flood events (typically at least one per year) drive bend cutoffs and wider channel-floodplain dynamics, despite low specific stream power (<10 W/m(2)) and cohesive (dominantly silt and clay) bed and bank sediments. Along the reach, twenty-two cutoffs are evident, with chute cutoff the dominant mechanism. Three chute cutoffs (CC1, CC2, CC3) occurred between 1996 and 2016; for one bend (CC3), high-resolution (<0.65m) satellite imagery and field investigations reveal the details of pre-, mid- and post-chute cutoff processes and sedimentary products. Together, the findings suggest that for any given bend, an increase in bend amplitude (mean ratio of meander bend length to chute channel length similar to 4) combines with a typically high diversion angle between the channel-belt axis and the upstream limb of the meander bend (mean similar to 98 degrees) to result in declining flow efficiencies. This enhances overbank flooding and promotes deposition along the upstream limb of the bend. Overbank flooding promotes the development of chute channels, which commonly initiate as shallow (typically <1 m) headward eroding channels, while sediment derived from overbank flow and headward erosion tends to be deposited in the downstream limb of the bend. By obstructing flow, such deposition reduces sediment transport capacity within the meander bend as a whole, thereby further inducing deposition within the upstream limb. During subsequent floods, deepening and widening of a dominant chute channel and sedimentation and shallowing of the meander bend continues. Along the reach, episodic La Nina-driven flood events drive phases of more rapid bend migration and clusters of chute cutoffs. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of meandering river dynamics across the full range of Earth's conditions, and also may help to improve interpretations of Earth's pre-vegetation rivers and meandering fluvial forms on other planetary bodies.

TI  - Drivers to spatial and temporal dynamics of column integrated phytoplankton biomass in the shallow lake of Chaohu, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies is a major threat to the ecosystem services. Many studies have focused on using surface or near surface phytoplankton biomass to determine trophic status or bloom conditions. However, surface phytoplankton biomass can change quickly due to the vertical migration of phytoplankton. A more appropriate indicator is column integrated biomass which considers the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton. In this study, we estimated the spatial and temporal dynamics of column integrated biomass in a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake Chaohu in China, using a biomass estimation algorithm and fourteen years of satellite data. The built algorithm was validated by in situ datasets with a significant correlation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89, mean absolute relative difference, MARD = 25.97%, the root-mean-square error, RMSE = 20.17 mg.m(-2).We decomposed the temporal dynamics of the satellite-based time series into inter-annual trends, seasonal and irregular behaviors of biomass in different lake sections. We compared these individual dynamics to nutrients, meteorological and climate variables, in particular with respect to ongoing effort to manage nutrients in this complex lake and catchment. Nutrient concentrations were shown to be determinant in the inter-annual trends. Irregular variation of biomass was found to be sensitive to global climate change events (ENSO) which influence regional conditions of precipitation and temperature. By taking the vertical profile of phytoplankton into consideration, the derived temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton biomass, rather than surface biomass, provided new sights into lake conditions and were seen to be a good support for lake management efforts.

TI  - Carbon Dynamics in the Northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 1990 to 2030 Using Landsat Land Use/Cover Change Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) has an important impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The spatial distribution of regional carbon reserves can provide the scientific basis for the management of ecosystem carbon storage and the formulation of ecological and environmental policies. This paper proposes a method combining the CA-based FLUS model and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model to assess the temporal and spatial changes in ecosystem carbon storage due to land-use changes over 1990-2015 in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB). Furthermore, future ecosystem carbon storage is simulated and evaluated over 2020-2030 under three scenarios of natural growth (NG), cropland protection (CP), and ecological protection (EP). The long-term spatial variations in carbon storage in the QLB are discussed. The results show that: (1) Carbon storage in the QLB decreased at first (1990-2000) and increased later (2000-2010), with total carbon storage increasing by 1.60 Tg C (Teragram: a unit of mass equal to 10(12) g). From 2010 to 2015, carbon storage displayed a downward trend, with a sharp decrease in wetlands and croplands as the main cause; (2) Under the NG scenario, carbon reserves decrease by 0.69 Tg C over 2020-2030. These reserves increase significantly by 6.77 Tg C and 7.54 Tg C under the CP and EP scenarios, respectively, thus promoting the benign development of the regional ecological environment. This study improves our understanding on the impact of land-use change on carbon storage for the QLB in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).

TI  - The Sensitivity of Multi-spectral Satellite Sensors to Benthic Habitat Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reef ecosystems are under stress due to human-driven climate change and coastal activities. Satellite-based monitoring approaches offer an alternative to traditional field sampling measurements for detecting coral reef composition changes, especially given the advantages in their broad spatial coverage and high temporal frequency. However, the effect of benthic composition changes on water-leaving reflectance remains underexplored. In this study, we examined benthic change detection abilities of four representative satellite sensors: Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Planet Dove and SkySat. We measured the bottom reflectance of different benthic compositions (live coral, bleached coral, dead coral with algal cover, and sand) in the field and developed an analytical bottom-up radiative transfer model to simulate remote sensing reflectance at the water surface for different compositions at a variety of depths and in varying water clarity conditions. We found that green spectral wavelengths are best for monitoring benthic changes such as coral bleaching. Moreover, we quantified the advantages of high spatial resolution imaging for benthic change detection. Together, our results provide guidance as to the potential use of the latest generation of multi-spectral satellites for monitoring coral reef and other submerged coastal ecosystems.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: A 10,000 km(2) area of southwestern Ontario within the Lake Erie and Lake Ontario basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, Ontario, Canada, a humid northern hydrogeological setting with abundant precipitation and recharge, and a stable Paleozoic sedimentary bedrock overlain by galacial sediment forming a relatively uncompressible sedimentary succession.Study focus: Examing land surface deformation in southern Ontario and its connection with water storage change.New hydrological insights: The surface deformation, observed from a set of 48 Radarsat-2 InSAR images over five years from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2017 presents a subsidence trend of 1-10 mm/year and a seasonal variation of up to 20 mm over the region. The InSAR results are confirmed by the GPS measurements at six locations over the region. The surface deformations were compared to the water storage data derived from GRACE satellites, in-situ water levels of the Great Lakes, and precipitation data in the study area. The results indicate that the multi-year trend and seasonal variations in surface deformation are correlated to water storage changes, suggesting that the surface deformation in southern Ontario could be caused by water loading.

TI  - Optimal Inversion of Conversion Parameters from Satellite AOD to Ground Aerosol Extinction Coefficient Using Automatic Differentiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) plays an important role for high spatiotemporal-resolution estimation of fine particulate matter with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). However, the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites mainly measure column (integrated) AOD using the aerosol (extinction) coefficient integrated over all altitudes in the atmosphere, and column AOD is less related to PM2.5 than low-level or ground-based aerosol (extinction) coefficient (GAC). With recent development of automatic differentiation (AD) that has been widely applied in deep learning, a method using AD to find optimal solution of conversion parameters from column AOD to the simulated GAC is presented. Based on the computational graph, AD has considerably improved the efficiency in applying gradient descent to find the optimal solution for complex problems involving multiple parameters and spatiotemporal factors. In a case study of the Jing-Jin-Ji region of China for the estimation of PM2.5 in 2015 using the Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD, the optimal solution of the conversion parameters was obtained using AD and the loss function of mean square error. This solution fairly modestly improved the Pearson's correlation between simulated GAC and PM2.5 up to 0.58 (test R-2: 0.33), in comparison with three existing methods. In the downstream validation, the simulated GACs were used to reliably estimate PM2.5, considerably improving test R-2 up to 0.90 and achieving consistent match for GAC and PM2.5 in their spatial distribution and seasonal variations. With the availability of the AD tool, the proposed method can be generalized to the inversion of other similar conversion parameters in remote sensing.

TI  - Estimating Urban Vegetation Biomass from Sentinel-2A Image Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation biomass is a key indicator of the carbon storage and sequestration capacity and ecological effect of an urban ecosystem. Rapid and effective monitoring and measurement of urban vegetation biomass provide not only an understanding of urban carbon circulation and energy flow but also a basis for assessing the ecological function of urban forest and ecology. In this study, field observations and Sentinel-2A image data were used to construct models for estimating urban vegetation biomass in the case study of the east Chinese city of Xuzhou. Results show that (1) Sentinel-2A data can be used for urban vegetation biomass estimation; (2) compared with the Boruta based multiple linear regression models, the stepwise regression models-also multiple linear regression models-achieve better estimations (RMSE = 7.99 t/hm(2) for low vegetation, 45.66 t/hm(2) for broadleaved forest, and 6.89 t/hm(2) for coniferous forest); (3) the models for specific vegetation types are superior to the models for all-type vegetation; and (4) vegetation biomass is generally lowest in September and highest in January and December. Our study demonstrates the potential of the free Sentinel-2A images for urban ecosystem studies and provides useful insights on urban vegetation biomass estimation with such satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - Mapping the Land Cover of Africa at 10 m Resolution from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing based mapping of land cover at extensive scales, e.g., of whole continents, is still a challenging task because of the need for sophisticated pipelines that combine every step from data acquisition to land cover classification. Utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE), which provides a catalog of multi-source data and a cloud-based environment, this research generates a land cover map of the whole African continent at 10 m resolution. This land cover map could provide a large-scale base layer for a more detailed local climate zone mapping of urban areas, which lie in the focus of interest of many studies. In this regard, we provide a free download link for our land cover maps of African cities at the end of this paper. It is shown that our product has achieved an overall accuracy of 81% for five classes, which is superior to the existing 10 m land cover product FROM-GLC10 in detecting urban class in city areas and identifying the boundaries between trees and low plants in rural areas. The best data input configurations are carefully selected based on a comparison of results from different input sources, which include Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), Night Time Light (NTL) Data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST). We provide a further investigation of the importance of individual features derived from a Random Forest (RF) classifier. In order to study the influence of sampling strategies on the land cover mapping performance, we have designed a transferability analysis experiment, which has not been adequately addressed in the current literature. In this experiment, we test whether trained models from several cities contain valuable information to classify a different city. It was found that samples of the urban class have better reusability than those of other natural land cover classes, i.e., trees, low plants, bare soil or sand, and water. After experimental evaluation of different land cover classes across different cities, we conclude that continental land cover mapping results can be considerably improved when training samples of natural land cover classes are collected and combined from areas covering each Koppen climate zone.

TI  - Influence of Spatial Resolution and Retrieval Frequency on Applicability of Satellite-Predicted PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been widely used in estimating fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations near the surface at a regional scale, and perform well compared with ground measurements. However, the influence of limitations such as retrieval frequency and the spatial resolution of satellite AODs on the applicability of predicted PM2.5 values has been rarely considered. With three widely used MODIS AOD products, including Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT), here we evaluate the influence of their spatial resolution and sampling frequency by estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of northern China during 2017 utilizing a mixed effects model. The daily concentrations of PM2.5 derived from MAIAC, DB and DT AOD all have high correlations (R-2: 0.78, 0.8, and 0.78) with the observed values, but the predicted annual PM2.5 exhibits a distinct spatial distribution. DT estimation obviously underestimates annual PM2.5 in polluted areas due to lower sampling of heavy pollution events. By contrast, the retrieval frequency (similar to 40-60%) of MAIAC and DB AOD can represent well annual PM2.5 in nearly all 83 sites tested. However, MAIAC and DB-derived PM2.5 have a larger bias compared with observed values than DT, indicating that the large spatial variation of aerosol properties can exert an influence on the reliability of the statistical AOD-PM2.5 relationship. Also, there is notable difference between MAIAC and DB PM2.5 due to their different cloud screening methods. The MAIAC PM2.5 with high spatial resolution at 1 km can capture much finer hotpots than DB and DT at 10 km. Our results suggest that it is crucial to consider the applicability of satellite-predicted PM2.5 values derived from different aerosol products according to the specific requirements besides modeling the AOD-PM2.5 relationship.

T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of ocean data acquisition is increasing day by day. According to the differences in temporal-spatial resolution, space-time range, vertical layers, ocean data can be classified into various types. The understanding and effective application of existing ocean data are of great importance to economic development, national security, military activities, etc. Several major data sources of marine data released at home and abroad are summarized in this study. Several kinds of common ocean data are classified, including terrain depth data, satellite remote sensing data, ocean survey observation data, and reanalysis data. The temporal-spatial scale applicable to various types of data is analyzed. It aims to offer information support for scientific researchers in the marine field and provide reference for the construction of China's marine big data.

TI  - Forest dynamics in relation to meteorology and soil in the Gulf Coast of Mexico
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest dynamics is complex, and the complexity could be a synthetic result of climate change. Specifically studying 11 forest type groups of the Gulf of Mexico coast region defined, we intended to explore and model the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on underlying forest dynamics. This study utilized normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) as a measurement indicator of forest dynamics, referring to the dynamics of canopy structure and phenology of forests, and for a given type of forests, seasonal and yearly NDVI values were applied to the quantification of its growth across the Gulf Coast. By utilizing geographically weighted regression (GWR) method, we related normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to precipitation, temperature, and silt and clay fractions in the soil. This study demonstrated an explanatory power of soil, besides the common macroclimate factors of precipitation, temperature, on explaining forest dynamics, which also revealed that the presence of spatiotemporal heterogeneity would affect model performance. Our results indicated that the model performance varied by forest type groups and seasons. The meteorology-soil model presented the best overall fit performance for White/Red/Jack Pine forests concerning R-2 (0.952), adjusted R-2 (0.905), Akaike information criterion (AIC, -1100) and residual sum of squares (RSS, 0.053) values. The comparative analysis of model performance also indicated that the meteorology-soil model has the best fit of data in summer. This study advanced the understanding of forests dynamics under conditions of climate change by highlighting the significance of soil, which is a significant confounding variable influencing forest activities but is often missed in forest-climate dynamics analysis.

TI  - A New Geolocation Error Estimation Method in MWRI Data Aboard FY3 Series Satellites
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Known as input in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data have been widely distributed to the user community. Nevertheless, the current operational geolocation accuracy is still on the pixel scale due to the presence of geolocation uncertainty. In this letter, we propose a new method to estimate the geolocation errors in MWRI data. Compared to the traditional coastline inflection method (CIM), the proposed method has two innovations. First, we establish a surface fitting interpolation model by involving more observations to detect the coastline. Second, we employ the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to determine the correspondences between the detected coastline and the actual coastline. Simulated experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a more accurate geolocation error estimation than the CIM. By applying our method, we have processed an MWRI data set from January 1 to February 28 in 2016. The experimental results have shown that the operational FY-3C MWRI geolocation errors are 0.4813 and 0.4909 pixels in the along-track and cross-track directions, respectively, which can be significantly reduced to 0.1299 and 0.1497 pixels after the attitude correction. It means that the geolocation accuracy has an average improvement up to 70%.

TI  - Integrating Google Earth imagery with Landsat data to improve 30-m resolution land cover mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover maps provide fundamental information that has been used in different kinds of studies, ranging from climate change to city planning. However, despite substantial efforts in recent decades, large-scale 30-m land cover maps still suffer from relatively low accuracy in terms of land cover type discrimination (especially for the vegetation and impervious types), due to limits in relation to the data, method, and design of the workflow. In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 84.40% on the entire validation dataset in China, improving the previous state-of-the-art accuracies obtained by RF and SVM by 4.50% and 4.20%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km(2) confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating features of datasets at different resolutions and the possibility to produce more reliable land cover maps.

TI  - SFSDAF: An enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information for spatio-temporal image fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal image fusion methods have become a popular means to produce remotely sensed data sets that have both fine spatial and temporal resolution. Accurate prediction of reflectance change is difficult, especially when the change is caused by both phenological change and land cover class changes. Although several spatio-temporal fusion methods such as the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) directly derive land cover phenological change information (such as endmember change) at different dates, the direct derivation of land cover class change information is challenging. In this paper, an enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF) is proposed. By directly deriving the sub-pixel land cover class fraction change information the proposed method allows accurate prediction even for heterogeneous regions that undergo a land cover class change. In particular, SFSDAF directly derives fine spatial resolution endmember change and class fraction change at the date of the observed image pair and the date of prediction, which can help identify image reflectance change resulting from different sources. SFSDAF predicts a fine resolution image at the time of acquisition of coarse resolution images using only one prior coarse and fine resolution image pair, and accommodates variations in reflectance due to both natural fluctuations in class spectral response (e.g. due to phenology) and land cover class change. The method is illustrated using degraded and real images and compared against three established spatio-temporal methods. The results show that the SFSDAF produced the least blurred images and the most accurate predictions of fine resolution reflectance values, especially for regions of heterogeneous landscape and regions that undergo some land cover class change. Consequently, the SFSDAF has considerable potential in monitoring Earth surface dynamics.

TI  - Evidence of Fault Immaturity from Shallow Slip Deficit and Lack of Postseismic Deformation of the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.5 Jiuzhaigou Earthquake
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The M-w 6.5 Jiuzhaigou earthquake occurred on 8 August 2017 36 km west-southwest of Yongle, Sichuan, China. We use both ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from Sentinel-1 and coseismic offsets of four Global Positioning System sites to obtain the coseismic surface deformation field and invert for the fault geometry and slip distribution. Most slip of the left-lateral strike-slip earthquake occurred in the 3-10 km depth interval with a maximum slip of about 1 m and a large shallow slip deficit (SSD). An eight-month InSAR time-series analysis documents a lack of resolvable postseismic deformation, and inversions for the distribution of postseismic slip demonstrate the lack of shallow afterslip. We argue that the observations of a pronounced SSD and no early afterslip of the Jiuzhaigou earthquake are indicative of an immature fault and that all incipient young strike-slip faults likely feature a SSD. We would expect a complex rupture geometry with distributed coseismic failure in the uppermost part of the brittle crust during the fault-zone development. As faults mature, they straighten out, develop a localized fault-zone core, and the SSD diminishes. By calculating the static Coulomb stress change and nine-year viscoelastic stress change caused by the Wenchuan earthquake, we also show that the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake did not significantly affect the time of occurrence of the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake.

TI  - Regionalization of Coarse Scale Soil Moisture Products Using Fine-Scale Vegetation Indices-Prospects and Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a critical role in many hydrological, biological and biogeochemical processes. It is relevant to farmers, scientists, and policymakers for making effective land management decisions. However, coarse spatial resolution and complex interactions of microwave radiation with surface roughness and vegetation structure present limitations within active remote sensing products to directly monitor soil moisture variations with sufficient detail. This paper discusses a strategy to use vegetation indices (VI) such as greenness, water stress, coverage, vigor, and growth dynamics, derived from Earth Observation (EO) data for an indirect characterization of SSM conditions. In this regional-scale study of a wetland environment, correlations between the coarse Advanced SCATterometer-Soil Water Index (ASCAT-SWI or SWI) product and statistical measurements of four vegetation indices from higher resolution Sentinel-2 data were analyzed. The results indicate that the mean value of Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) correlates most strongly to the SWI and that the wet season vegetation traits show stronger linear relation to the SWI than during the dry season. The correlation between VIs and SWI was found to be independent of the underlying dominant vegetation classes which are not derived in real-time. Therefore, fine-scale vegetation information from optical satellite data convey the spatial heterogeneity missed by coarse synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived SSM products and is linked to the SSM condition underneath for regionalization purposes.

TI  - Coupling Land Use Analysis and Ecological Risk Assessment: A Study of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the ecological response of land use change is important for regional sustainable development and assists in understanding the profound consequences of this change. This paper proposes coupling a study of the evolution of land use with an assessment of ecological risk, based on a typical watershed in the hinterland of China's Three Gorges Reservoir area. Land use data for the Caotangxi watershed derived from Landsat images from 1990, 2000, 2004, and China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite data from 2010 and 2016 were used to identify ecological risk based on land use changes. The spatial interaction process between land use and ecological risk changes from 2 spatial scales of grid and terrain was analyzed using geographic information system technology and an ecological risk index. The study area's ecological risk index demonstrated at first a worsening trend and then improvement during the period from 1990 to 2016. During 2004, there was a turning point in ecological risk evolution; this was most apparent in zones with a slope of 15-25 and >25 degrees, as well as in the elevation zone between 300 and 1000 m. The proportion of serious-risk areas decreased sharply after 2010, and land function transformation resulted in improvement of ecological risk in the watershed during the 26 years from 1990 to 2016. Our study provides support for evaluating ecological risk trends and the development of land use transition theory in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. It is a typical description of land remediation and ecological restoration in this area.

TI  - Association of Indoor and Outdoor Air Pollution With Hand-Grip Strength Among Adults in Six Low- and Middle-Income Countries
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Air pollution has been associated with various health outcomes. Its effect on hand-grip strength, a measurement of the construct of muscle strength and health status, remains largely unknown.Methods: We used the survey data from 31,209 adults >= 50 years of age within Wave 1 of the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health in six low- and middle-income countries. The outdoor concentration of fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) was estimated using satellite data. Domestic fuel type and ventilation were used as indicators of indoor air pollution. We used multilevel linear regression models to examine the association between indoor and outdoor air pollution and hand-grip strength, as well as the potential effect modifiers.Results: We found inverse associations between both indoor and outdoor air pollution and hand-grip strength. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in 3 years' averaged concentrations of outdoor PM2.5 corresponded to 0.70 kg (95% CI: -1.26, -0.14) lower hand-grip strength; and compared with electricity/liquid/gas fuel users, those using solid fuels had lower hand-grip strength (beta = -1.25, 95% CI: -1.74, -0.75). However, we did not observe a statistically significant association between ventilation and hand-grip strength. We further observed that urban residents and those having a higher education level had a higher association between ambient PM2.5 and hand-grip strength, and men, young participants, smokers, rural participants, and those with lower household income had higher associations between indoor air pollution and hand-grip strength.Conclusion: This study suggests that both indoor and outdoor air pollution might be important risk factors of poorer health and functional status as indicated by hand-grip strength.

TI  - Ship Detection With Superpixel-Level Fisher Vector in High-Resolution SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel ship detection method in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In the proposed method, the superpixel is utilized as the basic processing cell. We propose a superpixel-level Fisher vector to characterize the difference between the target and clutter superpixel due to the strong discriminating ability of the Fisher vector. Besides feature extraction, the threshold determination is another key step in the detection scheme. We determine the threshold in a semisupervised way, which combines the advantages of both supervised and unsupervised methods. Based on the threshold, the target superpixels are discriminated and we obtain the final detection result. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows robust performance under low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) conditions. Experiments performed on both synthetic data and a TerraSAR-X image demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Evaluating the Role of Past Clinical Information on Risk Adjustment
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether incorporating historical clinical information beyond 1 year improves risk adjustment. Data Sources: Administrative data from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare (for veterans concurrently enrolled in Medicare) for fiscal years (FYs) 2011-2015. Study Design: We regressed total annual costs on Medicare hierarchical condition category indicators and risk scores for FY 2015 in both a concurrent and a prospective model using 5-fold cross-validation. Regressions were repeated incorporating clinical information from FY 2011 to 2015. Model fit was appraised using R-2 and mean squared predictive error (MSPE). Data Collection: All veterans affairs users (n=3,254,783) with diagnostic information FY 2011-2015. Principal Findings: In a concurrent model, adding additional years of historical clinical information (FY 2011-2014) did not result in substantive gains in fit (R-2 from 0.671 to 0.673) or predictive capability (MSPE from 1956 to 1950). In a prospective model, adding additional years of historical clinical information also did not result in substantive gains in fit (R-2 from 0.334 to 0.344) or predictive capability (MSPE from 3988 to 3940). Conclusion: Incorporating historical clinical information yielded no material gain in risk adjustment fit.

AB  - Purpose To report on the oncological outcome of organ-sparing surgery (OSS) compared to (total or partial) penectomy regarding recurrence patterns and survival in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis. Methods This was a retrospective study of all patients with penile SCC and eligible follow-up data of at least 2 years at our institution. Patients with tumors staged >= pT1G2 underwent invasive lymph node (LN) staging by dynamic sentinel-node biopsy or modified inguinal lymphadenectomy. Radical inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed when LNs were palpable at diagnosis and in those with a positive LN status after invasive nodal staging. Follow-up visits were assessed, and local, regional and distant recurrences were defined and analyzed. Results 55 patients were identified with a mean follow-up of 63.7 months. Surgical management was OSS in 26 patients (47.2%) and partial or total penectomy in 29 cases (52.8%). Histopathological staging was: pTis (12.7%), pTa (16.3%), pT1a (18.2%), pT1b (5.5%), pT2 (29.1%) and pT3 (18.2%), respectively. Patients in the penectomy group were significantly older (mean 68 vs. 62 years; p = 0.026) with a higher rate of advanced tumor stage (>= pT2: 44.8% vs. 11.5%; p = 0.002). The local recurrence rate was 42.3% (n = 11) following OSS compared to 10.3% (n = 3) after penectomy (p = 0.007). Kaplan-Meier curves showed no significant differences between the two groups regarding metastasis-free and overall survival. Conclusions OSS is associated with a higher local recurrence rate compared to penectomy, yet it has no negative impact on overall and metastasis-free survival.

TI  - Filling Gaps of Monthly Terra/MODIS Daytime Land Surface Temperature Using Discrete Cosine Transform Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in geophysical fields. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra provides an accurate LST dataset with global coverage and monthly series, but the monthly MODIS LST data are often obscured by clouds and other atmospheric disturbances and consequently exhibit significant data gaps at a global scale, resulting in a difficult interpretation of LST trends and climatological characteristics. In this paper, an effective and fast LST reconstruction method to fill data gaps in monthly MODIS LST is presented. The proposal combines the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the Penalized Least Square approach (PLS) together with the Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) criterion. It depends only on the spatial high-frequency information from original LST estimates and allows a fast and automatic filling process without the help of any other ancillary data. To analyze its performance, the method is applied to fill data gaps on three continents with synthetic random missing values introduced as validation sets. The statistical evaluation shows that this method is capable of filling a large number of missing values in MODIS LST datasets with very high accuracy. In addition, the trend differences between the original LST and reconstructed LST have assessed the significance by computing 95% confidence intervals for a time series of trend differences is examined. Simulated experiments show that data gaps with large missing counts lead to significant differences in trend patterns and the patterns on validation sets are well estimated by this method, which confirms that the filling process of MODIS LST is necessary and favorable results can be produced for substantial data gaps by the DCT-PLS method.

TI  - UNVI-Based Time Series for Vegetation Discrimination Using Separability Analysis and Random Forest Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover data is crucial for earth system modelling, natural resources management, and conservation planning. Remotely sensed time-series data capture dynamic behavior of vegetation, and have been widely used for land cover mapping. Temporal profiles of vegetation index (VI), especially normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are the most used features derived from time-series spectral data. Whether NDVI or EVI is optimal to generate temporal profiles has not been evaluated. The universal normalized vegetation index (UNVI), a relatively new index with all spectral bands incorporated, has been proved to be more effective than several commonly used satellite-derived VIs in some application scenarios. In this study, we explored the ability of UNVI time series for discriminating different vegetation types in Chaoyang prefecture, northeast China, in comparison with normalized NDVI, EVI, triangle vegetation index (TVI), and tasseled cap transformation greenness (TCG). These five indices were calculated using Landsat 8 surface reflectance data, and two comparative experiments were conducted. The first experiment analyzed class separabilities using pairwise JM (Jeffries-Matusita) distance as indicator, and the results showed that UNVI was superior to EVI, TVI, and TCG, and almost equivalent to NDVI, especially during the peak of vegetation growing season and for the most indistinguishable vegetation pair broadleaf and shrubs. The second experiment compared the vegetation classification accuracies using the features of these VI temporal profiles and the corresponding phenological parameters, and the results showed that UNVI can better classify the five major vegetation in Chaoyang prefecture than other four indices. Therefore, we conclude that UNVI time series has considerable potential for regional land cover mapping, and we recommend that the use of the UNVI is considered in the future time series related studies.

TI  - Recent Accelerating Glacier Mass Loss of the Geladandong Mountain, Inner Tibetan Plateau, Estimated from ZiYuan-3 and TanDEM-X Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The headwaters of many Asian rivers are at mountain glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau. Glacier melt-water is a non-negligible contributor of river runoff, especially for a drought year. However, the observation of mass glacier changes was scarce in recent years. Here, we estimated the recent glacier mass change of the Geladandong mountain, by differencing the digital elevation models (DEMs) produced from ZiYuan-3 images and TanDEM-X data. Moreover, we compared the SRTM-C DEM with TanDEM-X DEMs to retrieve glacier mass balances since 2000. The annual mass loss rates of -0.11 +/- 0.03 and -0.47 +/- 0.09 m w.e. yr(-1) were derived in 2000-2012 and 2012-2018, respectively. This result revealed an accelerating rate of negative glacier mass changes during recent years, which is mainly caused by the significant increase of mass loss over non-surge glaciers, rather than surge-type glaciers, which held a slight increase of mass loss. In addition, we found a pronounced discrepancy of glacier mass change between non-surge and surge-type glaciers during 2012-2018, and suggested that this difference may be caused by the heterogeneous responses of surge-type glaciers to climate variations, because of the different timing and type of surge events.

TI  - Glacial Lake Inventory and Lake Outburst Flood/Debris Flow Hazard Assessment after the Gorkha Earthquake in the Bhote Koshi Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) evolve into debris flows by erosion and sediment entrainment while propagating down a valley, which highly increases peak discharge and volume and causes destructive damage downstream. This study focuses on GLOF hazard assessment in the Bhote Koshi Basin (BKB), where was highly developed glacial lakes and was intensely affected by the Gorkha earthquake. A new 2016 glacial lake inventory was established, and six unreported GLOF events were identified with geomorphic outburst evidence from GaoFen-1 satellite images and Google Earth. A new method was proposed to assess GLOF hazard, in which large numbers of landslides triggered by earthquake were considered to enter into outburst floods enlarge the discharge and volume of debris flow in the downstream. Four GLOF hazard classes were derived according to glacial lake outburst potential and a flow magnitude assessment matrix, in which 11 glacial lakes were identified to have very high hazard and 24 to have high hazard. The GLOF hazard in BKB increased after the earthquake due to landslide deposits, which increased by 216.03 x 10(6) m(3), and provides abundant deposits for outburst floods to evolve into debris flows. We suggest that in regional GLOF hazard assessment, small glacial lakes should not be overlooked for landslide deposit entrainment along a flood route that would increase the peak discharge, especially in earthquake-affected areas where large numbers of landslides were triggered.

TI  - Monitoring of Fine-Scale Warm Drain-Off Water from Nuclear Power Stations in the Daya Bay Based on Landsat 8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the drain-off water from nuclear power stations by high-resolution remote sensing satellites is of great significance for ensuring the safe operation of nuclear power stations and monitoring environmental changes. In order to select the optimal algorithm for Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data to monitor warm drain-off water from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (DNPS) and the Ling Ao Nuclear Power Station (LNPS) located on the southern coast of China, this study applies the edge detection method to remove stripes and produces estimates of four Sea Surface Temperature (SST) inversion methods, the Radiation Transfer Equation Method (RTM), the Single Channel algorithm (SC), the Mono Window algorithm (MW) and the Split Window algorithm (SW), using the buoy and Minimum Orbit Intersection Distances (MOIDS) SST data. Among the four algorithms, the SST from the SW algorithm is the most consistent with the buoy, the MODIS SST, the ERA-Interim and the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST). Based on the SST retrieved from the SW algorithm, the tidal currents calculated by the Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and winds from ERA-Interim, the distribution of the warm drain-off from the two nuclear power stations is analyzed. First, warm drain-off water is mainly distributed in a fan-shaped area from the two nuclear power stations to the center of the Daya Bay. The SST of the warm drain-off is about 1-4 degrees C higher than the surrounding water and exceeds 6 degrees C at the drain-off outfall. Second, the tide determines the shape and distribution characteristics of the warm drain-off area. The warm drain-off water flows to the northeast during the flood tide. During the ebb tide, the warm drain-off water flows toward the southwest direction as the tide flows toward the bay mouth, forming a fan-shaped area. Moreover, the temperature increase intensity in the combined discharge channel during the flood tide is lower than that during the ebb tide, and the low temperature rising area during the flood tide is smaller than that during the ebb tide.

TI  - High-Resolution Reconstruction of the Maximum Snow Water Equivalent Based on Remote Sensing Data in a Mountainous Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the accurate estimation of the maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountainous areas is an important topic. In this study, in order to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of SWE reconstruction in alpine regions, the Sentinel-2(MSI) and Landsat 8(OLI) satellite data with the spatial resolution of tens of meters are used instead of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data so that the pixel mixing problem is avoided. Meanwhile, geostationary satellite-based and topographic-corrected incoming shortwave radiation is used in the restricted degree-day model to improve the accuracy of radiation inputs. The seasonal maximum SWE accumulation of a river basin in the winter season of 2017-2018 is estimated. The spatial and temporal characteristics of SWE at a fine spatial and temporal resolution are then analyzed. And the results of reconstruction model with different input parameters are compared. The results showed that the average maximum SWE of the study area in 2017-2018 was 377.83 mm and the accuracy of snow cover, air temperature and the radiation parameters all affects the maximum SWE distribution on magnitude, elevation and aspect. Although the accuracy of other forcing parameters still needs to be improved, the estimation of the local maximum snow water equivalent in mountainous areas benefits from the application of high-resolution Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data. The joint usage of high-resolution remote sensing data from different satellites can greatly improve the temporal and spatial resolution of snow cover and the spatial resolution of SWE estimation. This method can provide more accurate and detailed SWE for hydrological models, which is of great significance to hydrology and water resources research.

TI  - Analysis of the optimal operating wavelength of spaceborne oceanic lidar
T2  - CHINESE OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne lidar is a promising tool for vertical ocean profile detection, which has attracted extensive attention in oceanic optical remote sensing technology. It is essential to evaluate the operating wavelength of spaceborne oceanic lidar to ensure that it is effective. In this paper, the optimal operating wavelength of spaceborne oceanic lidar for the purposes of global ocean detection was analyzed in terms of detection depth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The global distribution of ocean detection depths and the corresponding wavelengths were estimated by using the oceanic optical properties data from MODIS. The SNR was evaluated based on the characteristics of the solar Fraunhofer line. It was found that ocean water with an optimal wavelength of 488 nm accounts for about 70% of the global ocean area and more than 95% of the global ocean area has a detected depth deeper than 0.8 times the depth of the euphotic layer. Furthermore, 70% of background light can be suppressed with a filter against the 0.1 nm bandwidth at the 486.134 nm solar Fraunhofer line and the SNR can be increased by about 5.0% compared to that of the 488 nm. In conclusion. working at 486.134 nm can effectively improve the detection depth and the SNR, so it is the optimal operating wavelength of spaceborne oceanic lidar.

TI  - DeepSat V2: feature augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image classification is a challenging problem that lies at the crossroads of remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Due to the high variability inherent in satellite data, most of the current object classification approaches are not suitable for handling satellite datasets. The progress of satellite image analytics has also been inhibited by the lack of a single labeled high-resolution dataset with multiple class labels. In a preliminary version of this work, we introduced two new high resolution satellite imagery datasets (SAT-4 and SAT-6) and proposed DeepSat framework for classification based on "handcrafted" features and a deep belief network (DBN). The present paper is an extended version, we present an end-to-end framework leveraging an improved architecture that augments a convolutional neural network (CNN) with handcrafted features (instead of using DBN-based architecture) for classification. Our framework, having access to fused spatial information obtained from handcrafted features as well as CNN feature maps, have achieved accuracies of 99.90\% and 99.84\% respectively, on SAT-4 and SAT-6, surpassing all the other state-of-the-art results. A statistical analysis based on Distribution Separability Criterion substantiates the robustness of our approach in learning better representations for satellite imagery.

TI  - Diagnosing spatial biases and uncertainties in global fire emissions inventories: Indonesia as regional case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Models of atmospheric composition rely on fire emissions inventories to reconstruct and project impacts of biomass burning on air quality, public health, climate, ecosystem dynamics, and land-atmosphere exchanges. Many such global inventories use satellite measurements of active fires and/or burned area from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, differences across inventories in the interpretation of satellite imagery, the emissions factors assumed for different components of smoke, and the adjustments made for small and obscured fires can result in large regional differences in fire emissions estimates across inventories. Using Google Earth Engine, we leverage 15 years (2003-2017) of MODIS observations and 6 years (2012-2017) of observations from the higher spatial resolution Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor to develop metrics to quantify five major sources of spatial bias or uncertainty in the inventories: (1) primary reliance on active fires versus burned area, (2) cloud/haze burden on the ability of satellites to "see" fires, (3) fragmentation of burned area, (4) roughness in topography, and (5) small fires, which are challenging to detect. Based on all these uncertainties, we devise comprehensive "relative fire confidence scores," mapped globally at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution over 2003-2017.We then focus on fire activity in Indonesia as a case study to analyze how the choice of a fire emissions inventory affects model estimates of smoke-induced health impacts across Equatorial Asia. We use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and apply emissions of particulate organic carbon and black carbon (OC + BC smoke) from five global inventories: Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4s), Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1.5), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2), Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFEDv2.5r1), and Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEERv1.0-G1.2). We find that modeled monthly smoke PM2.5 in Singapore from 2003 to 2016 correlates with observed smoke PM2.5, with r ranging from 0.64-0.84 depending on the inventory. However, during the burning season (July to October) of high fire intensity years (e.g., 2006 and 2015), the magnitude of mean Jul-Oct modeled smoke PM2.5 can differ across inventories by > 20 mu g m(-3) (> 500%). Using the relative fire confidence metrics, we deduce that uncertainties in this region arise primarily from the small, fragmented fire landscape and very poor satellite observing conditions due to clouds and thick haze at this time of year. Indeed, we find that modeled smoke PM2.5 using GFASv1.2, which adjusts for fires obscured by clouds and thick haze and accounts for peatland emissions, is most consistent with observations in Singapore, as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Finally, we develop an online app called FIRECAM for end-users of global fire emissions inventories. The app diagnoses differences in emissions among the five inventories and gauges the relative uncertainty associated with satellite-observed fires on a regional basis.

TI  - Time Series Remote Sensing Data-Based Identification of the Dominant Factor for Inland Lake Surface Area Change: Anthropogenic Activities or Natural Events?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lake variations are considered sensitive indicators of global climate change. However, human activity is playing as a more and more important role in inland lake area variations. Therefore, it is critical to identify whether anthropogenic activity or natural events is the dominant factor in inland lake surface area change. In this study, we proposed a method that combines the Douglas-Peucker simplification algorithm and the bend simplification algorithm to locate major lake surface area disturbances. These disturbances were used to extract the features that been used to classify disturbances into anthropogenic or natural. We took the nine lakes in Yunnan Province as test sites, a 31-year long (from 1987 to 2017) time series Landsat TM/OLI images and HJ-1A/1B used as data sources, the official records were used as references to aid the feature extraction and disturbance identification accuracy assessment. Results of our method for disturbance location and disturbance identification could be concluded as follows: (1) The method can accurately locate the main lake changing events based on the time series lake surface area curve. The accuracy of this model for segmenting the time series of lake surface area in our study area was 94.73%. (2) Our proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 87.75%, with an F-score of 85.71 for anthropogenic disturbances and an F-score of 88.89 for natural disturbances. (3) According to our results, lakes in Yunnan Province of China have undergone intensive disturbances. Human-induced disturbances occurred almost twice as much as natural disturbances, indicating intensified disturbances caused by human activities. This inland lake area disturbance identification method is expected to uncover whether a disturbance to inland lake area is human activity-induced or a natural event, and to monitor whether disturbances of lake surface area are intensified for a region.

TI  - Impact of Climate Extremes on Suitability Dynamics for Japanese Scallop Aquaculture in Shandong, China and Funka Bay, Japan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of extreme weather events on suitable sites for aquaculture could help in establishing sustainable coastal environmental resource management. Japanese scallop culture is an economically important marine farming activity in the coastal communities of Shandong, China and Funka Bay, Japan. In this study, we improved the suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) by using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data instead of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, as a complementary source for higher temporal and spatial resolution data that are useful for monitoring fine-scale coastal and oceanic processes. We also applied the newly developed SASSM to the Japanese scallop production site along the Shandong coast. Finally, we analyzed the correlations between environmental factors (chlorophyll a concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), and total suspended sediment), meteorological factors (precipitation, temperature, and wind), and climatic events (winter East Asian monsoon (EAM) and El Nino/La Nina Southern Oscillation), and the impacts of climate events on suitable zones for scallop aquaculture. The new SASSM maps show that GOCI products have the potential for oceanographic investigations in Shandong, China and Funka Bay, Japan. Our results highlighted higher aquaculture site suitability for scallop in Funka Bay than in Shandong coast. During the winter with a strong EAM (2011), the suitable area for Japanese scallop aquaculture increased. Conversely, in the winter during a strong El Nino (2016), we found fewer areas that were highly suitable for scallop aquaculture in Funka Bay. SST was extremely low in Funka Bay during spring and summer 2017, which caused fewer highly suitable areas (scores of 7 and 8) for scallop aquaculture relative to other years. These findings suggest that extreme climatic events significantly impact the availability of suitable sites for marine farming and thus, should be considered in the development and design of coastal aquaculture sites.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of China's grassland NPP and its driving factors.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland NPP in China from 2000 to 2015 was simulated based on the CASA model, incorporated with MODIS and meteorological data. Trend analysis, coefficient of variation and Hurst index were used to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics, stability and persistence of grassland NPP. The main influencing factors of grassland NPP change in China were identified. The results showed that grassland NPP increased significantly from 2000 to 2015, with an average change rate of 1.53 g C " m-2 " a-1. Grassland NPP changed abruptly after 2011, with an obvious increase trend. Grassland NPP showed spatial heterogeneity, being lower in Northwest and higher in Southeast China. Areas with low NPP value were concentrated in most areas of Tibet Plateau and central Inner Mongolia. The area with increased grassland NPP accounted for 81.21% of the total grassland area, mainly distributed in the central region of Tibet Plateau and most areas of Loess Plateau. The regions with stable grassland NPP were mainly concentrated in Gannan region of Gansu Province and most of eastern Qinghai Province, while the unstable regions were mainly distributed in most areas of Tibet Plateau, central part and Hulunbuir of Inner Mongolia. The result of Hurst index analysis showed that grassland NPP in northern Xinjiang and most regions of Loess Plateau would continue to increase or decrease, while the future change of grassland NPP in southern Qinghai, central Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang would be anti-sustainable. The average NPP values of alpine and subalpine meadow and meadow were 578.8 and 565.31 g C " m(-2) . a(-1), respectively, while that of desert grassland was 122.61 g C . m(-2) . a(-1). The increase in grassland NPP in most areas of China is mainly controlled by precipitation, while the increased temperature has a certain inhibition on grassland NPP. Human activities such as the reduction of overgrazing and the implementation of returning farmland to grassland exert important influence over the increases of grassland NPP.

TI  - Attribution analyses of evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity changes in Ziya-Daqing basins, China during 2001-2015
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ETa) and gross primary productivity (GPP) are two of the key flux indices in a basin system. This study investigated the evolutions of ETa and GPP and the contributions of climate variables and vegetation index over multiple land cover types, simulated by the VIP model (Vegetation Interfaces Processes, RS version) with Terra-Modis 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset in the Ziya-Daqing basins (ZDB), China, during 2001-2015. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used to analyze the changes in ETa and GPP. Contributions to the variations of ETa and GPP were explored using a differential equation method. The analyses revealed that ETa and GPP were high in the eastern plain, and spatial distributions were mainly associated with distributions of the major land-cover types. ETa and GPP showed positive trends in the western Taihang Mountains and negative trends in the eastern plain region. The annual ETa and GPP increased from 2001 to 2015 in most land-use types except cropland and urban. The decreases in ETa and GPP were primarily attributed to solar dimming in cropland and urban. The increases in ETa and GPP mainly occurred in the natural land-cover types (e.g., mixed forest and grassland) as a tradeoff between the positive effect of greening and the negative effect of declined radiation. In ZDB, the contributions of net radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and leaf area index to the change in ETa were - 0.681%, - 0.379%, - 0.032%, and 1.442%, respectively. The contributions of net short-wave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation to the change in GPP were - 2.411%, 0.085%, - 0.020%, and 10.224%, respectively. Thus, the "greening" was the major reason for ETa and GPP increases in natural vegetations, whereas solar dimming was the major reason for ETa and GPP decreases in cropland.

TI  - Land Cover Trends in South Texas (1987-2050): Potential Implications for Wild Felids
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rio Grande Delta and surrounding rangelands in Texas has become one of the fastest urbanizing regions in the United States over the last 35 years. We assessed how land cover trends contributed to the large-scale processes that have driven land cover change since 1987. We classified LANDSAT imagery from 1987 to 2016 to quantify different rates of land cover change and used housing density scenarios to project changes in the amount and spatial distribution of woody cover until 2050 and its potential impact on wild felid habitat. Since 1987, woody cover increased from 3.9% along with patch and edge density, whereas mean patch area and Euclidean nearest neighbor decreased. Closer inspection revealed that woody encroachment of small patches (<1 ha) was the leading cause of woody cover increase by a magnitude of 4, with an observed significant skewness and kurtosis in the frequency distribution of patch size across years. By 2050, urbanization will be the dominant landscape type and at least 200 km(2) of woody cover may be lost, thereby affecting felid populations in South Texas. These results provide important information for predicting future woody cover fragmentation and its potential impact on the connectivity of wild felid populations.

TI  - Spectral Imagery Tensor Decomposition for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Data through Fully Convolutional Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims at addressing two issues simultaneously: data compression at input space and semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed multi- or hyperspectral images through deep learning (DL) artificial neural networks (ANN) delivers as output the corresponding matrix of pixels classified elementwise, achieving competitive performance metrics. With technological progress, current remote sensing (RS) sensors have more spectral bands and higher spatial resolution than before, which means a greater number of pixels in the same area. Nevertheless, the more spectral bands and the greater number of pixels, the higher the computational complexity and the longer the processing times. Therefore, without dimensionality reduction, the classification task is challenging, particularly if large areas have to be processed. To solve this problem, our approach maps an RS-image or third-order tensor into a core tensor, representative of our input image, with the same spatial domain but with a lower number of new tensor bands using a Tucker decomposition (TKD). Then, a new input space with reduced dimensionality is built. To find the core tensor, the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) algorithm is used. A fully convolutional network (FCN) is employed afterwards to classify at the pixel domain, each core tensor. The whole framework, called here HOOI-FCN, achieves high performance metrics competitive with some RS-multispectral images (MSI) semantic segmentation state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing computational complexity, and thereby, processing time. We used a Sentinel-2 image data set from Central Europe as a case study, for which our framework outperformed other methods (included the FCN itself) with average pixel accuracy (PA) of 90% (computational time similar to 90s) and nine spectral bands, achieving a higher average PA of 91.97% (computational time similar to 36.5s), and average PA of 91.56% (computational time similar to 9.5s) for seven and five new tensor bands, respectively.

TI  - An Aircraft Wetland Inundation Experiment Using GNSS Reflectometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In early May of 2017, a flight campaign was conducted over Caddo Lake, Texas, to test the ability of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) to detect water underlying vegetation canopies. This paper presents data from that campaign and compares them to Sentinel-1 data collected during the same week. The low-altitude measurement allows for a more detailed assessment of the forward-scattering GNSS-R technique, and at a much higher spatial resolution, than is possible using currently available space-based GNSS-R data. Assumptions about the scattering model are verified, as is the assumption that the surface spot size is approximately the Fresnel zone. The results of this experiment indicate GNSS signals reflected from inundated short, thick vegetation, such as the giant Salvinia observed here, results in only a 2.15 dB loss compared to an open water reflection. GNSS reflections off inundated cypress forests show a 9.4 dB loss, but still 4.25 dB above that observed over dry regions. Sentinel-1 data show a 6-dB loss over the inundated giant Salvinia, relative to open water, and are insensitive to standing water beneath the cypress forests, as there is no difference between the signal over inundated cypress forests and that over dry land. These results indicate that, at aircraft altitudes, forward-scattered GNSS signals are able to map inundated regions even in the presence of dense overlying vegetation, whether that vegetation consists of short plants or tall trees.

TI  - Detection of Occult Metastases in Patients with T1 and T2 Stage Lower Lip Squamous Cell Carcinomas after Positive Lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to detect lower lip squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that had metastasized to the lymph nodes and to evaluate if neck dissection was necessary for patients with T1 or T2-stage lip cancer after a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The study was conducted as a prospective clinical study to detect occult neck metastases in patients with T1 or T2 stage SCC of the lower lip. Thirty-one patients were eligible and underwent echo-ultrasound, computer tomography, magnetic resonance and lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) as diagnostic procedures. LSG was performed on the same day as the surgical procedure, after intradermal injection of 37 Mbq Tc99m-Sn-colloid/mL at four peritumoral sites. In patients with positive LSG results, the sentinel lymph nodes were extracted surgically. The risk factors for cancer development were sun exposure and smoking. The highest accuracy for detecting lymph node enlargements was achieved with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 80.7%). LSG showed excellent sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (NPV; 100%). Overall, occult metastases were diagnosed with an SLNB in eight (25.8%) patients. According to the results, with great caution, we suggest that an SLNB is reasonable to initiate only for patients with positive sentinel nodes by positive LSG, to be used as a lower morbidity approach for selected patients with T1 and T2 stage cancers.

TI  - Influences of Topographic Factors on Outcomes of Forest Programs and Policies in a Mountain Region of China: A Case Study
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, the successive government has implemented ambitious programs and policies to reverse the decline in forest cover. As an essential source of freshwater and an ecological barrier for Beijing, Zhangjiakou City has implemented several forest expansion strategies. Topographic conditions in this mountainous area have generated spatially heterogeneous afforestation outcomes. Quantifying the impact of these conditions on implemented forest programs could improve ecological restoration strategies of Chinese mountain areas. Using remotely sensed data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, we generated land cover data to identify forest cover changes in Zhangjiakou City in 1989, 2000, and 2015. Forest cover data, topographic information (elevation, slope, aspect, land relief, and terrain niches), and spatial statistical models (geographically weighted regression [GWR]) were used to analyze re- and afforestation over 2 periods (1989-2000 and 2000-2015). The results show that forest cover in Zhangjiakou City increased by one third from 1989 to 2015. The rate of afforestation from 2000 to 2015 was 4 times the rate observed between 1989 and 2000. A trend toward gradual afforestation of higher-elevation and gentler-slope areas and land relief and terrain niche zones was observed between the 2 periods. Expansion mostly occurred in grasslands, arable lands, and unused lands. Elevation, slope, and land relief were the dominant topographic factors influencing forest cover change. Such factors influenced afforestation directly through their effect on microclimates and local biophysical conditions and indirectly by limiting the geographic area where forest programs could be implemented. Terrain niche was also an important predictor of forest cover change under complex topographic conditions. The GWR results indicate heterogeneous forest cover change processes across the study area. Our analysis could guide the implementation of effective forest expansion programs and policies, particularly for degraded mountain ecosystems.

TI  - Did Government Expenditure on the Grain for Green Project Help the Forest Carbon Sequestration Increase in Yunnan, China?
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Reasonably assessing the effectiveness of government expenditure on the Grain for Green project (GFG) in providing forest carbon sequestration would contribute to the development of China's forest carbon sequestration. Using the government expenditure data from the GFG in Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2015 and the MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) time-series datasets, we calculated the forest carbon sequestration of various counties (cities or districts). The impacts of GFG government expenditure on forest carbon sequestration were empirically evaluated by the least squares dummy variables method (LSDV). The research results indicate that a 1% increase in government expenditure on the GFG yielded a 0.0364% increase in forest carbon sequestration. However, the effects of GFG government expenditure on forest carbon sequestration differed greatly in different areas because of the diversity of the natural environments, forest resource endowment, and government policies. If the initial forest endowment was not considered, the effectiveness of government expenditure on the GFG in providing forest carbon sequestration would have been overestimated. This study argues that, to improve the efficiency of GFG government expenditure in Yunnan Province, more investment should be made in regions with positive regression coefficients that have passed the significance t-test, such as Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in the northwest, Baoshan City in the west, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in the south, and Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the east.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Data Reveal Scale-Dependent and System-Specific Strengths of Urban Heat Island Determinants
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban natural surfaces and non-surface human activities are key factors determining the urban heat island (UHI), but their relative importance remains highly controversial and may vary at different spatial scales and focal urban systems. However, systematic studies on the scale-dependency system-specificity remain largely lacking. Here, we selected 32 major Chinese cities as cases and used Landsat 8 images to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) and quantify natural surface variables using point of interest (POI) data as a measure of the human activity variable and using multiple regression and relative weight analysis to study the contribution and relative importance of these factors to LST at a range of grain sizes (0.25-5 km) and spatial extents (20-60 km). We revealed that the contributions and relative importance of natural surfaces and human activities are largely scale-dependent and system-specific. Natural surfaces, especially vegetation cover, are often the most important UHI determinants for a majority of scales, but the importance of non-surface human activities is increasingly pronounced at a coarser spatial scale with respect to both grain and spatial extent. The scaling relations of the UHI determinants and their relative importance were mostly linear-like at the city-collective level, but highly diverse across individual cities, so reducing non-surface heat emissions could be the most effective measure in particular cases, especially at relatively large spatial scales. This study advances the understanding of UHI formation mechanisms and highlights the complexity of the scale issue underpinning the UHI effect.

TI  - Structural characterisation of mangrove forests achieved through combining multiple sources of remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal information on mangrove extent, age, structure and biomass provides an important contribution towards understanding the role of these ecosystems in terms of the services they provide (e.g., in relation to storage of carbon, conservation biodiversity), particularly given the diversity of influences of human activity and natural events and processes. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Perak Province, Peninsular Malaysia, this study aimed to retrieve comprehensive information on the biophysical properties of mangroves from spaceborne optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to support better understanding of their dynamics in a managed setting. For the period 1988 to 2016 (29 years), forest age was estimated on at least an annual basis by combining time-series of Landsat-derived Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Japanese L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The NDMI was further used to retrieve canopy cover (%). Interferometric Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) X/C-band (2000), TanDEM-X-band (2010-2016) and stereo WorldView-2 stereo (2016) data were evaluated for their role in estimating canopy height (CH), from which above ground biomass (AGB, Mg ha(-1)) was derived using pre-established allometry. Whilst both L-band HH and HV data increased with AGB after about 8-10 years of growth, retrieval was compromised by mixed scattering from varying amounts of dead woody debris following clearing and wood material within regenerating forests, thinning of trees at similar to 15 and 20 years, and saturation of L-band SAR data after approximately 20 years of growth. Reference was made to stereo Phantom-3 DJI stereo imagery to support estimation of canopy cover (CC) and validation of satellite-derived CH. AGB estimates were compared with ground-based measurements. Using relationships with forest age, both CH and AGB were estimated for each date of Landsat or L-band SAR observation and the temporal trends in L-band SAR were shown to effectively track the sequences of clearing and regeneration. From these, four stages of the harvesting cycle were defined. The study provided new information on the biophysical properties and growth dynamics of mangrove forests in the MMFR, inputs for future monitoring activities, and methods for facilitating better characterisation and mapping of mangrove areas worldwide.

TI  - Combining Indocyanine Green and Tc<SUP>99</SUP>-nanocolloid does not increase the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes in early stage cervical cancer compared to Indocyanine Green alone
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To investigate whether combining two independent tracers increases the SLN-detection rate in cervical cancer.Methods. Consecutive women with early stage cervical cancer planned for a robotic radical hysterectomy or a robotic radical trachelectomy with sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection were included. After cervical injections of Indocyanine green (ICG) and Tc-99-nanocolloid (Tc-99), near-infrared fluorescence imaging and a gamma probe were used to identify SLNs in the upper and lower paracervical pathways (UPP/LPP). A strict surgical algorithm was adhered to and the SLNs were defined as SLN-ICG, SLN-ICG+Tc-99 or SLN-Tc-99. In FIGO-stage >= IA2 cancers a full pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) was performed after detection of SLNs. The primary endpoint was the SLN detection rate per tracer and combination of tracers. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity and mapping rates of the SLN algorithm per tracer and combination of tracers.Results. In the sixty-five analyzed women, the bilateral mapping rate was 98.5% for ICG and 60% for Tc-99 (p < 0.01). Combining the tracers did not increase the bilateral detection rate. In three women (5%) Tc-99 identified ICG-negative non-metastatic SLNs without impact on the bilateral detection rate. Eight women (12%) had lymph node metastases (LNMs), all had at least one metastatic SLN. Seven (35%) of the 20 metastatic SLNs were detected by ICG only and 12 (60%) were ICG and Tc-99 positive.Conclusion. SLN detection rate was significantly higher using ICG compared with Tc-99. ICG identified all patients with LNMs. Combining ICG and Tc-99 did not improve the bilateral detection rate of SLNs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of Aerosol-Corrected Surface Solar Irradiance at Local Incidence Angle over Different Physiographic Subdivisions of India and Adjoining Areas Using MODIS and SRTM Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface solar irradiance is considered as an important component of the surface radiation budget and constitutes one of the essential climate variables. In the present study, clear-sky instantaneous solar irradiance was estimated over 15 physiographic regions of India during January. Dewpoint temperature profiles were extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the Aqua satellite to calculate actual vapor pressure following Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which was further used in the Zillman parameterization for solar irradiance. The effect of terrain slope and aspect on direct radiation was taken into account by modifying the parameterized incoming shortwave flux by introducing the local incidence angle. A significant positive correlation was found between terrain-corrected MODIS irradiance and measured radiation data but the RMSE was very high (187 W m(-2)). Further, the effect of aerosol extinction was introduced by multiplying the terrain-corrected flux by a transmission factor obtained from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth and angstrom ngstrom exponent. Due to the inclusion of the aerosol transmittance, the correlation was significantly improved (R-2 = 0.84) and RMSE was reduced (31 W m(-2)). Further the effect of surface orientation on surface irradiance was evaluated on six hilly subdivisions. A large variation in the flux (135 to 161 W m(-2)) was noticed among different aspect classes. The variability was highest in the Eastern Himalayas subdivision (>250 W m(-2)) and was a minimum in the Eastern Hills subdivision (<28 W m(-2)). In absence of ground radiation data in hills, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), was used for validation of model output but it performed poorly and got saturated at higher surface irradiance values.

TI  - A New Baseline Linear Combination Algorithm for Generating Urban Digital Elevation Models With Multitemporal InSAR Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data presents one major limitation for deformation mapping using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques with high-spatial-resolution radar imagery (e.g., TerraSAR-X). This article presents a baseline linear combination (BLC) approach to generate interferograms with nearly zero baselines so as to minimize the effects of the uncertainties in the DEM used. It incorporates the baseline combination (BC) method with adjacent gradient networking to successfully unwrap the interferograms even in abruptly discontinuous areas, which in turn can be used to estimate a high-resolution DEM. The BLC approach does not require any deformation model; instead, it utilizes nearly zero-baseline interferograms to assist with 3-D phase unwrapping. Application of the BLC approach to the TerraSAR-X data set in Shenzhen, China, shows that the BLC-derived DEM agrees with the digital surface model (DSM) obtained from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.05 m, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BLC approach. Note that the BLC approach is not only able to be employed in urban areas with high buildings but also in mountain areas with steep slopes.

TI  - Increasing Water Levels of Global Lakes Between 2003 and 2009
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential indicator of climatic and environmental change, water levels of lakes are sensitive to various natural factors and anthropogenic activities from local to global scales. Understanding the global lake water level change can help to uncover the earth's water resource change and its response to the potential drivers. To date, most studies on lake water level changes were performed at local and regional scales. However, comprehensive information on the magnitude of lake water level changes at a global scale remains poorly understood. Here, with the help of the lake polygons from the global lakes and wetlands database (GLWD) at a global scale, we analyzed all available Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data to estimate the change in water levels of 14 981 lakes with areas greater than 0.1 km2 and reservoirs with storage capacities greater than 0.5 km3 around the world. We found global lakes exhibiting a significant spatial heterogeneity with 58.68% increase and 41.32% decrease in water levels during 2003 and 2009. The average change rate of global lake levels is 0.013 m/yr. We discovered an obvious and broad lake level increase in North America and Siberia region, Tibetan Plateau, and the Amazon basin. Our results provide detailed satellite-based evidence of the global increase in lake levels. In the future, more works should be conducted to estimate the lake level change at a longer temporal scale using multi-source satellite data and investigate the potential drivers under the climate warming and growing human footprint.

TI  - Drought and fires influence the respiratory diseases hospitalizations in the Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation decline and vegetation fires in the Amazon region associated with climate change and deforestation expose local communities to hazardous air quality that may lead to damages in human health such as diseases of the respiratory system. Since 2000, drought incidence over the Amazon has been observed at a higher frequency than during the last century, and the effects of the drier climate and fires on human health remain uncertain. Understanding the roles played by precipitation decline and fire activity as well as associated changes of atmospheric parameters on the incidence of respiratory diseases hospitalizations (RDH) is a very complex task, and it is likely that the relative importance of those factors depends on the temporal and spatial variability used in the analysis. This work aims at serving as an updated reference that covers the impact of fire incidence on respiratory diseases in Porto Velho, the third most populated city of Brazilian Amazon, with emphasis on drought events from 2000 to 2016. For this purpose, we compare remote sensing data, meteorological variables and health indicators, that include RDH, in particular for children under five years old (RDH5) and people aged more than sixty (RDH60), as well as Asthma and Bronchitis hospitalizations. Here we show an increase of 27% in RDH (except for Asthma that decreased 75%) in drought years as described by the positive (negative for Asthma) relationship with rainfall. Rainfall and humidity exert a primary control in diseases of the respiratory system in the region. Hotspots, burned areas and smoke concentrate in August and September, and have a secondary influence of fire on RDH. Smoke production is strongly related to fire and temperature, which are associated with an increase in the number of hospitalizations during the fire season. RDH5 and RDH60 are respectively 11 and 22 times higher than RDH (for all ages), confirming the higher vulnerability for children and elderlies. Based on the observed data, we highlight the role of regional precipitation trends in driving respiratory hospitalizations, which are crucial ecological indicators for humans in the context of climate change.

TI  - Automated training sample definition for seasonal burned area mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of environmental change can benefit from the increasing availability of multitemporal satellite imagery, and efficient and effective analysis tools are needed to generate relevant spatio-temporal land cover datasets. We present a data driven approach for automatic training sample selection to support supervised spatio-temporal mapping of seasonally burned areas in the semi-arid savannas of Southern Africa. Our approach leveraged the distinctive spectral-temporal trajectories associated with areas on the landscape burned at different times or areas remaining unburned over time. Using fuzzy c-means clustering, we extracted distinctive trajectories from the multitemporal mid-infrared burn index (MIRBI) data derived from Landsat data and characterized them based on empirically developed labeling rules. The selected training trajectories captured both the bum condition (burned or unburned) and if burned, the timeframe of the burn event. We assessed the approach by training a Random Forests model using over 2500 automatically selected training data and validated the model against ground truth for years 2009 and 2014. Based on over 1000 validation points in each year, we obtained overall accuracies above 90% showing reliable and consistent training data were supplied by our automatic training sample selection approach. The method provides a data driven and automatic approach which can reduce the time-consuming and expensive training task, enabling quicker generation of relevant burned area information that can support fire monitoring programs and climate change research.

TI  - Assessment of rice growth conditions in a semi-arid region of India using the Generalized Radar Vegetation Index derived from RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice growth monitoring using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as a promising approach for tracking the development of this important crop. Accurate spatio-temporal information of rice inventories is required for water resource management, production risk occurrence, and yield forecasting. This research investigates the potential of the proposed Generalized volume scattering model based Radar Vegetation Index (GRVI) for monitoring rice growth at different phenological stages. The GRVI is derived using the concept of a geodesic distance (GD) between Kennaugh matrices projected on a unit sphere. We utilized this concept of GD to quantify a similarity measure between the observed Kennaugh matrix (representation of observed Polarimetric SAR information) and the Kennaugh matrix of a generalized volume scattering model (a realization of scattering media). The similarity measure is then modulated with a factor estimated from the ratio of the minimum to the maximum GD between the observed Kennaugh matrix and the set of elementary targets: trihedral, cylinder, dihedral, and narrow dihedral. In this work, we utilize a time series of C-band quad-pol RADARSAT-2 observations over a semi-arid region in Vijayawada, India. Among the several rice cultivation practices adopted in this region, we analyze the growth stages of direct seeded rice (DSR) and conventional tansplanted rice (TR) with the GRVI and crop biophysical parameters viz., Plant Area Index - PAI. The GRVI is compared for both rice types against the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) proposed by Kim and van Zyl. A temporal analysis of the GRVI with crop biophysical parameters at different phenological stages confirms its trend with the plant growth stages. Also, the linear regression analysis confirms that the GRVI outperforms RVI with significant correlations with PAI (r >= 0.83 for both DSR and TR). In addition, PAI estimations from GRVI show promising retrieval accuracy with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) < 1.05m(2) m(-2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) <0.85m(2) m(-2).

TI  - Parsing Synthetic Aperture Radar Measurements of Snow in Complex Terrain: Scaling Behaviour and Sensitivity to Snow Wetness and Landcover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial signatures of seasonal snow in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations at different spatial scales and for different physiographic regions. Sentinel-1 C-band (SAR) backscattering coefficients (BSC) were analyzed in the Swiss Alps (SA), in high elevation forest and grasslands in Grand Mesa (GM), Colorado, and in North Dakota (ND) croplands. GM BSC exhibit 10 dB sensitivity to wetness at small scales (100 m) over homogeneous grassland. Sensitivity decreases to 5 dB in the presence of trees, and it is demonstrated that VH BSC sensitivity enables wet snow mapping below the tree-line. Area-variance scaling relationships show minima at 100 m and 150-250 m, respectively, in barren and grasslands in SA and GM, increasing up to 1 km and longer in GM forests and ND agricultural fields. The spatial organization of BSC (as described by 1D-directional BSC wavelength spectra) exhibits multi-scaling behavior in the 100-1000 m range with a break at (180-360 m) that is also present in UAVSAR L-band measurements in GM. Spectral slopes in GM forested areas steepen during accumulation and flatten in the melting season with mirror behavior for grasslands reflecting changes in scattering mechanisms with snow depth and wetness, and vegetation mass and structure. Overall, this study reveals persistent patterns of SAR scattering variability spatially organized by land-cover, topography and regional winds with large inter-annual variability tied to precipitation. This dynamic scaling behavior emerges as an integral physical expression of snowpack variability that can be used to model sub-km scales and for downscaling applications.

TI  - Monitoring land use and land cover changes in the mountainous cities of Oman using GIS and CA-Markov modelling techniques
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of the socioeconomic transformation, the rapid urban expansion of cities and towns in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states has predominately led to tremendous pressure on the limited natural resources and loss of productive lands. Indeed, the spatial patterns of urbanisation and their impacts on mountain resources and environment have received little attention, particularly in Oman. Predicting urban growth in the mountainous cities has the potential to better understand the interaction between the spatial growth patterns and the mountain topography. This study aims to analyse spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) (2008-2018) and simulate urban expansion (2008-2038) in Nizwa city, Al Dakhliyah governorate, Oman. Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov and geospatial techniques were utilised to assess and project urban growth and land cover changes. The analysis was based on three maps of LULC at equal intervals derived from satellite imageries: Landsat TM for 1998, 2008 and 2018, along with topographic spatial layers (elevation, aspects, and terrain slopes) derived from the ASTER digital elevation model. In addition, other spatial para. meters (population density, proximity to urban centres, and proximity to major roads,) were incorporated in the simulation process. The findings revealed that the actual LULC change during 2008-2018 was 12,014 ha of net urban growth (418.5 % change), while the simulated change was expected to be 14,985 ha by 2028, with a total of 37,465 ha increase in the built-up area and urban growth by 2038. Although the topographic variability will control LULC changes, the urban expansion overly will occupy the arable land across the valleys along with the flat areas. During the next two decades, the built-up areas will dominant, with a large percentage of vacant land (net loss 12,813 ha) and vegetation cover (net loss 35 ha) will be gradually converted into residential land use. The output of the simulations in this research could serve not only as spatial guidelines for monitoring future trends of LULC dynamics, but also address the threats and deteriorates of urban sustainability in the Omani mountainous cities. Furthermore, identifying bare soils and vegetation areas that are susceptible to urbanisation is of value for the national strategy of future urban planning in Oman.

TI  - A Unified Data-Driven Method to Derive Hydrologic Dynamics From Global SMAP Surface Soil Moisture and GPM Precipitation Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Data sets provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite missions contain rich information about land surface hydrologic processes.In this study, a unified regression method is proposed and applied to these global data sets to investigate surface soil moisture (SSM) dynamics. Two forms of regressors are implemented: 1) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation flux and 2) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation flux with an additional interaction term. Regression results based on 3 years of global SMAP and GPM data show that the unified regression method can identify the SSM characteristics found by several recent studies, including the SSM exponential decay rate, the fraction of precipitation retained in the surface soil layer, and the effective depth of hydrologic storage. Additionally, including the interaction regressor provides a novel way to derive the sensitivity of infiltration/runoff partitioning to antecedent SSM without the need for streamflow observations. These SMAP/GPM regression results are compared with those derived from a global SSM data set simulated by the variable infiltration capacity model. Relative to the satellite data, variable infiltration capacity retains moisture longer in the top layer, retains too much precipitation input in that layer, and exhibits levels of sensitivity of runoff/infiltration partitioning to top-layer soil moisture that generally match SMAP especially in humid regions. This study demonstrates that the regression-based method can recover useful process-level insight from SMAP SSM retrievals and is a viable tool for evaluating the representation of surface processes in hydrologic models.Plain Language Summary In the past few years, new satellite missions have been launched to make frequent observations of near-surface soil moisture and rainfall over most global land areas. In this study, we analyze these satellite observations to learn how near-surface soil moisture changes over time. Based on this analysis, we can determine for each location: 1) how fast near-surface soil moisture declines after rainfall, 2) how much rainfall enters the soil versus how much runs off, and 3) how rainfall partitioning is affected by near-surface soil moisture. The first two questions have been studied before, but our method is simpler and reaches the same conclusions. Our method is also able to answer the third question, which has not been looked at before. Finally, we analyze a model-based near-surface soil moisture data set in the same way and compare the results with our observation-based finding. In this way, we pinpoint aspects of the mathematical model that do not correctly mimic the real-world evolution of near-surface soil moisture. This insight will guide model upgrades that better capture reality.

TI  - Pre-harvest classification of crop types using a Sentinel-2 time-series and machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely crop type information (preferably before harvest) is useful for predicting food surpluses or shortages. This study assesses the performance of several machine learning classifiers, namely SVM (support vector machine), DT (decision tree), k-NN (k-nearest neighbour), RF (random forest) and ML (maximum likelihood) for crop type mapping based on a series of Sentinel-2 images. Four experiments with different combinations of image sets were carried out. The first three experiments were undertaken with 1) single-date (uni-temporal) images; 2) combinations of five images selected from the best performing single-date images; and 3) five images selected manually based on crop development stages. The fourth experiment involved the chronologic addition of images to assess the performance of the classifiers when only pre-harvest images are used, with the purpose of investigating how early in the season reasonable accuracies can be achieved. The experiments were carried out in two different sites in the Western Cape Province of South Africa to provide a good representation of the grain-producing areas in the region which has a Mediterranean climate. The significance of image selection on classification accuracies as well as the performance of machine learning classifiers when only pre-harvest images are used were evaluated. The classification results were analysed by comparing overall accuracies and kappa coefficients, while McNemar's test and ANOVA (analysis of variance) were used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in accuracies among experiments. The results show that by selecting images based on individual performance, a viable alternative to selecting images based on crop developmental stages is offered, and that the classification of crops with an entire time series can be just as accurate as when they are classified with a subset of hand-selected images. We also found that good classification accuracies (77.2%) can be obtained with the use of SVM and RF as early as eight weeks before harvest. This result shows that pre-harvest images have the potential to identify crops accurately, which holds much potential for operational within-season crop type mapping.

TI  - Lymph Node Imaging in Patients with Primary Breast Cancer: Concurrent Diagnostic Tools
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Review
AB  - The detection of lymph node metastasis affects the management of patients with primary breast cancer significantly in terms of staging, treatment, and prognosis. The main goal for the radiologist is to determine and detect the presence of metastatic disease in nonpalpable axillary lymph nodes with a positive predictive value that is high enough to initially select patients for upfront axillary lymph node dissection. Features that are suggestive of axillary adenopathy may be seen with different imaging modalities, but ultrasound is the method of choice for evaluating axillary lymph nodes and for performing image-guided lymph node interventions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the available imaging modalities for lymph node assessment in patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer.Implications for Practice The detection of lymph node metastasis affects the management of patients with primary breast cancer. The main goal for the radiologist is to detect lymph node metastasis in patients to allow for the selection of patients who should undergo upfront axillary lymph node dissection. Features that are suggestive of axillary adenopathy may be seen with mammography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, but ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating axillary lymph nodes. A normal axillary lymph node is characterized by a reniform shape, a maximal cortical thickness of 3 mm without focal bulging, smooth margins, and, depending on size, a discernable central fatty hilum.

TI  - Studies of a Lacustrine-Volcanic Mars Analog Field Site With Mars-2020-Like Instruments
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On the upcoming Mars-2020 rover two remote sensing instruments, Mastcam-Z and SuperCam, and two microscopic proximity science instruments, Scanning for Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) and Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), will collect compositional (mineralogy, chemistry, and organics) data essential for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The synergies between and limitations of these instruments were evaluated via study of a Mars analog field site in the Mojave desert, using instruments approximating the data that will be returned by Mars-2020. A ground truth data set was generated for comparison to validate the results. The site consists of a succession of clay-rich mudstones of lacustrine origin, interbedded tuffs, a carbonate-silica travertine deposit, and gypsiferous mudstone strata. The major geological units were mapped successfully using simulated Mars-2020 data. Simulated Mastcam-Z data identified unit boundaries and Fe-bearing weathering products. Simulated SuperCam passive shortwave infrared and green Raman data were essential in identifying major mineralogical composition and changes in lacustrine facies at distance; this was possible even with spectrally downsampled passive IR data. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and simulated PIXL data discriminated and mapped major element chemistry. Simulated PIXL revealed millimeter-scale zones enriched in zirconium, of interest for age dating. Scanning for SHERLOC-like data mapped sulfate and carbonate at submillimeter scale; silicates were identified with increased laser pulses/spot or by averaging of hundreds of spectra. Fluorescence scans detected and mapped varied classes of organics in all samples, characterized further with follow-on spatially targeted deep-UV Raman spectra. Development of dedicated organics spectral libraries is needed to aid interpretation. Given these observations, the important units in the outcrop would be sampled and cached for sample return.

TI  - Transferring deep learning models for cloud detection between Landsat-8 and Proba-V
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cloud detection algorithms are mandatory to analyze the large streams of data coming from the different optical Earth observation satellites. Deep learning (DL) based cloud detection schemes provide very accurate cloud detection models. However, training these models for a given sensor requires large datasets of manually labeled samples, which are very costly or even impossible to create when the satellite has not been launched yet. In this work, we present an approach that exploits manually labeled datasets from one satellite to train deep learning models for cloud detection that can be applied (or transferred) to other satellites. We take into account the physical properties of the acquired signals and propose a simple transfer learning approach using Landsat-8 and Proba-V sensors, whose images have different but similar spatial and spectral characteristics.Three types of experiments are conducted to demonstrate that transfer learning can work in both directions: (a) from Landsat-8 to Proba-V, where we show that models trained only with Landsat-8 data produce cloud masks 5 points more accurate than the current operational Proba-V cloud masking method, (b) from Proba-V to Landsat-8, where models that use only Proba-V data for training have an accuracy similar to the operational FMask in the publicly available Biome dataset (87.79-89.77% vs 88.48%), and (c) jointly from Proba-V and Landsat-8 to Proba-V, where we demonstrate that using jointly both data sources the accuracy increases 1-10 points when few Proba-V labeled images are available. These results highlight that, taking advantage of existing publicly available cloud masking labeled datasets, we can create accurate deep learning based cloud detection models for new satellites, but without the burden of collecting and labeling a large dataset of images.

TI  - Mapping Precipitable Water Vapor Time Series From Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a methodology to retrieve the precipitable water vapor (PWV) from a differential interferometric time series is presented. We used external data provided by atmospheric weather models (e.g., ERA-Interim reanalysis) to constrain the initial state and by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to phase ambiguities elimination introduced by phase unwrapping algorithm. An iterative least-square is then used to solve the optimization problem. We applied the presented methodology to two time series of differential PWV maps estimated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Sentinel-1A, over the southwest part of the Appalachian Mountains (USA). The results were validated using an independent GNSS data set and also compared with atmospheric weather prediction data. The GNSS PWV observations show a strong correlation with the estimated PWV maps with a root-mean-square error less than 1 mm. These results are very encouraging, particularly for the meteorology community, providing crucial information to assimilate into numerical weather models and potentially improve the forecasts.

TI  - An integrated remote-sensing mapping method for groundwater dependent ecosystems associated with diffuse discharge in the Great Artesian Basin, Australia
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical leakage (discharge to upper aquifers) is an important but poorly constrained component of water balance in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), Australia. It ranges from negligible discharge where the GAB is overlain by aquitards, to high discharge where artesian water feeds the shallow unconfined aquifer (thereby raising the water table) causing elevated surface soil moisture and extensive surface salinisation. Adequately representing the temporal and spatial variability of vertical leakage is difficult due to the large scale over which the discharge occurs. An innovative method is presented that integrates a supervised classification of high-discharge zones using time-series Landsat data with landform mapping information to improve classification results. 'Wetness persistence' and 'salt persistence' classes, determined from the time series data, are related to groundwater discharge processes through a discharge framework that allows scaling up of field-based discharge estimates. The results show that using multi-image classification integrated with landform data will significantly reduce uncertainty by reducing false positives. No significant temporal trends were found in a time series assessment, with results featuring high variability, most likely due to image normalisation issues. The lack of a clear temporal signal suggests that an assumption of steady-state discharge is valid for estimating annual fluxes of vertical leakage. Supervised classification and landform outputs provide updated knowledge on GAB vertical leakage rates by providing useful lower and upper bounds of discharge rates respectively. Additionally, groundwater-dependent ecosystem classification, covering the full extent of the basin margins, is a new source of information resulting from the work.

TI  - Slope Failure Prediction Using Random Forest Machine Learning and LiDAR in an Eroded Folded Mountain Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The probabilistic mapping of landslide occurrence at a high spatial resolution and over a large geographic extent is explored using random forests (RF) machine learning; light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived terrain variables; additional variables relating to lithology, soils, distance to roads and streams and cost distance to roads and streams; and training data interpreted from high spatial resolution LiDAR-derivatives. Using a large training set and all predictor variables, an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.946 is obtained. Our findings highlight the value of a large training dataset, the incorporation of a variety of terrain variables and the use of variable window sizes to characterize the landscape at different spatial scales. We also document important variables for mapping slope failures. Our results suggest that feature selection is not required to improve the RF modeling results and that incorporating multiple models using different pseudo absence samples is not necessary. From our findings and based on a review of prior studies, we make recommendations for high spatial resolution, large-area slope failure probabilistic mapping.

TI  - Sliding Time Master Digital Image Correlation Analyses of CubeSat Images for landslide Monitoring: The Rattlesnake Hills Landslide (USA)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide monitoring is a global challenge that can take strong advantage from opportunities offered by Earth Observation (EO). The increasing availability of constellations of small satellites (e.g., CubeSats) is allowing the collection of satellite images at an incredible revisit time (daily) and good spatial resolution. Furthermore, this trend is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. In order to explore the potential of using a long stack of images for improving the measurement of ground displacement, we developed a new procedure called STMDA (Slide Time Master Digital image correlation Analyses) that we applied to one year long stack of PlanetScope images for back analyzing the displacement pattern of the Rattlesnake Hills landslide occurred between the 2017 and 2018 in the Washington State (USA). Displacement maps and time-series of displacement of different portions of the landslide was derived, measuring velocity up to 0.5 m/week, i.e., very similar to velocities available in literature. Furthermore, STMDA showed also a good potential in denoising the time-series of displacement at the whole scale with respect to the application of standard DIC methods, thus providing displacement precision up to 0.01 pixels.

TI  - A Tutorial on Model-Assisted Estimation with Application to Forest Inventory
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - National forest inventories in many countries combine expensive ground plot data with remotely-sensed information to improve precision in estimators of forest parameters. A simple post-stratified estimator is often the tool of choice because it has known statistical properties, is easy to implement, and is intuitive to the many users of inventory data. Because of the increased availability of remotely-sensed data with improved spatial, temporal, and thematic resolutions, there is a need to equip the inventory community with a more diverse array of statistical estimators. Focusing on generalized regression estimators, we step the reader through seven estimators including: Horvitz Thompson, ratio, post-stratification, regression, lasso, ridge, and elastic net. Using forest inventory data from Daggett county in Utah, USA as an example, we illustrate how to construct, as well as compare the relative performance of, these estimators. Augmented by simulations, we also show how the standard variance estimator suffers from greater negative bias than the bootstrap variance estimator, especially as the size of the assisting model grows. Each estimator is made readily accessible through the new R package, mase. We conclude with guidelines in the form of a decision tree on when to use which an estimator in forest inventory applications.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Changes over a District in Northern India using Remote Sensing and GIS and their Impact on Society and Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on exploring changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) over Baramulla district of Kashmir using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Linkage of LULC with evapotranspiration and precipitation is also explored in this paper. LULC were categorised into dense forest, sparse forest, water body and other classes by using geospatial satellite data from Landsat for the years 1979, 2001 to 2018. The dense forest and water body show decrease in extent from 1979 to 2018. A decrease of about 27 % has been reported from 1979 to 2018 in dense forest. Furthermore, water body shows a reduction of about 36% during the same time span. Significant changes in dense forest and water body affected the water cycle of the region. Reduction in dense forest and water body resulted in significant decrease in evapotranspiration which caused reduction in precipitation over the study area. Reduced precipitation over study area caused conversion from agriculture to horticulture. Increase of about 55% in horticulture has been reported with decrease of about 54% in agriculture over study area. Evapotranspiration from reanalysis shows coherent variation with precipitation from India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded product. A decadal decrease of about 0.5% in evapotranspiration resulting in decrease of about 0.38% in precipitation over study area is reported. Increased horticulture causes increase in black carbon due to increased biomass which results in increased warming over study area. Changes reported in this study may cause a significant socioeconomic and environmental impact over Baramulla.

TI  - Assessments on the impact of high-resolution-sensor pixel sizes for common agricultural policy and smart farming services in European regions
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution (5-50 m) remote sensing satellite sensors provide a reliable, free and open data infrastructure for public and private agriculture and land use services. The further market penetration of these services critically depends on the fraction of agricultural fields and area that the services can cover. EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and smart farming services require a minimum of spectrally pure measurements per agricultural field. The impact of pixel size on the coverage of agriculture is studied in this paper considering present free and open optical sensors (Sentinel-2 and LANDSAT). It further studies the implications of the selection of spatial resolution of planned extensions of these sensors, i.e. the next generation of Sentinel-2, as well as Copernicus's hyperspectral CHIME and thermal LSTM future candidate missions.The paper analyzes the 2018 vector boundaries and crop types of 3.6 million agricultural fields in the German States of Bavaria and Lower Saxony and the Netherlands. The fields were rasterized using Sentinel-2 flight geometry and a pixel spacing of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 m. The study specifically considered: (1) fields with no pure pixel inside where no CAP services can be provided and (2) fields with less than 50 pure pixels inside, which is estimated to be the critical number for site-specific smart farming. The percentage of agricultural fields and agricultural area was determined for the main crop types. It shows, that with 10 m pixel spacing 2-4% and 20 m pixel spacing 12-22% of the agricultural fields in the study area do not contain a single pure spectral sample (Sentinel-2 case). This fraction decreases to 1-3% at 5 m spacing and increases to 25-40% for 30 m (LANDSAT and CHIME) and 50-70% for 50 m (LSTM) spacing. The percentage of fields with less than 50 pure pixels is 20-50% at 10 m and 70-85% at 20 m spacing (Sentinel-2). This fraction decreases to 5-12% for 5 m spacing and reaches the level of 92-97% for 30 m (LANDSAT) and 99% for 50 m spacing (LSTM). Our analysis shows, that with a pixel spacing of 5 m the Sentinel-2-based site-specific smart farming services could increase their potential customer base from similar to 50% to similar to 90% of the agricultural fields and could potentially cover 99% of the regions' agricultural area. A 20 m pixel spacing would increase the agriculture area from 23% to 56% in the Central and Western European study regions on which the Copernicus hyperspectral candidate mission CHIME is capable to measure pure and full spectra for highly advanced future site-specific management services. LSTM would also profit from a spatial resolution of 30 m, which would raise coverage of the agricultural area in Central Europe with pure thermal measurements from 3% at 50 m to 23% at 30 m.

TI  - A retrospective analysis of commonly prescribed medications and the risk of developing breast cancer related lymphedema.
T2  - Clinical research and trials
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common complication of current breast cancer treatment modalities, significantly lowering quality of life for these patients and often leading to recurrent infections. Here, based on pre-clinical literature, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the risks of prescribed medications on BCRL development.METHODS: All post-operative breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy from 2005-2013 at Massachusetts General Hospital and developed lymphedema(n=115) were included in the analysis. Comparable patients without lymphedema(n=230) were randomly selected as control. The following classes of medications were analyzed: NSAIDs, corticosteroids, angiotensin system inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and hormonal therapy. Known risk factors for lymphedema development were included as variables, including BMI, age at diagnosis, type of surgery, number of lymph nodes removed and radiation therapy. Outcomes were BCRL development and lymphedema severity.RESULTS: Similarly, to previous studies, we found that an increase in BMI increases the risk of BCRL(p=0.006) and axillary lymph node dissection has a higher risk of developing BCRL compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy(p=0.045). None of the drugs studied increased the risk of BCRL development or lymphedema severity. However, lymphedema severity was positively correlated with the number of lymph nodes removed(p=0.034).CONCLUSION: We found that anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-hypertensive drugs and hormonal therapy taken during the year postoperatively do not increase the risk of BCRL development or lymphedema severity in breast cancer patients. While others have demonstrated that the number of lymph nodes removed during surgery increases the risk of BCRL, we found it also correlates to lymphedema severity.

TI  - Tree Species Distribution Change Study in Mount Tai Based on Landsat Remote Sensing Image Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Located in the Mount Tai state-owned forest farm, this study adopted Landsat multispectral remote sensing data in 2000 and 2016 on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform and selected four phases of images each year according to the phenological period. By dealing with the current situation map of forestry resources in 2000 and the field survey data in 2016, the samples of tree species distribution in 2000 and 2016 were obtained. On the basis of topographic correction with the empirical rotation model, this study used the random forest (RF) classifier to classify tree species from remote sensing images in 2000 and 2016, achieving high classification accuracy. The results showed that, after 16 years of evolution, the percentage of pine species in the forest decreased from 55.69% to 50.22%, with a percentage decrease as high as 5.47%. The percentage of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) increased from 10.15% in 2000 to 13.75% in 2016, with an increase of 3.60%. Quercus also had a positive growth in the area. This result reflected the expansion of black locust.

TI  - Bias correction and covariance parameters for optimal estimation by exploiting matched in-situ references
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimal estimation (OE) is a core method in quantitative Earth observation. The optimality of OE depends on the errors in the prior, measurements and forward model being zero mean and having well-known error covariance. Often these assumptions are not met. We show how to use matches of satellite observations to in situ reference measurements to estimate parameters for use in OE that bring the retrieval framework closer to the theoretical optimality. This is done by retrieving bias correction and error covariance parameters. Bias correction parameters for some components of the retrieved state and for the satellite radiances are anchored by the in situ reference measurements, and are obtained by a modification of Kalman filtering. Error covariance matrices for the prior state and for the observation-simulation difference are iteratively obtained by applying equations for diagnosing internal retrieval consistency. The theory is applied to the case of OE of sea surface temperature from a sensor on a geostationary platform. Relative to an initial OE implementation, all measures of retrieval performance are improved when the optimised OE is tested on independent data: mean difference from validation data is reduced from -0.08 K to -0.01 K, and the standard deviation from 0.47 to 0.45 K; retrieval sensitivity to sea surface temperature increases from 71% to 76%; and a 20% underestimation of retrieval uncertainty is corrected. Perhaps more significant than the quantitative improvements are the coherent new insights into the forward model simulations and prior assumptions that are also obtained. These include estimates of prior bias in the absence of in situ information, an important consideration when in situ information is not globally distributed. Biases and lack of information about error covariances arise in remote sensing very often. While illustrated here for a particular case, the principles and methods we present for constraining that lack of knowledge systematically using ground truth will be widely applicable in remote sensing.

TI  - Image Interpretability of nSight-1 Nanosatellite Imagery for Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanosatellites are increasingly being used in space-related applications to demonstrate and test scientific capability and engineering ingenuity of space-borne instruments and for educational purposes due to their favourable low manufacturing costs, cheaper launch costs, and short development time. The use of CubeSat to demonstrate earth imaging capability has also grown in the last two decades. In 2017, a South African company known as Space Commercial Services launched a low-orbit nanosatellite named nSight-1. The demonstration nanosatellite has three payloads that include a modular designed SCS Gecko imaging payload, FIPEX atmospheric science instrument developed by the University of Dresden and a Radiation mitigation VHDL coding experiment supplied by Nelson Mandela University. The Gecko imager has a swath width of 64 km and captures 30 m spatial resolution images using the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectral bands. The objective of this study was to assess the interpretability of nSight-1 in the spatial dimension using Landsat 8 as a reference and to recommend potential earth observation applications for the mission. A blind image spatial quality evaluator known as Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) was used to compute the image quality for nSight-1 and Landsat 8 imagery in the spatial domain and the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) method to quantify the interpretability of the images. A visual interpretation was used to propose some potential applications for the nSight1 images. The results indicate that Landsat 8 OLI images had significantly higher image quality scores and NIIRS results compared to nSight-1. Landsat 8 has a mean of 19.299 for the image quality score while nSight-1 achieved a mean of 25.873. Landsat 8 had NIIRS mean of 2.345 while nSight-1 had a mean of 1.622. The superior image quality and image interpretability of Landsat could be attributed for the mature optical design on the Landsat 8 satellite that is aimed for operational purposes. Landsat 8 has a GDS of 30-m compared to 32-m on nSight-1. The image degradation resulting from the lossy compression implemented on nSight-1 from 12-bit to 8-bit also has a negative impact on image visual quality and interpretability. Whereas it is evident that Landsat 8 has the better visual quality and NIIRS scores, the results also showed that nSight-1 are still very good if one considers that the categorical ratings consider that images to be of good to excellent quality and a NIIRS mean of 1.6 indicates that the images are interpretable. Our interpretation of the imagery shows that the data has considerable potential for use in geo-visualization and cartographic land use and land cover mapping applications. The image analysis also showed the capability of the nSight-1 sensor to capture features related to structural geology, geomorphology and topography quite prominently.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a statistical approach to evaluate the performance of the ocean color data processing system for satellite-derived ocean color data products based on temporal stability of retrievals. We use the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system to obtain the normalized water-leaving reflectance rho(wN)(lambda) spectra from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements. The deviations of rho(wN)(lambda) spectra from temporally and spatially averaged values are investigated, and the statistics with respect to various retrieval parameters are collected, including the solar-sensor geometry (solar-zenith, sensor-zenith, and relative azimuth angles), and various ancillary data (surface wind speed, surface atmospheric pressure, water vapor amount, and ozone concentration). The performance of MSL12 is also evaluated with respect to other intermediate retrieval parameters. The study shows that MSL12 produces statistically consistent VIIRS ocean color retrievals in the global open ocean, with respect to retrieval geometry parameters, as well as the ancillary inputs.

TI  - Analyses of Namibian Seasonal Salt Pan Crust Dynamics and Climatic Drivers Using Landsat 8 Time-Series and Ground Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt pans are highly dynamic environments that are difficult to study by in situ methods because of their harsh climatic conditions and large spatial areas. Remote sensing can help to elucidate their environmental dynamics and provide important constraints regarding their sedimentological, mineralogical, and hydrological evolution. This study utilizes spaceborne multitemporal multispectral optical data combined with spectral endmembers to document spatial distribution of surface crust types over time on the Omongwa pan located in the Namibian Kalahari. For this purpose, 49 surface samples were collected for spectral and mineralogical characterization during three field campaigns (2014-2016) reflecting different seasons and surface conditions of the salt pan. An approach was developed to allow the spatiotemporal analysis of the salt pan crust dynamics in a dense time-series consisting of 77 Landsat 8 cloud-free scenes between 2014 and 2017, covering at least three major wet-dry cycles. The established spectral analysis technique Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) extraction method was used to derive image endmembers from the Landsat time-series stack. Evaluation of the extracted endmember set revealed that the multispectral data allowed the differentiation of four endmembers associated with mineralogical mixtures of the crust's composition in dry conditions and three endmembers associated with flooded or muddy pan conditions. The dry crust endmember spectra have been identified in relation to visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the collected surface samples. According these results, the spectral endmembers are interpreted as efflorescent halite crust, mixed halite-gypsum crust, mixed calcite quartz sepiolite crust, and gypsum crust. For each Landsat scene the spatial distribution of these crust types was mapped with the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method and significant spatiotemporal dynamics of the major surface crust types were observed. Further, the surface crust dynamics were analyzed in comparison with the pan's moisture regime and other climatic parameters. The results show that the crust dynamics are mainly driven by flooding events in the wet season, but are also influenced by temperature and aeolian activity in the dry season. The approach utilized in this study combines the advantages of multitemporal satellite data for temporal event characterization with advantages from hyperspectral methods for the image and ground data analyses that allow improved mineralogical differentiation and characterization.

TI  - Low-Cost Radiometer for Landsat Land Surface Temperature Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (ST) represents the radiative temperature of the Earth's surface and is used as input to hydrological, agricultural, and meteorological science applications. Due to the synoptic nature of satellite imaging systems, ST products derived from space-borne platforms are invaluable for estimating ST at the local, regional, and global scale. In the past two decades, an emphasis has been placed on the need to develop algorithms necessary to deliver accurate surface temperature products to support the needs of science users. However, corresponding efforts to validate these products are hindered by the availability of quality ground-based reference measurements. The NOAA Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) network is commonly used to support ST validation efforts, but their instrumentation is broadband (4-50 mu m) and several of their sites lack spatial uniformity. To address the apparent deficiencies within existing validation networks, this work discusses a prototype radiometer that was developed to provide surface temperature estimates to support validation efforts for spaceborne thermal instruments. Specifically, a prototype radiometer was designed, built, and calibrated to acquire ground reference data to be used to validate ST product(s) derived from Landsat 8 image data. Lab-based efforts indicate that these prototype instruments are accurate to within 1.28 K and initial field measurements demonstrate agreement to Landsat-derived ST products to within 1.37 K.

TI  - Decision Support on Monitoring and Disaster Management in Agriculture with Copernicus Sentinel Applications
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful implementation of the European Commission's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the insurance coverage in case of a natural disaster requires precise and regular mapping of crop types and detailed delineation of the disasters' effects by frequent and accurate controls. Free and open access policy to Copernicus Sentinel data offers a big volume of data to the users on a consistent and complete basis. Today, the Sentinels are involved in an increasing number of agriculture applications, but their effective exploitation is still being investigated and the development of efficient tools, aligned to the user's needs, is yet to be realised. To this end, the DiAS (Disaster and Agriculture Sentinel Applications) project proposes methods for decision support in agriculture using Sentinel data for crop type mapping, as well as mapping of the extend of fire and flood effects in agricultural areas. The DiAS Decision Support System (DSS) is designed in consultation with potential users in participatory approach and aims to provide a prototype tool, which provides assistance to the responsible paying agencies and insurance organizations to make decisions on farmers' subsidies and compensations. The DiAS DSS prototype and its functionalities are presented in this paper and its use is demonstrated through example applications for two test sites in Greece. The DiAS DSS demonstrates the necessity for the development of similar tools, as this emerges from the user's requirements, and wishes to stimulate and inspire further research and development.

TI  - Taguchi L<sub>16</sub> optimization approach for simultaneous removal of Cs<SUP>+</SUP> and Sr<SUP>2+</SUP> ions by a novel scavenger
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study targeted to investigate the efficacy of a novel nano 2-naphtyl amine6:6-azulene sodium methanesulfonate di sulphonic acid-impregnated zeolite scavenger for simultaneous elimination of Cs+ and Sr2+ ions from binary aqueous systems. Fractal analysis is introduced to assign a fractal dimension and other fractal characteristics necessary for the surface characterization in terms of fractal dimension (D-s) and pre-exponential coefficient (C), which, in theory, are independent tool and sole for each surface. It is found that the D-s value of nano 2-naphtyl amine6:6-azulene sodium methanesulfonate di sulphonic acid-impregnated zeolite of type Y (NAASMS-ZY) is higher than that of nano 2-naphtyl amine6:6-azulene sodium methanesulfonate di sulphonic acid-impregnated zeolite of type X (NAASMS-ZX) and nano 2-naphtyl amine6:6-azulene sodium methanesulfonate di sulphonic acid-impregnated zeolite of type A (NAASMS-ZA) which accordingly, suggests the irregularity of NAASMS-ZY surface and thus demonstrates a large surface area. To increase the scavenge efficacy, effecting parameters on scavenge process were investigated and optimized via the use of adopting Taguchi L-16 design of experiments approach. It is found that, the initial metal ions concentration is the most powerful variable, and its value of contribution percentage is up to 33% and 31% for Cs+ and Sr2+, respectively. The kinetic curves and sorption isotherms at 298, 303 and 313 K were obtained, which well fitted to hyperbolic and Langmuir equations, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the scavenge process was endothermic for both the concerned ions. Our results showed that the novel synthesized NAASMS-ZY is an effective nano-scavenger for cesium and strontium decontamination.

TI  - Tree species identification within an extensive forest area with diverse management regimes using airborne hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on tree species composition is crucial in forest management and can be obtained using remote sensing. While the topic has been addressed frequently over the last years, the remote sensing-based identification of tree species across wide and complex forest areas is still sparse in the literature. Our study presents a tree species classification of a large fraction of the Bialowieza Forest in Poland covering 62 000 ha and being subject to diverse management regimes. Key objectives were to obtain an accurate tree species map and to examine if the prevalent management strategy influences the classification results. Tree species classification was conducted based on airborne hyperspectral HySpex data. We applied an iterative Support Vector Machine classification and obtained a thematic map of 7 individual tree species (birch, oak, hornbeam, lime, alder, pine, spruce) and an additional class containing other broadleaves. Generally, the more heterogeneous the area was, the more errors we observed in the classification results. Managed forests were classified more accurately than reserves. Our findings indicate that mapping dominant tree species with airborne hyperspectral data can be accomplished also over large areas and that forest management and its effects on forest structure has an influence on classification accuracies and should be actively considered when progressing towards operational mapping of tree species composition.

TI  - Yield gap analysis simulated for sugar beet-growing areas in water-limited environments
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugar beet is one of the main two field crops cultivated to extract sugar. In order to increase the production of sugar beet, it is necessary to identify limiting and reducing factors by quantifying and analyzing yield gap. For this purpose, a crop simulation model was evaluated and used to simulate the storage organ of the sugar beet as well as yield gaps due to water shortage, inappropriate sowing date, and other biotic and abiotic factors at 10 locations of Khorasan Razavi province in northeastern Iran. Results of long-term simulations indicated that the province has a good potential for sugar beet yield with the highest yield of 103.6 t ha(-1). However, there is a huge difference between actual production level and simulated attainable one (65.4 t ha(-1)); the average actual yield was only 32.7 % of the simulated attainable yield. In spite of the large amount of water applied as irrigation by most farmers, there are still water limitations because of water mismanagement, high vapor pressure deficit, and the temperatures occurring during most sensitive the major sugar beet growth stages at most locations. On average, water limitation had a major influence on yield gap (47.5 % of total yield gap) compared with sowing date (15 %) and other limiting and reducing factors (37.5 %). Under these circumstances, farmers must focus on increasing the water productivity of the sugar beet agroecosystem by replacing the current furrow irrigation systems, sowing earlier crops, and substituting sugar beet with crops that have a shorter growing season and are better adapted to the hot and arid climate during summer.

TI  - A new soil moisture index driven from an adapted long-term temperature-vegetation scatter plot using MODIS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of soil moisture content on the global scale is a key research issue in the field of remote sensing and, to date, a range of methods have been developed to achieve this. The temperature-vegetation (T-V) technique, which is perhaps one of the most common and successful, suffers from being inaccurate in some cases, especially when the daily T-V scatter plots are not able to define the wet and dry edges in a reliable way. A further challenge is the scale inconsistency between the results obtained on different days, which is a serious concern when monitoring soil moisture changes over periods of time. To address these restrictions, this paper introduces a new soil moisture index, called SMiSEE, driven by a new long-term T-V scatter plot that is established from data covering a 1-year period. The normalized NDVI is set as the horizontal axis and three different temperature factors are suggested as the vertical axis in the proposed 1-year scatter plot. From these three temperature factors, the results proved that "LSTday-Ta-day (10:30 am)" is the most appropriate choice. In contrast to most linear co-distance indexes reported in the literature, the proposed SMiSEE is a novel non-linear soil moisture index that defines the locus of co-moisture points in the scatter plot as unequal distance curves. To investigate the proposed method, two different soil moisture observation networks with different climate and vegetation conditions, namely, SMAPVEX12 in Canada and REMEDHUS in Spain, were applied. The results demonstrated that the efficiency of the proposed 1-year scatter plot, which was even applicable to, and improved upon, other indexes in the literature. In addition, SMiSEE outperformed SEE, iTVDI and phi as the most recent similar indexes, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.74 for the SMAPVEX12 and REMEDHUS networks, respectively. These results appear to be promising, especially for the vegetated area in the SMAPVEX12 network.

TI  - A Comparison of Satellite-Based Estimates of Urban Agglomeration Size for the Accra Area
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the extension of urban areas are important for analyzing growth dynamics and to support the planning of transport and service provision. Satellite-based remote sensing has proven extremely useful, especially in cities that experience fast spatial growth. Different approaches to satellite-based mapping may, however, produce different results concerning urban categorization and delineation, often making direct comparison misleading. This study analyses four different satellite-based studies of urban land cover in Accra, Ghana and presents a new land cover map based on visual interpretation of segmented Sentinel-2 imagery. The methods and results, as well as the underlying definition of "urban", are compared and discussed. One method identifies exclusively areas with man-made, impervious surfaces, such as roads and buildings, as proxies for urban extent. Other methods aim to identify a broader set of land cover types, including green spaces, which are treated as part of the mixed urban fabric. Further differences are found in the way urban fringe areas under development are classified depending on their degree of urbanization, and in the distance threshold values used for defining the urban agglomeration. For the most recent maps we identify a difference in the measured size of the Accra agglomeration of almost 100%.

TI  - Crop-Type Classification for Long-Term Modeling: An Integrated Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term temporal and spatial information of crop type supports a wide range of applications including hydrological and climatological studies. In the U.S., yearly crop data layers (CDLs) are available starting in the early 2000s and have been developed using combined field information and sets of temporal imagery from multiple sensors. Development of long-term crop-type layers similar to CDLs is restricted by reduced accessibility to imagery and the necessary auxiliary datasets. In this study, a procedure to generate a historical crop type was developed and evaluated. Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets from Landsat 5 TM sensor for the Lower Bear Creek watershed were collected and processed. Object-based pseudo phenology curves, represented by the NDVI time series, were generated using noise filtering and dimensionality standardization procedures for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Classifiers were developed and evaluated using random-forest machine learning algorithms and CDL datasets as the reference. Increased generalization performance was obtained when the model was developed using multi-year datasets. This can be attributed to improved crop type representation during the training phase coupled with characterization of yearly variations due to natural (weather) and anthropogenic factors (farming management). Source of uncertainties were the presence of multiple crops within objects, phenological similarities between soybean and corn/maize, and the accuracy of CDL itself. The proposed procedure supports the development of historic crop types for long-term studies at the field scale in agricultural watersheds.

TI  - A reporting framework for Sustainable Development Goal 15: Multi-scale monitoring of forest degradation using MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.1.1 proposes to quantify "Forest area as a proportion of total land area" in order to achieve SDG target 15.1. While area under forest cover can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle changes within the broad vegetation class, e.g. forest degradation. Continental or national-level studies, mostly utilizing coarse-scale satellite data, are likely to fail in capturing these changes due to the fine spatial and long temporal characteristics of forest degradation. Yet, these long-term changes affect forest structure, composition and function, thus ultimately limiting successful implementation of SDG targets.Using a multi-scale, satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easy-to-implement reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystems. We systematically analyze freely available remote sensing assets on Google Earth Engine for monitoring degradation and evaluate the potential of multiple satellite data with different spatial resolutions for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate vegetation trends in six south Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000-2016. We also calculate rainfall trends in these countries using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and further calculate Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) that shows vegetation trends in the context of rainfall variability. In step 2, we focus on two protected area test cases from India and Sri Lanka for evaluating the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, for capturing forest degradation signals, which will ultimately contribute towards SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. We find that most countries show a fluctuating trend in vegetation condition over the years, along with localized greening and browning. The Random Forest (RF) classifier utilized in step 2 was able to generate accurate maps (87% and 91% overall accuracy for Indian and Sri Lankan test cases, respectively) of non-intact forest within the protected areas. We find that almost one-third of the Indian test case is degraded forest, even though it shows overall greening as per the broad-brush approach. This finding corroborates our argument that utilizing higher-resolution satellite data (e.g. 10-m) than those normally used for national-level studies will be crucial for reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: "progress towards sustainable forest management".

TI  - Human Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells and Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - The prognosis of metastatic melanoma (MM) patients has remained poor for a long time. However, the recent introduction of effective target therapies (BRAF and MEK inhibitors for BRAFV600-mutated MM) and immunotherapies (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1) has significantly improved the survival of MM patients. Notably, all these responses are highly dependent on the fitness of the host immune system, including the innate compartment. Among immune cells involved in cancer immunity, properly activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exert an important role, bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses and directly eliminating cancer cells. A distinctive feature of pDCs is the production of high amount of type I Interferon (I-IFN), through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 9 signaling pathway activation. However, published data indicate that melanoma-associated escape mechanisms are in place to hijack pDC functions. We have recently reported that pDC recruitment is recurrent in the early phases of melanoma, but the entire pDC compartment collapses over melanoma progression. Here, we summarize recent advances on pDC biology and function within the context of melanoma immunity.

TI  - A High-Resolution Global Map of Giant Kelp (<i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i>) Forests and Intertidal Green Algae (<i>Ulvophyceae</i>) with Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) is the most widely distributed kelp species on the planet, constituting one of the richest and most productive ecosystems on Earth, but detailed information on its distribution is entirely missing in some marine ecoregions, especially in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we present an algorithm based on a series of filter thresholds to detect giant kelp employing Sentinel-2 imagery. Given the overlap between the reflectances of giant kelp and intertidal green algae (Ulvophyceae), the latter are also detected on shallow rocky intertidal areas. The kelp filter algorithm was applied separately to vegetation indices, the Floating Algae Index (FAI), the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and a novel formula (the Kelp Difference, KD). Training data from previously surveyed kelp forests and other coastal and ocean features were used to identify reflectance threshold values. This procedure was validated with independent field data collected with UAV imagery at a high spatial resolution and point-georeferenced sites at a low spatial resolution. When comparing UAV with Sentinel data (high-resolution validation), an average overall accuracy >= 0.88 and Cohen's kappa >= 0.64 coefficients were found in all three indices for canopies reaching the surface with extensions greater than 1 hectare, with the KD showing the highest average kappa score (0.66). Measurements between previously surveyed georeferenced points and remotely-sensed kelp grid cells (low-resolution validation) showed that 66% of the georeferenced points had grid cells indicating kelp presence within a linear distance of 300 m. We employed the KD in our kelp filter algorithm to estimate the global extent of giant kelp and intertidal green algae per marine ecoregion and province, producing a high-resolution global map of giant kelp and intertidal green algae, powered by Google Earth Engine.

TI  - LiCSBAS: An Open-Source InSAR Time Series Analysis Package Integrated with the LiCSAR Automated Sentinel-1 InSAR Processor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the past five years, the 2-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation has provided abundant and useful Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which have the potential to reveal global ground surface deformation at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, for most users, fully exploiting the large amount of associated data is challenging, especially over wide areas. To help address this challenge, we have developed LiCSBAS, an open-source SAR interferometry (InSAR) time series analysis package that integrates with the automated Sentinel-1 InSAR processor (LiCSAR). LiCSBAS utilizes freely available LiCSAR products, and users can save processing time and disk space while obtaining the results of InSAR time series analysis. In the LiCSBAS processing scheme, interferograms with many unwrapping errors are automatically identified by loop closure and removed. Reliable time series and velocities are derived with the aid of masking using several noise indices. The easy implementation of atmospheric corrections to reduce noise is achieved with the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS). Using case studies in southern Tohoku and the Echigo Plain, Japan, we demonstrate that LiCSBAS applied to LiCSAR products can detect both large-scale (>100 km) and localized (similar to km) relative displacements with an accuracy of <1 cm/epoch and similar to 2 mm/yr. We detect displacements with different temporal characteristics, including linear, periodic, and episodic, in Niigata, Ojiya, and Sanjo City, respectively. LiCSBAS and LiCSAR products facilitate greater exploitation of globally available and abundant SAR datasets and enhance their applications for scientific research and societal benefit.

TI  - Extramammary Paget Disease: A Review of the Literature-Part I: History, Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, Presentation, Histopathology, and Diagnostic Work-up
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare malignancy with unclear pathophysiology that occurs predominantly on apocrine rich skin. Surgery is the treatment of choice; however, procedures tend to be extensive and associated with a high rate of recurrence. OBJECTIVE To review the current literature on EMPD regarding epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, histology, diagnostic work-up, treatment, and prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Literature review using PubMed search for articles related to EMPD. RESULTS Extramammary Paget disease classically presents as a slowly growing red plaque, which often mimics an inflammatory condition leading to significant delay in diagnosis. Diagnosis requires histopathologic examination and is often supported by immunohistochemical analysis. Once a diagnosis of EMPD is made, the patient must be risk-stratified and evaluated for an underlying malignancy. CONCLUSION Standard of treatment is surgery, with data suggesting that Mohs micrographic surgery may have superior clinical outcomes and lower recurrence rates. Alternatives such as photodynamic therapy and topicals have been explored and may be appropriate in certain situations. Patients with EMPD generally have a good prognosis with a 5-year overall survival rate of 75% to 95%.

TI  - Tissue specific regulation of transcription in endometrium and association with disease
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Are genetic effects on endometrial gene expression tissue specific and/or associated with reproductive traits and diseases?SUMMARY ANSWER: Analyses of RNA-sequence data and individual genotype data from the endometrium identified novel and disease associated, genetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in the endometrium and showed evidence that these mechanisms are shared across biologically similar tissues.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The endometrium is a complex tissue vital for female reproduction and is a hypothesized source of cells initiating endometriosis. Understanding genetic regulation specific to, and shared between, tissue types can aid the identification of genes involved in complex genetic diseases.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: RNA-sequence and genotype data from 206 individuals was analysed and results were compared with large publicly available datasets.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING,, rat I HODS: RNA-sequencing and genotype data from 206 endometrial samples was used to identify the influence of genetic variants on gene expression, via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and to compare these endometrial eQTLs with those in other tissues. To investigate the association between endometrial gene expression regulation and reproductive traits and diseases, we conducted a tissue enrichment analysis, transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and summary data-based Mendelian randomisation (SMR) analyses. Transcriptomic data was used to test differential gene expression between women with and without endometriosis.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A tissue enrichment analysis with endometriosis genome-wide association study summary statistics showed that genes surrounding endometriosis risk loci were significantly enriched in reproductive tissues. A total of 444 sentinel cis-eQTLs (P < 2.57 x 10(-9)) and 30 trans-eQTLs (P < 4.65 x 10(-13)) were detected, including 327 novel cis-eQTLs in endometrium. A large proportion (85%) of endometrial eQTLs are present in other tissues. Genetic effects on endometrial gene expression were highly correlated with the genetic effects on reproductive (e.g. uterus, ovary) and digestive tissues (e.g. salivary gland, stomach), supporting a shared genetic regulation of gene expression in biologically similar tissues. The TWAS analysis indicated that gene expression at 39 loci is associated with endometriosis, including five known endometriosis risk loci. SMR analyses identified potential target genes pleiotropically or causally associated with reproductive traits and diseases including endometriosis. However, without taking account of genetic variants, a direct comparison between women with and without endometriosis showed no significant difference in endometrial gene expression.LARGE SCALE DATA: The eQTL dataset generated in this study is available at http://reproductivegenomics.com.au/shiny/endo_ eqtl_ nrna/. Additional datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article and the supplementary information files, or are available on reasonable request.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data are derived from fresh tissue samples and expression levels are an average of expression from different cell types within the endometrium. Subtle cell-specifc expression changes may not be detected and differences in cell composition between samples and across the menstrual cycle will contribute to sample variability. Power to detect tissue specific eQTLs and differences between women with and without endometriosis was limited by the sample size in this study. The statistical approaches used in this study identify the likely gene targets for specific genetic risk factors, but not the functional mechanism by which changes in gene expression may influence disease risk.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results identify novel genetic variants that regulate gene expression in endometrium and the majority of these are shared across tissues. This allows analysis with large publicly available datasets to identify targets for female reproductive traits and diseases. Much larger studies will be required to identify genetic regulation of gene expression that will be specific to endometrium.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the automation of the building extraction using SPOT 6 satellite imagery. The proposed methodology uses variance textural information derived from 1.5m panchromatic image to detect built-up areas from non-built-up areas. Once detected, detailed segmentation is performed on built-up class to create individual building objects. Canny edges, SAVI and spectral properties of the objects were used to classify building structures from other land use features using a thresholding technique. The methodology was tested in different areas including formal, rural village and informal and new development settlement types without modifying segmentation and classification parameters. The proposed methodology successfully detected built-up from non built-up areas in all different settlement types. The detection of individual structures achieved more than 70% in formal, rural village and new development areas while less than 50% of building structures in informal settlement were detected. The proposed method can contribute towards monitoring of human settlement developments over a larger area which is vital during spatial planning, service delivery and environmental management. This work will contribute towards the development of a National Human Settlement Layer developed and maintained by SANSA.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of Methods for Monitoring Ice Phenology of the World's Largest High Arctic Lake Using High-Density Time Series Analysis of Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice is a dominant component of Canada's landscape and can act as an indicator for how freshwater aquatic ecosystems are changing with warming climates. While lake ice monitoring through government networks has decreased in the last three decades, the increased availability of remote sensing images can help to provide consistent spatial and temporal coverage for areas with annual ice cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are commonly used for lake ice monitoring, due to the acquisition of images in any condition (time of day or weather). Using Sentinel-1 A/B images, a high-density time series of SAR images was developed for Lake Hazen in Nunavut, Canada, from 2015-2018. These images were used to test two different methods of monitoring lake ice phenology: one method using the first difference between SAR images and another that applies the Otsu segmentation method. Ice phenology dates determined from the two methods were compared with visual interpretation of the Sentinel-1 images. Mean errors for the pixel comparison of the first difference method ranged 3-10 days for ice-on and ice-off, while average error values for the Otsu method ranged 2-10 days. Mean errors for comparisons of different sections of the lake ranged 0-15 days for the first difference method and 2-17 days for the Otsu method. This research demonstrates the value of temporally consistent image acquisition for improving the accuracy of lake ice monitoring.

TI  - Epidemiology of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) in India, 2016-18, based on data from sentinel surveillance
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryRubella infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can affect the fetus, resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or an infant born with a combination of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Government of India is committed to eliminate measles and control rubella/CRS and has completed nationwide immunization campaigns using measles-rubella vaccine targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years. A case-based surveillance for CRS is one of the strategies for achieving elimination. The Indian Council of Medical Research and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare initiated surveillance for CRS in five sentinel sites to estimate the disease burden. During 2016-18, the surveillance sites enrolled 645 suspected CRS patients, 137 (21.2%) were classified as laboratory confirmed CRS and 8 (1.2%) as congenital rubella infection. Common clinical features among laboratory confirmed CRS patients included structural heart defects (78.8%), one or more eye signs (cataract, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy (59.9%)) and hearing impairment (38.6%). Thirty-three (24.1%) laboratory confirmed CRS patients died over a period of 2 years. The surveillance data indicated significance of rubella as persistent public health problem in India.BackgroundGovernment of India is committed to eliminate measles and control rubella/congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by 2020. In 2016, CRS surveillance was established in five sentinel sites. We analyzed surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of CRS in India.Methodology/Principal findingsWe used case definitions adapted from the WHO-recommended standards for CRS surveillance. Suspected patients underwent complete clinical examination including cardiovascular system, ophthalmic examination and assessment for hearing impairment. Sera were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against rubella. Of the 645 suspected CRS patients enrolled during two years, 137 (21.2%) were classified as laboratory confirmed CRS and 8 (1.2%) as congenital rubella infection. The median age of laboratory confirmed CRS infants was 3 months. Common clinical features among laboratory confirmed CRS patients included structural heart defects in 108 (78.8%), one or more eye signs (cataract, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy) in 82 (59.9%) and hearing impairment in 51. (38.6%) Thirty-three (24.1%) laboratory confirmed CRS patients died over a period of 2 years. Surveillance met the quality indicators in terms of adequacy of investigation, adequacy of sample collection for serological diagnosis as well as virological confirmation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline change along the coast of Sayung Demak, Indonesia using Digital Shoreline Analysis System
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sayung is a coastal area located in the northern coast of Central Java Province, Indonesia. This area is severely damaged and experienced shoreline changes due to massive erosion and tidal flooding. This study aims to analyse the shoreline changes in Sayung coast during 24 years period from 1994 to 2018. Shoreline data were obtained by extracting multi-temporal satellite imagery of Landsat 5, 7, and Sentinel 2A. Coastline data for the year 1994, 2000, 2005, 2011 and 2018 were analysed using an overlay technique with the assistance of Geographic Information System (GIS) with ArcGIS software. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to calculate erosion and accretion rates. The results show that the average end point rates (EPR) was -25 m/yr and net shoreline movement (NSM) was -592 m recorded. For five years measurement period: 1994-2000, the EPR value was -7 m/yr, the NSM value was -39 m; 2000-2005 the EPR value was -15 m/yr and the NSM value was -77 m. For 2005-2011 the EPR value was -20 m/yr, and the NSM value was -123 m, and 2011-2018 the EPR value was -41 m/yr, and the NSM value was -290 m. Severe erosions were found in Sriwulan, Bedono, and Timbulsoko. Slight accretion occurs in Surodadi which were caused by varying characteristics of waves, and storms surge, tidal currents, bathymetry forms, and mangroves cover. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Complexity revealed in the greening of the Arctic
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - As tundra ecosystems respond to rapid Arctic warming, satellite records suggest a widespread greening. This Perspective highlights the challenges of interpreting complex Arctic greening trends and provides direction for future research by combining ecological and remote sensing approaches.As the Arctic warms, vegetation is responding, and satellite measures indicate widespread greening at high latitudes. This 'greening of the Arctic' is among the world's most important large-scale ecological responses to global climate change. However, a consensus is emerging that the underlying causes and future dynamics of so-called Arctic greening and browning trends are more complex, variable and inherently scale-dependent than previously thought. Here we summarize the complexities of observing and interpreting high-latitude greening to identify priorities for future research. Incorporating satellite and proximal remote sensing with in-situ data, while accounting for uncertainties and scale issues, will advance the study of past, present and future Arctic vegetation change.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Ensemble-Based Machine Learning and Maximum Likelihood Methods for Mapping Seagrass Using Sentinel-2 Imagery in Tauranga Harbor, New Zealand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass has been acknowledged as a productive blue carbon ecosystem that is in significant decline across much of the world. A first step toward conservation is the mapping and monitoring of extant seagrass meadows. Several methods are currently in use, but mapping the resource from satellite images using machine learning is not widely applied, despite its successful use in various comparable applications. This research aimed to develop a novel approach for seagrass monitoring using state-of-the-art machine learning with data from Sentinel-2 imagery. We used Tauranga Harbor, New Zealand as a validation site for which extensive ground truth data are available to compare ensemble machine learning methods involving random forests (RF), rotation forests (RoF), and canonical correlation forests (CCF) with the more traditional maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) technique. Using a group of validation metrics including F1, precision, recall, accuracy, and the McNemar test, our results indicated that machine learning techniques outperformed the MLC with RoF as the best performer (F1 scores ranging from 0.75-0.91 for sparse and dense seagrass meadows, respectively). Our study is the first comparison of various ensemble-based methods for seagrass mapping of which we are aware, and promises to be an effective approach to enhance the accuracy of seagrass monitoring.

TI  - Land Cover Changes in Open-Cast Mining Complexes Based on High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technologies can play a fundamental role in the environmental assessment of open-cast mining and the accurate quantification of mine land rehabilitation efforts. Here, we developed a systematic geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach to map the amount of revegetated area and quantify the land use changes in open-cast mines in the Carajas region in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Based on high-resolution satellite images from 2011 to 2015 from different sensors (GeoEye, WorldView-3 and IKONOS), we quantified forests, cangas (natural metalliferous savanna ecosystems), mine land, revegetated areas and water bodies. Based on the GEOBIA approach, threshold values were established to discriminate land cover classes using spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and a light detection and range sensor (LiDAR) digital terrain model and slope map. The overall accuracy was higher than 90%, and the kappa indices varied between 0.82 and 0.88. During the observation period, the mining complex expanded, which led to the conversion of canga and forest vegetation to mine land. At the same time, the amount of revegetated area increased. Thus, we conclude that our approach is capable of providing consistent information regarding land cover changes in mines, with a special focus on the amount of revegetation necessary to fulfill environmental liabilities.

TI  - Influence of Model Grid Size on the Estimation of Surface Fluxes Using the Two Source Energy Balance Model and sUAS Imagery in Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable for hydrology and irrigation water management, with significant importance in drought-stricken regions of the western US. This is particularly true for California, which grows much of the high-value perennial crops in the US. The advent of small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) with sensor technology similar to satellite platforms allows for the estimation of high-resolution ET at plant spacing scale for individual fields. However, while multiple efforts have been made to estimate ET from sUAS products, the sensitivity of ET models to different model grid size/resolution in complex canopies, such as vineyards, is still unknown. The variability of row spacing, canopy structure, and distance between fields makes this information necessary because additional complexity processing individual fields. Therefore, processing the entire image at a fixed resolution that is potentially larger than the plant-row separation is more efficient. From a computational perspective, there would be an advantage to running models at much coarser resolutions than the very fine native pixel size from sUAS imagery for operational applications. In this study, the Two-Source Energy Balance with a dual temperature (TSEB2T) model, which uses remotely sensed soil/substrate and canopy temperature from sUAS imagery, was used to estimate ET and identify the impact of spatial domain scale under different vine phenological conditions. The analysis relies upon high-resolution imagery collected during multiple years and times by the Utah State University AggieAir(TM) sUAS program over a commercial vineyard located near Lodi, California. This project is part of the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Grape Remote Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). Original spectral and thermal imagery data from sUAS were at 10 cm and 60 cm per pixel, respectively, and multiple spatial domain scales (3.6, 7.2, 14.4, and 30 m) were evaluated and compared against eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Results indicated that the TSEB2T model is only slightly affected in the estimation of the net radiation (R-n) and the soil heat flux (G) at different spatial resolutions, while the sensible and latent heat fluxes (H and LE, respectively) are significantly affected by coarse grid sizes. The results indicated overestimation of H and underestimation of LE values, particularly at Landsat scale (30 m). This refers to the non-linear relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at coarse model resolution. Another predominant reason for LE reduction in TSEB2T was the decrease in the aerodynamic resistance (R-a), which is a function of the friction velocity (<mml:semantics>u*</mml:semantics>) that varies with mean canopy height and roughness length. While a small increase in grid size can be implemented, this increase should be limited to less than twice the smallest row spacing present in the sUAS imagery. The results also indicated that the mean LE at field scale is reduced by 10% to 20% at coarser resolutions, while the with-in field variability in LE values decreased significantly at the larger grid sizes and ranged between approximately 15% and 45%. This implies that, while the field-scale values of LE are fairly reliable at larger grid sizes, the with-in field variability limits its use for precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Labor Values and Labor Attitudes among Students of Secondary Vocational Schools in Nizhny Novgorod: as Revealed by the Sociological Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the results of the sociological survey of students of secondary vocational schools in Nizhny Novgorod (N-208 respondents).The research was conducted using a questionnaire survey. The research purpose was to identify labor values and attitudes, factors influencing professional choices and perception of labor as a value among students of secondary vocational schools. The choice of profession, educational institution, place of full-time and part-time work is dictated by the market economy realities. The national basic values are undergoing transformation. Socially useful activities and work for the benefit of society are shifted to the periphery in the youth worldview.

TI  - PAHs in the atmospheric aerosols and seawater in the North-West Pacific ocean and sea of Japan
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PAHs were analyzed in samples of atmospheric aerosols and suspended matter in seawater collected in the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk and the North-Western Pacific in June-July 2012. The concentrations of Sigma(15) PAHs in the suspended matter of seawater ranged between 1984.7 pg/L to 30260.3 pg/L. The concentration of Sigma(14) PAHs in marine aerosols ranged from 17.09 pg/m(3) on June 19-22, 2012 in the northern part of the Sea of Japan, the La Perouse Strait to 142.47 pg/m(3) on June 25-28, 2012 near middle Kuril Islands. The results of diagnostic ratios analysis indicate that the primary sources of PAH are pyrogenic. This paper discusses the main anthropogenic (coal-fired power plants and population) and natural sources (wildfires) of PAHs and their effect on the concentration of these compounds in the marine air and suspended matter of seawater. Long-range atmospheric transport of PAHs from the continent to the ocean is shown using HYSPLIT backward trajectories. Active fire products (MODIS and VIIRS) data were used to build a regression model. The model as a whole explains 58% and 75% of the Sigma 5-ring PAHs and BaP variations in seawater in June-July 2012, respectively. The analysis shows that anthropogenic sources were not a significant contribution factor for PAHs in the seawater at the Sea of Japan during this period.

TI  - Monitoring aboveground forest biomass dynamics over three decades using Landsat time-series and single-date inventory data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding forest biomass dynamics is crucial for carbon and environmental monitoring, especially in the context of climate change. In this study, we propose a robust approach for monitoring aboveground forest biomass (AGB) dynamics by combining Landsat time-series with single-date inventory data. We developed a Random Forest (RF) based kNN model to produce annual maps of AGB from 1988 to 2017 over 7.2 million ha of forests in Victoria, Australia. The model was internally evaluated using a bootstrapping technique. Predictions of AGB and its change were then independently evaluated using multi-temporal Lidar data (2008 and 2016). To understand how natural and anthropogenic processes impact forest AGB, we analysed trends in relation to the history of disturbance and recovery. Specifically, change metrics (e.g., AGB loss and gain, Years to Recovery Y2R) were calculated at the pixel level to characterise the patterns of AGB change resulting from forest dynamics. The imputation model achieved a RMSE value of 132.9 Mg ha(-1) (RMSE% = 46.3%) and R-2 value of 0.56. Independent assessments of prediction maps in 2008 and 2016 using Lidar-based AGB data achieved relatively high accuracies, with a RMSE of 108.6 Mg ha(-1) and 135.9 Mg ha(-1) for 2008 and 2016, respectively. Annual validations of AGB maps using un-changed, homogenous Lidar plots suggest that our model is transferable through time (RMSE ranging from 109.65 Mg ha(-1) to 112.27 Mg ha(-1) and RMSE% ranging from 25.38% to 25.99%). In addition, changes in AGB values associated with forest disturbance and recovery (decrease and increase, respectively) were captured by predicted maps. AGB change metrics indicate that AGB loss and Y2R varied across bioregions and were highly dependent on levels of disturbance severity (i.e., a greater loss and longer recovery time were associated with a higher severity disturbance). On average, high severity fire burnt from 200 Mg ha(-1) to 550 Mg ha(-1) of AGB and required up to 15 years to recover while clear-fell logging caused a reduction in 250 Mg ha(-1) to 600 Mg ha(-1) of AGB and required nearly 20 years to recover. In addition, AGB within un-disturbed forests showed statistically significant but monotonic trends, suggesting a mild gradual drop over time across most bioregions. Our methods are designed to support forest managers and researchers in developing forest monitoring systems, especially in developing regions, where only a single date forestry inventory exists.

TI  - An assessment of groundwater use in irrigated agriculture using multi-spectral remote sensing
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining water resources in dry regions requires sustainable groundwater management as trends indicate increasing groundwater use, but without accountability. The sustainability of groundwater is uncertain, as little is known about its extent and availability, a challenge that requires a quantitative assessment of its current use. This study assessed groundwater use for irrigated agriculture in the Venda-Gazankulu area of Limpopo Province in South Africa using crop evapotranspiration and irrigated crop area derived from the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Evapotranspiration data was derived from the Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed Actual Evapotranspiration and Interception (WaPOR) dataset (250 m resolution), and irrigated areas were characterised using dry season NDVI data derived from Landsat 8. Field surveys were conducted for four years to assess accuracy and for post-classification correction. Daily ET for the dry season (May to September) was developed from the actual ET for the irrigated areas. The irrigated areas were overlaid on the ET map to calculate ET for only irrigated land parcels. Groundwater use during the 2015 dry period was 3627.49 billion m(3) and the irrigated area during the same period was 26% of cultivated land. About 82 435 ha of cultivated area was irrigated using 44 million m(3)/ha of water, compared to 186.93 million m(3)/ha on a rainfed area of 237 847 ha. Groundwater management is essential for enhancing resilience in arid regions in the advent of water scarcity.

TI  - The Loewner Order and Direction of Detected Change in Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2 Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - When the covariance matrix formulation is used for multilook polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, the complex Wishart distribution can be used for change detection between acquisitions at two or more time points. Here, we are concerned with the analysis of change between two time points and the "direction" of change: Does the radar response increase, decrease, or does it change its structure/nature between the two time points? This is done by postprocessing/coprocessing the detected change with the Loewner order which calculates the definiteness of the difference of the covariance matrices at the two time points. We briefly describe the theory. Two case studies illustrate the technique on Sentinel-1 data covering the international Frankfurt Airport, Germany, and on Radarsat-2 data covering Bonn, Germany, and surroundings. We successfully demonstrate our "direction" of change approach to detected change areas.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy for Melanoma Patients with a Local Recurrence or In-Transit Metastasis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) is not routinely performed for melanoma patients with local recurrence (LR) or in-transit metastasis (ITM). This study aimed to describe the technique, findings, and prognostic value of this procedure, and the outcome for such patients at our institution.Methods. Prospectively collected data were obtained from the Melanoma Institute Australia database. Patients who had SNB for LR or ITM between 1992 and 2015 were included in the study. Patient and primary tumor characteristics, lymphoscintigrams, SNB results, and follow-up data were analyzed.Results. Overall, 7999 patients underwent SNB, 128 (1.6%) of whom met the selection criteria. The SNB procedure was performed for 85 of 1516 patients with LR (6%), 17 of 1671 patients with ITM from a known primary tumor (1%), and 26 of 170 patients who presented with ITM from an unknown primary site (15%). The SN identification rate was 100%. Metastatic melanoma was identified in an SN from 16 of the 128 patients (13%). Follow-up data were available for 114 patients. The false-negative rate was 27%. The SN-positive patients had significantly worse overall survival than the SN-negative patients, with respective 5-year survival rates of 54% and 81% (P = 0.01).Conclusion. The SNB procedure was performed infrequently for LR or ITM. The SNs were positive for 13% of the patients with LR or ITM. Positive SNs were associated with worse overall survival. Despite the false-negative rate of 27%, the procedure yielded information that was relevant for staging and prognosis. The SNB procedure should be considered for patients with LR or ITM.

TI  - Effect of lower stratospheric temperature on total ozone column (TOC) during the ozone depletion and recovery phases
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the Solar Back-scatter Ultraviolet merged ozone data during 1980-2016, the recovery of total ozone column (TOC) is examined in 5 degrees wide latitude bands from 65 degrees S to 65 degrees N across the globe. Since the variability of TOC is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic proxies, a multiple linear regression (MLR) is employed to remove the dynamic variability. Among the proxies, lower stratospheric temperature at similar to 100hPa plays a significant role in the dynamics of the TOC variability. The MLR model has significantly improved after including the lower stratospheric temperature along with other proxies and the standard deviation of the estimated TOC trend has significantly reduced about 35 to 43% in 50 degrees N-65 degrees N and 16 to 20% in 45 degrees S-65 degrees S after using the lower stratospheric temperature during both the depletion (1980-1996) and recovery (1997-2016) phases. Cooling of lower-middle stratospheric temperature are observed during the depletion phase with -0.09 degrees C to -0.02 degrees C year(-1). However, during the recovery phase, the temperature at the lower stratosphere is warming. Due to weak signals, the estimated warming trends are not statistically significant. The TOC trends are examined by the increasing or decreasing emission of chlorofluorocarbon, indicated by Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) index. During the recovery phase, the EESC varies from 0.82 +/- 0.01 to 0.29 +/- 0.005 DU year(-1) at 45-65 degrees S using the lower stratospheric temperature. In the northern hemisphere, the recovery trends are weak and varied from 0.21 +/- 0.004 to 0.25 +/- 0.005 DU year(-1) and these trends are statistically significant. This study suggests the importance of the lower stratospheric temperature to derive proper trends using the MLR model.

TI  - Artificial intelligence associated with satellite data in predicting energy potential in the Brazilian savanna woodland area
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of artificial intelligence to generate information of the savanna's energy capacity may support sustainable management of those areas. We assessed the efficacy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) combined with satellite data to estimate the energy potential (Pe) for cerradao, a dense savannah-like vegetation type in Brazil. We conducted a forest inventory for measuring dendrometric variables and sampling woody materials and barks in a cerradao area in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. The Pe of cerradao biomass was estimated based on the observed higher calorific power and drier biomass values. Six vegetation indices were retrieved from a RapidEye image and tested for correlation to choose the optimum vegetation index for biomass modeling. The basal area and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used as predictors in the Pe modeling. We estimated an average of 19.234 +/- 0.411 GJ ton(-1) and 19.878 +/- 1.090 GJ ton(-1) for higher heating values of the wood species and barks, respectively, and an average Pe of 1022.660 GJ ha(-1). The best ANN showed an error of 11.3% by using a structure of two, eight, and one neurons in the input layer, in the hidden layer, and in the output layer, respectively, as well as activation functions of the tangential and sigmoidal types. The validation tests showed no significant difference between the observed and ANN-predicted values. Based on our results, we concluded that Pe can be efficiently predicted by combining ANNs and remotely sensed data, which ultimately is a promising tool for forest sustainable management of the cerrado ecosystems.

TI  - The Impact of a New Set of IASI Channels on the Unified Model Global Precipitation Forecast
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to assess the impact of data assimilation with newly selected Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) channels on the global precipitation forecast, using the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) Unified Model (UM) system. The new IASI channels assimilated under the clear-sky condition give a positive impact on the global precipitation forecast, shown in the trial experiments. In particular, the overestimated horizontal size of forecasted precipitation in the control run with operational IASI channels significantly decreases in the experimental trial with the newly selected channels. In addition, the moist biases of moisture field in the model analysis as an initial condition are substantially reduced in the experiment run. Considering that the moisture in the troposphere is a main source of precipitation, the reduction of moist biases in the troposphere seems to contribute to the improvement of precipitation forecast in the UM system. Therefore, these results suggest that the improved moisture field even over clear areas is able to enhance the precipitation forecast accuracy. And because the difference between two trial runs is only a set of IASI channels used in the UM data assimilation system, the improved precipitation forecast is likely to due to the use of different H2O channels in the new set of IASI channel used in the experiment run, which are sensitive to the tropospheric water vapor.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Change in Land Surface Temperature for a Long-Term Sequence in Africa (2003-2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very important to understand the temporal and spatial variations of land surface temperature (LST) in Africa to determine the effects of temperature on agricultural production. Although thermal infrared remote sensing technology can quickly obtain surface temperature information, it is greatly affected by clouds and rainfall. To obtain a complete and continuous dataset on the spatiotemporal variations in LST in Africa, a reconstruction model based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST time series and ground station data was built to refactor the LST dataset (2003-2017). The first step in the reconstruction model is to filter low-quality LST pixels contaminated by clouds and then fill the pixels using observation data from ground weather stations. Then, the missing pixels are interpolated using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method. The evaluation shows that the accuracy between reconstructed LST and ground station data is high (root mean square er-ror (RMSE) = 0.84 degrees C, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.75 degrees C and correlation coefficient (R) = 0.91). The spatiotemporal analysis of the LST indicates that the change in the annual average LST from 2003-2017 was weak and the warming trend in Africa was remarkably uneven. Geographically, "the warming is more pronounced in the north and the west than in the south and the east". The most significant warming occurred near the equatorial region in South Africa (slope > 0.05, R > 0.61, p < 0.05) and the central (slope = 0.08, R = 0.89, p < 0.05) regions, and a nonsignificant decreasing trend occurred in Botswana. Additionally, the mid-north region (north of Chad, north of Niger and south of Algeria) became colder (slope > -0.07, R = 0.9, p < 0.05), with a nonsignificant trend. Seasonally, significant warming was more pronounced in winter, mostly in the west, especially in Mauritania (slope > 0.09, R > 0.9, p < 0.5). The response of the different types of surface to the surface temperature has shown variability at different times, which provides important information to understand the effects of temperature changes on crop yields, which is critical for the planning of agricultural farming systems in Africa.

TI  - Metastatic Conditioning of Myeloid Cells at a Subcutaneous Synthetic Niche Reflects Disease Progression and Predicts Therapeutic Outcomes
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring metastatic events in distal tissues is challenged by their sporadic occurrence in obscure and inaccessible locations within these vital organs. A synthetic biomaterial scaffold can function as a synthetic metastatic niche to reveal the nature of these distal sites. These implanted scaffolds promote tissue ingrowth, which upon cancer initiation is transformed into a metastatic niche that captures aggressive circulating tumor cells. We hypothesized that immune cell phenotypes at synthetic niches reflect the immunosuppressive conditioning within a host that contributes to metastatic cell recruitment and can identify disease progression and response to therapy. We analyzed the expression of 632 immune-centric genes in tissue biopsied from implants at weekly intervals following inoculation. Specific immune populations within implants were then analyzed by single-cell RNA-seq. Dynamic gene expression profiles in innate cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, suggest the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. These dynamics in immune phenotypes at implants was analogous to that in the diseased lung and had distinct dynamics compared with blood leukocytes. Following a therapeutic excision of the primary tumor, longitudinal tracking of immune phenotypes at the implant in individual mice showed an initial response to therapy, which over time differentiated recurrence versus survival. Collectively, the microenvironment at the synthetic niche acts as a sentinel by reflecting both progression and regression of disease.Significance: Immune dynamics at biomaterial implants, functioning as a synthetic metastatic niche, provides unique information that correlates with disease progression.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Impact of Temperature Storage Conditions of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Eggs on Parasitism by <i>Anastatus reduvii</i> (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal, is an invasive species of Asian origin that is an important agricultural pest in the eastern United States. Sentinel egg masses are tools used to assess the impact of natural enemies on H. halys populations. To determine the effect of host egg age and storage conditions on their susceptibility to parasitism, H. halys eggs were stored at different temperatures for different lengths of time and then exposed to Anastatus reduvii (Howard), a native natural enemy of H. halys occurring in eastern North America. For eggs stored at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C and then exposed to A. reduvii, the number of host eggs from which parasitoid offspring emerged declined with age of eggs. Control eggs (exposed to parasitoids without being stored) and those eggs stored for only 5.5 degree-days (DD) (=0.5 days) at 25 degrees C yielded the highest percentage of parasitoids at 88.2 and 88.3%, respectively. For eggs stored at 20 and 25 degrees C for 7.3 DD to about 36 DD, offspring emerged from about 58 to 73% of eggs, and total parasitism (emerged + unemerged parasitoids) ranged from about 70 to 80%. Parasitoid emergence was significantly lower for host eggs stored at 15 degrees C for comparable times at 20 and 25 degrees C. Stink bugs nymphs hatched from <0.6% of all eggs. Parasitoid-induced host egg abortion was an important component of egg mortality caused by A. reduvii, with underdeveloped stink bug nymphs, undifferentiated cell contents, and parasitoid host feeding occurring across all storage treatments.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Monitoring of air pollution is an important task in public health. Availability of data is often hindered by the paucity of the ground monitoring station network. We present here a new spatio-temporal dataset collected and processed from the Sentinel 5P remote sensing platform. As an example application, we applied the full workflow to process measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) collected over the territory of mainland France from May 2018 to June 2019. The data stack generated is daily measurements at a 4 x 7 km spatial resolution. The supplementary Python code package used to collect and process the data is made publicly available. The dataset provided in this article is of value for policy-makers and health assessment. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Tree cover mapping based on Sentinel-2 images demonstrate high thematic accuracy in Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution of trees has a large impact on human health and the environment through contributions to important climate mechanisms as well as commercial, recreational and social activities in society. A range of tree mapping methodologies has been presented in the literature, but tree cover estimates still differ widely between the individual datasets, and comparisons of the thematic accuracy of the resulting tree maps are rather scarce. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, which were launched in 2015 and 2017, have a combination of high spatial and temporal resolution. Given that this is a new satellite, a substantial amount of research on development of tree mapping algorithms as well as accuracy assessment of said algorithms have to be done in the years to come. To contribute to this process, a tree map produced through unsupervised classification was created for six Sentinel-2 tiles. The agreement between the tree map and the corresponding national forest inventory, as a function of the band combination chosen, was analysed and the thematic accuracy was assessed for two out of the six tiles. The results show that the highest agreement between the present tree map and the national forest inventory was found for bands 2, 3, 6 and 12. The present tree map has a relative difference in tree cover between 8% and 79% compared to previous estimates, but results are characterised by large scatter. Lastly, it is shown that the overall thematic accuracy of the present map is up to 90%, with the user's accuracy ranging from 34.85% to 92.10%, and the producer's accuracy ranging from 23.80% to 97.60% for the various thematic classes. This demonstrates that tree maps with high thematic accuracy can be produced from Sentinel-2. In the future the thematic accuracy can be increased even more through the use of temporal averaging in the mapping procedure, which will enable an accurate estimate of the European tree cover.

TI  - Changes Detection of Ice Dimension in Cheonji, Baekdu Mountain Using Sentinel-1 Image Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cheonji, the largest caldera lake in Asia, is located at the summit of Baekdu Mountain. Cheonji is covered with snow and ice for about six months of the year due to its high altitude and its surrounding environment. Since most of the sources of water are from groundwater, the water temperature is closely related to the volcanic activity. However, in the 2000s, many volcanic activities have been monitored on the mountain. In this study, we analyzed the dimension of ice produced during winter in Baekdu Mountain using Sentinel-1 satellite image data provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). In order to calculate the dimension of ice from the backscatter image of the Sentinel-1 satellite, 20 Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) layers were generated from two polarization images using texture analysis. The method used in calculating the area was utilized with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the GLCM layer which is to calculate the dimension of ice in the image. Also, the calculated area was correlated with temperature data obtained from Samjiyeon weather station. This study could be used as a basis for suggesting an alternative to the new method of calculating the area of ice before using a long-term time series analysis on a full scale.

TI  - Deformation due to geothermal exploitation at Reykjanes, Iceland
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation in utilized geothermal areas is often attributed either to pressure decrease or temperature decrease in the geothermal reservoir. A new geothermal power plant at Reykjanes began operation in May 2006 and local deformation caused by geothermal utilization was observed shortly thereafter. We use images acquired by the Envisat and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellites, between 2003 and 2016, as well as available GNSS data, to derive constraints on the cumulative ground displacement at the Reykjanes geothermal area. Iceland, and compare these results to production data acquired from observation wells in this region. We employ interferometric analysis of synthetic aperture satellite radar images (InSAR), using a combined persistent scatterer and small baseline approach, on both ascending and descending Envisat and TSX satellite tracks covering the 2003-2016 period. Time series of range change along line-of-sight (LOS) from the ground to the satellite show the characteristics of on-going ground deflation in the vicinity of the Reykjanes power plant. In the 2005-2008 period, the main area of deformation was 4 km long by 2.5 km wide, aligned along the Reykjanes fissure swarm, but in the period 2009-2016 it is more circular in shape and similar to 2 km wide. LOS displacement rates have remained relatively steady in time, although slightly faster in the 2005-2008 period than the 2009-2016 period. The average LOS velocities from ascending and descending tracks are decomposed into estimates of near-vertical and near-east displacements. The inferred maximum subsidence since the start of production is similar to 260 mm. Horizontal displacements show contraction towards the center of deflation of up to similar to 140 mm. Geodetic modeling is undertaken using sources of simple geometry within an elastic halfspace to determine the optimal sources for the observed contraction throughout 2005-2016. For the earlier period modeled utilizing ENVISAT interferograms (16 June 2005-16 August 2008) the optimal source is a Yang model with a strike of 58 degrees and a source depth of 22 km. The calculated volume change associated with the observed contraction is -23 x 10(6) m(3). For the latter period, utilizing TSX interferograms (24 September 2009-17 August 2016), the preferred source is a Mogi-type model at a depth of 12 km and the modeled volume change is -1 x 10(6) m(3).

TI  - A Simple Method to Identify Potential Groundwater-Dependent Vegetation Using NDVI MODIS
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential groundwater-dependent vegetation (pGDV) in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) was mapped, with a simple method, hereafter referred to as SRS-pGDV, that uses only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra V6 product, covering the period February 2000 to April 2018. NDVI was standardized, to minimize the effect of the different land cover types. The extreme drought event of 2004/2005 was used to perform the classification. Considering the water scarcity that affected vegetation in the IP during this event, it was postulated that vegetation showing a high standardized NDVI should be classified as pGDV. Irrigated vegetation and areas with sparse vegetation were eliminated. A cluster analysis was performed, in order to classify the pixels as more/less likely to be pGDV. The results obtained were compared with modeled water table depth, and a propensity of pixels identified as pGDV in areas with low water table depth was clearly observed. However, based on CORINE Land Cover types, some areas identified as pGDV are likely irrigated, such as fruit-tree plantations; this inference is in line with the postulated criterion of vegetation access to sources of water other than precipitation. SRS-pGDV could also be applied to regional studies, using NDVI with a higher spatial resolution.

TI  - GRACE-based Mass Conservation as a Validation Target for Basin-Scale Evapotranspiration in the Contiguous United States
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we evaluate basin-scale evapotranspiration (ET) estimates for eleven major river basins in the contiguous United States against a water balance approach with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations. The relatively precise measurements of large-scale changes in water mass from GRACE are used to estimate the storage rate term in the terrestrial water budget and consequently provide an estimate, with propagated uncertainty, of basin-aggregated ET from mass conservation. We apply GRACE-based ET to two modeling systems (NLDAS-2 and GLDAS-2.1) comprised of five land surface models and three remote sensing-based products (MOD16, PT-JPL, and FLUXCOM) for 2003 to 2014. Both the land surface model-based and remote sensing-based ET are persistently lower than GRACE-based ET in all eleven basins tested. We also find that interannual variability is greater for GRACE-ET than the model and remote sensing products, and this is attributed to precipitation variability.

TI  - Characterizing Land Surface Phenology and Exotic Annual Grasses in Dryland Ecosystems Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data in Harmony
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive annual grasses, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), have proliferated in dryland ecosystems of the western United States, promoting increased fire activity and reduced biodiversity that can be detrimental to socio-environmental systems. Monitoring exotic annual grass cover and dynamics over large areas requires the use of remote sensing that can support early detection and rapid response initiatives. However, few studies have leveraged remote sensing technologies and computing frameworks capable of providing rangeland managers with maps of exotic annual grass cover at relatively high spatiotemporal resolutions and near real-time latencies. Here, we developed a system for automated mapping of invasive annual grass (%) cover using in situ observations, harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data, maps of biophysical variables, and machine learning techniques. A robust and automated cloud, cloud shadow, water, and snow/ice masking procedure (mean overall accuracy >81%) was implemented using time-series outlier detection and data mining techniques prior to spatiotemporal interpolation of HLS data via regression tree models (r = 0.94; mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.02). Weekly, cloud-free normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image composites (2016-2018) were used to construct a suite of spectral and phenological metrics (e.g., start and end of season dates), consistent with information derived from Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. These metrics were incorporated into a data mining framework that accurately (r = 0.83; MAE = 11) modeled and mapped exotic annual grass (%) cover throughout dryland ecosystems in the western United States at a native, 30-m spatial resolution. Our results show that inclusion of weekly HLS time-series data and derived indicators improves our ability to map exotic annual grass cover, as compared to distribution models that use MODIS products or monthly, seasonal, or annual HLS composites as primary inputs. This research fills a critical gap in our ability to effectively assess, manage, and monitor drylands by providing a framework that allows for an accurate and timely depiction of land surface phenology and exotic annual grass cover at spatial and temporal resolutions that are meaningful to local resource managers.

TI  - An Evaluation of Safety and Patient Outcomes for Hand Surgery following Prior Breast Cancer Treatment: Establishing New Recommendations in Lymphedema
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Injuries to the upper extremity lymphatic system from cancer may require measures to prevent secondary lymphedema. Guidelines were established relating to the use of tourniquet and elective hand and upper extremity surgery. However, reports in the setting of hand surgery have indicated that prior guidelines may not be protective to the patient.Methods:The study systematically reviewed the current literature evaluating elective hand surgery in breast cancer patients. The authors evaluated the risk of complications, including new or worsening lymphedema and infection.Results:One hundred ninety-eight abstracts were identified, and a bibliographic review was performed. Nine studies pertained to our subject, and four were included for final review. All studies included patients with prior breast cancer treatment involving breast surgery and axillary lymph node dissection. Pneumatic tourniquets were used during nearly all operations. Patients without presurgery ipsilateral lymphedema had a 2.7 percent incidence of developing new lymphedema and a 0.7 percent rate of postoperative infection. Patients with presurgery lymphedema had a 11.1 percent incidence of worsening lymphedema and a 16.7 percent rate of infection. However, all cases of new or exacerbated lymphedema resolved within 3 months. Tourniquet use was not found to increase rates of lymphedema.Conclusions:Based on the available evidence, there is no increased risk of complications for elective hand surgery in patients with prior breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer patients with preexisting ipsilateral lymphedema carry slightly increased risk of postoperative infection and worsening lymphedema. It is the authors' opinion and recommendation that elective hand surgery with a tourniquet is not a contradiction in patients who have received previous breast cancer treatments.

TI  - Landscape Representation by a Permanent Forest Plot and Alternative Plot Designs in a Typhoon Hotspot, Fushan, Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent forest dynamics plots have provided valuable insights into many aspects of forest ecology. The evaluation of their representativeness within the landscape is necessary to understanding the limitations of findings from permanent plots at larger spatial scales. Studies on the representativeness of forest plots with respect to landscape heterogeneity and disturbance effect have already been carried out, but knowledge of how multiple disturbances affect plot representativeness is lacking-particularly in sites where several disturbances can occur between forest plot censuses. This study explores the effects of five typhoon disturbances on the Fushan Forest Dynamics Plot (FFDP) and its surrounding landscape, the Fushan Experimental Forest (FEF), in Taiwan where typhoons occur annually. The representativeness of the FFDP for the FEF was studied using four topographical variables derived from a digital elevation model and two vegetation indices (VIs), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), calculated from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+, and Landsat-8 OLI data. Representativeness of four alternative plot designs were tested by dividing the FFDP into subplots over wider elevational ranges. Results showed that the FFDP neither represents landscape elevational range (<10%) nor vegetation cover (<7% of the interquartile range, IQR). Although disturbance effects (i.e., Delta VIs) were also different between the FFDP and the FEF, comparisons showed no under- or over-exposure to typhoon damage frequency or intensity within the FFDP. In addition, the Delta VIs were of the same magnitudes in the plots and the reserve, and the plot covered 30% to 75.9% of IQRs of the reserve Delta VIs. Unexpectedly, the alternative plot designs did not lead to increased representation of damage for 3 out of the 4 tested typhoons and they did not suggest higher representativeness of rectangular vs. square plots. Based on the comparison of mean Euclidian distances, two rectangular plots had smaller distances than four square or four rectangular plots of the same area. Therefore, this study suggests that the current FFDP provides a better representation of its landscape disturbances than alternatives, which contained wider topographical variation and would be more difficult to conduct ground surveys. However, upscaling needs to be done with caution as, in the case of the FEF, plot representativeness varied among typhoons.

TI  - Groundwater use and rapid irrigation expansion in a changing climate: Hydrological drivers in one of the world's food bowls
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, increased groundwater use enabled a large areal increase in irrigated dry season crops in northwest Bangladesh. Concurrent declining groundwater levels across the region are of great concern for food security. A water balance model approach that considered changes in irrigated agriculture was implemented to assess changes over the long-term to three five-year evaluation periods (1985-1989, 1998-2002 and 2011-2015) and seasonally (annual, dry season and wet season). The model used two different methods that explicitly capture changes in irrigation to compute and compare actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The first method used MODIS satellite data to estimate a crop coefficient based on vegetation indices (at 500 m spatial resolution) scaled by reference crop evapotranspiration (ETref). The second method used a crop coefficient approach based on survey data of crop areas at the district level and subsequently scaled by ETref. Both methods yielded very similar results at the district level, with correlation coefficients between 0.75 and 0.89. The maximum difference between the monthly averages was only of 5.4%. Notwithstanding the observed overall increase in irrigated areas, estimated overall mean annual ETa is similar through the analysis (ca. 1100 mm) and district-level trends were mixed (some increasing and some decreasing) showing in some districts a weak association between ETa and the related declining groundwater level. From the water balance, it is inferred that both the groundwater extraction (by pumping for irrigation and capillary rise to supply roots) and the groundwater recharge reduced from 1998-2002 to 2011-2015, and with deeper groundwater in later years, much of the irrigation water supply is by soil water storage rather than by groundwater. As highlighted in this paper, there are other factors aside crop expansion that may have contributed to the groundwater decline, thus a single policy or management change such as restricting groundwater extraction for irrigation may alone be inadequate to reverse declining groundwater trends.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-3A SAR mode sea level anomalies around the Australian coastal region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode sea level anomalies (SLAs) of Sentinel-3A altimetry mission around the Australian coastal region were validated using eight in situ tide gauge sea level records and retracked Jason-3 datasets from a modified Brown-peaky (MBP) retracker. The MBP is a modified version of our existing Brown-peaky retracker aimed at enhancing BP's performance. We compared the noise of Sentinel-3A SLAs averaged across three posting rates (i.e. 1 Hz, 2 Hz and 4 Hz) with the 1 Hz noise of MBP-derived Jason-3 SLAs. At distances >10 km from the coast, the noise level of 1 Hz Sentinel-3A SLAs (similar to 1.2 cm) is lower than that of the MBP-retracked Jason-3 SLAs (similar to 1.7 cm). Moreover, the noise level of 2 Hz Sentinel-3A SLAs is comparable to that of the 1 Hz MBP-derived Jason-3 dataset, indicating that Sentinel-3A can provide precise SLAs at finer spatial scales. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of differences between the tide gauge SLA time series and the equivalent SLA time series at each along-track altimeter point was used to assess pointwise data quality. For both Sentinel-3A and MBP-retracked Jason-3, the along-track RMSEs of 20 Hz SLAs vary between 0.05 m and 0.2 m. The mean and standard deviation (STD) of 1 Hz SLA differences at crossover points were computed for each individual altimetry mission to assess overall data quality. When compared with the crossover analysis results, the quality of Sentinel-3A SLAs is superior to that of the retracked Jason-3 dataset in terms of smaller STDs at crossover points (8.8 cm vs. 10.7 cm).

TI  - Population density and habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) during the rainy season in the Colombian Orinoquia.
T2  - Biblioteca Jose Jeronimo Triana
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to generate relevant information for deer conservation and management in Colombia, estimations of white-tailed deer population size densities are needed, as well as information on habitat preferences. This study was conducted during the rainy season at two sites of natural flooded savannas in the Colombian Orinoco region (Taparas and Miramar). These two sites differ in configuration of vegetation cover and water availability. At each site we estimated deer population density using line transects between 3 toWhite-tailed deer population density varies greatly throughout its range because of environmental factors as well as interactions with other species. In the Neotropics, the largest abundances occur in mixed habitats of natural savannas and forests on terrain with gradual slopes and located near water sources. In Colombia white-tailed deer abundance is poorly known. However, the few available records indicate that deer populations have decreased and only remnant populations persist in the highlands of the Andes and the lowlands of the Orinoco regions. 5 km long located 1500 m apart from each other, in an area of 3600 ha. The summed distance of the line transects (four in Taparas and six in Miramar) were 63.45 km and 51.78 km respectively. For this study we considered each type of vegetation cover as a different habitat type, the areas of which were estimated by supervised classification of Landsat images, at a scale of 1: 25,000. We used this information as a measure of the availably of each habitat type. We counted 641 deer in Taparas and 240 deer in Miramar. Population density was higher in Taparas (43.3 deer/km2) than in Miramar 13.3 deer/km2). We identified six types of vegetation cover in the study area with dispersed pajonal, dense pajonal and open savannas being the dominant types. In both sites, deer exhibited a preference for dispersed pajonales, but they used shrubs and open savannas as well. Deer population densities estimated in this study are similar to those found in other open ecosystems, such as paramo (highlands) and deciduous tropical forest. A higher heterogeneity in the landscape configuration and mainly greater water availability explain the higher deer density found at Taparas relative to Miramar. Differences in the reported habitat use suggest that vegetation cover types provide complementarity resources to meet the deers' requirements. Shrub cover provides food and thermal protection, as well as protection from predators, while the dispersed pajonal provides complementary food sources.

TI  - Characterizing Uncertainty in Forest Remote Sensing Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This discussion paper addresses (1) the challenge of concisely reporting uncertainties in forest remote sensing (RS) studies, primarily conducted at plot and stand level, and (2) the influence of reference data errors and how corrections for such errors can be made. Different common ways of reporting uncertainties are discussed, and a parametric error model is proposed as a core part of a comprehensive approach for reporting uncertainties (compared to, e.g., conventional reporting of root mean square error (RMSE)). The importance of handling reference data errors is currently increasing since estimates derived from RS data are becoming increasingly accurate; in extreme cases the accuracies of RS- and field-based estimates are of equal magnitude and there is a risk that reported RS accuracies are severely misjudged due to inclusion of errors from the field reference data. Novel methods for correcting for some types of reference data errors are proposed, both for the conventional RMSE uncertainty metric and for the case when a parametric error model is applied. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper is demonstrated using real data from a typical RS study where airborne laser scanning and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are applied for estimating biomass at the level of forest stands. With the proposed correction method, the RMSE for the RS-based estimates from laser scanning was reduced from 50.5 to 49.5 tons/ha when errors in the field references were properly accounted for. The RMSE for the estimates from SAR data was reduced from 28.5 to 26.1 tons/ha.

TI  - Multi-Spatial Resolution Satellite and sUAS Imagery for Precision Agriculture on Smallholder Farms in Malawi
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A collection of spectral indices, derived from a range of remote sensing imagery spatial resolutions, are compared to on-farm measurements of maize chlorophyll content and yield at two trial farms in central Malawi to evaluate what spatial resolutions are most effective for relating multispectral images with crop status. Single and multiple linear regressions were tested for spatial resolutions ranging from 7 cm to 20 m using a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and satellite imagery from Planet, SPOT 6, Pleiades, and Sentinel-2. Results suggest that imagery with spatial resolutions nearer the maize plant scale (i.e., 14-27 cm) are most effective for relating spectral signals with crop health on smallholder farms in Malawi. Consistent with other studies, green-band indices were more strongly correlated with maize chlorophyll content and yield than conventional red-band indices, and multivariable models often outperformed single variable models.

TI  - Morphometric Characterization of Longitudinal Striae on Martian Landslides and Impact Ejecta Blankets and Implications for the Formation Mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Longitudinal striae are a shared characteristic of long run-out landslides and layered ejecta crater deposits. They appear to be a fundamental feature of disintegrated mass flows, but their formation and the required conditions are poorly understood. We evaluated their similarity using spectral analysis and assessed the possibility of a common formation mechanism. The topography of striae is scale-invariant in the form of a power law relationship of the power spectrum and the derived spectral exponent and amplitude factor, which are a measure for roughness, show similar correlations on both types of deposit. There is no correlation to geologic substrate units, latitude, or age. Parameter values are isotropic in horizontal direction for ejecta deposits and show a weak anisotropy for landslide deposits. Spectral parameter values of substrate topography match well with the values of the superposed deposit, which indicates that roughness is transferred from substrate to deposit surface during emplacement. Testing different geometric models, we find that a simple superposition of topography with a semideterministic, anisotropic pattern does not reproduce the patterns of our data. We find that phase locking of a surface with scale-invariant properties creates striae with fractal properties close to our natural data sets as well as recreating other morphological features that can form alongside striae. Although the transferal of substrate roughness cannot be fully conciliated with conventional flow models, we find that a model that combines advection with lateral diffusion accounts for the unidirectional preservation of phase information and is also consistent with the scale-invariance of striae.Plain Language SummaryLongitudinal striae are a prominent surface feature of many types of mass movements, for example, long run-out landslides on Mars and Earth and layered ejecta crater deposits. It is unclear how they form or whether they form by the same process on the different types of deposits. Using high-resolution remote-sensing data of pristine Martian landslides and layered ejecta craters, we find that the similar appearance of striae can be confirmed by shared morphometric properties. Fourier methods reveal a scale-invariant topography where the roughness of longitudinal and perpendicular profiles is surprisingly similar. It is even similar to the roughness of the topography outside the striated regions, so that it may be inherited from the underlying substrate. This weak anisotropy in roughness cannot be responsible for the distinct pattern of striae. The latter is probably related to the phases of the Fourier components rather than to the amplitudes that are responsible for the roughness. These characteristics include scale-invariance, weakly anisotropic fractal properties and a roughness that appears to be transferred from the substrate. Testing of formation models shows that a formation process that conserves phase information of topography is most consistent with our data. We suggest that a flow process that combines advection with lateral diffusion of topography can enable phase locking and is also consistent with the fractal properties of striae.

TI  - Forecasting experiences associated with supercells over South-Western Poland on July 7, 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On July 7th, 2017 numerous supercells affected the south - western part of Poland. Significant hail, severe wind gusts and one - tornado of estimated F2 intensity on the Fujita scale were reported. Thunderstorms developed in a warm sector within the low pressure trough. Moderate to high - shear and low to moderate buoyant environmental conditions led to rapid formation of supercells. The main aim of the study was to examine meteorological conditions which result in severe storms and to validate their projections in meteorological models.Supercells were detected with the use of the Polish radar system "POLRAD" run by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute (IMGW). Additionally, geostationary and polar satellite data were used in the study. The data were provided by NOAA and METEOSAT. Surface and upper air meteorological conditions were obtained from hourly observations from synoptic stations in Poland and atmospheric soundings from Lindenberg, Prague, Wroclaw and Prostejov. High - resolution models AROME, COSMO and the mesoscale model ALARO were analysed. The examination of the radar and satellite data yielded an abundance of sharp and classic severe convection signatures as a bounded weak echo region (BWER), hook echo and radial velocity couplets. The most intensive supercells lasted > 2.5 h, with tops reaching 12 km, and reflectivity up to 67 dBz. Operational runs of ALARO, AROME and COSMO showed favourable for severe convection values of instability and wind shear. However, the models incorrectly simulated convection as multicellular and displaced it significantly.

TI  - Assessment of Multi-Scale SMOS and SMAP Soil Moisture Products across the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, technological advances led to the launch of two satellite missions dedicated to measure the Earth's surface soil moisture (SSM): the ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) launched in 2009, and the NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) launched in 2015. The two satellites have an L-band microwave radiometer on-board to measure the Earth's surface emission. These measurements (brightness temperatures T-B) are then used to generate global maps of SSM every three days with a spatial resolution of about 30-40 km and a target accuracy of 0.04 m(3)/m(3). To meet local applications needs, different approaches have been proposed to spatially disaggregate SMOS and SMAP T-B or their SSM products. They rely on synergies between multi-sensor observations and are built upon different physical assumptions. In this study, temporal and spatial characteristics of six operational SSM products derived from SMOS and SMAP are assessed in order to diagnose their distinct features, and the rationale behind them. The study is focused on the Iberian Peninsula and covers the period from April 2015 to December 2017. A temporal inter-comparison analysis is carried out using in situ SSM data from the Soil Moisture Measurements Station Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) to evaluate the impact of the spatial scale of the different products (1, 3, 9, 25, and 36 km), and their correspondence in terms of temporal dynamics. A spatial analysis is conducted for the whole Iberian Peninsula with emphasis on the added-value that the enhanced resolution products provide based on the microwave-optical (SMOS/ERA5/MODIS) or the active-passive microwave (SMAP/Sentinel-1) sensor fusion. Our results show overall agreement among time series of the products regardless their spatial scale when compared to in situ measurements. Still, higher spatial resolutions would be needed to capture local features such as small irrigated areas that are not dominant at the 1-km pixel scale. The degree to which spatial features are resolved by the enhanced resolution products depend on the multi-sensor synergies employed (at T-B or soil moisture level), and on the nature of the fine-scale information used. The largest disparities between these products occur in forested areas, which may be related to the reduced sensitivity of high-resolution active microwave and optical data to soil properties under dense vegetation.

TI  - Landsat Analysis Ready Data for Global Land Cover and Land Cover Change Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-decadal Landsat data record is a unique tool for global land cover and land use change analysis. However, the large volume of the Landsat image archive and inconsistent coverage of clear-sky observations hamper land cover monitoring at large geographic extent. Here, we present a consistently processed and temporally aggregated Landsat Analysis Ready Data produced by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery team at the University of Maryland (GLAD ARD) suitable for national to global empirical land cover mapping and change detection. The GLAD ARD represent a 16-day time-series of tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to present, updated annually, and designed for land cover monitoring at global to local scales. A set of tools for multi-temporal data processing and characterization using machine learning provided with GLAD ARD serves as an end-to-end solution for Landsat-based natural resource assessment and monitoring. The GLAD ARD data and tools have been implemented at the national, regional, and global extent for water, forest, and crop mapping. The GLAD ARD data and tools are available at the GLAD website for free access.

TI  - Global Assimilation of Ocean-Color Data of Phytoplankton Functional Types: Impact of Different Data Sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton functional-type (PFT) data are assimilated into the global coupled ocean-ecosystem model MITgcm-REcoM2 for two years using a local ensemble Kalman filter. The ecosystem model has two PFTs: small phytoplankton (SP) and diatoms. Three different sets of satellite PFT data are assimilated: Ocean-Color-Phytoplankton Functional Type (OC-PFT), Phytoplankton Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (PhytoDOAS), and SYNergistic exploitation of hyper- and multi-spectral precursor SENtinel measurements to determine Phytoplankton Functional Types (SynSenPFT), which is a synergistic product combining the independent PFT products OC-PFT and PhytoDOAS. The effect of assimilating PFT data is compared with the assimilation of total chlorophyll data (TChla), which constrains both PFTs through multivariate assimilation. While the assimilation of TChla already improves both PFTs, the assimilation of PFT data further improves the representation of the phytoplankton community. The effect is particularly large for diatoms where, compared to the assimilation of TChla, the SynSenPFT assimilation results in 57% and 67% reduction of root-mean-square error and bias, respectively, while the correlation is increased from 0.45 to 0.54. For SP the assimilation of SynSenPFT data reduces the root-mean-square error and bias by 14% each and increases the correlation by 30%. The separate assimilation of the PFT data products OC-PFT, SynSenPFT, and joint assimilation of OC-PFT and PhytoDOAS data leads to similar results while the assimilation of PhytoDOAS data alone leads to deteriorated SP but improved diatoms. When both OC-PFT and PhytoDOAS data are jointly assimilated, the representation of diatoms is improved compared to the assimilation of only OC-PFT. The results show slightly lower errors than when the synergistic SynSenPFT data are assimilated, which shows that the assimilation successfully combines the separate data sources.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - One of the foci of the Forum for Artic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) project is improving Arctic regional ice-ocean models and understanding of physical processes regulating variability of Arctic environmental conditions based on synthesis of observations and model results. The Beaufort Gyre, centered in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean, is an ideal phenomenon and natural laboratory for application of FAMOS modeling capabilities to resolve numerous scientific questions related to the origin and variability of this climatologic freshwater reservoir and flywheel of the Arctic Ocean. The unprecedented volume of data collected in this region is nearly optimal to describe the state and changes in the Beaufort Gyre environmental system at synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales. The in situ and remote sensing data characterizing ocean hydrography, sea surface heights, ice drift, concentration and thickness, ocean circulation, and biogeochemistry have been used for model calibration and validation or assimilated for historic reconstructions and establishing initial conditions for numerical predictions. This special collection of studies contributes time series of the Beaufort Gyre data; new methodologies in observing, modeling, and analysis; interpretation of measurements and model output; and discussions and findings that shed light on the mechanisms regulating Beaufort Gyre dynamics as it transitions to a new state under different climate forcing.

TI  - An Automatic Processing Chain for Near Real-Time Mapping of Burned Forest Areas Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fully automated processing chain for near real-time mapping of burned forest areas using Sentinel-2 multispectral data is presented. The acronym AUTOBAM (AUTOmatic Burned Areas Mapper) is used to denote it. AUTOBAM is conceived to work daily at a national scale for the Italian territory to support the Italian Civil Protection Department in the management of one of the major natural hazards, which affects the territory. The processing chain includes a Sentinel-2 data procurement component, an image processing algorithm, and the delivery of the map to the end-user. The data procurement component searches every day for the most updated products into different archives. The image processing part represents the core of AUTOBAM and implements an algorithm for burned forest areas mapping that uses, as fundamental parameters, the relativized form of the delta normalized burn ratio and the normalized difference vegetation index. The minimum mapping unit is 1 ha. The algorithm implemented in the image processing block is validated off-line using maps of burned areas produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The results of the validation shows an overall accuracy (considering the classes of burned and unburned areas) larger than 95% and a kappa coefficient larger than 80%. For what concerns the class of burned areas, the commission error is around 1%-3%, except for one case where it reaches 25%, while the omission error ranges between 6% and 25%.

T2  - HUMAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Kanaka Maoli (Indigenous Hawaiians) are blessed with a written literature that documents observations and relationships with their environment in the form of chants, stories, and genealogies passed down orally for centuries. These literatures connect them to their ancestral knowledge and highlight species, places, and processes of importance. Such sayings as Pua ka wiliwili, nanahu ka mano (When the wiliwili blossoms, sharks bite), from the Kumulipo (a Kanaka Maoli creation story), are examples of the place of nature, humans, and a specific creature-here the shark, or mano-in ecological phenology. This article focuses on mano because of the importance of mano in Hawaiian culture and the availability of historical references, in contrast to the relatively little available scientific knowledge. Mano are understood through Hawaiian Indigenous science in their roles as 'aumakua (guardians) and as unique individuals. By using mano as a lens through which to recognize the uniqueness of the Hawaiian worldview, the author highlights the classification system developed and applies this framework in analyzing management scenarios. She argues that using Hawaiian Indigenous science can help adapt new ways to classify our environmental interactions and relationships that will bring us closer to our living relatives. Management decisions regarding culturally important species need not be based solely on the most current Western scientific data but can utilize the much longer data set of knowledge stored in Kanaka Maoli oral literature.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Radar and Optical Satellite Data for Improved Monsoon Cropland Mapping in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monsoon crops play a critical role in Indian agriculture, hence, monitoring these crops is vital for supporting economic growth and food security for the country. However, monitoring these crops is challenging due to limited availability of optical satellite data due to cloud cover during crop growth stages, landscape heterogeneity, and small field sizes. In this paper, our objective is to develop a robust methodology for high-resolution (10 m) monsoon cropland mapping appropriate for different agro-ecological regions (AER) in India. We adapted a synergistic approach of combining Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 optical data using the Google Earth Engine platform. We developed a new technique, Radar Optical cross Masking (ROM), for separating cropland from non-cropland by masking out forest, plantation, and other non-dynamic features. The methodology was tested for five different AERs in India, representing a wide diversity in agriculture, soil, and climatic variations. Our findings indicate that the overall accuracy obtained by using the SAR-only approach is 90%, whereas that of the combined approach is 93%. Our proposed methodology is particularly effective in regions with cropland mixed with tree plantation/mixed forest, typical of smallholder dominated tropical countries. The proposed agriculture mask, ROM, has high potential to support the global agriculture monitoring missions of Geo Global Agriculture Monitoring (GEOGLAM) and Sentinel-2 for Agriculture (S2Agri) project for constructing a dynamic monsoon cropland mask.

TI  - Dynamic Channel Selection of Microwave Temperature Sounding Channels under Cloudy Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To make better use of microwave radiance observations for data assimilation, removal of radiances contaminated by hydrometeor particles is one of the most important steps. Generally, all observations below the middle troposphere are eliminated before the analysis when precipitation is present. However, the altitude of the cloud top varies; when the weighting function peak height of a channel is higher than the altitude of the cloud top, observations are not affected by the absorption or scattering of cloud particles. Thus, the radiative transfer calculation can be performed under a clear sky scenario. In this paper, a dynamic channel selection (DCS) method was developed to determine the radiance observations unaffected by clouds under cloudy conditions in assimilation. First, the sensitivity of cloud liquid water (CLW) profiles to radiance from the microwave temperature sounding frequencies was analyzed. It was found that the impact of CLW on transmittance can be neglected where the cloud top height is below the weighting function peak height. Second, three lookup tables were devised through analysis of the impact of cloud fraction and cloud top height on radiance, which is the basis of the DCS method. The unified cloud top height of the Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS)-2 fields of view (FOVs) can be calculated by remapping the cloud mask and cloud top height data from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-2 (MERSI-2). Observations from various channels may be removed or retained based on real-time dynamic unified cloud top height data. Twelve-hour and long-term time-series brightness temperature simulation experiments both showed that an increase in the amount of observations used for data assimilation of more than 300% can be achieved by application of DCS, but this had no effect on the amount of error. Through DCS, areas of strong precipitation can be accurately identified and removed, and more observations above cloud top height can be included in the data assimilation. The application of DCS to data assimilation will greatly improve the data utilization rate, and therefore allow for more accurate characterization of upper atmospheric circulation.

TI  - Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Clinically Axillary Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Diagnosis and Implications for Patient Management
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Routine performance of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) remains a subject of debate due to no clinical relevance in breast cancer, because it was performed only in clinically axillary lymph node (ALN)-negative patients. In this study, IM-SLNB was performed in clinically ALN-positive patients, and its impact on nodal staging and therapeutic strategy were subsequently analyzed.Methods. Clinically ALN-positive patients who underwent IM-SLNB were enrolled in this prospective study. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square test, Mann-Whitney U and logistic regression models with a significance level of 0.05.Results. Among the 352 recruited patients, the internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IMSLN) visualization rate of patients who received initial surgery and neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) was 71.9% (123/171) and 33.1% (60/181), respectively. The 183 patients who underwent IM-SLNB successfully had the average time duration of 7 min and the median IMSLN number of 2. There were 87 positive IMSLNs in all the 347 removed IMSLNs, which were mainly concentrated in the second (50.6%) and third (34.5%) intercostal space. The IMSLN metastasis rate was 39.8% (initial surgery) and 13.3% (NST), respectively. All of the 183 IM-SLNB patients received more accurate nodal staging, 57 of whom had stage elevated, which might have prompted modifications to the therapeutic strategy.Conclusions. IM-SLNB should be routinely performed in clinically ALN-positive patients, and thus more accurate nodal staging and perfect pathologic complete response definition could be put forward. The identification of IMLN metastases by IM-SLNB might potentially influence therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Evapotranspiration in North America: implications for water resources in a changing climate
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) is important to understanding its role in the global hydrological cycle of terrestrial ecosystems and feedbacks to the climate system. This study improves ET quantification in North America using a data assimilation technique and a process-based Terrestrial Ecosystem Model as well as in situ and satellite data. ET is modeled using the Penman-Monteith equation with an improved leaf area index (LAI) algorithm in a biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The evaluated TEM was used to estimate ET at site and regional scales in North America from 2000 to 2010. The estimated annual ET varies from 420 to 450 mm year(-1) with the improved model, close to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer monthly data with a root-mean-square error less than 10 mm month(-1) for the study period. Alaska, Canada, and the conterminous US account for 33%, 6%, and 61% of the regional ET, respectively. Water availability, the difference between precipitation and ET, is 181 mm month(-1), averaged from 2000 to 2010. Under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, the regional ET increases by 11% and 24%, respectively. Consequently, the water availability decreases in the region by 2.4% and 23.7%, respectively. For the period of 2020-2100, due to uncertain parameters, TEM versions integrated with three different ET algorithms estimated that the regional ET in the USA are 430.5 +/- 10.5 mm year(-1), 482.1 +/- 11.2 mm year(-1), and 489.7 +/- 13.4 mm year(-1), and the available water is - 105.3 +/- 8.7 mm year(-1), - 20.3 +/- 11.9 mm year(-1), and - 126.2 +/- 15.4 mm year(-1), respectively, by the end of the twenty-first century. Our analysis suggests natural terrestrial ecosystem soils in North America will get drier under future climate conditions, which will impact the regional water resource and the climate system. Based on our ET simulation under three climate change scenarios, our study suggests that the RCP 2.6 is the optimum trajectory for preserving freshwater resources in North America and other regions in the globe.

TI  - Automatic Flood Duration Estimation Based on Multi-Sensor Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood duration is a crucial parameter for disaster impact assessment as it can directly influence the degree of economic losses and damage to structures. It also provides an indication of the spatio-temporal persistence and the evolution of inundation events. Thus, it helps gain a better understanding of hydrological conditions and surface water availability and provides valuable insights for land-use planning. The objective of this work is to develop an automatic procedure to estimate flood duration and the uncertainty associated with the use of multi-temporal flood extent masks upon which the procedure is based. To ensure sufficiently high observation frequencies, data from multiple satellites, namely Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and TerraSAR-X, are analyzed. Satellite image processing and analysis is carried out in near real-time with an integrated system of dedicated processing chains for the delineation of flood extents from the range of aforementioned sensors. The skill of the proposed method to support satellite-based emergency mapping activities is demonstrated on two cases, namely the 2019 flood in Sofala, Mozambique and the 2017 flood in Bihar, India.

TI  - Assessing the synergistic potential of Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance bands and derived vegetation indices for detecting and mapping invasive alien plant species
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland biomes are valuable socio-economic and ecological resources. However, the invasion of grasslands by alien plant species has emerged as one of the biggest threats to their sustainability, management and conservation. Timely, cost-effective and accurate determination of invasive alien plant spatial distribution is paramount for mitigating the adverse effects of alien plants on natural grasslands. Whereas literature on use of optical bands for invasive alien plants detection and mapping is abound, there is paucity in literature on the integration of Vegetation Indices (VIs) and optical reflectance bands in invasive species mapping. Specifically, there is need to test the efficacy of improved and freely available sensors like Sentinel-2 in understanding landscape invasion. Hence, this study sought to assess the efficacy of Sentinel-2's optical bands and VIs for improving the mapping of American Bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) within a grassland biome. Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) was used to identify the most influential reflectance bands and VIs, which were then fused at a feature level to determine Bramble spatial distribution. To determine the optimal season for Bramble mapping, seasonal classification accuracies were executed in Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm and accuracies for Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter seasons compared. Results show that although the highest overall accuracy was achieved using only optical bands, fused imagery increased overall classification accuracies during spring and autumn i.e. 70% to 73% and 63% to 65%, respectively. However, the fused imagery failed to improve on the benchmark of optical imagery during summer and winter. Findings from this study underline the efficacy of complementing VIs and optical bands in determining the distribution of invasive species within grasslands at specific seasons. Furthermore, this study advocates for the adoption and fusion of freely available new generation satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2 as a cost effective option in landscape mapping.

TI  - Application of Best-Worst method and Additive Ratio Assessment in mineral prospectivity mapping: A case study of vein-type copper mineralization in the Kuhsiah-e-Urmak Area, Iran
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes the application of a hybrid methodology combining the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) approaches to mineral prospectivity mapping. The ARAS approach is used to prioritize and rank individual cells. The BWM, on the other hand, is useful for assigning weights to the spatial proxies of the mineralized system, representing mappable expressions of the ore-forming processes. A dataset of vein-type copper mineralization, including geochemical, geophysical, geological, and remotely sensed data from the Kuhsiah-e-Urmalc area, Iran, was translated into a set of mappable spatial proxies representing the genetic processes involved in the formation of the vein-type copper mineralization. A hybrid BWM-ARAS method was applied to the spatial proxies used to generate the mineral potential map. The results of the proposed methodology were statistically compared to those obtained from the Index Overlay and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods using the rate of correct classification in confusion matrices and demonstrating the superiority of the proposed methodology. A field trip was conducted to assess the most prospective target zones and to collect samples for analysis. The majority of these samples returned significant copper contents with copper ores observed in most of the polished sections prepared from these samples. Considering these results, the newly proposed BWM-ARAS approach appears to offer a viable alternative to the conventional methods applied to knowledge-driven mineral prospectivity mapping.

TI  - Photoacoustic Imaging for Management of Breast Cancer: A Literature Review and Future Perspectives
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - In this review article, a detailed chronological account of the research related to photoacoustic imaging for the management of breast cancer is presented. Performing a detailed analysis of the breast cancer detection related photoacoustic imaging studies undertaken by different research groups, this review attempts to present the clinical evidence in support of using photoacoustic imaging for breast cancer detection. Based on the experimental evidence obtained from the clinical studies conducted so far, the performance of photoacoustic imaging is compared with that of conventional breast imaging modalities. While we find that there is enough experimental evidence to support the use of photoacoustic imaging for breast cancer detection, additional clinical studies are required to be performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of photoacoustic imaging for identifying different types of breast cancer. To establish the utility of photoacoustic imaging for breast cancer screening, clinical studies with high-risk asymptomatic patients need to be done.

TI  - Consistent signal of aerosol indirect and semi-direct effect on water clouds in the oceanic regions adjacent to the Indian subcontinent
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying aerosol-cloud interaction is one of the most challenging tasks in climate science. Previous studies in the oceanic regions adjacent to the Indian subcontinent providing evidence of aerosol impacts on cloud properties were mostly confined in the winter season. Here we analyze 15 years (March 2000-February 2015) of MODIS aerosol and cloud products and 10 years (October 2004-February 2015) of OMI absorbing aerosol index (AI) over the Arabian Sea (AS), Bay of Bengal (BoB) and South Indian Ocean (SIO) to examine the sensitivity of marine water cloud characteristics to changing aerosol loading. Amidst a monotonous increase in R-eff (cloud effective radius) with an increase in LWP (liquid water path) in clean and polluted conditions (an indicator of the meteorological influence), a smaller R-eff at higher AOD (aerosol optical depth) bins demonstrates that aerosol signal is detectable and consistent in LWP range of 150-350 gm(-2). Furthermore, a faster rate of R-eff growth with increasing LWP in clean condition and the pattern of change in cloud fraction (f(c)) with an increase in AOD that cannot be explained by meteorology alone also provide evidence of the consistency of aerosol indirect effect. Evidence of aerosol semi-direct (decrease of LWP with an increase in AI) is also conspicuous in the AS and BoB. Our results suggest improved representations of aerosol and cloud processes in the models are required to reduce uncertainty in regional climate forcing.

TI  - Identifying challenges to implementation of clinical practice guidelines for sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with melanoma in Australia: protocol paper for a mixed methods study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a diagnostic procedure developed in the 1990s. It is currently used to stage patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, provide prognostic information and guide management. The Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines state that SLNB should be considered for patients with cutaneous melanoma >1 mm in thickness (or >0.8 mm with high-risk pathology features). Until recently, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status was used to identify patients who might benefit from a completion lymph node dissection, a procedure that is no longer routinely recommended. SLN status is now also being used to identify patients who might benefit from systemic adjuvant therapies such as anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy or BRAF-directed molecular targeted therapy, treatments that have significantly improved relapse-free survival for patients with resected stage III melanoma and improved overall survival of patients with unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma. Australian and international data indicate that approximately half of eligible patients receive an SLNB.Methods and analysis This mixed-methods study seeks to understand the structural, contextual and cultural factors affecting implementation of the SLNB guidelines. Data collection will include: (1) cross-sectional questionnaires and semistructured interviews with general practitioners and dermatologists; (2) semistructured interviews with other healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and early definitive care of melanoma patients and key stakeholders including researchers, representatives of professional colleges, training organisations and consumer melanoma groups; and (3) documentary analysis of documents from government, health services and non-government organisations. Descriptive analyses and multivariable regression models will be used to examine factors related to SLNB practices and attitudes. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis.Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Sydney. Results will be disseminated through publications and presentations to clinicians, patients, policymakers and researchers and will inform the development of strategies for implementing SLNB guidelines in Australia.

TI  - A Decade of Aerosol Optical Properties Measurements over Athens, Greece
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ground-based measurements of aerosol optical properties in Athens, Greece, for the period 2008-2018 performed by the National Observatory of Athens are used in order to investigate the aerosol climatology of the area. In this study, we utilize quality-assured measurements of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and angstrom ngstrom exponent obtained by CIMEL photometers in the framework of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) to extract the seasonality and the trends of aerosols in the region. Higher aerosol loads are found during spring and summer months. A 1.1% per year decrease for AOD at 440 nm and 0.4% decrease per year for SSA during the studied period are recorded. Collocated and synchronous PM10 values, for a five-year period, are used in order to study ground-level conditions. Also, the Planetary Boundary Layer Height from ERA-5 is used to investigate the stratification of the particles. The classification of aerosols using AERONET data is performed to separate dust, biomass burning, polluted urban, marine and continental dominant aerosol mixtures. Also, the characterization of AOD provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) is investigated. Finally, seasonal AOD trends recorded from AERONET from satellite sensors (MODIS-Aqua/MODIS-Terra) and estimated by CAMS are examined, and significant differences have been found.

TI  - Developing a rapid method for 3-dimensional urban morphology extraction using open-source data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Available and accessible three-dimensional (3D) urban morphology data have become essential for extensive academic research on built-up environments and urban climates. A rapid and consistent methodology for extracting urban morphology information is urgently needed for sustainable urban development in global cities, particularly given future trends of rapid urbanization. However, there is still a lack of generally applicable methods that use open-source data in this context. In this study, we developed a simple and highly efficient method for acquiring 3D urban morphology information using open-source data. Building footprints were acquired from the Maps Static application programming interface. Building heights were extracted from an open digital surface model, i.e., the ALOS World 3D model with a resolution of 30 m (AW3D30). Thereafter, urban morphological parameters, including the sky view factor, building coverage ratio, building volume density, and frontal area density, were calculated based on the retrieved building footprints and building heights. The proposed method was applied to extract the 3D urban morphology of Hong Kong, a city with a complex urban environment and a highly mixed geographical context. The results show a usable accuracy and wide applicability for the newly proposed method.

TI  - Investigating Spatial and Vertical Patterns of Wetland Soil Organic Carbon Concentrations in China's Western Songnen Plain by Comparing Different Algorithms
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the spatial and vertical patterns of wetland soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc) is important for understanding the regional carbon cycle and managing the wetland ecosystem. By integrating 160 wetland soil profile samples and environmental variables from climatic, topographical, and remote sensing data, we spatially predicted the SOCc of wetlands in China's Western Songnen Plain by comparing four algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) for regression, inverse distance weighted (IDW), and ordinary kriging (OK). The predicted results of the SOCc from the different algorithms were validated against independent testing samples according to the mean error, root mean squared error, and correlation coefficient. The results show that the measured SOCc values at depths of 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm were 15.28, 7.57, and 5.22 g.kg(-1), respectively. An assessment revealed that the RF algorithm was the most accurate for predicting SOCc; its correlation coefficients at the different depths were 0.82, 0.59, and 0.51, respectively. The attribute importance from the RF indicates that environmental variables have various effects on the SOCc at different depths. The land surface temperature and land surface water index had a stronger influence on the spatial distribution of SOCc at the depths of 0-30 and 30-60 cm, whereas topographic factors, such as altitude, had a stronger influence within 60-100 cm. The predicted SOCc of each vertical depth increased gradually from south to north in the study area. This research provides an important case study for predicting SOCc, including selecting factors and algorithms, and helps understanding the carbon cycles of regional wetlands.

TI  - Immediate intraoperative sentinel lymph node analysis by frozen section is predictive of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph nodes sampling (SLN) in endometrial cancer is being evaluated as a means to gather prognostic information about lymphatic metastasis while avoiding the morbidity associated with complete lymphadenectomy. SLN ultrastaging has been advocated to identify low-volume metastases, but its value remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate a pathological protocol for the immediate intraoperative SLN work-up using H&E staining alone. In this retrospective single-center study, patients received standardized cervical injection of indocyanine green, SLN mapping followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. SLNs were entirely frozen, multiple H&E stained sections prepared and evaluated intraoperatively. No immunohistochemistry was performed. SLN results were compared with the complete lymphadenectomy specimen. Over 3.5 years, 90 patients were identified who underwent SLN mapping and subsequent complete pelvic lymphadenectomy. At least one SLN was detected in 79 (88%) patients. The median number of SLNs removed was 2.0. Para-aortic SLNs were detected in 7%. Final pathology showed 67% Type I tumors, 76% locally confined. The mean number of lymph nodes removed during complete lymphadenectomy was 21. In this series, only 6 patients had lymph node metastases. 5/6 were identified by the described SLN approach resulting in 83.3% sensitivity and a negative predictive value of 98.7%. Our approach permits immediate intraoperative results and helps guide the primary surgery. The immediate SLN work-up using frozen sections showed both high accuracy and negative predictive value. The comparably lower sensitivity may be related to the low number of patients with positive lymph nodes (7.6%).

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsies in Endometrial Cancer: Practice Patterns among Gynecologic Oncologists in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate practice patterns among gynecologic oncologists with regard to sentinel lymph node injection and biopsy in endometrial cancer.Design: An observational study with no control group.Setting and Patients: Active members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology.Interventions: After institutional review board approval, we performed an online survey among active members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. Members were contacted via e-mail and their answers anonymously captured. Study data were collected using REDCap (REDCap developed by Vanderbilt University, Nashville TN).Measurements and Main Results: Three hundred eighteen of 1216 listed members completed the online survey. The majority of respondents (82.7%) perform sentinel lymph node sampling for endometrial cancer staging. Most technical aspects of sentinel lymph node sampling were consistently applied by the vast majority of respondents, including the choice of indocyanine green as a lymphatic tracer (97.3%) and its injection into the cervix (100%). Other technical aspects of sentinel lymph node sampling, such as the depth of injection, varied among respondents. Although 50.9% of the respondents perform an intraoperative assessment of the uterus by frozen section, only 17.9% assess sentinel lymph nodes by frozen section and/or touch prep. Some of the respondents' approaches are based on limited data, including (1) the use of sentinel lymph node injection and biopsy for high-risk histologies (performed by 69%-75% of the respondents dependent on the histology), (2) omitting side-specific completion lymphadenectomy in the absence of sentinel node mapping (in up to 57.8%), or (3) when lymph node metastases are present (in 39.9%).Conclusion: In summary, despite the growing use of sentinel lymph node injection and biopsy in endometrial cancer, practice patterns vary considerably among providers sampled by this survey. Some of the decisions are based on limited evidence and, in some instances, deviate from current published guidelines. (C) 2019 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantifying Western US Rangelands as Fractional Components with Multi-Resolution Remote Sensing and In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying western U.S. rangelands as a series of fractional components with remote sensing provides a new way to understand these changing ecosystems. Nine rangeland ecosystem components, including percent shrub, sagebrush (Artemisia), big sagebrush, herbaceous, annual herbaceous, litter, and bare ground cover, along with sagebrush and shrub heights, were quantified at 30 m resolution. Extensive ground measurements, two scales of remote sensing data from commercial high-resolution satellites and Landsat 8, and regression tree models were used to create component predictions. In the mapped area (2,993,655 km(2)), bare ground averaged 45.5%, shrub 15.2%, sagebrush 4.3%, big sagebrush 2.9%, herbaceous 23.0%, annual herbaceous 4.2%, and litter 15.8%. Component accuracies using independent validation across all components averaged R-2 values of 0.46 and an root mean squared error (RMSE) of 10.37, and cross-validation averaged R-2 values of 0.72 and an RMSE of 5.09. Component composition strongly varies by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) level III ecoregions (n = 32): 17 are bare ground dominant, 11 herbaceous dominant, and four shrub dominant. Sagebrush physically covers 90,950 km(2), or 4.3%, of our study area, but is present in 883,449 km(2), or 41.5%, of the mapped portion of our study area.

TI  - Patterns of Historical and Future Urban Expansion in Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate at the cost of agricultural and forested lands in peri-urban areas fringing larger cities. Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km(2) (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km(2)). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km(2) by 2026 and by another 165 km(2) by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal.

TI  - Automatic Delineation of Forest Patches in Highly Fragmented Landscapes Using Coloured Point Clouds
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of landscape features is key for natural resources management and planning. For this purpose, the use of high-resolution remote sensing data has become widespread and is increasingly freely available. However, mapping some target features, such as small forest patches, is still a challenge. Standard, easily replicable, and automatic methodologies to delineate such features are still missing. A common alternative to automated methods is manual delineation, but this is often too time and resource intensive. We developed a simple and automatic method from freely available aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and aerial ortho-images that provide accurate land use mapping and overcome some of the aforementioned limitations. The input for the algorithm is a coloured point cloud, where multispectral information from the ortho-images is associated to each LiDAR point. From this, four-class segmentation and mapping were performed based on vegetation indices and the ground-elevation of the points. We tested the method in four areas in the north-western Iberian Peninsula and compared the results with existent cartography. The completeness and correctness of our algorithm ranging between 78% and 99% in most cases, and it allows for the delineation of very small patches that were previously underrepresented in the reference cartography.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection in node-positive breast cancer: are ten nodes adequate and when is enough, enough?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose National guidelines define adequate axillary lymph node dissections as those yielding >= 10 lymph nodes (LNs). We aimed to identify the optimal LN yield among node-positive patients. Methods Using the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2015), we categorized node-positive patients as follows: (1) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC, cN1-3 or ypN1mi-3) or (2) upfront surgery (pN1-3). A restricted cubic splines model was used to estimate LN retrieval thresholds associated with change in overall survival (OS). Results 129,685 patients were identified: 21.2% NAC, 78.8% upfront surgery. Low, moderate, and high retrieval thresholds were estimated to be 1-6, 7-21, and > 21 LNs (upfront surgery), and 1-7, 8-22, and > 22 LNs (NAC). In an adjusted model, high versus low LN yield was associated with greater receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (upfront surgery OR 1.96, p < 0.001) and greater use of adjuvant radiation (upfront surgery OR 1.08, p = 0.02; NAC OR 1.23, p = 0.002). After adjustment, high versus low LN retrieval was associated with improved OS (upfront surgery HR 0.86, p < 0.001; NAC HR 0.77, p < 0.001). Worse OS was associated with retrieving fewer LNs, likely as a result of an under-staged axilla and missed opportunity for adjuvant therapy, while better OS was independently associated with retrieval of up to approximately 20 LNs, after which survival did not improve. Conclusion In node-positive breast cancer, the number of nodes retrieved is significantly associated with an increased positive nodal count and greater use of adjuvant therapy. Removal of approximately 20 LNs may improve survival by both more accurate nodal staging and increased adjuvant therapy use.

TI  - Nodal metastases of soft tissue sarcomas: risk factors, imaging findings, and implications
T2  - SKELETAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are malignancies derived fromconnective tissue, and regional lymph nodemetastasis (RLNM), while not common, is an important aspect of prognosis and treatment. Various risk factors, in particular the histological subtype, affect the likelihood of nodal involvement, which can be characterized by imaging features such as nodal dimension and morphology. Currently, surveillance and management vary by institution, as concrete societal guidelines have not been established. Common nodal status assessment strategies include physical exam, US CT, MRI, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and radical lymphadenectomy. This article summarizes data regarding relevant risk factors of RLNM, imaging features, and any available data regarding surveillance recommendations.

TI  - Towards large-scale mapping of local climate zones using multitemporal Sentinel 2 data and convolutional neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the concept of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) has become a new standard in the research of urban landscapes. LCZs outline a classification scheme, which is designed to categorize urban and rural surfaces according to their climate-relevant properties, irrespective of local building materials or cultural background. We present a novel workflow for a high-resolution derivation of LCZs using multi-temporal Sentinel 2 (S2) composites and supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We assume that CNNs, due to their potential invariance to size and illumination of objects, are best suited to predict the highly context-based LCZs on a large scale. As a first step, the proposed workflow includes a fully automated generation of cloud-free S2 composites. These composites serve as training data basis for the LCZ classifications carried out over eight German cities. Results show that by using a CNN, overall accuracies can be increased by an average of 16.5 and 4.8 percentage points when compared to a pixel-based and a texture-based Random Forest approach, respectively. If sufficient training data is available, CNN models proved to be robust in classifying unknown cities and achieved overall accuracies of up to 86.5%. The proposed method constitutes a feasible approach for automated, large scale mapping of LCZs, and could be the preferred alternative for LCZ classifications in upcoming studies.

TI  - HybridSN: Exploring 3-D-2-D CNN Feature Hierarchy for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is widely used for the analysis of remotely sensed images. Hyperspectral imagery includes varying bands of images. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep learning-based methods for visual data processing. The use of CNN for HSI classification is also visible in recent works. These approaches are mostly based on 2-D CNN. On the other hand, the HSI classification performance is highly dependent on both spatial and spectral information. Very few methods have used the 3-D-CNN because of increased computational complexity. This letter proposes a hybrid spectral CNN (HybridSN) for HSI classification. In general, the HybridSN is a spectral-spatial 3-D-CNN followed by spatial 2-D-CNN. The 3-D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature representation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2-D-CNN on top of the 3-D-CNN further learns more abstract-level spatial representation. Moreover, the use of hybrid CNNs reduces the complexity of the model compared to the use of 3-D-CNN alone. To test the performance of this hybrid approach, very rigorous HSI classification experiments are performed over Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas Scene remote sensing data sets. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art hand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning-based methods. A very satisfactory performance is obtained using the proposed HybridSN for HSI classification. The source code can be found at https://github.com/gokriznastic/HybridSN.

TI  - Operational Monitoring and Damage Assessment of Riverine Flood-2014 in the Lower Chenab Plain, Punjab, Pakistan, Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In flood-prone areas, the delineation of the spatial pattern of historical flood extents, damage assessment, and flood durations allow planners to anticipate potential threats from floods and to formulate strategies to mitigate or abate these events. The Chenab plain in the Punjab region of Pakistan is particularly prone to flooding but is understudied. It experienced its worst riverine flood in recorded history in September 2014. The present study applies Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques to estimate the riverine flood extent and duration and assess the resulting damage using Landsat-8 data. The Landsat-8 images were acquired for the pre-flooding, co-flooding, and post-flooding periods for the comprehensive analysis and delineation of flood extent, damage assessment, and duration. We used supervised classification to determine land use/cover changes, and the satellite-derived modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) to detect flooded areas and duration. The analysis permitted us to calculate flood inundation, damages to built-up areas, and agriculture, as well as the flood duration and recession. The results also reveal that the floodwaters remained in the study area for almost two months, which further affected cultivation and increased the financial cost. Our study provides an empirical basis for flood response assessment and rehabilitation efforts in future events. Thus, the integrated RS and GIS techniques with supporting datasets make substantial contributions to flood monitoring and damage assessment in Pakistan.

TI  - Incorporating environmental variables into a MODIS-based crop yield estimation method for United States corn and soybeans through the use of a random forest regression algorithm
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing is a powerful form of technology that can provide food security policy makers with reliable information. This information allows them to estimate final crop yields on a global scale within reasonable time frames and with higher spatial resolution than with the use of pure statistical data. Satellite-based crop yield estimation methods are commonly based on the high correlation between the crop yield and the vegetation index (VI), taken at a specific phenological stage. Although VI-based crop yield estimation methods that make use of one approximation formula can easily and effectively estimate the spatial distribution of corn and soybean yields in the United States, there are still some associated drawbacks to this approach that result in the underestimation of crop yields, especially in irrigated regions. Furthermore, a fundamental problem with this approach is the difficulty in evaluation of environmental stress-related physiological disorders such as sterility, which cannot be evaluated based on VIs as an alternative value to biomass. This study's objective was, thus, to overcome the limitations associated with the conventional approach by incorporating additional environmental variables into the proposed method along with the application of a random forest regression algorithm for estimating United States (US) corn and soybean yields with higher accuracy.This study compared three methods: (1) a conventional method based on a linear regression model (LM method) calibrated using limited past data, (2) a method, which was slightly altered from the LM method in terms of the use of a polynomial regression model (PM method), and (3) the newly proposed method, which involved the application of a random forest regression algorithm and the use of irrigated harvested cropland percentage and reanalysis data for temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, and soil moisture (RF method). The time-series correlation between the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) wide dynamic ranged vegetation index (WDRVI) and corn and soybean yields were analyzed as part of a preliminary investigation to determine the best time for recording the MODIS WDRVI as an explanatory variable in the study area. The results revealed that the MODIS WDRVI demonstrated the highest correlation with county-level statistical yields 13 days before the silking stage for corn and 6 days before the setting pods stage for soybeans. The regression formulas for the LM and the PM method were developed based on assigning the MODIS WDRVI to these phenological stages as explanatory variables. The advantage of the PM method over the LM method was found to be its adaptability to high-yield counties because of the inherent effect of using a polynomial regression equation. The LM method, which made use of a linear regression equation calibrated using limited past data (2009-2010), could not be adapted to increased yields encountered in recent years without recalibration with the latest data. The RF method learning models were individually optimized for each state and crop. This optimization revealed, that our learning model that incorporated every available variable did not always perform best, probably due to overfitting. In the major irrigated states of Kansas, and Nebraska, the spatial data of the percentage of irrigated harvested cropland improve the estimation accuracy of the RF method for both corn and soybean.In the states of Illinois and Iowa, the RF method, which incorporated primarily the weather-related variables of soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, and shortwave radiation, improved the estimation accuracy due to a response of rainfed agriculture to environmental stress. This is especially true for soybean. The validation results indicated that the estimation accuracy of the RF method (root mean square error RMSE: 0.539 t/ha for corn, 0.206 t/ha for soybeans) was higher than that of the PM method (RMSE: 0.897 t/ha for corn, 0.283 t/ha for soybeans) at the state level, particularly due to the effect of bias correction in irrigated regions.

TI  - Ecosystem service valuation of a natural reserve region for sustainable management of natural resources
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is extremely important for providing essential ecosystem services, which are crucial for subsistence and human well-being. Using time-series satellite data products and different unit values, the spatially explicit Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) of six eco-regions of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, has been calculated for four reference years, viz. 1973, 1988, 2002 and 2013. The maximum ESV (million US$ year(1)) is provided by the mangrove forest (2292-44468), followed by water surface (65-4244), cropland (26-3938), and sparse vegetation cover (0-326). The total ESV (million US$ year(1)) of Sundarbans is estimated to be 16629.5, 20175.7, 19733.4, and 16761.3 for 1973, 1988, 2002, and 2013 respectively. The regulation of gas and climate, raw material production, and cultural ecosystem services are entirely dependent on the mangrove ecosystem, while the waste treatment, cultural, and water regulation services are found to be highly sensitive to the changes in water bodies. The food production and biodiversity services exhibiting higher sensitivity to the changes in cropland, water regulation and soil formation and retention services show higher sensitivity to the changes in mixed vegetation cover. The current study has thoroughly evaluated the sensitivity and response behavior of six ecoregions of Sundarbans. The outcome of this study will enable the decision-makers, planners, as well as researchers to adopt necessary action plans for strengthening and protecting the natural resources of this biosphere reserve.

TI  - Geospatial approach for assessing spatiotemporal dynamics of urban green space distribution among neighbourhoods: A demonstration in Mumbai
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Green spaces are an integral part of urban landscape and offer numerous benefits related to quality of urban life. However, due to various factors, the distribution of green spaces among city neighbourhoods is often skewed. Hence, urban planners require effective tools to routinely map and monitor the greening/ un-greening phenomena among the neighbourhoods. This study caters to this need by adopting a geospatial green space distribution assessment approach that encompasses green space quantity, quality and accessibility aspects. The green space distribution indicators were derived from remote sensing data, which facilitates cost-effective green space assessments at desired time scales. In this study, the approach is demonstrated in Mumbai, a typical city in a developing country undergoing urbanization transition accompanied by stark environmental challenges. The study results revealed that the green spaces in Mumbai had generally diminished, fragmented and disaggregated between 2001 and 2011. However, the level of degeneration of green spaces was found to vary significantly among the neighbourhoods. The results also unveiled that the verdant spaces in the city's western suburbs had experienced the worst degradation during the study period. These results would aid Mumbai's planners in formulating local greening strategies in a cost-effective manner. Further, the study has wider implications for green space planning, especially in the understudied, fast-urbanizing developing countries.

TI  - Detecting Burn Severity across Mediterranean Forest Types by Coupling Medium-Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery and Field Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mediterranean countries, in the year 2017, extensive surfaces of forests were damaged by wildfires. In the Vesuvius National Park, multiple summer wildfires burned 88% of the Mediterranean forest. This unprecedented event in an environmentally vulnerable area suggests conducting spatial assessment of the mixed-severity fire effects for identifying priority areas and support decision-making in post-fire restoration. The main objective of this study was to compare the ability of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) spectral index obtained from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A satellites in retrieving burn severity levels. Burn severity levels experienced by the Mediterranean forest communities were defined by using two quali-quantitative field-based composite burn indices (FBIs), namely the Composite Burn Index (CBI), its geometrically modified version CBI (GeoCBI), and the dNBR derived from the two medium-resolution multispectral remote sensors. The accuracy of the burn severity map produced by using the dNBR thresholds developed by Key and Benson (2006) was first evaluated. We found very low agreement (0.15 < K < 0.21) between the burn severity class obtained from field-based indices (CBI and GeoCBI) and satellite-derived metrics (dNBR) from both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A. Therefore, the most appropriate dNBR thresholds were rebuilt by analyzing the relationships between two field-based (CBI and GeoCBI) and dNBR from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A. By regressing alternatively FBIs and dNBRs, a slightly stronger relationship between GeoCBI and dNBR metrics obtained from the Sentinel-2A remote sensor (R-2 = 0.69) was found. The regressed dNBR thresholds showed moderately high classification accuracy (K = 0.77, OA = 83%) for Sentinel-2A, suggesting the appropriateness of dNBR-Sentinel 2A in assessing mixed-severity Mediterranean wildfires. Our results suggest that there is no single set of dNBR thresholds that are appropriate for all burnt biomes, especially for the low levels of burn severity, as biotic factors could affect satellite observations.

TI  - Elevation-Dependent Removal of Cirrus Clouds in Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Masking of cirrus clouds in optical satellite imagery is an important step in automated processing chains. Firstly, it is a prerequisite to a subsequent removal of cirrus effects, and secondly, it affects the atmospheric correction, i.e., aerosol and surface reflectance retrievals. Cirrus clouds can be detected with a narrow bandwidth channel near 1.38 mu m and operational detection algorithms have been developed for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images. However, concerning cirrus removal in the case of elevated surfaces, current methods do not separate the ground reflected signal from the cirrus signal in the 1.38 mu m channel when performing an atmospheric correction, often resulting in an overcorrection of the cirrus influence. We propose a new operational algorithm using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to estimate the surface and cirrus cloud contributions in the 1.38 mu m channel and to remove cirrus effects during the surface reflectance retrieval. Due to the highly variable nature of cirrus clouds and terrain conditions, no generic quantitative results could be derived. However, results for typical cases and the achieved improvement in cirrus removal are given for selected scenes and critical issues and limitations of the approach are discussed.

TI  - Monitoring Land Surface Phenology in Near Real Time by Using PhenoMap
T2  - U S Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station General Technical Report PNW-GTR
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation phenology is important for managers at several scales. Across decades, changes in the timing, pattern, and duration of significant life cycle events for plant groups can foreshadow shifts in species assemblages that can affect ecosystem services. In the shorter term, managers need phenological information to time activities such as grazing, ecological restoration plantings, biocontrol of pests, seed collection, and wildlife monitoring. However, tools to deliver timely seasonal development have been limited either spatially (data from a single tower or weather station, or on a single species, or both) or temporally (annually, quarterly, or monthly summaries). We developed another option called PhenoMap. This is a weekly assessment of land surface "greenness" across the continental United States that employs the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. Here we present the PhenoMap Web map and its validation by using 54 in situ PhenoCam camera sites representing six vegetation structure types and 31 different ecoregions. We found that PhenoMap effectively tracks phenology on grasslands, shrublands, deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests. Results for evergreen needleleaf sites were poor owing to the low green-up signal relative to the total amount of foliage detected by NDVI. Issues of extent and field of view were critical when assessing remotely sensed data with in situ oblique camera imagery.

TI  - Yes, no, maybe so: the importance of cognitive interviewing to enhance structured surveys on respectful maternity care in northern India
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative survey findings are important in measuring health-related phenomena, including on sensitive topics such as respectful maternity care (RMC). But how well do survey results truly capture respondent experiences and opinions? Quantitative tool development and piloting often involve translating questions from other settings and assessing the mechanics of implementation, which fails to deeply explore how respondents understand survey questions and response options. To address this gap, we conducted cognitive interviews on survey questions (n=88) adapted from validated RMC instruments used in Ethiopia, Kenya and elsewhere in India. Cognitive interviews with rural women (n=21) in Madhya Pradesh, India involved asking the respondent the survey question, recording her response, then interviewing her about what the question and response options meant to her. We analysed the interviews to revise the tool and identify question failures, which we grouped into six areas: issues with sequencing, length and sensitivity; problematic response options; inappropriate vocabulary; temporal and spatial confusion; accessing different cognitive domains; and failure to resonate with the respondent's worldview and reality. Although women tended to provide initial answers to the survey questions, cognitive interviews revealed widespread mismatch between respondent interpretation and question intent. Likert scale response options were generally incomprehensible and questions involving hypothetical scenarios could be interpreted in unexpected ways. Many key terms and concepts from the international RMC literature did not translate well and showed low resonance with respondents, including consent and being involved in decisions about one's care. This study highlights the threat to data quality and the validity of findings when translating quantitative surveys between languages and cultures and showcases the value of cognitive interviews in identifying question failures. While survey tool revision can address many of these issues, further critical discussion is needed on the use of standardized questions to assess the same domains across contexts.

TI  - Limitations of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry to measure small seasonal ground movements in an urban environment
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - London Clay, which underlies the majority of Greater London, has a high shrink-swell potential that can result in damage to foundations and surface infrastructure due to seasonal expansion and contraction of the clay. Currently, surface movement as a result of shrink-swell is not monitored in London, meaning that the magnitude and cyclicity of these movements is poorly understood. Persistent Scatterer Interferometric (PSI) Synthetic Aperture Radar data provide high-precision line-of-sight displacement measurements at a high point density across urban areas, offering the possibility of routine shrink-swell monitoring across whole cities. To test this, PSI data derived from TerraSAR-X (TSX) observations for the period from May 2011 to April 2017 were analysed for shrink-swell patterns across three areas of London in Hammersmith, Muswell Hill and Islington. A consistent cyclicity and amplitude was detected at all sites and the number of cycles is comparable with those identified in rainfall data. The amplitude of these cycles is smaller than anticipated, most probably because of the resisting effect of roads and pavements. The Cranfield University Leakage Assessment from Corrosivity and Shrinkage (LEACS) database was used to subdivide the PSI data and the average velocity and amplitude of each class statistically tested for significant differences between classes. The results show that it is not possible to statistically isolate possible soil shrink-swell movement in TSX PSI data in London.

TI  - Investigating spatiotemporal relationship between EVI of the MODIS and climate variables in northern Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and fluctuations dramatically affect terrestrial ecosystems and their variations. Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between them in terms of use of vegetation indices. In this study, GIS-based spatiotemporal analyses were used to model the relationship between vegetation variations based on the EVI-MODIS and its response to land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall in Mazandaran province during the period of 2000-2016 in the north of Iran. The LST parameter was derived from the 17-year MODIS data, and rainfall parameter was achieved via meteorological station data in the region. Correlation and linear regression analyses at 0.95% confidence level (P value = 0.5) were used to study the relationship between spatiotemporal enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and two climatic parameters. The results indicated that the EVI had a rising trend over the study period. This was mostly due to the increase in paddy fields. The result also shows significant spatial correlation between EVI with LST values, which was direct during winter and inverse during summer. The tabulate area analysis showed that throughout the winter months, the spatial distribution of pixels matched the highest EVI values in pixels with a maximum temperature (20-27 degrees C), while during June to September, the maximum EVI values were related to areas where the LST was less than 25 degrees C. Although we found no significant simultaneous relationship between EVI/MODIS and rainfall in studied area, but by 1.5-2.5 months lag time in spring season, the relation between them reaches peak.

TI  - Mass balance and area changes of glaciers in the Cordillera Real and Tres Cruces, Bolivia, between 2000 and 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has led to a significant shrinkage of glaciers in the Tropical Andes during the last decades. Recent multi-temporal quantifications of ice mass loss at mountain range to regional scale are missing. However, this is fundamental information for future water resource planning and glacier change projections. In this study, we measure temporally consistent glacier area changes and geodetic mass balances throughout the Bolivian Cordillera Real and Tres Cruces based on multi-sensor remote-sensing data. By analyzing multi-spectral satellite images and interferometric SAR data, a glacier recession of 81 +/- 18 km(2) (29%; 5.1 +/- 1.1 km(2) a(-1)), a geodetic mass balance of -403 +/- 78 kg m(-2) a(-1) and a total ice mass loss of 1.8 +/- 0.5 Gt is derived for 2000-2016. In the period 2013-2016, ice mass loss was 21% above the average rate. A retreat rate of 15 +/- 5 km(2) a(-1) and a mass budget of -487 +/- 349 kg m(-2) a(-1) are found in this more recent period. These higher change rates can be attributed to the strong El Nino event in 2015/16. The analyses of individual glacier changes and topographic variables confirmed the dependency of the mass budget and glacier recession on glacier aspect and median elevation.

TI  - Cloud detection algorithm for multi-modal satellite imagery using convolutional neural-networks (CNN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection algorithms are crucial in many remote-sensing applications to allow an optimized processing of the acquired data, without the interference of the cloud fields above the surfaces of interest (e.g., land, coral reefs, etc.). While this is a well-established area of research, replete with a number of cloud detection methodologies, many issues persist for detecting clouds over areas of high albedo surfaces (snow and sand), detecting cloud shadows, and transferring a given algorithm between observational platforms. Particularly for the latter, algorithms are often platform-specific with corresponding rule-based tests and thresholds inherent to instruments and applied corrections. Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the detection of cloud and cloud shadow fields in multi-channel satellite imagery from World-View-2 (WV-2) and Sentinel-2 (S-2), using their Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared (RGB, NIR) channels. This algorithm is developed within the NASA NeMO-Net project, a multi-modal CNN for global coral reef classification which utilizes imagery from multiple remote sensing aircraft and satellites with heterogeneous spatial resolution and spectral coverage. Our cloud detection algorithm is novel in that it attempts to learn deep invariant features for cloud detection utilizing both the spectral and the spatial information inherent in satellite imagery. The first part of our work presents the CNN cloud and cloud shadow algorithm development (trained using WV-2 data) and its application to WV-2 (with a cloud detection accuracy of 89%) and to S-2 imagery (referred to as augmented CNN). The second part presents a new domain adaptation CNN-based approach (domain adversarial NN) that allows for better adaptation between the two satellite platforms during the prediction step, without the need to train for each platform separately. Our augmented CNN algorithm results in better cloud prediction rates as compared to the original S-2 cloud mask (81% versus 48%), but still, clear pixels prediction rate is lower than S-2 (81% versus 91%). Nevertheless, the application of the domain adaptation approach shows promise in better transferring the knowledge gained from one trained domain (WV-2) to another (S-2), increasing the prediction accuracy of both clear and cloudy pixels when compared to a network trained only by WV-2. As such, domain adaptation may offer a novel means of additional augmentation for our CNN-based cloud detection algorithm, increasing robustness towards predictions from multiple remote sensing platforms. The approach presented here may be further developed and optimized for global and multi-modal (multi-channel and multi-platform) satellite cloud detection capability by utilizing a more global dataset.

AB  - This study investigated the coastal lagoon monitoring and mapping potential of Landsat-8 Opera-tional Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) in the Enez Dalyan Lagoon, located in Turkey. Five different water indices, including normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), automated water extraction index for shadow (AWEI(sh)) and non-shadow (AWEI(nsh)), tasseled cap wetness index (TCWI), and maximum likelihood classification methods were compared to evaluate the potential for mapping coastal lagoons. Additionally, spectral consistency of index algorithms was examined to introduce the coastal lagoon monitoring potential whereas cross-calibration analysis was carried out. Among the methods, the AWEI(nsh) achieved quite better results compared with the other methods for mapping Enez Dalyan Lagoon while TCWI had relatively poor results independent from the sensors. AWEI(nsh) had the strongest correlation with 0.989, while NDWI had the poorest correlation value as 0.966. Results pointed out the linear correlation and spectral consistency between almost all corresponding indices derived from the data of two sensors. This research indicated that index algorithms provide a reliable mapping of Enez Dalyan Lagoon. Also, Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors, which are statistically consistent, provided sufficient monitoring of Enez Dalyan Lagoon to both continuity and combined use.

TI  - Comparing Measured Incoming Shortwave and Longwave Radiation on a Glacier Surface with Estimated Records from Satellite and Off-Glacier Observations: A Case Study for the Forni Glacier, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of methods for quantifying meltwater from glaciated areas is very important for better management of water resources and because of the strong impact of current and expected climate change on the Alpine cryosphere. Radiative fluxes are the main melt-drivers, but they can generally not be derived from in situ measures because glaciers are usually located in remote areas where the number of meteorological stations is very low. For this reason, focusing, as a case study, on one of the few glaciers with a supraglacial automatic weather station (Forni Glacier), we investigated methods based on both satellite records and off-glacier surface observations to estimate incoming short- and long-wave radiation at the glacier surface (SWin and LWin). Specifically, for SWin, we considered CM SAF SARAH satellite gridded surface solar irradiance fields and data modeled by cloud transmissivity parametrized from both CM SAF COMET satellite cloud fractional cover fields and daily temperature range observed at the closest off-glacier station. We then used the latter two data sources to derive LWin too. Finally, we used the estimated SWin and LWin records to assess the errors obtained when introducing estimated rather than measured incoming radiation data to quantify glacier melting by means of an energy balance model. Our results suggest that estimated SWin and LWin records derived from satellite measures are in better agreement with in situ observations than estimated SWin and LWin records parametrized from observations performed at the closest off-glacier station. Moreover, we find that the former estimated records permit a significantly better quantification of glacier melting than the latter estimated ones.

TI  - Update and spatial extension of strategic forest inventories using time series remote sensing and modeling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date forest inventory information relating the characteristics of managed and natural forests is fundamental to sustainable forest management and required to inform conservation of biodiversity and assess climate change impacts and mitigation opportunities. Strategic forest inventories are difficult to compile over large areas and are often quickly outdated or spatially incomplete as a function of their long production cycle. As a consequence, automated approaches supported by remotely sensed data are increasingly sought to provide exhaustive spatial coverage for a set of core attributes in a timely fashion. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the integration of current remotely-sensed data products and pre-existing jurisdictional inventory data to map four forest attributes of interest (stand age, dominant species, site index, and stem density) for a 55 Mha study region in British Columbia, Canada. First, via image segmentation, spectrally homogenous objects were derived from Landsat surface-reflectance pixel composites. Second, a suite of Landsat-based predictors (e.g., spectral indices, disturbance history, and forest structure) and ancillary variables (e.g., geographic, topographic, and climatic) were derived for these units and used to develop predictive models of target attributes. For the often difficult classification of dominant species, two modelling approaches were compared: (a) a global Random Forests model calibrated with training samples collected over the entire study area, and (b) an ensemble of local models, each calibrated with spatially constrained local samples. Accuracy assessment based upon independent validation samples revealed that the ensemble of local models was more accurate and efficient for species classification, achieving an overall accuracy of 72% for the species which dominate 80% of the forested areas in the province. Results indicated that site index had the highest agreement between predicted and reference (R-2 = 0.74, %RMSE = 23.1%), followed by stand age (R-2 = 0.62, %RMSE = 35.6%), and stem density (R-2 = 0.33, %RMSE = 65.2%). Inventory attributes mapped at the image-derived unit level captured much finer details than traditional polygon-based inventory, yet can be readily reassembled into these larger units for strategic forest planning purposes. Based upon this work, we conclude that in a multi-source forest monitoring program, spatially localized and detailed characterizations enabled by time series of Landsat observations in conjunction with ancillary data can be used to support strategic inventory activities over large areas.

TI  - Fusion of Five Satellite-Derived Products Using Extremely Randomized Trees to Estimate Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of spatially and temporally continuous latent heat flux (LE) is essential in the assessment of surface water and energy balance. Various satellite-derived LE products have been generated to enhance the simulation of terrestrial LE, yet each individual LE product shows large discrepancies and uncertainties. Our study used Extremely Randomized Trees (ETR) to fuse five satellite-derived terrestrial LE products to reduce uncertainties from the individual products and improve terrestrial LE estimations over Europe. The validation results demonstrated that the estimation using the ETR fusion method increased the R-2 of five individual LE products (ranging from 0.53 to 0.61) to 0.97 and decreased the RMSE (ranging from 26.37 to 33.17 W/m(2)) to 5.85 W/m(2). Compared with three other machine learning fusion models, Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), ETR exhibited the best performance in terms of both training and validation accuracy. We also applied the ETR fusion method to implement the mapping of average annual terrestrial LE over Europe at a resolution of 0.05 ? in the period from 2002 to 2005. When compared with global LE products such as the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the fusion LE using ETR exhibited a relatively small gap, which confirmed that it is reasonable and reliable for the estimation of the terrestrial LE over Europe.

TI  - Sea state parameters retrieval from cross-polarization Gaofen-3 SAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquired in wave mode (WV) and quad-polarization stripmap (QPS) mode default operates in quad-polarization (vertical vertical (VV), vertical-horizontal (VH), horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (HV)) modes. To date, more than GF-3 SAR vignettes following about 110 orbits acquired in WV and QPS mode have been recorded during the mission from April 2016 to December 2017. In the vignettes, ocean surface waves signatures, that are wave-look patterns, are visible in cross-polarization (basically VH). These vignettes are collocated with surface sea state parameters simulated from numerical WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) wave model using a 0.1 degrees grid. There are 11,269 matchups available for studying the relation between sea state parameters and SAR-derived parameters in VH-polarization. A well-known empirical CWAVE model, herein renamed as CPCWAVE_GF3, is adopted for sea state parameter retrieval from GF-3 SAR vignettes with the SAR parameters in the cross polarization channel. The method yielded a significant correlation coefficient (COR) of 0.79 for wave height (SWH) and 0.72 for second-order cross-zero mean wave period (MWP). Validation against 76 moored buoys resulted in a 0.49 m RMSE of SWH with a 0.21 m scatter index (SI) and validation against 71 moored buoys resulted in a 1.01 s RMSE of MWP with a 0.13 s SI. The comparison of SWH with 116 footprints from the altimeter of Jason-2 also shows a 0.46 m RMSE of SWH with a 0.19 m SI. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of wave retrieval from GF-3 SAR using cross-polarization channels parameters. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of a Proximal Sensing-integrated Crop Model for Simulation of Soybean Growth and Yield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A remote sensing-integrated crop model (RSCM) able to simulate crop growth processes using proximal or remote sensing data was formulated for simulation of soybean through estimating parameters required for modelling. The RSCM-soybean was then evaluated for its capability of simulating leaf area index (LAI), above-ground dry mass (AGDM), and yield, utilising the proximally sensed data integration into the modelling procedure. Field experiments were performed at two sites, one in 2017 and 2018 at Chonnam National University, Gwangju, and the other in 2017 at Jonnam Agricultural Research and Extension Services in Naju, Chonnam province, South Korea. The estimated parameters of radiation use efficiency, light extinction coefficient, and specific leaf area were 1.65 g MJ(-1), 0.71, and 0.017 m(2) g(-1), respectively. Simulated LAI and AGDM values agreed with the measured values with significant model efficiencies in both calibration and validation, meaning that the proximal sensing data were effectively integrated into the crop model. The RSCM reproduced soybean yields in significant agreement with the measured yields in the model assessment. The study results demonstrate that the well-calibrated RSCM-soybean scheme can reproduce soybean growth and yield using simple input requirement and proximal sensing data. RSCM-soybean is easy to use and applicable to various soybean monitoring projects.

TI  - Polarimetric calibration for the distributed Gaofen-3 product by an improved unitary zero helix framework
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Gaofen-3 satellite was launched into space in 2016. Based on the corner reflector (CR) evaluation, it was found that the co-pol channel imbalance phase may exceed the maximum tolerance in the distributed standard product, i.e., +/- 10 degrees. The ground-deployed CRs are the most precise way to calibrate the phase error. However, the Mongolia calibration site of Gaofen-3 is a temporal calibration field, and the calibration time is limited for the periodic evaluation over the 8-year satellite life. In this paper, to accelerate the Gaofen-3 calibration mission, we propose an improved unitary zero helix (IUZH) framework to fully replace the use of CRs when estimating the co-pol channel imbalance phase by the use of natural media. Compared with our previous works (Shi et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2020), this novel algorithm presents three main contributions to remote sensing society. Firstly, we believe that this natural media calibration technique could replace the use of CRs, to satisfy the radar design specification, and that this natural media calibration technique could be more than just a substitute in an emergency event when there are no CRs deployed in-scene. Secondly, the IUZH framework is less dependent on choosing the particular reference targets, such as isolated point-like objects or Amazon forest. As a result, it will help radar researchers to relax the constraint of selecting references, and will make the non-CR calibration task easier in satellite or airborne cases. Last but not least, the proposed technique simultaneously derives the calibration phase after the sensor has completed a long-strip observation, which will significantly accelerate the Gaofen-3 external calibration mission, at little cost and time-consuming. The experiments with more than 500 images demonstrate that the phase bias of the Gaofen-3 standard product can be robustly calibrated, even when CRs are unavailable in the scene. The HH and VV imbalance phase with the IUZH method is generally found to be less than 4 degrees. The potential phase error of the Gaofen-3 product is thus significantly suppressed, and the calibration accuracy satisfies the 10 degrees design specification.

TI  - Detection and Characterization of Active Slope Deformations with Sentinel-1 InSAR Analyses in the Southwest Area of Shanxi, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A catastrophic landslide happened on 15 March 2019 in Xiangning County of Shanxi Province, causing 20 fatalities. Such an event makes us realize the significance of loess slope instability detection. Therefore, it is essential to identify the potential active landslides, monitor their displacements, and sort out dominant controlling factors. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (InSAR) has been recognized as an effective tool for geological hazard mapping with wide coverage and high precision. In this study, the time series InSAR analysis method was applied to map the unstable areas in Xiangning County, as well as surrounding areas from C-band Sentinel-1 datasets acquired from March 2017 to 2019. A total number of 597 unstable sites covering 41.7 km(2) were identified, among which approximately 70% are located in the mountainous areas which are prone to landslides. In particular, the freezing and thawing cycles might be the primary triggering factor for the failure of the Xiangning landslide. Furthermore, the nonlinear displacements of the active loess slopes within this region were found to be correlated significantly with precipitation. Therefore, a climate-driven displacement model was employed to explore the quantitative relationship between rainfall and nonlinear displacements.

TI  - Improving LiDAR-based tree species mapping in Central European mixed forests using multi-temporal digital aerial colour-infrared photographs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital colour-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs, which have been collected routinely in many parts of the world, are an invaluable data source for the monitoring and assessment of forest resources. Yet, the potential of these data for automated individual tree species mapping remains largely unexplored. One way to maximize the usefulness of digital CIR aerial photographs for individual tree species mapping is to integrate them with modern and complementary remote sensing technologies such as the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system and 3D segmentation algorithms. In this study, we examined whether multi-temporal digital CIR orthophotos could be used to further increase the accuracy of airborne LiDAR-based individual tree species mapping for a temperate mixed forest in eastern Germany. Our results showed that the texture features captured by multi-temporal digital CIR orthophotos under different view-illumination conditions were species-specific. As a consequence, combining these texture features with LiDAR metrics significantly improved tree species mapping accuracy (overall accuracy: 77.4%, kappa: 0.68) compared to using LiDAR data alone (overall accuracy: 69.3%, kappa: 0.58). Among various texture features, the average gray level in the near-infrared band was found to contribute most to the classification. Our results suggest that the synergic use of multi-temporal digital aerial photographs and airborne LiDAR data has the potential to accurately classify individual tree species in Central European mixed forests.

TI  - Detection of spatiotemporal dynamics of land cover and its drivers using remote sensing and landscape metrics (Pingtan Island, China)
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change (LCC) and its drivers are important inputs for tracking and tackling environmental problems. Pingtan has been experiencing rapid LCC recently, but it is not well documented. The general objective of this study is to detect land cover dynamics using three Landsat images from the years 2000, 2009 and 2013 based on metrics of land cover transition and pattern, together with driving factors. The overall trends in LCC depicted the expansion of forest land (6.75%), shrubland (4.81%), urban land (12.05%) and rural settlement (15.54%), as well as the reduction of grassland (- 17.86%), water body (- 0.71%), wetland (- 3.23%), farmland (- 17.16%) and bare land (- 0.19%). The land use intensity was also increased. Transformation of each land cover type was characterized by unbalanced expansion and contraction simultaneously and a spatial shift in their locations. During 2000-2013, a class-to-class transformation was dominated by the expansion of urban land and rural settlement (70.26% of gross gain), as well as the reduction of farmland and grassland (59.69% of gross loss). Landscape-level metrics indicated the decline of landscape heterogeneity and shape irregularities. However, there are some inconsistencies at the class level. LCC was driven primarily by policy factors and socio-economic development. Detailed quantification of spatiotemporal LCC will have significant contributions for sustainable land resource conservation and to improve land use planning policies.

AB  - This article aims to show that although Laozi mentioned no knowledge (wuzhi), he did not deny the value of knowledge as a whole, but rather he offered an alternative way to appreciating and obtaining knowledge. Some scholars, having paid too much attention to the literal reading of no-knowledge, claimed that Laozi advocated anti-intellectualism and the policy that makes people ignorant. In this paper, I argue that this claim is unfounded and unconvincing. My claim is that Laozi, who was very critical of the tendency to divide and individuate people in parts in his time, tried to lead the world and the people into a state of peace by presenting the worldview of the whole and universality.

TI  - A Holistic Analysis for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Applying Geographic Object-Based Random Forest: A Comparison between Protected and Non-Protected Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent progress in landslide susceptibility mapping, a holistic method is still needed to integrate and customize influential factors with the focus on forest regions. This study was accomplished to test the performance of geographic object-based random forest in modeling the susceptibility of protected and non-protected forests to landslides in northeast Iran. Moreover, it investigated the influential conditioning and triggering factors that control the susceptibility of these two forest areas to landslides. After surveying the landslide events, segment objects were generated from the Landsat 8 multispectral images and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The features of conditioning factors were derived from the DEM and available thematic layers. Natural triggering factors were derived from the historical events of rainfall, floods, and earthquake. The object-based image analysis was used for deriving anthropogenic-induced forest loss and fragmentation. The layers of logging and mining were obtained from available historical data. Landslide samples were extracted from field observations, satellite images, and available database. A single database was generated including all conditioning and triggering object features, and landslide samples for modeling the susceptibility of two forest areas to landslides using the random forest algorithm. The optimal performance of random forest was obtained after building 500 trees with the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) values of 86.3 and 81.8% for the protected and non-protected forests, respectively. The top influential factors were the topographic and hydrologic features for mapping landslide susceptibility in the protected forest. However, the scores were loaded evenly among the topographic, hydrologic, natural, and anthropogenic triggers in the non-protected forest. The topographic features obtained about 60% of the importance values with the domination of the topographic ruggedness index and slope in the protected forest. Although the importance of topographic features was reduced to 36% in the non-protected forest, anthropogenic and natural triggering factors remarkably gained 33.4% of the importance values in this area. This study confirms that some anthropogenic activities such as forest fragmentation and logging significantly intensified the susceptibility of the non-protected forest to landslides.

TI  - Contribution of multispectral (optical and radar) satellite images to the classification of agricultural surfaces
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of different crops (cultivated plots) and types of surface (bare soils, etc.) is a crucial economic and environmental issue for the management of resources and human activity. In this context, the objective of this study is to evaluate the contribution of multispectral satellite imagery (optical and radar) to land use and land cover classification.Object-oriented supervised classifications, based on a Random Forest algorithm, and majority zoning post-processing are used. This study emerges from the experiment on multi-sensor crop monitoring (MCM'10, Baup et al., 2012) conducted in 2010 on a mixed farming area in the southwest of France, near Toulouse. This experiment enabled the regular and quasi-synchronous collection of multi-sensor satellite data and in situ observations, which are used in this study. 211 plots with contrasting characteristics (different slopes, soil types, aspects, farming practices, shapes and surface areas) were monitored to represent the variability of the study area. They can be grouped into four classes of land cover: 39 grassland areas, 100 plots of wheat, 13 plots of barley, 20 plots of rapeseed, and 2 classes of bare soil: 23 plots of small roughness and 16 plots of medium roughness. Satellite radar images in the X-, C- and L-bands (HH polarization) were acquired between 14 and 18 April 2010. Optical images delivered by Formosat-2 and corresponding field data were acquired on 14 April 2010.The results show that combining images acquired in the L-band (Alos) and the optical range (Formosat-2) improves the classification performance (overall accuracy = 0.85, kappa = 0.81) compared to the use of radar or optical data alone. The results obtained for the various types of land cover show performance levels and confusions related to the phenological stage of the species studied, with the geometry of the cover, the roughness states of the surfaces, etc. Performance is also related to the wavelength and penetration depth of the signal providing the images. Thus, the results show that the quality of the classification often increases with increasing wavelength of the images used.

TI  - Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA): Machine learning for accurate prediction of hospitalization in subjects suspected of arboviral infection
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryPatient triage is a critical decision for clinicians. Patients with suspected arbovirus infection are difficult to diagnose as symptoms can be vague and molecular testing can be expensive or unavailable. Determining whether these patients should be hospitalized or not can be challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Our study included data from 543 subjects with a diagnosis of suspected dengue, chikungunya, or Zika infection. Using a machine learning approach, we tested the ability of seven algorithms to predict hospitalization status based on the signs, symptoms, and laboratory data that would be available to a clinician at patient intake. Using only signs and symptoms, we were able to predict hospitalization with high accuracy (94%). Including laboratory data also resulted in highly accurate prediction of hospitalization (92%). This tool should be tested in future studies with new subject data. Upon further development, we envision a simple mobile application to aid in the decision-making process for clinicians in areas with limited resources.BackgroundDengue, chikungunya, and Zika are arboviruses of major global health concern. Decisions regarding the clinical management of suspected arboviral infection are challenging in resource-limited settings, particularly when deciding on patient hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine if hospitalization of individuals with suspected arboviral infections could be predicted using subject intake data.Methodology/Principal findingsTwo prediction models were developed using data from a surveillance study in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador with a high burden of arboviral infections. Data were obtained from subjects who presented at sentinel medical centers with suspected arboviral infection (November 2013 to September 2017). The first prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA)-used only demographic and symptom data. The second prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with Laboratory (SISAL)-incorporated laboratory data. These models were selected by comparing the prediction ability of seven machine learning algorithms; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the prediction of a test dataset was used to select the final algorithm for each model. After eliminating those with missing data, the SISA dataset had 534 subjects, and the SISAL dataset had 98 subjects. For SISA, the best prediction algorithm was the generalized boosting model, with an AUC of 0.91. For SISAL, the best prediction algorithm was the elastic net with an AUC of 0.94. A sensitivity analysis revealed that SISA and SISAL are not directly comparable to one another.

TI  - Senegal's Grand Magal of Touba: Syndromic Surveillance during the 2016 Mass Gathering
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Grand Magal of Touba (GMT) is an annual 1-day Muslim religious event that takes place in Touba in Senegal. The city of Touba swells from 800,000 to four million people during the GMT. All patients who attended one of the 154 dedicated medical care public healthcare structures of the medical region of Diourbel during theGMTwere included in a cross-sectional survey from November 16 to November 21, 2016. Demographic, morbidity, and mortality data were collected on a daily basis using a standardized article form that allows data to be recorded in a free-text format. Data were obtained from a total of 20,850 healthcare encounters, and 30.9% patients were aged <= 15 years. The most frequent conditions were gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases. Most frequent gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal and gastric pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea, suggesting that most patients suffered gastroenteritis. The predominance of cough, rhinitis, influenza-like illness, and sore throat among patients with respiratory symptoms suggests that most patients suffered from upper respiratory tract infections. Other frequent symptoms were headaches and pain in various organs. Three percentage of patients were considered to have malaria, 29.8% of patients were prescribed antibiotics and 2.6% antimalarial drugs, and 1.5% of patients were hospitalized. Only one death was recorded. Preparedness of the medical infrastructure should target these syndromic features, in terms of diagnostic tools and specific treatments, including pediatric formulations. It is also essential to improve the quality and rapid availability of data to enable real-time analysis of medical events at the GMT and to implement a rapid response, if necessary.

TI  - Monitoring spatial LULC changes and its growth prediction based on statistical models and earth observation datasets of Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known and witnessed the fact that in recent years the growth of urbanization and increasing urban population in the cities, particularly in developing countries, are the primary concern for urban planners and other environmental professionals. The present study deals with multi-temporal satellite data along with statistical models to map and monitor the LULC change patterns and prediction of urban expansion in the upcoming years for one of the important cities of Ganga alluvial Plain. With the help of our study, we also tried to portray the impact of urban sprawl on the natural environment. The long-term LULC and urban spatial change modelling was carried out using Landsat satellite data from 2001 to 2016. The assessment of the outcome showed that increase in urban built-up areas favoured a substantial decline in the agricultural land and rural built-up areas, from 2001 to 2016. Shannon's entropy index was also used to measure the spatial growth patterns over the period of time in the study area based on the land-use change statistics. Prediction of the future land-use growth of the study area for 2019, 2022 and 2031 was carried out using artificial neural network method through Quantum GIS software. Results of the simulation model revealed that 14.7% of urban built-up areas will increase by 2019, 15.7% by 2022 and 18.68% by 2031. The observation received from the present study based on the long-term classification of satellite data, statistical methods and field survey indicates that the predicted LULC map of the area will be precious information for policy and decision-makers for sustainable urban development and natural resource management in the area for food and water security.

TI  - Validation and Comparison of Water Quality Products in Baltic Lakes Using Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters, including lakes, are one of the key points of the carbon cycle. Using remote sensing data in lake monitoring has advantages in both temporal and spatial coverage over traditional in-situ methods that are time consuming and expensive. In this study, we compared two sensors on different Copernicus satellites: Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 to validate several processors and methods to derive water quality products with best performing atmospheric correction processor applied. For validation we used in-situ data from 49 sampling points across four different lakes, collected during 2018. Level-2 optical water quality products, such as chlorophyll-a and the total suspended matter concentrations, water transparency, and the absorption coefficient of the colored dissolved organic matter were compared against in-situ data. Along with the water quality products, the optical water types were obtained, because in lakes one-method-to-all approach is not working well due to the optical complexity of the inland waters. The dynamics of the optical water types of the two sensors were generally in agreement. In most cases, the band ratio algorithms for both sensors with optical water type guidance gave the best results. The best algorithms to obtain the Level-2 water quality products were different for MSI and OLCI. MSI always outperformed OLCI, with R-2 0.84-0.97 for different water quality products. Deriving the water quality parameters with optical water type classification should be the first step in estimating the ecological status of the lakes with remote sensing.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability in spate irrigation systems in Khirthar National Range, Sindh, Pakistan (case study)
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) have been used successfully to monitor and assess the land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and their impacts on people and the environment. LULC change detection is essential for studying spatiotemporal conditions and for proposing better future planning and development options. The current research analyzes the detection of spatiotemporal variability of spate irrigation systems using remote sensing and GIS in the Khirthar National Range, Sindh Province of Pakistan. We use Landsat images to study the dynamics of LULC using ArcGIS software and categorize five major LULC types. We obtain secondary data related to precipitation and crop yield from the provincial department of revenue. The maximum likelihood supervised classification (MLSC) procedure, augmented with secondary data, reveals a significant increase of 86.25% in settlements, 83.85% in spate irrigation systems, and 65% in vegetation, and a substantial negative trend of 39.50% in water bodies and 20% in barren land during the period from 2013 to 2018. Our study highlights an increase in settlements due to the inflow of local population for better means of living and an increase in spate irrigation systems, which indicates the water conservation practices for land cultivation and human purpose lead to the shrinkage of water bodies. The confusion matrix using Google Earth data to rectify modeled (classified) data, which showed an overall accuracy of 82.8%-92%, and the Kappa coefficient estimated at 0.80-0.90 shows the satisfactory results of the LULC classification. The study suggests the need to increase water storage potential with the appropriate water conservation techniques to enhance the spate irrigation system in the hilly tracts for sustainable developments, which mitigates drought impact and reduces migration rate by providing more opportunities through agricultural activities in the study area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics of the Association between AOD and PM over the California Central Valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many air pollution health effects studies rely on exposure estimates of particulate matter (PM) concentrations derived from remote sensing observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Simple but robust calibration models between AOD and PM are therefore important for generating reliable PM exposures. We conduct an in-depth examination of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship by leveraging data from the Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON) field campaign where eight NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites were co-located with EPA Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring sites in California's Central Valley from November 2012 to April 2013. With this spatiotemporally rich data we found that linear calibration models (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 10.38 mu g/m(3)) were significantly improved when spatial (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 9.54 mu g/m(3)), temporal (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 8.30 mu g/m(3)), and spatiotemporal (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 7.58 mu g/m(3)) functions were included. As a use-case we applied the best spatiotemporal model to convert space-borne MultiAngle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) AOD observations to predict PM2.5 over the region (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 8.42 mu g/m(3)). Our results imply that simple AERONET AOD-PM2.5 calibrations are robust and can be reliably applied to space-borne AOD observations, resulting in PM2.5 prediction surfaces for use in downstream applications.

TI  - Transformative Urban Changes of Beijing in the Decade of the 2000s
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid economic growth, the exodus from rural to urban areas, and the associated extreme urban development that occurred in China in the decade of the 2000s have severely impacted the environment in Beijing, its vicinity, and beyond. This article presents an innovative approach for assessing mega-urban changes and their impact on the environment based on the use of decadal QuikSCAT (QSCAT) satellite data, acquired globally by the SeaWinds scatterometer over that period. The Dense Sampling Method (DSM) is applied to QSCAT data to obtain reliable annual infrastructure-based urban observations at a posting of similar to 1 km. The DSM-QSCAT data, along with different DSM-based change indices, were used to delineate the extent of the Beijing infrastructure-based urban area in each year between 2000 and 2009, and assess its development over time, enabling a physical quantification of its urbanization which reflects the implementation of various development policies during the same time period. Eventually, as a proxy for the impact of Beijing urbanization on the environment, the decadal trend of its infrastructure-based urbanization is compared with that of the corresponding tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column densities as observed from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) instrument aboard the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-2) between 2000 and 2002, and from the SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY aboard of the ESA's ENVIronmental SATellite (SCIAMACHY /ENVISAT) between 2003 and 2009. Results reveal a threefold increase of the yearly tropospheric NO2 column density within the Beijing infrastructure-based urban area extent in 2009, which had quadrupled since 2000.

TI  - Deep Learning in Archaeological Remote Sensing: Automated Qanat Detection in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we report the results of our work on automated detection of qanat shafts on the Cold War-era CORONA Satellite Imagery. The increasing quantity of air and space-borne imagery available to archaeologists and the advances in computational science have created an emerging interest in automated archaeological detection. Traditional pattern recognition methods proved to have limited applicability for archaeological prospection, for a variety of reasons, including a high rate of false positives. Since 2012, however, a breakthrough has been made in the field of image recognition through deep learning. We have tested the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of archaeological features. Our case study is the qanat systems of the Erbil Plain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The signature of the underground qanat systems on the remote sensing data are the semi-circular openings of their vertical shafts. We choose to focus on qanat shafts because they are promising targets for pattern recognition and because the richness and the extent of the qanat landscapes cannot be properly captured across vast territories without automated techniques. Our project is the first effort to use automated techniques on historic satellite imagery that takes advantage of neither the spectral imagery resolution nor very high (sub-meter) spatial resolution.

TI  - Is Naturalism an Ideology?
T2  - DEUTSCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHILOSOPHIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Naturalism is the current orthodoxy in analytic philosophy. Naturalism is the conjunction of the (ontological) claim that all that truly exists are the entities countenanced by the natural sciences and the (epistemological) claim that the only true knowledge is natural-scientific knowledge. Drawing on some recent work in Critical Theory, this article argues that naturalism qualifies as an ideology. This is the case because naturalism meets three key aspects shared by paradigmatic cases of ideology: (i) naturalism has practical consequences and implications of a specific kind, (ii) those endorsing naturalism fall prey to a dual deception: having false meta-level beliefs about naturalism as being without alternative, and (iii) naturalism has a tendency towards self-immunisation. The article ends by suggesting we pull naturalism out of our collective cognitive backgrounds onto the main stage of critical discourse, making it a proper topic for philosophical critique again.

TI  - Changing fluvial styles and backwater flooding along the Upper Paraguay River plains in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The channel-floodplain relationship is used to understand flooding dynamics in the Pantanal wetland. To understand how different fluvial styles along the Upper Paraguay River (UPR) control the hydrology of the Pantanal wetland, we used a database including 11 gauge stations from the Brazilian National Agency of Waters, Landsat series satellite data, GeoCover images circa 1990 and 2000, the SRTM 90 m digital elevation model (DEM) and 34 acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) sections. We defined eight very distinct fluvial zones in the UPR within the Pantanal based on the channel-floodplain morphology, channel pattern, hydrologic function, and channel slope. Three zones are narrowing plains (Amolar, Urucum and Fecho dos Morros) constrained by geological features on the western border of the Pantanal sedimentary basin, which act as bottlenecks for flood runoff and produce backwater effects that delay flood wave transmission. In each of these narrow zones, the flood wave is delayed by flow velocity reduction, generating huge water bodies upstream that store flood water and affect the duration and amplitude of floods. The existence of three bottlenecks and the occurrence of a backwater effect constrain flood waves along the river, conditioning the hydrological regime of the entire wetland and resulting in unusual rating curves at some gauge stations along the UPR. This peculiar hydrological regime is responsible for the functioning of the wetland, including the undesirable "dequada" phenomena (natural fish mortality events). The backwater effect is enhanced by the existence of large flood basins upstream of the bottlenecks, where waters can be temporarily retained for periods of months, delaying the surface runoff and prolonging the flood season, which contributes to the maintenance of the wetland and its rich ecosystem.

TI  - Aspects of spatiality in African architecture
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue of architecture with an African identity has been persistently debated in South Africa since democracy in 1994. There seems to be broad consensus that the essence of Afrocentric architecture is culturally appropriate spaces, rather than aesthetics, but few white architects understand how spaces are actually experienced by black people. To investigate this notion the study explores the views of black authors and architects, using a framework originally proposed by the French philosopher, Henri Lefebvre. Thoughts on spatial perceptions and the African worldview are juxtaposed with a review of space in architectural theory in general. Three case studies are briefly assessed in terms of the findings. It is concluded that Lefebvre's triad remains valid, but should be considered much more fluid and overlapping, than is represented in the Western publications.

TI  - Desert Roughness Retrieval Using CYGNSS GNSS-R Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess the potential use of data recorded by the Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation to characterize desert surface roughness. The study is applied over the Sahara, the largest non-polar desert in the world. This is based on a spatio-temporal analysis of variations in Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data, expressed as changes in reflectivity (Gamma). In general, the reflectivity of each type of land surface (reliefs, dunes, etc.) encountered at the studied site is found to have a high temporal stability. A grid of CYGNSS Gamma measurements has been developed, at the relatively fine resolution of 0.03 degrees x 0.03 degrees, and the resulting map of average reflectivity, computed over a 2.5-year period, illustrates the potential of CYGNSS data for the characterization of the main types of desert land surface (dunes, reliefs, etc.). A discussion of the relationship between aerodynamic or geometric roughness and CYGNSS reflectivity is proposed. A high correlation is observed between these roughness parameters and reflectivity. The behaviors of the GNSS-R reflectivity and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscattering coefficient are compared and found to be strongly correlated. An aerodynamic roughness (Z(0)) map of the Sahara is proposed, using four distinct classes of terrain roughness.

TI  - Monitoring Rock Glacier Kinematics with Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active rock glaciers represent the best visual expression of mountain permafrost that can be mapped and monitored directly using remotely sensed data. Active rock glaciers are bodies that consist of a perennially frozen ice/rock mixture and express a distinct flow-like morphology indicating downslope permafrost creep movement. Annual rates of motion have ranged from a few millimeters to several meters per year, varying within the annual cycle, from year to year, as well as at the decennial time scale. During the last decade, in situ observations in the European Alps have shown that active rock glaciers are responding almost synchronously to inter-annual and decennial changes in ground temperature, suggesting that the relative changes of their kinematics are a general indicator of the evolution of mountain permafrost conditions. Here, we used satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) to monitor the rate of motion of various active rock glaciers in the Swiss Alps, Qeqertarsuaq (Western Greenland), and the semiarid Andes of South America. Velocity time series computed with Sentinel-1 SAR images, regularly acquired since 2014, every six days over Europe and Greenland and every 12 days over the Andes, show annual fluctuations, with higher velocities at the end of the summer. A JERS-1 image pair of 1996 and stacks of very high-resolution SAR images from TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed from 2008 to 2017 were analyzed using InSAR and offset tracking over the Western Swiss Alps in order to extend the main observation period of our study. A quantitative assessment of the accuracy of InSAR and offset tracking was performed by comparison with in situ methods. Our results for the three different study regions demonstrate that Sentinel-1 InSAR can complement worldwide in situ measurements of active rock glacier kinematics.

TI  - Association of moderately abnormal behavior and administered neuraminidase inhibitors
T2  - DRUG DISCOVERIES AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our earlier study investigated the incidence of severe abnormal behavior associated with neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs), but some studies have specifically examined the association of oseltamivir use and moderately abnormal behavior. Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess associations between moderately abnormal behavior and administered drugs. All cases of patients with influenza who exhibited moderately abnormal behavior were reported to us by physicians of all sentinel clinics and hospitals for influenza throughout Japan. Open Data of the National Database of Electronic Medical Claims include the numbers of patients diagnosed as having influenza who were prescribed NI. Incidence by NI was tested using Fisher's exact test. We received 518 moderately abnormal cases in 5-9-year-olds and 207 moderately abnormal behavior cases in 10-19-year-olds. The incidence among NI ranged from 193 per one million influenza patients in laninamivir among 10-19-year-olds to 1021 for peramivir among 5-9-year-olds. Estimation results revealed the order of risk among NIs as peramivir, oseltamivir, zanamivir and laninamivir in moderate abnormal behavior. Because of data limitations, risk among patients with and without NI cannot be compared.

TI  - A Dual Satellite Interferometric Precise Localization Method Based on Short Synthetic Aperture
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual satellite TDOA/FDOA localization is achieved by the TDOA hyperboloid and FDOA hyperboloid. The accuracy of localization is affected by TDOA/FDOA accuracy. In order to measure accurately the TDOA/FDOA, a method of TDOA/FDOA measurement based on short synthetic aperture is presented. This method improves the measurement accuracy by using a certain length of synthetic aperture. For narrowband signals, the method has the ability to estimate a single satellite Doppler frequency, and the frequency difference can be obtained from the results estimated by the two satellites. For wideband signals, high-precision estimates of frequency differences can be obtained by dual satellite data interference. For short-term stable radar signals, the processing results of STK simulation data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Multitemporal Land Use and Land Cover Classification from Time-Series Landsat Datasets Using Harmonic Analysis with a Minimum Spectral Distance Algorithm
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of historical and present land use and land cover (LULC) information and its changes, such as urbanization and urban growth, is critical for city planners, land managers and resource managers in any rapidly changing landscape. To deal with this situation, the development of a new supervised classification method for multitemporal LULC mapping with long-term reliable information is necessary. The ultimate goal of this study was to develop a new classification method using harmonic analysis with a minimum spectral distance algorithm for multitemporal LULC mapping. Here, the Jiangning District of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, China was chosen as the study area. The research methodology consisted of two main components: (1) Landsat data selection and time-series spectral reflectance reconstruction and (2) multitemporal LULC classification using HA with a minimum spectral distance algorithm. The results revealed that the overall accuracy and Kappa hat coefficients of the four LULC maps in 2000, 2006, 2011, and 2017 were 97.03%, 90.25%, 91.19%, 86.32% and 95.35%, 84.48%, 86.74%, 80.24%, respectively. Further, the average producer accuracy and user accuracy of the urban and built-up land, agricultural land, forest land, and water bodies from the four LULC maps were 92.30%, 90.98%, 94.80%, 85.65% and 90.28%, 93.17%, 84.40%, 99.50%, respectively. Consequently, it can be concluded that the newly developed supervised classification method using harmonic analysis with a minimum spectral distance algorithm can efficiently classify multitemporal LULC maps.

TI  - Effects of land-use change on eco-environmental quality in Hainan Island, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hainan Island is the largest tropical island in China, which is vulnerable to intensifying human activities, such as deforestation and urbanization affecting the quality of the eco-environment on regional scale. To quantify the temporal and spatial changes of the environment, multispectral Landsat data with 30-m spatial resolution was used to establish an Eco-environmental Quality Index (EQI) model for evaluating the ecological status of Hainan Island from 1990 to 2015. According to the EQI value, the study area was divided into different regions marked by five eco-environmental quality levels: excellent, good, normal, poor, and very poor. Finally, temporal and spatial analysis was incorporated into the eco-environmental quality assessment, and the effect of land-use changes on eco-environmental quality was discussed. The results indicated that the overall eco-environmental quality of Hainan Island belonged to the good class but with obvious spatial variation: the eco-environmental quality was excellent in the central mountainous area, good in the flat plane surrounding the mountains, whereas the quality was normal in the coastal areas. From a temporal perspective, the eco-environmental quality of Hainan Island has reduced slightly from 1990 to 2015, while the regions gaining better quality grades have exceeded those becoming worse. Land-use changes dominated eco-environmental quality variations during the study period in Hainan Island: areas of poor eco-environmental quality have expanded in residential regions and eco-environmental quality of rubber plantations has increased since its expanding area has been converted from land of worse eco-environmental quality grades. The EQI results are expected to provide a quantitative foundation for planning sustainable development and the rational use of resources in Hainan Island.

TI  - Scatter Matrix Based Domain Adaptation for Bi-Temporal Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis (TSA) based on multi-temporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images can deeply mine the scattering characteristics of objects in different stages and improve the interpretation effect, or help to extract the range of surface changes. However, as far as classification is concerned, it is difficult to directly generate the classification map for a new temporal image, by the use of conventional TSA or change detection methods. Once some labeled samples exist in historical temporal images, semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA) is able to use historical label information to infer the categories of pixels in the new image, which is a potential solution to the above problem. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised DA algorithm is proposed, which inherits the merits of maximum margin criterion and principal component analysis in the DA learning scenario. Using a kernel mapping function established on the statistical distribution of PolSAR data, the proposed algorithm aims to find an optimal subspace for eliminating domain influence and keeping the key information of bi-temporal images. Experiments on both UAVSAR and Radarsat-2 multi-temporal datasets show that, superior classification results with the average accuracy of about 80% can be obtained by a simple classifier trained with historical labeled samples in the learned low- dimensional subspaces.

TI  - Red-Edge Band Vegetation Indices for Leaf Area Index Estimation From Sentinel-2/MSI Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of leaf area index (LAI) from optical remotely sensed data based on vegetation indices (VIs) is a quick and practical approach to acquire LAI over vast areas. Reflectance in the red-edge bands is sensitive to vegetation status, and its information is thought to be useful in agricultural applications. Based on three red-edge band observations (represented as RE1, RE2, and RE3 for bands 5-7) from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite, this article aims to investigate the feasibility and performance of using red-edge bands for LAI estimates with the VI method and ground-measured LAI data sets. Sensitivity analysis from PROSAIL simulations revealed that RE1 is mainly affected by the influence of the leaf chlorophyll content, and this uncertainty should not be ignored during LAI estimation. For the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified simple ratio (MSR), chlorophyll index (CI), and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the optimal combination of Sentinel-2 bands for LAI estimation was RE2 and RE3, with a minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.75. Four 3-band red-edge VIs were proposed to exploit the full content of the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2, and their performance in LAI estimation improved slightly. However, both 2-band red-edge VIs and 3-band red-edge VIs remained slightly saturated at high LAI levels; therefore, a segmental estimation with a threshold was suggested for large LAIs. The results indicate that the optimal 2-band red-edge VIs and proposed 3-band red-edge VIs are effective tools for crop LAI estimation in multiple-growth stages with Sentinel-2 MSI images.

TI  - Geoweaver: Advanced Cyberinfrastructure for Managing Hybrid Geoscientific AI Workflows
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - AI (artificial intelligence)-based analysis of geospatial data has gained a lot of attention. Geospatial datasets are multi-dimensional; have spatiotemporal context; exist in disparate formats; and require sophisticated AI workflows that include not only the AI algorithm training and testing, but also data preprocessing and result post-processing. This complexity poses a huge challenge when it comes to full-stack AI workflow management, as researchers often use an assortment of time-intensive manual operations to manage their projects. However, none of the existing workflow management software provides a satisfying solution on hybrid resources, full file access, data flow, code control, and provenance. This paper introduces a new system named Geoweaver to improve the e fficiency of full-stack AI workflow management. It supports linking all the preprocessing, AI training and testing, and post-processing steps into a single automated workflow. To demonstrate its utility, we present a use case in which Geoweaver manages end-to-end deep learning for in-time crop mapping using Landsat data. We show how Geoweaver effectively removes the tedium of managing various scripts, code, libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, servers, and platforms, greatly reducing the time, cost, and effort researchers must spend on such AI-based workflows. The concepts demonstrated through Geoweaver serve as an important building block in the future of cyberinfrastructure for AI research.

TI  - A Professional Development Course Improves Unprofessional Physician Behavior
T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2008 The Joint Commission issued a Sentinel Event Alert that further defined "behaviors that undermine a culture of safety," stating that "intimidating and disruptive behaviors" can result in medical errors that affect patient care and safety. The American College of Physician Executives found that more than 95% of respondents encountered "disturbing... and potentially dangerous" behaviors on a regular basis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a professional development program on unprofessional physician behaviors using the B29TM, a reliable and valid tool to assess workplace behaviors.Methods: A pre-post study design was used to measure changes in physicians' unprofessional behaviors using the B29, a 35-item, Web-based survey. The survey is completed as a 360 degrees assessment by peers, colleagues, administrators, and staff, and the physician completes a self-assessment. In most cases, the survey is voluntary. Those who completed both a precourse and a postcourse survey made up a convenience sample or subset of the larger number of physicians who completed the course.Results: Twenty-four of 28 physicians in the study experienced an improvement in professional behavior, demonstrated as a decrease in the number of lowest-rated items. The mean decrease for all 28 physicians was 51.1%. Lowest-rated items improved an average of 53.5% overall. T-scores increased (also improved) for 24 of 28 physicians over the six-month period.Conclusion: Unprofessional behavior by physicians, as observed and reported by their peers and colleagues, can be posi-tively modified by a relatively brief education program focused on teaching professionalism.

TI  - Mapping of Post-Wildfire Burned Area Using a Hybrid Algorithm and Satellite Data: The Case of the Camp Fire Wildfire in California, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 8, 2018, a devastating wildfire, known as the Camp Fire wildfire, was reported in Butte County, California, USA. Approximately 88 fatalities ensued, and 18,804 structures were damaged by the wildfire. As a response to this destructive wildfire, this study generated a pre- and post-wildfire maps to provide basic data for evacuation and mitigation planning. This study used Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to map the pre- and post-wildfire conditions. A support vector machine (SVM) optimized by the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) hybrid model was compared with the non-optimized SVM algorithm for classification of the pre- and post-wildfire map. The SVM-ICA produced a better accuracy (overall accuracies of 83.8% and 83.6% for pre- and post-wildfire using Landsat-8 respectively; 90.8% and 91.8% for pre- and post-wildfire using Sentinel-2 respectively), compared to SVM without optimization (overall accuracies of 80.0% and 78.9% for pre- and post-wildfire using Landsat-8 respectively; 83.3% and 84.8% for pre- and post-wildfire using Sentinel-2 respectively. In total, eight pre- and post-wildfire burned area maps were generated; these can be used to assess the area affected by the Camp Fire wildfire as well as for wildfire mitigation planning in the future.

TI  - Remote sensing of Salmonella-specific DNA fragment by using nanoporous alumina modified with the single-strand DNA probe
T2  - SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Foodborne Salmonella disease is a major public health concern. Therefore, it is crucial to design a reliable biosensor to the diagnosis of this disease. Herein, we fabricated an interferometric reflectance spectroscopy (IRS) based DNA sensor for the determination of Salmonella-specific DNA fragment concentration. For this purpose, the nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) was first fabricated. The pore walls of NAA were then functionalized with 3-aminopropyl tri-methoxy silane (NAA-NH2). After that, the amino-terminated single strand DNA(sal) (ssDNA(sal)) probe was immobilized on NAA-NH2 by the use of glutaraldehyde (Glu) as cross-linker. To detect the amount of Salmonella-specific DNA fragment, the different concentrations of Salmonella-specific DNA fragment were pumped to the analytical flow cell. Subsequently, methylene blue (MB) was pumped to the analytical flow cell to intercalate between guanine-cytosine base pairs. The intercalated MB into double-strand DNA absorbed the transferred white light to the DNA sensor and therefore, the intensity of the reflected light from the DNA sensor to the charge-coupled device detector decreased. The decrease in the intensity of the reflected light consequent on the decrease in the peak area of the IRS in the wavelength range of 450-1050 nm (peak area(450-1050 nm)). The decrease in the peak area(450-1050) (nm) had a good linear relationship with the concentration of Salmonella-specific DNA fragment in the range of 0.25-50.0 nM. The limit of detection was found to be 0.01 nM. The fabricated DNA sensor had a good selectivity to Salmonella-specific DNA fragment in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus-specific DNA fragment and Escherichia coli-specific DNA fragment.

TI  - Axillary management for young women with breast cancer varies between patients electing breast-conservation therapy or mastectomy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Axillary treatment strategies for the young woman with early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer undergoing upfront surgery found to have 1-3 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) differ significantly after BCT and mastectomy. Here we compare axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and regional nodal irradiation (NRI) rates between women electing breast-conservation therapy (BCT) versus mastectomy. Methods From 2010 to 2016, women age < 50 years with clinical T1-T2N0 breast cancer having upfront surgery and found to have a positive SLN were identified. ALND and/or NRI receipt were compared between groups. Results 192 women undergoing BCT and 165 undergoing mastectomy were identified (median age: 44 years). 5.2% (10/192) of women undergoing BCT had an ALND versus 87% (144/165) of women undergoing mastectomy (p < 0.01). NRI was given to 48% (78/165) of mastectomy patients compared to 30% (57/192) of BCT patients (p < 0.01). Of the 75 mastectomy patients with 1-2 total positive lymph nodes after completion ALND, 44% received NRI. Women undergoing mastectomy were significantly more likely to receive both ALND and NRI than women undergoing BCS (45% vs 6%, p < 0.01). Conclusion Young cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients found to have 1-3 SLN metastases received ALND, NRI, and combined ALND/NRI more frequently if they elected mastectomy over BCT. Use of both ALND and postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in this population could be reduced in the future by omitting ALND in patients for whom the need for PMRT is clear with the finding of 1-2 SLN metastases.

TI  - An automatic method for impervious surface area extraction by fusing high-resolution night light and Landsat OLI images
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised classification is a vital approach to extract impervious surface areas(ISA)from satellite images,but the training samples need to be provided through heavy manual work. To address it,this study proposed an automatic method to generate training samples from high-resolution night light data,considering that nighttime lights generated by human activities is strongly correlated with impervious surface. First,positive and negative samples for ISA were located according to the distribution of nighttime lights. Second,the feature sets were constructed by calculating the spectral and texture feature from the OLI images. Third,an ensemble ELM classifier was selected for ISA classification and extraction. Four large cities were selected as study areas to examine the performance of the proposed method in different environment. The results show that the proposed method can automatically and accurately acquire ISA with an overall accuracy higher than 93% and Kappa coefficient higher than 0.87. Furthermore,comparative experiments by biophysical composition index (BCI) and classification by manual sample were conducted to evaluate its superiority. The results show that our method has better separability for ISA and soil than the BCI. In general,the proposed method is superior to manual methods,except Harbin mostly because some impervious surfaces with weak light intensity are selected as negative samples.

TI  - Estimation of the Yield and Plant Height of Winter Wheat Using UAV-Based Hyperspectral Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield is related to national food security and economic performance, and it is therefore important to estimate this parameter quickly and accurately. In this work, we estimate the yield of winter wheat using the spectral indices (SIs), ground-measured plant height (H), and the plant height extracted from UAV-based hyperspectral images (H-CSM) using three regression techniques, namely partial least squares regression (PLSR), an artificial neural network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). The SIs, H, and H-CSM were used as input values, and then the PLSR, ANN, and RF were trained using regression techniques. The three different regression techniques were used for modeling and verification to test the stability of the yield estimation. The results showed that: (1) H-CSM is strongly correlated with H (R-2 = 0.97); (2) of the regression techniques, the best yield prediction was obtained using PLSR, followed closely by ANN, while RF had the worst prediction performance; and (3) the best prediction results were obtained using PLSR and training using a combination of the SIs and H-CSM as inputs (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 648.90 kg/ha, NRMSE = 10.63%). Therefore, it can be concluded that PLSR allows the accurate estimation of crop yield from hyperspectral remote sensing data, and the combination of the SIs and H-CSM allows the most accurate yield estimation. The results of this study indicate that the crop plant height extracted from UAV-based hyperspectral measurements can improve yield estimation, and that the comparative analysis of PLSR, ANN, and RF regression techniques can provide a reference for agricultural management.

TI  - Nearshore sandbars crest position dynamics analysed based on Earth Observation data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding long-term underwater sandbars dynamics is a key element for optimal coastal zone management, but this endeavour is often held back by data availability. In order to increase the spatial and temporal resolution, availability and quality of sandbars observations, this study proposes and evaluates a new approach for automatic extraction of sandbars positions from freely available satellite imagery, using a case study of complex waters located on the Danube Delta coast, Black Sea. Validation of the satellite extracted sandbars locations against 4 in-situ measurements between 2016 and 2018 shows a very good correlation between the two datasets, demonstrating the high accuracy of satellite-derived data in revealing the underwater morphology of the upper shoreface along large areas and with high temporal resolution. The obtained sandbars positions were then integrated into an automatic workflow able to accurately represent the seasonal and multi-annual sandbars dynamics and also to give an insight about the sandbars alongshore behavioural changes. The results are similar to the ones previously suggested by other studies, which empowered different methods. These prove the high potential of the newly proposed algorithm to be used for the automatic extraction of the positions of underwater features in the surf zone on other sites worldwide, after proper tuning of parameters in accordance with local conditions. The main constraints of the proposed approach are represented by the omission of sandbars position that imprint a low signal on the satellite image due to increased water depth (especially for the outer bar), high turbidity (mostly for the inner bar) or any other noise generation situation (sun glint, small wind waves). The main advantages of the described algorithm are related to the simplicity of implementation and adaptability to other areas of interest and other types of satellite data.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Do We Need a Delayed Image?
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a standard of care in the treatment of patients with early breast cancer, but clinical guidelines continue to be vague on details of the procedure. We were interested in the results of our 2-day protocol, which includes delayed lymphoscintigraphy at 18 h. Methods: We reviewed the results of preoperative lymphoscintigrams in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed 2 h after periareolar injection of 4 x 37 MBq Tc-99m nanocolloid (early lymphoscintigraphy) and 18 h following injection (delayed lymphoscintigraphy). The early results were compared with the late results. Results: A total of 238 lymphoscintigraphies were performed in 232 patients (6 bilateral). At 2 h, >= 1 sentinel nodes were visualized in 154/238 (65%) cases; in 84 (35%), no sentinel node was visualized. Delayed lymphoscintigraphy visualized a sentinel node in 40 of 76 (53%) cases with no visualization at 2 h and failed to show a sentinel node in 36 (47%) of these cases (in 8 cases, no delayed lymphoscintigram was obtained). Conclusions: Delayed lymphoscintigraphy was useful in about 50% of the breast cancer patients in whom immediate scintigraphy failed to demonstrate a sentinel lymph node. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Urbanization in Small Cities and Their Significant Implications on Landscape Structures: The Case in Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fundamental ideas concerning urbanization are primarily based on studies performed in large cities. It is of interest to study whether or not similar phenomena take place in smaller cities. Small cities are an inherent component of urbanization, and in the future, the majority of globalization is expected to occur in small and mid-sized cities. Understanding the effects of small cities on landscape structures is, therefore, an essential component in planning city land expansion. Accordingly, this study focused on six towns of the Oromia Special Zone Surrounding Finfinnee, Ethiopia, which is broadly known to be experiencing dramatic growth. Time-series Landsat images from 1987 to 2019 with an integrated method, landscape metrics, and built-up density analysis were employed to characterize and compare the dynamics of landscape structures, urban expansion patterns, process, and overall growth status in the towns. The results highlight that all the towns experienced accelerated growth in the built-up areas and highly scattered nature in spatial growth. Landscape ecology analysis confirmed a highly fragmented urban landscape, a significant loss of natural land covers, and disconnected and complicated agro-vegetation patches in all towns, suggesting a lack of rigorous implementation of the master plan. Results also indicated that the Oromia Special Zone surrounding Finfinnee has failed to control urban sprawl to surrounding ecological sensitive areas. The study results, more broadly, highlight that the small cities would have a limited physical and demographic footprint and relatively less contribution to the national economic agglomeration; nonetheless, they can have a notable and important impact in terms of their ecological and environmental influence. Hence, the study suggests policies for monitoring such dynamics and protecting agro-environmental connectivity with particular focus on the small cities.

TI  - A review of the application of multispectral remote sensing in the study of mangrove ecosystems with special emphasis on image processing techniques
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Much progress has been made since the first published report on application of remote sensing in mangrove mapping nearly 40 years ago. Remote sensing is now a widely used proxy in mangrove ecosystem related research mostly due to increased affordability of data and ease of access. This work reviews previous works on mangrove forests using remote sensing techniques with an aim to identify the best combinations of sensors, methods of image processing and vegetation indices for future studies. It was observed that higher accuracies were directly related to sensor resolution and expertise of the authors. From the imageries used, Quickbird had the highest accuracies ( 100%) whereas aerial photos had 93% accuracy and IRS LISS recorded (76-97%). Accuracies for Landsat images classified using hybrid approaches were up to 88% while AVIRIS and ASTER, gave up to 99% accuracies. Sentinel images also produced very high accuracy levels. Non parametric methods using machine learning techniques produced the highest levels of accuracy (up to 99%). But not all datasets are freely available and the cost of procuring datasets varies from country to country. This suggests that remote sensing of mangrove vegetation pose some serious challenges that require careful considerations in order to obtain better results. An in-depth understanding of the factors affecting the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and mangrove vegetations in the environment, selection of images with appropriate spatial and spectral resolution and use of proper processing techniques for extracting spectral information is a must. This review paper thus, can be considered as a convenient asset to the researchers involved in assessing the mangrove environment by remote sensing technique.

TI  - Genetic characterization of VP1 of coxsackieviruses A2, A4, and A10 associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease in Vietnam in 2012-2017: endemic circulation and emergence of new HFMD-causing lineages
T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While conducting sentinel surveillance of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Vietnam, we found a sudden increase in the prevalence of coxsackievirus A10 (CV-A10) in 2016 and CV-A2 and CV-A4 in 2017, the emergence of which has been reported recently to be associated with various clinical manifestations in other countries. However, there have been only a limited number of molecular studies on those serotypes, with none being conducted in Vietnam. Therefore, we sequenced the entire VP1 genes of CV-A10, CV-A4, and CV-A2 strains associated with HFMD in Vietnam between 2012 and 2017. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a trend of endemic circulation of Vietnamese CV-A10, CV-A4, and CV-A2 strains and the emergence of thus-far undescribed HFMD-causing lineages of CV-A4 and CV-A2. The Vietnamese CV-A10 strains belonged to a genotype comprising isolates from patients with HFMD from several other countries; however, most of the Vietnamese strains were grouped into a local lineage. Recently, emerging CV-A4 strains in Vietnam were grouped into a unique lineage within a genotype comprising strains isolated from patients with acute flaccid paralysis from various countries. New substitutions were detected in the putative BC and HI loops in the Vietnamese CV-A4 strains. Except for one strain, Vietnamese CV-A2 isolates were grouped into a unique lineage of a genotype that includes strains from various countries that are associated with other clinical manifestations. Enhanced surveillance is required to monitor their spread and to specify their roles as etiological agents of HFMD or "HFMD-like" diseases, especially for CV-A4 and CV-A2. Further studies including whole-genome sequencing should be conducted to fully understand the evolutionary changes occurring in these newly emerging strains.

TI  - Temporal and spatial changes in chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations in the Yellow Sea from 2002 to 2018 based on MODIS data
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton, the base of the oceanic food chain, play a fundamental role in marine ecosystems. Since the Yellow Sea, an important place for fisheries in China, is facing the grim situation of depletion of fishery resources, it is critical to understand the distribution and changes of phytoplankton in this area. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an important proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Chl-a data derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Aqua satellite from 2002 to 2018 were processed using Google Earth Engine. The temporal and spatial distribution of and changes in Chl-a concentrations were analyzed. Combined with regional climate, hydrological and geographical features, sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, salinity, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and mixed layer depth data were analyzed to investigate the causes of the distribution and variability of Chl-a concentrations in the Yellow Sea. It is found that Chl-a concentration decreased from the nearshore to the middle of the Yellow Sea, which was contributed by the input of terrestrial nutrients, nearshore upwelling and the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM). Under the control of monsoons, climate and hydrology and influence of wind speed, SST, PAR and YSCWM, the peak of Chi-a concentration appeared in April and the minimum values were in June and July. Under the influence of pollution in the coastal areas of northern Jiangsu Province and the eutrophication in seawaters, the salinity of seawater increased in the nearshore waters and so did the Chl-a concentrations in Haizhou Bay. The environmental factors, which affected the changes in Chl-a concentrations in the Yellow Sea, were complicated. Significant correlation between environmental factors and Chl-a concentration only appeared in some months. There was no one dominant factor which could influence Chl-a concentrations in the whole years and seasons.

TI  - An IPSO-BP neural network for estimating wheat yield using two remotely sensed variables in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early and accurate information of crop growth condition is vital for agricultural industry and food security, which gives rise to a strong demand for timely monitoring crop growth condition and estimating crop yields. This study selected the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which closely relate to crop growth and crop water stress as two key variables for indicating crop growth condition and estimating crop yields in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China. The single VTCI, the single LAI and the combination of VTCI and LAI at four growth stages of winter wheat (the turning green, jointing, heading-filling, and dough stages) were used as three input variable schemes of the back propagation (BP) neural network and the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO)-BP neural network using a nonlinear decreasing inertia weight, respectively. The relative importance of the input variables to the output variable, yield of winter wheat, was used to determine the weight values of input variables at each growth stage. Based on the weights, the integrated index (1) was established, and then three linear regression models (weighted VTCIs, weighted LAIs, and I values) were established with yield data to estimate winter wheat yields. By calculating several statistical functions, i.e., coefficient of determination (R-2) and probability value (P), the model between the I values and wheat yield performed better than those between the weighted VTCIs or weighted LAIs and wheat yields. The yield estimation model of / values by using the IPSO-BP neural network (R-2 = 0.342) was found to be better than that using the BP neural network (R-2 = 0.310). Therefore, we applied the model with better performance (R-2 = 0.342) to map the regional winter wheat yields pixel by pixel in the Guanzhong Plain during 2011-2018, and analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of the estimated yields. Regarding the spatial distribution, the yields in the west part of the plain are the highest, followed by the central part, and the yields in the east part are lowest, consistent with previous studies. The estimated yields showed inter-annual fluctuations along with an increasing trend on the whole. Winter wheat yields were most depleted in 2013 and most abundant in 2015. These results were consistent with the actual situation of winter wheat production in the plain, which indicated that I can be used to provide a better quantification for monitoring regional winter wheat growth conditions and estimating crop yield. Thus, the approach of this study can provide significant benefit for regional crop production monitoring.

TI  - An ecological history of the relict genetic lineage of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of extensive population sampling with whole-genome sequencing in the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana has recently allowed the identification of a genetically differentiated relict lineage. The most important nuclei of relict A. thaliana is found in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, although relict accessions have also been found scattered across Atlantic oceanic islands, eastern Mediterranean Basin, South and East Africa and China. We hypothesised that relict A. thaliana long survived and adapted to a wide array of environments in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa due to the fact that the region repeatedly acted as glacial refugia. Given the lack of evidence to support this hypothesis, we addressed this issue by studying the ecological history of Iberian and North African relict A. thaliana. To this end, we analysed the relationship between the current habitat suitability of relict A. thaliana, estimated with species distribution models, and the vegetation dynamics in the region over the last millennia using pollen fossil data from sediment cores and reconstructions of past distribution ranges of the most important tree species occurring in the region. Overall, our results indicated that a higher current habitat suitability of relict A. thaliana was correlated with more stable vegetation dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum and during the Holocene. Given that relict A. thaliana is known to harbour genetic variation specific to its relict nature, we also evaluated the differentiation between relict and non-relict A. thaliana accessions at the functional genetic level for the known flowering genes, CRY2 and TSF. Genomic surveys detected the existence of haplogroups of these genes occurring at very high frequency only among relict accessions. Overall, our study reinforced the relict character of this lineage thought to be at the base of the species' early history. We stress the need to sample in depth other geographic areas harbouring relict A. thaliana and conduct further functional genetic analyses between relict and non-relict accessions to keep disentangling the evolutionary trajectory of this annual plant.

TI  - Land-cover classification with high-resolution remote sensing images using transferable deep models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, large amount of high spatial-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images are available for land cover mapping. However, due to the complex information brought by the increased spatial resolution and the data disturbances caused by different conditions of image acquisition, it is often difficult to find an efficient method for achieving accurate land-cover classification with high-resolution and heterogeneous remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a scheme to apply deep model obtained from labeled land-cover dataset to classify unlabeled HRRS images. The main idea is to rely on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained in different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample selection scheme for improving the transferability of deep models. More precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is first pre-trained with a well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data. Then, given a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to classify the image in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are assigned with pseudo-labels and employed as the queries to retrieve related samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with the retrieved results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target image, we rely on the fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by combining patch-wise classification and hierarchical segmentation. In addition, we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing 150 Gaofen-2 satellite images for CNN pre-training. Experiments on multi-source HRRS images, including Gaofen-2, Gaofen-1, Jilin-1, Ziyuan-3, Sentinel-2A, and Google Earth platform data, show encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to land-cover classification with multi-source HRRS images.

TI  - A Scenario-Based Approach for Assessing the Hydrological Impacts of Land Use and Climate Change in the Marboreh Watershed, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In separate analyses of the impacts of land use change and climate change, a scenario-based approach using remote sensing and hydro-climatological data was developed to assess changes in hydrological indices. The data comprised three Landsat TM images (1988, 1998, 2008) and meteorological and hydrological data (1983-2012) for the Aligudarz and Doroud stations in the Marboreh watershed, Iran. The QUAC module and supervised classification maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm in ENVI 5.1 were used for remote sensing, the SWAT model for hydrological modelling and the Mann-Kendall and t test methods for statistical analysis. To create scenarios, the study period was divided into three decades (1983-1992, 1993-2002, 2003-2012) with clearly different land use/land cover (LULC). After hydrological modelling, 10 hydrological indices related to high and low flow indices (HDI and LDI) were analysed for seven scenarios developed by combining pre-defined climate periods and LULC maps. The major changes in land use were degradation of natural rangeland (- 18.49%) and increasing raid-fed farm area (+ 16.70%) and residential area (+ 0.80%). The Mann-Kendall test results showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreasing trend in rainfall and flow during 1983-2012. In the scenarios evaluated, hydrological index trends were more sensitive to climate change than to LULC changes in the study area. Low flow indices were more affected than high flow indices in both land use and climate change scenarios. The results show little impact of land use change and indicate that climate change is the main driver of hydrological variations in the catchment. This is useful information in outlining future strategies for sustainable water resources management and policy decision-making in the Marboreh watershed.

TI  - Dynamics of Soil-Productive Potential of River Basin Ecosystems Functioning in Different Climatic Conditions Assessed Basing on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the state of soil and plant resources of the territory of several river catchments, the indicator of soil-productive potential (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation based on ground and remote data, FAPAR), as well as indicators of the phytomass reserve, data on phytocenosis production and land use, and leaf area index (LAI) were used. It is shown that ecosystems of river basins located in different climatic zones react ambiguously to climate change. The data obtained make it possible to forecast the dynamics of soil-productive potential in the conditions of changes in climatic characteristics, such as temperature and precipitation. It is shown that the productive potential continues to grow with time only in those areas, where the amount of biologically active temperatures is a limiting factor, i.e., in river basins within the zone of mixed forests. It is found that in river basins with limited precipitation, the temperature increase will lead to a decrease in the soil productive potential.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the impact of atmospheric dust deposition on ocean biological productivity in association with oceanic supply of nutrients over specific regions of the Arabian Sea (20 degrees N, 69 degrees E) and the Bay of Bengal (20 degrees N, 87 degrees E) during wintertime (November-March) from the year 2012 to 2017 using satellite-based observations. During winter, selected regions are characterized by higher Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and major oceanic vertical supply of nutrients. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard Aqua space-platform is used to obtain Chl-a and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. Blended Chl-a daily product from various satellite sensors is also used. There are a total of nine cases (seven cases of the Arabian Sea region and two cases of the Bay of Bengal region) where episodic Chl-a enhancements following high AOD values are observed. Chl-a maxima lag behind AOD maxima by 1 to 4 days. Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (Version-2) is used for AOD and dust deposition flux estimation. Estimated dust deposition flux ranges between 0.44 and 27.68 mg m(-2) day(-1).

TI  - Monitoring shoreline changes along Andhra coast of India using remote sensing and geographic information system
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A shoreline is dynamic in nature which makes the interface of land and water that offers socio-economic and cultural protection to its adjacent population. The purpose of this study was to understand long-term (1973-2015 and 2015-2057) shoreline transformation as well as the patterns of soil loss/sedimentation owing to physical and anthropogenic activities along the Andhra coast. Satellite imageries of LANDSAT from 1973 to 2015 were utilized to delineate the shoreline. Shoreline fluctuations were analyzed by Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and End Point Rate (EPR) statistics using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) computer software of USGS. The highest and lowest EPR of about 67.63 m/y and -43.14 m/y were recorded in the Andhra coast. The high rate of deposition was recorded in the Godavari delta, whereas Krishna delta experienced low erosion. This study establishes the use of remote sensing data and statistical techniques such as EPR and NSM for shoreline monitoring are helpful for soil loss/accretion evaluation and future shoreline prediction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first of its kind work on the assessment of forest burnt area and fire hotspots of Myanmar using Landsat OLI data and spatial statistics tool. Burnt area analysis indicates 15.2% of vegetation area was affected by fires in 2017. Analysis of burnt area at state level indicates Kayah affected by more fires in 2017. Of the total vegetation fire occurrences from 2003 to 2017 about 44.7% were observed in the forested landscapes of Myanmar. The emerging hotspot analysis had shown the highest spatial extent of persistent hotspots followed by oscillating hotspots. Forest fire hotspots are mainly found in the states of Kayah, Shan, Bago, Nayi Pyi Taw, Magway, Mandalay, Chin, and Kayin. Overall earth observations based on 2003 to 2017 fire occurrences indicate a declining trend of fires in Myanmar. A comparison of the fire occurrences recorded by MODIS and VIIRS indicates that VIIRS is capable of detecting a greater number of fire incidences. The findings of the study would support in assessing the impact of fires on forest, its structure, composition, function, and provide valuable input for nationwide forest fire management.

TI  - Numerical modelling and remote sensing based approaches for investigating groundwater dynamics under changing land-use and climate in the agricultural region of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The shrinking groundwater resource is a major cause of ecosystem imbalance, which is further intensified by rapid changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and climate in the lower Chenab canal (LCC) of Pakistan. Present study aims to investigate groundwater dynamics using a novel approach by incorporating remote sensing data in combination with actual patterns of LULC, while statistical approach is employed for downscaling of climatic data under two emission scenarios including H3A2 and H3B2. A 3-D numerical groundwater flow model is used for evaluating current patterns of groundwater use and its dynamics. The results of water budget show a total horizontal groundwater inflow of 2844 Mm(3) and an outflow of 2720.2 Mm(3). The groundwater abstraction through pumping is about 17374.43 Mm(3) as compared to groundwater recharge of 19933.20 Mm(3), yields a surplus of 2682.87 Mm(3), which raises groundwater levels in major parts of LCC. Change in rice cultivation has the highest impact on groundwater levels in upper regions of LCC, whereas higher negative changes are observed for lower parts under decreased fodder area in place of rice, cotton and sugarcane. For climate scenarios, a rise in groundwater level is observed for 2011 to 2025, whereas, its drop is expected for the periods 2026-2035 and 2036-2045 under H3A2 scenario. Due to no imminent threats to groundwater, there is an opportunity for groundwater development through water re-allocation. Groundwater status under H3B2 emission regime is rather complex during 2011-2025. Water management under such situation requires revisiting of cropping patterns and augmenting water supply through additional surface water resources. Considering the limitations of the current study, it is recommended to update model with river flow under changing climate, and to extend investigations for combined effects of LULC and climate change.

TI  - Natural, But Not Supernatural, Literal Immortality Affirmation Attenuates Mortality Salience Effects on Worldview Defense in Atheists
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research explored whether atheists managing death awareness would be effectively buffered by affirmations of supernatural and/or natural literal immortality. Prior data were reanalyzed, revealing ambiguous results, so further experiments were conducted. In Study 1 (n = 382), atheists were randomly assigned to a supernatural afterlife-confirmed (vs. afterlife-disconfirmed) prime, an MS (vs. control topic) prime, and then given an opportunity to engage in secular worldview defense. In Study 2 (n = 360), atheists were randomly assigned to supernatural (afterlife) versus natural (medical indefinite life extension; MILE) immortality prime, an MS (vs. control topic) prime, and then given an opportunity to engage in secular worldview defense. Atheists managing death awareness increased worldview defense in the supernatural/afterlife conditions but that effect was eliminated in the MILE condition. These findings are consistent with the terror management theory perspective on worldview defense. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

TI  - Predicting Microhabitat Suitability for an Endangered Small Mammal Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping is a main challenge for endangered small-sized terrestrial species. Freely available spatio-temporal data at high resolution from multispectral satellite offer excellent opportunities for improving predictive distribution models of such species based on fine-scale habitat features, thus making it easier to achieve comprehensive biodiversity conservation goals. However, there are still few examples showing the utility of remote-sensing-based products in mapping microhabitat suitability for small species of conservation concern. Here, we address this issue using Sentinel-2 sensor-derived habitat variables, used in combination with more commonly used explanatory variables (e.g., topography), to predict the distribution of the endangered Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) in agrosilvopastorial systems. Based on vole surveys conducted in two different seasons over a similar to 176,000 ha landscape in Southern Portugal, we assessed the significance of each predictor in explaining Cabrera vole occurrence using the Boruta algorithm, a novel Random forest variant for dealing with high dimensionality of explanatory variables. Overall, results showed a strong contribution of Sentinel-2-derived variables for predicting microhabitat suitability of Cabrera voles. In particular, we found that photosynthetic activity (NDI45), specific spectral signal (SWIR1), and landscape heterogeneity (Rao's Q) were good proxies of Cabrera voles' microhabitat, mostly during temporally greener and wetter conditions. In addition to remote-sensing-based variables, the presence of road verges was also an important driver of voles' distribution, highlighting their potential role as refuges and/or corridors. Overall, our study supports the use of remote-sensing data to predict microhabitat suitability for endangered small-sized species in marginal areas that potentially hold most of the biodiversity found in human-dominated landscapes. We believe our approach can be widely applied to other species, for which detailed habitat mapping over large spatial extents is difficult to obtain using traditional descriptors. This would certainly contribute to improving conservation planning, thereby contributing to global conservation efforts in landscapes that are managed for multiple purposes.

TI  - A Common Genetic Variation in Langerin (CD207) Compromises Cellular Uptake of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF INNATE IMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Langerhans cells are key sentinel cells of the skin and mucosal lining. They sense microorganisms through their repertoire of pattern-recognition receptors to mount and direct appropriate immune responses. We recently demonstrated that human Langerhans cells interact with the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus through the Langerhans cell-specific receptor langerin (CD207). It was previously hypothesized that two linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; N288D and K313I) in the carbohydrate recognition domain of langerin would affect interaction with microorganisms. We show that recognition of S. aureus by recombinant langerin molecules is abrogated in the co-inheriting SNP variant, which is mainly explained by the N288D SNP and further enhanced by K313I. Moreover, introduction of SNP N288D in ectopically-expressed langerin affected cellular distribution of the receptor such that langerin displayed enhanced plasma membraneexpression. Despite this increased binding of S. aureus by the langerin double SNP variant, uptake of bacteria by this langerin variant was compromised. Our findings indicate that in a proportion of the human population, the recognition and uptake of S. aureus by Langerhans cells may be affected, which could have important consequences for proper immune activation and S. aureus-associated disease.

TI  - A framework to develop semiautomated surveillance of surgical site infections: An international multicenter study
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Automated surveillance of healthcare-associated infections reduces workload and improves standardization, but it has not yet been adopted widely. In this study, we assessed the performance and feasibility of an easy implementable framework to develop algorithms for semiautomated surveillance of deep incisional and organ-space surgical site infections (SSIs) after orthopedic, cardiac, and colon surgeries. Design: Retrospective cohort study in multiple countries. Methods: European hospitals were recruited and selected based on the availability of manual SSI surveillance data from 2012 onward (reference standard) and on the ability to extract relevant data from electronic health records. A questionnaire on local manual surveillance and clinical practices was administered to participating hospitals, and the information collected was used to pre-emptively design semiautomated surveillance algorithms standardized for multiple hospitals and for center-specific application. Algorithm sensitivity, positive predictive value, and reduction of manual charts requiring review were calculated. Reasons for misclassification were explored using discrepancy analyses. Results: The study included 3 hospitals, in the Netherlands, France, and Spain. Classification algorithms were developed to indicate procedures with a high probability of SSI. Components concerned microbiology, prolonged length of stay or readmission, and reinterventions. Antibiotics and radiology ordering were optional. In total, 4,770 orthopedic procedures, 5,047 cardiac procedures, and 3,906 colon procedures were analyzed. Across hospitals, standardized algorithm sensitivity ranged between 82% and 100% for orthopedic surgery, between 67% and 100% for cardiac surgery, and between 84% and 100% for colon surgery, with 72%-98% workload reduction. Center-specific algorithms had lower sensitivity. Conclusions: Using this framework, algorithms for semiautomated surveillance of SSI can be successfully developed. The high performance of standardized algorithms holds promise for large-scale standardization.

TI  - Automated water surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8/TIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of Land and Water Surface Temperature (L/WST) has many applications in studies of terrestrial and aquatic ecology. Retrieval of L/WST requires a well calibrated radiometer and an accurate atmospheric correction. In the present study, the performance of the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated for the retrieval of L/WST. libRadtran is used to retrieve atmospheric correction parameters based on atmospheric profiles of relative humidity and temperature from three global atmospheric models. Performance of single band retrievals is compared to typical MODTRAN results from the Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) and a split-window approach. A multi-temporal land masking method using imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat 8 is demonstrated, and is used to automatically classify imagery in the matchup dataset in three classes of cloud cover. Two sources of in situ data covering the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ) are used for validation of the L/WST product: (1) fixed locations in the Flemish Banks measurement network and (2) underway data from regular RV Belgica campaigns. In the present study the single band methods outperformed the split-window approach, and consistent retrievals are found for the MODTRAN and libRadtran simulations. Typical single band surface temperature retrievals in quasi cloud-free conditions have Root Mean Squared Differences (RMSD) of 0.7 K and 1 K for Bands 10 and 11 with low bias, depending on the method and atmospheric profile source. For imagery with scattered clouds, RMSD values increase to 1 K and 2 K respectively with an approximately 0.5 K cold bias, likely caused by cloud proximity. The calibration efforts combined into Collection 1 allows for accurate absolute surface temperature retrievals from B10 on Landsat 8/TIRS for homogeneous targets with known emissivity, such as liquid water. The method is adapted to global processing and can be used for Land Surface Temperature retrieval with a suitable source of emissivity data.

TI  - Identification of Snow Using Fully Polarimetric SAR Data Based On Entropy and Anisotropy
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, with the extensive availability of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, methods that are simple and efficient, and involve lesser computation and data processing, are needed to be explored for snow cover mapping. This paper analyzes different polarimetric parameters such as entropy, anisotropy, and the mean scattering angle for the identification of snow cover area. We present a novel index for mapping snow cover based on the assessment of entropy (H) and anisotropy (A) using fully polarimetric SAR data and refer to it as the radar snow fraction (RSF). The RSF is proposed as an extension of the H(1-A) metric by applying a sigmoidal function to this metric. The experiments to evaluate the applicability of the proposed RSF are carried out using fully polarimetric SAR data of L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and C-band RADARSAT-2 data sets corresponding to different geographical locations in the Indian Himalayas. The developed snow cover maps from the proposed method were validated with respect to reference snow cover maps derived by thresholding the Normalized Differenced Snow Index developed from multispectral data (e.g., Landsat-8 imagery). These maps were also statistically compared with those obtained from the conventional radar snow index, which is based on the polarization fraction. We determined a mean overall accuracy of 0.8 between the developed snow cover maps and the reference maps for the different data sets used for experiments. The results showed that, in general, the RSF outperformed the other polarimetric parameters for snow cover detection.Plain Language Summary Fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data are widely used for the studies of snow geophysical parameters requiring good quality snow cover area (SCA) maps. There are limited methods in the literature for SCA mapping using fully PolSAR data. Some of these methods are based on multitemporal backscatter response, which requires more data sets that are commercial and expensive; efforts toward the development of methods, which can discriminate snow using a single data sets, are desirable. This study examines the potential of the proposed radar snow fraction (RSF) index, which is based on fully polarimetric SAR data utilizing the response of entropy (H) and anisotropy (A) for snow cover mapping. The parameter RSF is an extension of the H(1-A) metric, which utilizes a sigmoidal filter function to this metric. The proposed method, the conventional radar snow index (RSI), and the other polarimetric parameters are evaluated for SCA mapping for different L-band and C-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and RADARSAT-2 data sets for rugged terrains in various locations in the Indian Himalayas. This study also compared the RSF with RSI for SCA mapping and delineated better results for the RSF.

TI  - TanDEM-X DEM: Comparative performance review employing LIDAR data and DSMs
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The generation of a truly global DEM with enhanced accuracy, resolution and coverage was the main objective of the TanDEM-X mission. The mission is innovative for many reasons and as a result an abundance of research about its technology has been published so far. This paper aims to fill the literature gap between the scientific use of the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X data and the practical use of the final TanDEM-X DEM. A review of the DEM is performed over non trivial areas of the globe, some of which are test sites of international scientific societies. LIDAR data and DSMs are used as reference elevation information and other widely used global DEMs are employed. The visual inspection and the accuracy analysis over 14 sites in Europe, USA and Antarctica show the clear superiority of the TanDEM-X DEM in the family of global DEMs, regardless of the latitude, the terrain type and the land cover. The TanDEM-X DEM is more morphologically detailed than the AW3D30, the ASTER and the SRTM global DEMs, which agrees with its much finer pixel spacing. It is also more complete than the other global DEMs, especially over the polar test sites. The accuracy analysis shows that the TanDEM-X DEM is more accurate than the other global DEMs with RMSEs ranging from 1.0 to 8.7 m, while the RMSEs of the AW3D30, the ASTER, the 1 arcsec SRTM and the 3 arcsec SRTM range from 2.6 to 49.0 m, from 8.3 to 80.2 m, from 3.0 to 8.7 m and from 7.3 to 20.5 m, respectively. The accuracy analysis also shows that the TanDEM-X DEM has better geolocation accuracy, and the application of the computed 3D bias with respect to the reference data leaves the RMSE practically unaffected. All in all, it seems that the TanDEM-X DEM paves the way for a new generation of global DEMs and re-introduces SAR as a state-of-the art technology for global topographic, and other, applications.

AB  - Natural processes driving the dynamics of tidal inlets have been studied in length, however, as human influence in the coastal environment persists, there is a need to comprehend how both natural and human-induced processes drive different aspects of tidal inlet morphological evolution. An effort to understand the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic-induced processes in a tidal inlet is pursued by studying Oregon Inlet, considered one of the most dynamic inlets in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, USA. The temporal and spatial scales of the anthropogenic processes driving the morphological evolution of this tidal inlet are studied by means of remotely sensed data and in-situ observations gathered from 2005 until 2015. Effects of natural process that cannot be gathered from observations are studied via a morphological model based on Delft3D. Evolutional trends include the cyclical response of the main channel of the inlet to dredging, a 13 degrees northward rotation of the main channel, and frequent sediment transport reversal in the southern shoulder. Simulations indicate a net sediment transport rate into the inlet of 205,000 m(3)/yr. Tidal currents are responsible for 55% of such transport, while waves account for the remaining 45%. After a 2-year non-dredging modeling scenario, sediments from the subaqueous spit form a detached shoal in the north side of the flood delta and the main channel remains open branching into two dominant channels. Observations and model results indicate that Oregon Inlet has been in a state of stable equilibrium in the past decade. Natural and human-induced processes contribute to such equilibrium. This study exemplifies the decadal behavior of a tidal inlet influenced by natural processes, infrastructure, and dredging. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A worldwide perspective of the legislation and regulations governing sentinel plants
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel plants, plants in exporting countries that are inspected at regular intervals for signs and symptoms of invertebrate pests and microbial pathogens, are a promising tool for detecting and identifying harmful organisms of woody plants prior to their introduction into importing countries. Monitoring of sentinel plants reveals crucial information for pest risk analyses and the development of mitigation measures. The establishment of sentinel plants requires the import and plantation of non-native plants, which may be affected by the laws, regulations and administrative procedures in the individual countries. To evaluate the feasibility of sentinel plants as a global approach, this study aimed to summarise regulations and administrative procedures that affect the establishment of sentinel plants using non-native plants in countries worldwide. Information about national regulations of import and planting of non-native plant species was collected through a questionnaire survey, conducted among national representatives to the International Plant Protection Convention. Over 40 countries responded. The results show that legislations and regulations should not be major obstacles for a global use of the sentinel plants approach. However, the few existing experiences show that it can be complicated in practice. Here we describe the current state of art of the procedures that should be adopted to establish sentinel plants and we propose a strategy to circumvent the shortcomings resulting from the lack of a specific regulation.

TI  - A review of environmental droughts: Increased risk under global warming?
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - This article reviews current drought effects on environmental systems. It stresses the need for considering environmental drought as a relevant type to be included in drought classifications. Here we illustrate that drought has complex environmental effects and affects many different systems (e.g., soils, air, vegetation, and forests, aquatic systems and wildlife). Droughts can affect the quality, structure, and diversity of these systems. However, we find that most environmental systems show strong resistance and resilience to drought events, and the effects of drought are usually temporary. Structural effects of environmental droughts tend to only occur in areas that are perturbed or in communities near their distribution limits. There are few long-term experimental studies that quantify possible trends in drought effects on environmental systems. Nevertheless, existing studies of forests that are based on tree-ring chronologies or forest inventories indicate increased drought-related effects on environmental systems. Future climate change scenarios suggest increased drought severity worldwide, which could alter the vulnerability of different environmental systems and increase the number of structural drought effects.

TI  - Metagenomics Uncovers a Core SAR11 Population in Brackish Surface Waters of the Baltic Sea
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltic Sea represents one of the largest brackish ecosystems where various environmental factors control dynamic seasonal shifts in the structure, diversity, and function of the planktonic microbial communities. In this study, despite seasonal fluctuations, several bacterial populations (<2% of the total OTUs) that are highly dominant (25% of relative abundance) and highly frequently occurring (>85% of occurrence) over four seasons were identified. Mathematical models using occurrence frequency and relative abundance data were able to describe community assembly persisting over time. Further, this work uncovered one of the core bacterial populations phylogenetically affiliated to SAR11 subclade Ma. The analysis of the hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene and single copy housekeeping genes recovered from metagenomic datasets suggested that the population was unexpectedly evolutionarily closely related to those inhabiting a mesosaline lacustrine ecosystem rather than other marine/coastal members. Our metagenomic results further revealed that the newly-identified population was the major driver facilitating the seasonal shifts in the overall community structure over the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. The core community uncovered in this study supports the presence of a brackish water microbiome distinguishable from other marine and freshwater counterparts and will be a useful sentinel for monitoring local/global environmental changes posed on brackish surface waters.

TI  - Identification of <i>Heracleum sosnowskyi</i>-Invaded Land Using Earth Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - H. sosnowskyi (Heracleumsosnowskyi) is a plant that is widespread both in Lithuania and other countries and causes abundant problems. The damage caused by the population of the plant is many-sided: it menaces the biodiversity of the land, poses risk to human health, and causes considerable economic losses. In order to find effective and complex measures against this invasive plant, it is very important to identify places and areas where H. sosnowskyi grows, carry out a detailed analysis, and monitor its spread to avoid leaving this process to chance. In this paper, the remote sensing methodology was proposed to identify territories covered with H. sosnowskyi plants (land classification). Two categories of land cover classification were used: supervised (human-guided) and unsupervised (calculated by software). In the application of the supervised method, the average wavelength of the spectrum of H. sosnowskyi was calculated for the classification of the RGB image and according to this, the unsupervised classification by the program was accomplished. The combination of both classification methods, performed in steps, allowed obtaining better results than using one. The application of authors' proposed methodology was demonstrated in a Lithuanian case study discussed in this paper.

TI  - Estimating Wind Speed and Direction Using Wave Spectra
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact wave buoys are increasingly used to provide monitoring of coastal and oceanic conditions by measuring surface waves in real time. Due to their relatively compact size, they are generally not suited to measure wind directly. However, since the wave field is intrinsically coupled to the wind field, wave measurements can serve as a proxy observation of ocean surface winds. In this study, we use spectral wave observations to estimate wind speed and direction based on the assumption of a universal f(-4) shape of the wave energy spectrum in the equilibrium range and the presence of a logarithmic wind speed profile above the ocean surface. The wind speed and direction were estimated between 2014 and 2017 at more than a 100 coastal sites with colocated wave and wind observations. Estimates of wind speed and direction based on wave measurements have a root-mean-square error of 2 m/s for wind speeds between 3 and 12 m/s (and a relative error of 17% for wind speeds between 10 and 20 m/s) and up to 20. for wind speeds between 10 and 20 m/s. The accuracy of proxy measurements of wind depends on fetch, wave steepness, wave age, directional alignment between wind and dominant waves, and temporal variability of the wind. Further, we show that estimates of wind speed and direction improve considerably as the size of the buoy is reduced.Plain Language Summary Coastal marine weather conditions are continuously monitored by meteorological buoys and satellites to inform the public, authorities, and emergency services. However, observations of wind and waves from meteorological buoys and satellites are strongly restricted by either their spatial or temporal resolution. Wave buoys, which measure waves only and not wind, can be more compact, which makes them easier to deploy, relatively low cost, and therefore much better suited to deploy in larger numbers. Here, we explore whether we can exploit the coupling of short surface waves to the near-surface wind to quantitatively estimate surface wind properties based on wave measurements. We use an extensive data set of collocated wind and wave measurements to show that measurements of short wind waves can indeed provide a useful estimate of wind speed and direction. We also show that the accuracy of the estimates are considerably improved when the size of the buoy is reduced. The fidelity of surface wind estimates based on wave measurements is comparable to estimates based on remote sensing satellite data. This suggests that networks of wave buoys can successfully provide real-time and long-dwell estimates of surface wind speed and direction and thus successfully augment available meteorological buoy networks and satellite data.

TI  - Determination of a Hazard Compensations Based on Land Administration Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - During the summer period, fire hazards represent an especially real threat not only for vegetation and animals, but also for material resources and human lives. In the Republic of Croatia, the most affected areas are those in the coastal region, which are characterised by a very dry environment and strong winds that are conducive to the rapid spread of wildfire. Although the prevention of wildfire is an utmost imperative, many countries are still missing a good and reliable fire management system for both fire monitoring and prevention and post-disaster management. The aim of this paper is to show the utilisation of open source GIS, web-based technologies, and open data in the case of natural disasters, and to define the concept of advanced national system of compensation determination. Such a system could be utilised to identify land parcels for which compensations for damage and losses after fire devastation have to be determined and could be used by compensation agencies, insurance companies, or state administration. The island of Hvar, which has suffered from fire hazards, was used as a case study for a quick and relevant calculation of the compensation based on land administration data. Sentinel satellite images and official digital orthophoto maps (DOMs) of the affected area before and after the fire devastation were obtained and analysed together with the data on cadastral parcels and land owners. Research was conducted by using both sets of imagery data, showing that Sentinel satellite images are more than adequate for fulfilling the task of the determination of hazard compensation.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data Assimilation in Dynamic Crop Models Using Particle Swarm Optimization
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing world population, increasing prosperity in emerging countries, and shifts in energy and food demands necessitate a continuous increase in global agricultural production. Simultaneously, risks of extreme weather events and a slowing productivity growth in recent years has caused concerns about meeting the demands in the future. Crop monitoring and timely yield predictions are an important tool to mitigate risk and ensure food security. A common approach is to combine the temporal simulation of dynamic crop models with a geospatial component by assimilating remote sensing data. To ensure reliable assimilation, handling of uncertainties in both models and the assimilated input data is crucial. Here, we present a new approach for data assimilation using particle swarm optimization (PSO) in combination with statistical distance metrics that allow for flexible handling of model and input uncertainties. We explored the potential of the newly proposed method in a case study by assimilating canopy cover (CC) information, obtained from Sentinel-2 data, into the AquaCrop-OS model to improve winter wheat yield estimation on the pixel- and field-level and compared the performance with two other methods (simple updating and extended Kalman filter). Our results indicate that the performance of the new method is superior to simple updating and similar or better than the extended Kalman filter updating. Furthermore, it was particularly successful in reducing bias in yield estimation.

TI  - Integrating stream gage data and Landsat imagery to complete time-series of surface water extents in Central Valley, California
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of surface water location and extent is critical for the management of diverse water resource phenomena. The multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery is punctuated by missing data due to cloud cover during acquisition times, hindering the assembly of a continuous time series of inundation dynamics. This study investigated whether streamflow volume measurements could be integrated with satellite data to fill gaps in monthly surface water chronologies for the Central Valley region of California, USA, from 1984 to 2015. We aggregated measurements of maximum monthly water extent within each of the study area's 50 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watersheds from two Landsat-derived datasets: the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Monthly Water History and the U.S. Geological Survey Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). We calculated Spearman rank correlation coefficients between water extent values in each HUC and streamflow discharge data. Linear regression fits of the water extent/streamflow data pairs with the highest correlations served as the basis for interpolation of missing imagery surface water values on a HUC-wise basis. Results show strong (rho > 0.7) maximum correlations in 11 (22.4%) and 25 (51.0%) HUCs for the DSWE and JRC time series, respectively, when comparisons were restricted to imagery and gages co-located in each HUC. Strong maximum correlations occurred in 39 (79.6%; DSWE) and 42 (85.7%; JRC) HUCs when imagery was paired with discharge data from any study area gage, providing a solid basis for reconstruction of water extent values. We generated continuous time series of 30 + years in 35 HUCs, demonstrating that this technique can provide quantitative estimates of historical surface water extents and elucidate flooding or drought events over the period of data collection. Results of a non-parametric trend analysis of the long-term time series on an annual, seasonal, and monthly basis varied among HUCs, though most trends indicate an increase in surface water over the past 30 years.

TI  - GF-5 Hyperspectral Data for Species Mapping of Mangrove in Mai Po, Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral data has been widely used in species discrimination of plants with rich spectral information in hundreds of spectral bands, while the availability of hyperspectral data has hindered its applications in many specific cases. The successful operation of the Chinese satellite, Gaofen-5 (GF-5), provides potentially promising new hyperspectral dataset with 330 spectral bands in visible and near infrared range. Therefore, there is much demand for assessing the effectiveness and superiority of GF-5 hyperspectral data in plants species mapping, particularly mangrove species mapping, to better support the efficient mangrove management. In this study, mangrove forest in Mai Po Nature Reserve (MPNR), Hong Kong was selected as the study area. Four dominant native mangrove species were investigated in this study according to the field surveys. Two machine learning methods, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, were employed to classify mangrove species with Landsat 8, Simulated Hyperion and GF-5 data sets. The results showed that 97 more bands of GF-5 over Hyperion brought a higher over accuracy of 87.12%, in comparison with 86.82% from Hyperion and 73.89% from Landsat 8. The higher spectral resolution of 5 nm in GF-5 was identified as making the major contribution, especially for the mapping of Aegiceras corniculatum. Therefore, GF-5 is likely to improve the classification accuracy of mangrove species mapping via enhancing spectral resolution and thus has promising potential to improve mangrove monitoring at species level to support mangrove management.

TI  - An advanced geometric model to simulate thermal anisotropy time-series for simplified urban neighborhoods (GUTA-T)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The anisotropy of directional radiative surface temperature measurements over urban building surfaces is expected to have strong temporal variation. However, a model with the capability to simulate the temporal variation of urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) and with inversion abilities has not yet been developed. In this paper, the relationship between the temporal variation of UTA and temperature contrasts among surface components is investigated. Based on a system of previously developed geometric models for simulation of thermal anisotropy in simplified urban neighborhoods of different densities, a system of advanced geometric models, GUTA-T, is proposed that incorporates the temporal variability of UTA through the dependence of temperature contrasts on solar zenith angle theta(s) under clear skies. A 3-D microscale urban surface temperature model and a sensor view model are combined to generate a synthetic UTA dataset for a variety of simplified urban geometries and with which to evaluate GUTA-T. The results show that parameter inversions are sensitive to sun-surface-sensor geometries. The seasonal and hourly behavior of anisotropy is simulated by GUTA-T with mean absolute differences of 1.06 degrees C, 1.25 degrees C, 1.69 degrees C and 1.04 degrees C for the view zenith and azimuth angles (theta(v), phi(v)) of (40 degrees, 90 degrees), (60 degrees, 270 degrees), (60 degrees, 180 degrees) and (40 degrees, 130 degrees), respectively. Evaluation using diurnal measurements over an urban scale model shows that the root mean square difference between simulated anisotropy and the reference anisotropy generated from observed directional temperatures and a high-accuracy computer model is 2.02 degrees C for theta(s) <= 60 degrees. If the proposed model is to be calibrated with satellite data, a second directional observation from the opposite side of the surface target area can improve model performance significantly. Calibrations using samples including only small (e.g., theta(s) >= 30 degrees) or large s (e.g., theta(s) >= 50 degrees) tend to decrease the anisotropy time-series simulation accuracy. Due to its inversion abilities, the GUTA-T model has the potential to simulate and correct anisotropy in time-series thermal infrared remote sensing data, thereby improving the analysis either of spatial variation within an image, or of temporal variation of angular urban surface temperature.

TI  - The Impact Analysis of Land Features to JL1-3B Nighttime Light Data at Parcel Level: Illustrated by the Case of Changchun, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime lights (NTL) create a unique footprint left by human activities, which can reflect the economic index and demographic characteristics of a country or region to some extent. It is of great significance to explore the impact of land features related to social-economic indexes to NTL intensity in urban areas. At present, there are few studies on the impact factors of high-resolution NTL remote sensing data to analyze the influence of NTL intensity variation at a fine scale. In this paper, taking Changchun, China as a case study, we selected the new generation of high spatial resolution (0.92 m) and multispectral bands NTL image JL1-3B data to evaluate the relationship between NTL intensity and related land features such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use types and point of information (POI) at the parcel level, and combined Luojia 1-01 images for comparative analysis. After screening features by the Gini index, 17 variables were selected to establish the best random forest (RF) regression model for the Luojia 1-01 and JL1-3B data, corresponding to out-of-bag (oob) scores of 0.8304 and 0.9054, respectively. The impact of features on NTL was determined by calculating the features contribution. It was found that JL1-3B data perform better on a finer scale and provide more information. In addition, JL1-3B data are less affected by light overflow effect and saturation, and they could provide more accurate information at smaller parcels. Through the impact analysis of land features on the two kinds of NTL data, it is proven that JL1-3B images can be used to study effectively the relationship between NTL and human activities information. This paper aims to establish a regression model between the radiance of two types of NTL data and land features by RF algorithm, to further excavate the main land features that impact radiance according to the feature contribution, and compare the performance of two types of NTL data in regression. The study is expected to provide a reference to the further application of NTL data such as land feature inversion, artificial surface monitoring and evaluation, geographic information point estimation, information mining, etc., and a more comprehensive cognition of land feature impact to urban social-economic indexes from a unique perspective, which can be used to assist urban planning and related decision-making.

Given a static spatial network, a set of query points $Q$ , and a set of data locations $O$ (candidates for cluster centers), the MSA function retrieves the data location with the minimum aggregation distance (the sum of the distances to all query points). We believe that such function plays an important role in remote sensing data cluster and classification. The MSA problem faces two challenges: 1) how to prune the search space effectively and retrieve the results of MSA in real time and 2) how to schedule multiple query sources during search processing. To overcome these challenges, we make the following contributions. First, upper and lower bounds on aggregation distance are defined to prune the search space effectively. Second, each query source is given a priority label, and a best-first scheduling strategy is developed to further enhance the query performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets to verify the high performance of the developed algorithms.

TI  - LeafSpec: An accurate and portable hyperspectral corn leaf imager
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has been widely applied in industry and academia for plant phenotyping. However, most HSI systems are large and expensive, making it challenging to benefit more people. The overall goal of this study was to develop a portable and low-cost hyperspectral imaging handheld device (named LeafSpec) with even improved measurement quality compared with traditional HSI systems for crop leaves imaging. The hardware of LeafSpec device was comprised of a push-broom hyperspectral camera (HSC), leaf scanner with an encoder system for leaf position information, a lightbox as an intensive and uniform beam lighting source, and an ARM-based microcontroller. In each scanning, a smooth and clear hyperspectral image of the entire leaf was obtained by quickly sliding LeafSpec across the leaf from the beginning to tip. Each measurement was geo-referenced by sending processed data to a smartphone and combining it with the GPS location and time information before uploading to a Geography Information System (GIS) with Digital Ag Map Services and internet connection. After calibration, the HSC's imaging results were highly consistent with a commercialized hyperspectral camera. In the field test in the summer of 2018, LeafSpec was able to detect the difference between two nitrogen treatments of corn plants in each genotype, as well as the differences between three genotypes in high nitrogen treatment, and the difference between two genotypes in low nitrogen treatment before it was visible to human eyes. In the greenhouse test in the spring of 2019, LeafSpec predicted nitrogen content and relative water content with R-2 of 0.880 and 0.771, RMSE of 0.265 and 0.049, respectively. Generally, LeafSpec is an easy-to-use and low-cost crop phenotyping sensor with improved measurement accuracy, which could benefit more people in plant science research and agriculture production.

TI  - The Impact of Low Latency Satellite Sounder Observations on Local Severe Storm Forecasts in Regional NWP
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forecasts of local severe storms (LSS) are highly dependent on how well the pre-convection environment is characterized in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model analysis. The usefulness of the forecasts is highly dependent on how frequently the forecast is updated. Therefore, the data latency is critical for assimilation into regional NWP models for it to be able to assimilate more data within the data cut-off window. These low latency data can be obtained through direct broadcast sites and direct receiving systems. Observing system experiments (OSE) were performed to study the impact of data latency on the LSS forecasts. The experiments assimilated all existing observations including conventional data (from the global telecommunication system, GTS) and satellite sounder radiance data (AMSU-A (The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A), ATMS (Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder), CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder), and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer)). They were carried out in a nested domain with a horizontal resolution of 9 km and 3 km in the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The forecast quality scores of the LSS precipitation forecasts were calculated and compared with different data cut-off widows to evaluate the impact of data latency. The results showed that low latency can lead to an improved and positive impact on precipitation and other forecasts, which indicates the potential application of LEO direct broadcast (DB) data in a high-resolution regional NWP for LSS forecasts.

TI  - Subpixel Land-Cover Mapping Based on Extended Random Walker
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a novel subpixel mapping (SPM) based on extended random walker (ERW) (SPMERW) is proposed. First, the resolution of the original coarse remote sensing image is upsampled by bicubic interpolation. Second, the class proportions of subpixel are produced by unmixing the upsampled image. Irregular objects are generated by adaptive segmentation of the first principal component of the upsampled image. Third, the class proportions of the object are derived by averaged fusion of the class proportions of subpixel belonging to each object in the segmentation image. Object spatial dependence including the spatial information among and within the objects is obtained by the ERW algorithm. Finally, a class allocation method based on units of the object is utilized to obtain the SPM result according to the object spatial dependence. Experimental results on two remote sensing data sets show that the proposed SPMERW outperforms the state-of-the-art SPM methods.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land Use/Cover Patterns and Their Relationship with Land Surface Temperature in Nanjing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is one of the most concerning issues in the 21st century because of its significant impacts on various fields, including agriculture, forestry, ecology, and climate. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens' daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high- and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing. Our findings are valuable for the local government to reorganize the future development zones in a way to control the urban climate environment and to keep a healthy social life within the city.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing Data Are Effective and Robust in Mapping Regional Forest Soil Organic Carbon Stocks in a Northeast Forest Region in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping the spatial distribution information of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is a key premise for soil resource management and environment protection. Rapid development of satellite remote sensing provides a great opportunity for monitoring SOC stocks at a large scale. In this study, based on 12 environmental variables of multispectral remote sensing, topography and climate and 236 soil sampling data, three different boosted regression tree (BRT) models were compared to obtain the most accurate map of SOC stocks covering the forest area of Lvshun District in the Northeast China. Four validation indexes, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) were calculated to evaluate the performance of the three models. The results showed that the full variable model performed the best, except the model using multispectral remote sensing variables. In the full variable model, the regional SOC stocks are primarily determined by multispectral remote sensing variables, followed by topographic and climatic variables, with the relative importance of variables in the model being 63%, 28%, and 9%, respectively. The average prediction results of full variables model and only multispectral remote sensing variables model were 8.99 and 9.32 kg m(-2), respectively. Our results indicated that there is a strong dependence of SOC stocks on multispectral remote sensing data when forest ecosystems have dense natural vegetation. Our study suggests that the multispectral remote sensing variables should be used to map SOC stocks of forest ecosystems in our study region.

TI  - Retrieval and validation of aerosol optical depth using GF-1 WFV cameras data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) retrieval is restricted to the global and regional scale due to the limited spatial resolution of satellites. This does not allow for aerosol monitoring at the city level. The Chinese GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV) sensors have sufficiently fine resolution as a data source for AOD retrieval with fine spatial resolution and a 4-day revisit time. In this study, principles similar to those in the Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT) algorithms were used to retrieve AOD at 100 m spatial resolution from GF-1 WFV images supported by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectraradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance (SR) products (MOD09A1). The derived GF-1 WFV AOD were compared with a combination of MOD04_3K DT AOD and MOD04_L2 DB AOD (MODIS AOD) to find that they yield reasonable Spearman correlations (R-s > 0.82) over Taiwan and Beijing. The derived GF-1 WFV AOD were also validated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD; the Spearman correlation values were R-s = 0.911 in Beijing and R-s = 0.858 in Taiwan. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI  - Estimating hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations using MODIS 3 km AOD and an improved spatiotemporal model over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5 during heavy pollution is a short-term dynamic change process, and quantifying the dynamic change process of PM2.5 is the premise and guarantee for short-term PM2.5 exposure research. However, given the low temporal resolution of polar-orbiting satellites and late launch time of geostationary satellites, the application of remote sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in hourly PM2.5 spatial distribution prediction is greatly limited, which brings uncertainty to short-term PM2.5 exposure research. This study introduces the PM2.5 concentration predicted by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradlometer (MODIS) 3 krn AOD data and the PM2.5 concentration of monitoring stations into a spatiotemporal autoregressive (STAR) model to generate hourly PM2.5 spatial distribution and quantify the short-term dynamic change process of PM2.5. The monitoring data in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JingJinJi) region of 2014 were used to test the model performance. Time-based 10-fold cross-validation (CV) R-2 was 0.82, and the root-mean-square prediction error (RMSE) was 37.37 mu g/m(3). The CV R-2 and RMSE were higher by 0.04 and lower by 3.4 mu g/m(3) than the STAR model without monitoring station PM2.5 concentration as predictors, which indicated that the monitoring station PM2.5 concentration could improve the performance of the model. Hourly performance statistics results showed that the model's accuracy increased when the time was closer to the MODIS transit time compared with that at other hours. The farther away from the MODIS transit time, the greater the monitoring stations' PM2.5 concentration improved the performance of the model. The predicted results of the spatial distribution of PM2.5 showed that the spatial distribution of the average PM2.5 concentration in each hour varied greatly in JingJinJi, and the maximum difference reached 30 mu g/m(3). The model in this paper not only demonstrates high prediction accuracy but also provides high spatiotemporal resolution of PM2.5 for short-term PM2.5 exposure studies.

TI  - An Automated Method for Surface Ice/Snow Mapping Based on Objects and Pixels from Landsat Imagery in a Mountainous Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface ice/snow is a vital resource and is sensitive to climate change in many parts of the world. The accurate and timely measurement of the spatial distribution of ice/snow is critical for managing water resources. Object-oriented and pixel-oriented methods often have some limitations due to the image segmentation scale, the determination of the optimal threshold and background heterogeneity. Therefore, this study proposes a method for automatically extracting large-scale surface ice/snow from Landsat series images, which takes advantage of the combination of image segmentation, the watershed algorithm and a series of ice/snow indices. We tested our novel method in three different regions in the Karakoram Mountains, and the experimental results show that the produced ice/snow map obtained a user's accuracy greater than 90%, a producer's accuracy greater than 97%, an overall accuracy greater than 98% and a kappa coefficient greater than 0.93. Comparing the extraction results under segmentation scales of 10, 15, 20 and 25, the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy from the proposed method are very similar, which indicates that the proposed method is more reliable and stable for extracting ice/snow objects than the object-oriented method. Due to the different reflectivity values in the near-infrared band in the snow and water categories, the normalized difference forest snow index (NDFSI) is suitable for Landsat TM and ETM+ images. This study can serve as a reliable, scientific reference for rapidly and accurately extracting ice/snow objects.

TI  - Mapping Maize Cultivated Area Combining MODIS EVI Time Series and the Spatial Variations of Phenology over Huanghuaihai Plain
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology is a significant factor that affects the precision of crop area extraction by using the multi-temporal vegetation indices (VIs) approach. Considering the phenological differences of maize among the different regions, the summer maize cultivated area was estimated by using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Huanghuaihai Plain in China. By analyzing the temporal shift in summer maize calendars, linear regression equations for simulating the summer maize phenology were obtained. The simulated maize phenology was used to correct the MODIS EVI time series curve of summer maize. Combining the mean absolute distance (MAD) and p-tile algorithm, the cultivated areas of summer maize were distinguished over the Hunaghuaihai Plain. The accuracy of the extraction results in each province was above 85%. Comparing the maize area of two groups from MODIS-estimated and statistical data, the validation results showed that the R-2 reached 0.81 at the city level and 0.69 at the county level. It demonstrated that the approach in this study has the ability to effectively map the summer maize area over a large scale and provides a novel idea for estimating the planting area of other crops.

M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Full convolution neural network U-net can effectively improve the effect of remote sensing target recognition and object classification. [Method] The test site is located in Wangyedian Forest Farm, Chifeng district, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The GF-2 multispectral data, ZY-3 DOM data, ZY-3 DEM data, sub-compartment data and field survey data were employed as the key data sources. Based on the U-net network model and the optimization ideas of the previous FCN-8s model, the standard Normalize Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) was added to the original band in the training process, and the CRF post-processing process was added to construct the network and the final classification results were obtained. [Result] (1) The overall classification accuracy of the optimized U-net model was 84.89%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.82, which was higher than that of the U-net model without NDVI feature and U-net model without CRF post-processing; (2) Compared with the classification results of FCN-8s, SVM and RF using the same strategy, the classification accuracy of the optimized U-net model was greatly improved. [Conclusion] The classification effect of U-net model can be improved by adjusting the relevant remote sensing features and using CRF post-processing method. This method is suitable for the classification of high resolution multispectral remote sensing images of forest types.

TI  - Simulating the Impact of Urban Surface Evapotranspiration on the Urban Heat Island Effect Using the Modified RS-PM Model: A Case Study of Xuzhou, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important energy absorption process in the Earth's surface energy balance, evapotranspiration (ET) from vegetation and bare soil plays an important role in regulating the environmental temperatures. However, little research has been done to explore the cooling effect of ET on the urban heat island (UHI) due to the lack of appropriate remote-sensing-based estimation models for complex urban surface. Here, we apply the modified remote sensing Penman-Monteith (RS-PM) model (also known as the urban RS-PM model), which has provided a new regional ET estimation method with the better accuracy for the urban complex underlying surface. Focusing on the city of Xuzhou in China, ET and land surface temperature (LST) were inversed by using 10 Landsat 8 images during 2014-2018. The impact of ET on LST was then analyzed and quantified through statistical and spatial analyses. The results indicate that: (1) The alleviating effect of ET on the UHI was stronger during the warmest months of the year (May-October) but not during the colder months (November-March); (2) ET had the most significant alleviating effect on the UHI effect in those regions with the highest ET intensities; and (3) in regions with high ET intensities and their surrounding areas (within a radius of 150 m), variation in ET was a key factor for UHI regulation; a 10 Wm(-2) increase in ET equated to 0.56 K decrease in LST. These findings provide a new perspective for the improvement of urban thermal comfort, which can be applied to urban management, planning, and natural design.

TI  - Capturing the Worldview of Global Citizens: Development and Validation of an Improved Measure of Global Citizenry
T2  - PEACE AND CONFLICT-JOURNAL OF PEACE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Across two studies, we developed and validated an individual differences measure of global citizenry (the Global Citizenry Scale) in order to capture how people respond to intergroup conflict and assess the degree to which they perceive themselves as a citizen of the world at large. Global citizenry emerged as a two-factor construct that was related to social orientation, self-relevant goals, political attitudes, and actual experience with diversity. Moreover, it was distinct from previous attempts to capture cosmopolitanism; cognitive orientation, more generally; and self-presentational concerns. As a tentative first step toward scale development of global citizenship, the present findings suggest that although being a world citizen may not necessarily involve traveling the world, it does promote lower social dominance, greater existential quest, more liberal political attitudes, and greater experience in multicultural contexts.

TI  - Long-term InSAR, borehole inclinometer, and rainfall records provide insight into the mechanism and activity patterns of an extremely slow urbanized landslide
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - New radar satellites provide global coverage and the possibility of long-term, regular frequency (days-weeks) surface displacement measurements through the application of high precision multi-temporal InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry) techniques. This represents an excellent opportunity to investigate and improve our understanding of the behavior of extremely slow landslides, as well as of the long- to short-term controls of their activity. In urban settings, such landslides deserve special attention, as their cumulative movements can cause significant socio-economic damage. Here, we re-examine the case of a long-lived, deep-seated landslide in the Apennine Mountains (Italy) which was urbanized between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The case provides a rare opportunity to highlight the benefits of the integrated analysis of long-term (several years) borehole inclinometer measurements with 15 years of multi-temporal InSAR displacement data. We present evidence of the landslide composite nature and asymmetry, and draw attention to the recent period of accelerated movement that coincided with the foot failure event. This helps constraining the interpretation of the borehole and InSAR data and demonstrating the predominantly rotational landslide mechanism. We show how a detailed analysis of sparse inclinometer and more spatially continuous InSAR measurements, when combined with local rainfall records, can reveal long- to short-term patterns of temporal variability in landslide motions and allow anticipating the consequences of future landslide activity.

TI  - Calculating macroalgal height and biomass using bathymetric LiDAR and a comparison with surface area derived from satellite data in Nova Scotia, Canada
T2  - BOTANICA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to map and monitor the macroalgal coastal resource is important to both the industry and the regulator. This study evaluates topo-bathymetric lidar (light detection and ranging) as a tool for estimating the surface area, height and biomass of Ascophyllum nodosum, an anchored and vertically suspended (floating) macroalga, and compares the surface area derived from lidar and WorldView-2 satellite imagery. Pixel-based Maximum Likelihood classification of low tide satellite data produced 2-dimensional maps of intertidal macroalgae with overall accuracy greater than 80%. Low tide and high tide topo-bathymetric lidar surveys were completed in southwestern Nova Scotia, Canada. Comparison of lidar-derived seabed elevations with ground-truth data collected using a survey grade global navigation satellite system (GNSS) indicated the low tide survey data have a positive bias of 15 cm, likely resulting from the seaweed being draped over the surface. The high tide survey data did not exhibit this bias, although the suspended canopy floating on the water surface reduced the seabed lidar point density. Validation of lidar-derived seaweed heights indicated a mean difference of 30 cm with a root mean square error of 62 cm. The modelled surface area of seaweed was 28% greater in the lidar model than the satellite model. The average lidar-derived biomass estimate was within one standard deviation of the mean biomass measured in the field. The lidar method tends to overestimate the biomass compared to field measurements that were spatially biased to the mid-intertidal level. This study demonstrates an innovative and cost-effective approach that uses a single high tide bathymetric lidar survey to map the height and biomass of dense macroalgae.

TI  - On accuracy of SAR wind speed retrieval in coastal area
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal region, the overestimation of wind speed are observed in SAR wind speed retrievals and the contamination from land and ships are considered as one of the main reasons. A novel method for calculating the value of normalized radar cross section (NRCS) cell has been developed to improve high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind retrieval in the case of contamination. The ratio of median and mean (R-mmpp) has been proposed to assess the effect of the distribution of NRCS on wind retrievals quantitatively. In this research, Sentinel-1 interferometric wide-swath (IW) dual polarization SAR data were collocated with in situ wind measurements from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for comparison. CMOD5, CMOD7 and the C-band Cross-Polarization Ocean (C-2PO) were used for wind retrievals. The statistic validation results show that the proposed method is more robust than the conventional method for wind speed retrievals. In addition, the R-mmpp could be used as an indicator for the reliability of SAR wind and the accuracy of wind speed increase with the R-mmpp increasing from 0.2 to 1.0 in the coastal area.

TI  - Dynamics of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in An Arid Piedmont Plain in the Middle Reaches of the Kaxgar River Basin, Xinjiang, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kaxgar River Basin, a key section of the Tarim River Basin, is a typical ecologically fragile region that has undergone rapid changes to its spatial patterns over the preceding few decades. In particular, the expansion of salinized land has posed a severe threat to ecological restoration and economic development. This study monitored the rates and patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the plain area of Aketao County in the middle reaches of the Kaxgar River Basin. Five Landsat images (captured in 1990, 1998, 2002, 2013, and 2018) were divided into seven LULC types: built-up land, cultivated land, woodland and grassland, light-moderate salinized land, heavy salinized land, water areas, and bare land. Subsequently, their dynamic processes were analyzed. The results revealed that in 1990, the dominant LULCs were cultivated land, woodland and grassland, and bare land. Throughout the study period (from 1990 to 2018), the coverage of built-up land, cultivated land, bare land, water areas, and light-moderate salinized land increased; by contrast, that of the other LULC types decreased. The most marked LULC changes were the expansion of light-moderate salinized land (by 6.2% of the study area) and the shrinkage of woodland and grassland (by 9.4% of the study area). Almost all the analyzed LULC types underwent conversion to other types; such conversion occurred most frequently between 1998 and 2018. The conversions of woodland and grassland into cultivated land and light-moderate salinized land were the most notable phenomena. Another highly evident change was the conversion of heavy salinized land into bare land. These results revealed that the expansion of salinized land and the shrinkage of woodland and grassland in the study area were the most severe environmental changes. Therefore, ecological protection and salinization control are urgently required to enable local economic development while not exceeding the environmental carrying capacity and ensuring the safety of the "green corridor" in the lower reaches of the Kaxgar River Basin.

TI  - A Value-Consistent Method for Downscaling SMAP Passive Soil Moisture With MODIS Products Using Self-Adaptive Window
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products have been developed with global coverage. However, most of them are derived from passive microwave observations with very coarse resolution, greatly constraining the applications at regional scales. To increase the spatial resolution, a downscaling method is developed to downscale the 36-km Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 SM (SMAP SM) product to 1 km using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (8-d land surface temperature, LST, and 16-d normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). In this method, a linking model is first established between SM and LST and NDVI, and a self-adaptive window method is applied with the use of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to obtain an optimal local regression. Then, the uncertainty of the linking model, expressed as the regression residual, is redistributed to fine-resolution pixels to analyze the consistency before and after downscaling. The method was applied to the Iberian Peninsula to produce the 8-d downscaled SM product in 2016. The downscaled SM was validated with the in-situ SM network (REMEDHUS). A good agreement was found between the two data sets, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.87 and an unbiased root-mean-squared error (ubRMSE) of 0.043 m(3)/m(3) at a network level. At station level, the R is larger than 0.6 for all the REMEDHUS stations, with an ubRMSE smaller than 0.06 m(3)/m(3). The evaluation indicates the good potential of the proposed method in the SM downscaling, which achieves a robust consistency and provides rich spatial information while maintaining good accuracy.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Mid-Channel Bar Dynamics in Downstream of the Three Gorges Dam, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The downstream reach of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) along the Yangtze River (1560 km) hosts numerous mid-channel bars (MCBs). MCBs dynamics are crucial to the river's hydrological processes and local ecological function. However, a systematic understanding of such dynamics and their linkage to TGD remains largely unknown. Using Landsat-image-extracted MCBs and several spatial-temporal analysis methods, this study presents a comprehensive understanding of MCB dynamics in terms of number, area, and shape, over downstream of TGD during the period 1985-2018. On average, a total of 140 MCBs were detected and grouped into four types representing small (<2 km(2)), middle (2 km(2) - 7 km(2)), large (7 km(2) - 33 km(2)) and extra-large size (>33 km(2)) MCBs, respectively. MCBs number decreased after TGD closure but most of these happened in the lower reach. The area of total MCBs experienced an increasing trend (2.77 km(2)/yr, p-value < 0.01) over the last three decades. The extra-large MCBs gained the largest area increasing rate than the other sizes of MCBs. Small MCBs tended to become relatively round, whereas the others became elongate in shape after TGD operation. Impacts of TGD operation generally diminished in the longitudinal direction from TGD to Hankou and from TGD to Jiujiang for shape and area dynamics, respectively. The quantified longitudinal and temporal dynamics of MCBs across the entire Yangtze River downstream of TGD provides a crucial monitoring basis for continuous investigation of the changing mechanisms affecting the morphology of the Yangtze River system.

TI  - Calibration Method of Smear in the Sun Glint Region of Directional Polarization Camera Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to effectively correct smears in the sun glint produced by spaceborne polarization camera imaging, this paper takes the GF-5 satellite directional polarization camera as an example and combines with imaging characteristics of directional polarization camera on orbit to theoretically analyze the generating mechanism of smears in the process of image acquisition. It sets up a matrix method calibration model and a dark line method calibration model both of which can effectively correct the light leakage smear under the circumstances of without any saturated pixel in the flare region. And it sets up a legacy smear calibration model based on a combination of the matrix method and dark line method under the circumstances of full pixel saturation in the flare region to estimate saturated pixel intensity in the flare region. This algorithm fully considers the leakage smear and legacy smear produced in the sun glint under the circumstances of intense light saturation. The feasibility of this smear correction method is verified by using spots of integrating sphere light source imaging in the laboratory to simulate solar flares in remote sensing images of directional polarization camera when it works on orbit. The experimental results show that this method can not only effectively remove smear noise in images and improve image quality but also effectively estimate spot saturation pixel intensity. In the end, this paper analyzes the influence of the flare region smear in directional polarization camera on-orbit images on radiance measurement accuracy of directional polarization camera. Analysis results show that gray variance can be decreased from 202.69 x 10(6) to 2.32 x 10(6), and average gradient can be decreased from 5.08 x 10(-1) to 2.26 X 10(-1) after the smear correction.

TI  - Tropical forests did not recover from the strong 2015-2016 El Nino event
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe drought and extreme heat associated with the 2015-2016 El Nino event have led to large carbon emissions from the tropical vegetation to the atmosphere. With the return to normal climatic conditions in 2017, tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks are expected to partly recover due to increased productivity, but the intensity and spatial distribution of this recovery are unknown. We used low-frequency microwave satellite data (L-VOD) to feature precise monitoring of AGC changes and show that the AGC recovery of tropical ecosystems was slow and that by the end of 2017, AGC had not reached predrought levels of 2014. From 2014 to 2017, tropical AGC stocks decreased by 1.3(1.2)(1.5)Pg C due to persistent AGC losses in Africa (-0.9(-1.1)(-0.8)Pg C) and America (-0.5(-0.6)(-0.4)Pg C). Pantropically, drylands recovered their carbon stocks to pre-El Nino levels, but African and American humid forests did not, suggesting carryover effects from enhanced forest mortality.

TI  - Orbital Path and Spacecraft Attitude Correction for the MODIS Lunar Spatial Characterization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua platforms, regularly scheduled lunar observations using spacecraft roll maneuvers have been used extensively for sensor characterization. While the primary purpose of these observations is for radiometric calibration of the reflective solar bands, they have also been leveraged for a number of other sensor performance assessments, such as the band-to-band spatial registration (BBR) and detector-to-detector spatial registration (DDR). The spatial registration calculations are complicated by the fact that the Moon does not move in a straight path across the sensor field of view (FOV). This path is determined by the relative orbital motion between the spacecraft and the Moon and the instrument attitude error that results from the roll maneuver. In this article, we develop a correction for the MODIS lunar spatial characterization measurements by calculating the predicted path of the Moon across the sensor FOV using spacecraft and lunar ephemeris data to model the relative orbital motion between the spacecraft and the Moon along with spacecraft attitude error data acquired during the roll maneuver. The difference between the measured and predicted positions of the Moon in the MODIS FOV can be used to calculate the BBR and DDR results. Since the predicted path across the FOV will be the same for each band, the BBR results will be minimally affected. However, we will show that the along-scan spread in the DDR can be significantly reduced, which results in a much greater consistency throughout the full mission for both Aqua and Terra MODIS.

TI  - Assessment of readiness to transition from antenatal HIV surveillance surveys to PMTCT programme data-based HIV surveillance in South Africa: The 2017 Antenatal Sentinel HIV Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: South Africa has used antenatal HIV surveys for HIV surveillance in pregnant women since 1990. We assessed South Africa's readiness to transition to programme data based antenatal HIV surveillance with respect to PMTCT uptake, accuracy of point-of-care rapid testing (RT) and selection bias with using programme data in the context of the 2017 antenatal HIV survey.Methods: Between 1 October and 15 November 2017, the national survey was conducted in 1,595 public antenatal facilities selected using stratified multistage cluster sampling method. Results of point-of-care RT were obtained from medical records. Blood samples were taken from eligible pregnant women and tested for HIV using immunoassays (IA) in the laboratory. Descriptive statistics were used to report on: PMTCT uptake; agreement between HIV point-of-care RT and laboratory-based HIV-1 IA; and selection bias associated with using programme data for surveillance.Results: PMTCT HIV testing uptake was high (99.8%). The positive percent agreement (PPA) between RT and IA was lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmark (97.6%) at 96.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 95.9%-96.6%). The negative percent agreement was above the WHO benchmark (99.5%), at 99.7% (95% CI: 99.6%-99.7%) nationally. PPA markedly varied by province (92.9%-98.3%). Selection bias due to exclusion of participants with no RT results was within the recommended threshold at 0.3%.Conclusion: For the three components assessed, South Africa was close to meeting the WHO standard for transitioning to routine RT data for antenatal HIV surveillance. The wide variations in PPA across provinces should be addressed. (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - How Machine Learning and High-Resolution Imagery Can Improve Melt Pond Retrieval From MODIS Over Current Spectral Unmixing Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meltwater that pools on the surface of Arctic sea ice enhances solar absorption and accelerates further ice melt. The impact of melt ponds on energy absorption is controlled primarily through their influence on ice albedo, which is, in turn, governed in large part by the ponds' spatial coverage. This work seeks to observe the spatial coverage of melt ponds across the Arctic basin with sufficient accuracy to investigate pond-albedo feedback and presents an improved technique to achieve this goal. We approach the problem by using the Open Source Sea Ice Processing algorithm to classify surface features in submeter resolution optical satellite imagery over select sites where such imagery is available. These data establish "true" estimates of pond coverage and the ponds' spectral reflectance. This information is then used to inform, improve, and test spectral unmixing and machine learning techniques that seek to determine melt pond coverage from more widely available, but lower resolution, optical satellite imagery (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The new machine learning approach improves accuracy from prior work and can contribute to improved efforts to validate melt pond models or understand trends in pond coverage. Nevertheless, we encounter and carefully document significant challenges to retrieving melt pond fractions from low-resolution optical imagery. These limit accuracy to levels below that necessary for resolving climatologically important trends. We conclude that greatly expanding the collection of highresolution satellite imagery over sea ice is necessary to monitor melt pond coverage with the accuracy needed by the scientific community.Plain Language Summary As temperatures in the Arctic rise during summer months, meltwater pools on the surface of sea ice. These ponds are darker than snow/ice and cause more sunlight to be absorbed. This creates a feedback cycle that accelerates ice melt. A primary factor in this cycle is the percentage of the ice surface that is covered by ponds. It is therefore important to observe the spatial coverage of ponds across the Arctic to better understand their impact sea ice loss. Due to the remoteness of the Arctic Ocean, it is necessary to utilize satellite imagery to investigate the properties of sea ice. In satellite imagery there is a trade-off between resolution and spatial coverage: Images can be either "sharp," seeing many details of the surface but covering a small region, or "blurry" covering a large region but where each pixel contains many ponds. This work seeks to improve techniques (called spectral unmixing) for determining the fraction of each low-resolution pixel that is a pond. We investigate the theoretical limits of spectral unmixing and conclude that it has several limitations that negatively impact its usefulness. Finally, we trial a new machine learning approach to the same problem that shows promising results.

TI  - Light absorption, fluorescence properties and sources of brown carbon aerosols in the Southeast Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brown carbon (BrC) has been proposed as an important driving factor in climate change due to its light absorption properties. However, our understanding of BrC's chemical and optical properties are inadequate, particularly at remote regions. This study conducts a comprehensive investigation of BrC aerosols in summer (Aug. 2013) and winter (Jan. 2014) at Southeast Tibetan Plateau, which is ecologically fragile and sensitive to global warming. The concentrations of methanol-soluble BrC (MeS-BrC) are approximately twice of water-soluble BrC (WS-BrC), demonstrating the environmental importance of water-insoluble BrC are previously underestimated with only WS-BrC considered. The mass absorption efficiency of WS-BrC (0.27-0.86 m(2) g(-1)) is lower than those in heavily polluted South Asia, indicating a distinct contrast between the two sides of Himalayas. Fluorescence reveals that the absorption of BrC is mainly attributed to humic-like and protein-like substances, which broaden the current knowledge of BrC's chromophores. Combining organic tracer, satellite MODIS data and air-mass backward trajectory analysis, this study finds BrC is mainly derived from bioaerosols and secondary formation in summer, while long-range transport of biomass burning emissions in winter. Our study provides new insights into the optical and chemical properties of BrC, which may have implications for environmental effect and sources of organic aerosols. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessing Terrestrial Ecosystem Resilience using Satellite Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative approaches to measuring and assessing terrestrial ecosystem resilience, which expresses the ability of an ecosystem to recover from disturbances without shifting to an alternative state or losing function and services, is critical and essential to forecasting how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to global change. However, global and continuous terrestrial resilience measurement is fraught with difficulty, and the corresponding attribution of resilience dynamics is lacking in the literature. In this study, we assessed global terrestrial ecosystem resilience based on the long time-series GLASS LAI product and GIMMS AVHRR LAI 3g product, and validated the results using drought and fire events as the main disturbance indicators. We also analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of global terrestrial ecosystem resilience and attributed their dynamics to climate change and environmental factors. The results showed that arid and semiarid areas exhibited low resilience. We found that evergreen broadleaf forest exhibited the highest resilience (mean resilience value (from GLASS LAI): 0.6). On a global scale, the increase of mean annual precipitation had a positive impact on terrestrial resilience enhancement, while we found no consistent relationships between mean annual temperature and terrestrial resilience. For terrestrial resilience dynamics, we observed three dramatic raises of disturbance frequency in 1989, 1995, and 2001, respectively, along with three significant drops in resilience correspondingly. Our study mapped continuous spatiotemporal variation and captured interannual variations in terrestrial ecosystem resilience. This study demonstrates that remote sensing data are effective for monitoring terrestrial resilience for global ecosystem assessment.

TI  - Tracking the phenology and expansion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> coastal wetland by time series MODIS and Landsat images
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on phenology of Spartina alterniflora is basic for observing its growing condition in native and invasive places. Remote sensing (RS) can be used to analyse and monitor vegetation at a large spatial and long time scale. In this study, RS is used to explore phenology of coastal wetland vegetation (Reed, Suaeda salsa and Spartina alterniflora) based on time series data of four spectral indices (SI): Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Moisture Index (mNDWI). These SIs were calculated based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Land Satellite (Landsat) images, respectively. Phenology (including growing season and non-growing season) of Spartina alterniflora based on SIs to track its dynamic expansion since it invaded in southern Yellow Sea (Jiangsu, Yancheng), China through observing Landsat sub-pixels in per MODIS pixel. We also developed a new phenology-based algorithm to identify Spartina alterniflora from 1984 to 2015. The results show that Spartina alterniflora has a longer growth circle (around 286 days in a year) and higher productivity (about 0.6-0.8 NDVI) than the other salt marsh vegetation. The way of observing vegetation phenology on RS, and then developing a new phenology-based algorithm to track coastal wetland including invasive species-like Spartina alterniflora can support the studies of biological expansion, coastal wetland biodiversity conservation, and even global carbon cycling and climate change further.

TI  - Characterizing the spatial heterogeneity and controlling factors of land surface temperature clusters: A case study in Beijing
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variation in land surface temperature (LST) is a measure of the exchange and interaction of energy flux between the land surface and near-surface atmosphere. Understanding the connections between LST and complex landscape patterns is vital for selecting proper mitigation strategies to improve the urban thermal environment. However, the high spatial heterogeneity of the urban landscape makes it tricky to accurately characterizing the quantitative contributions from man-made or natural objects. In this study, we first estimated LST with Landsat-8 TIRS by applying a split-window algorithm. We then grouped the urban landscape into 10 urban function zones (UFZs) and classified these UFZs as LST hot or cool spots. We used stepwise regression to examine the relationships between surface temperatures in hot and cool spots and 7 climate-sensitive parameters. We obtained some interesting results: (1) Urban thermal environment is highly heterogeneous at the scale of UFZ. Every UFZ can be partitioned into both hot and cool spots. (2) The prediction accuracy of LST is found to be dependent on a combination of different parameters. The 2-dimensional parameters were more effective in predicting LST than the 3-dimensional parameters according to the stepwise regression analyses. (3) A new 3-dimensional parameter (sun-view factor-SunVF) adopted in this study, provides an alternative option in characterizing the variation of LST of various landscape structures. The results of this study provide insights into how the current spatial pattern of LST formed and into which mitigation strategies can be applied to improve the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Urban Land-Cover Classification Using Side-View Information from Oblique Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover classification on very high resolution data (decimetre-level) is a well-studied yet challenging problem in remote sensing data processing. Most of the existing works focus on using images with orthographic view or orthophotos with the associated digital surface models (DSMs). However, the use of the nowadays widely-available oblique images to support such a task is not sufficiently investigated. In the effort of identifying different land-cover classes, it is intuitive that information of side-views obtained from the oblique can be of great help, yet how this can be technically achieved is challenging due to the complex geometric association between the side and top views. We aim to address these challenges in this paper by proposing a framework with enhanced classification results, leveraging the use of orthophoto, digital surface models and oblique images. The proposed method contains a classic two-step of (1) feature extraction and (2) a classification approach, in which the key contribution is a feature extraction algorithm that performs simplified geometric association between top-view segments (from orthophoto) and side-view planes (from projected oblique images), and joint statistical feature extraction. Our experiment on five test sites showed that the side-view information could steadily improve the classification accuracy with both kinds of training samples (1.1% and 5.6% for evenly distributed and non-evenly distributed samples, separately). Additionally, by testing the classifier at a large and untrained site, adding side-view information showed a total of 26.2% accuracy improvement of the above-ground objects, which demonstrates the strong generalization ability of the side-view features.

TI  - Regional Forest Volume Estimation by Expanding LiDAR Samples Using Multi-Sensor Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information regarding forest volume plays an important role in estimating afforestation, timber harvesting, and forest ecological services. Traditionally, operations on forest growing stock volume using field measurements are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recently, remote sensing technology has emerged as a time-cost efficient method for forest inventory. In the present study, we have adopted three procedures, including samples expanding, feature selection, and results generation and evaluation. Extrapolating the samples from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanning is the most important step in satisfying the requirement of sample size for nonparametric methods operation and result in accuracy improvement. Besides, mean decrease Gini (MDG) methodology embedded into Random Forest (RF) algorithm served as a selector for feature measure; afterwards, RF and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were adopted in subsequent forest volume prediction. The results show that the retrieval of Forest volume in the entire area was in the range of 50-360 m(3)/ha, and the results from the two models show a better consistency while using the sample combination extrapolated by the optimal threshold value (2 x 10(-4)), leading to the best performances of RF (R-2 = 0.618, root mean square error, RMSE = 43.641 m(3)/ha, mean absolute error, MAE = 33.016 m(3)/ha), followed by KNN (R-2 = 0.617, RMSE = 43.693 m(3)/ha, MAE = 32.534 m(3)/ha). The detailed analysis that is discussed in the present paper clearly shows that expanding image-derived LiDAR samples helps in refining the prediction of regional forest volume while using satellite data and nonparametric models.

TI  - Discriminative Feature Learning Constrained Unsupervised Network for Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a significant preprocessing step for increasing the exploitability of remote sensing imagery that faces various levels of difficulty due to the complexity of underlying surfaces, insufficient training data, and redundant information in high-dimensional data. To solve these problems, we propose an unsupervised network for cloud detection (UNCD) on multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing images. The UNCD method enforces discriminative feature learning to obtain the residual error between the original input and the background in deep latent space, which is based on the observation that clouds are sparse and modeled as sparse outliers in remote sensing imagery. The UNCD enforces discriminative feature learning to obtain the residual error between the original input and the background in deep latent space, which is based on the observation that clouds are sparse and modeled as sparse outliers in remote sensing imagery. First, a compact representation of the original imagery is obtained by a latent adversarial learning constrained encoder. Meanwhile, the majority class with sufficient samples (i.e., background pixels) is more accurately reconstructed than the clouds with limited samples by the decoder. An image discriminator is used to prevent the generalization of out-of-class features caused by latent adversarial learning. To further highlight the background information in the deep latent space, a multivariate Gaussian distribution is introduced. In particular, the residual error with clouds highlighted and background samples suppressed is applied in the cloud detection in deep latent space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed UNCD method, experiments were conducted on both MS and HS datasets that were captured by various sensors over various scenes, and the results demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. The sensors that captured the datasets include Landsat 8, GaoFen-1 (GF-1), and GaoFen-5 (GF-5). Landsat 8 was launched at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on 11 February 2013, in a mission that was initially known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). China launched the GF-1 satellite. The GF-5 satellite captures hyperspectral observations in the Chinese Key Projects of High-Resolution Earth Observation System. The overall accuracy (OA) values for Images I and II from the Landsat 8 dataset were 0.9526 and 0.9536, respectively, and the OA values for Images III and IV from the GF-1 wide field of view (WFV) dataset were 0.9957 and 0.9934, respectively. Hence, the proposed method outperformed the other considered methods.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Approach Based on Hybrid Multispectral Features with Dynamic Thresholds for GF-1 Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, GF-1 (GF is the acronym for GaoFen which means high-resolution in Chinese) remote sensing images are widely utilized in agriculture because of their high spatio-temporal resolution and free availability. However, due to the transferrable rationale of optical satellites, the GF-1 remote sensing images are inevitably impacted by clouds, which leads to a lack of ground object's information of crop areas and adds noises to research datasets. Therefore, it is crucial to efficiently detect the cloud pixel of GF-1 imagery of crop areas with powerful performance both in time consumption and accuracy when it comes to large-scale agricultural processing and application. To solve the above problems, this paper proposed a cloud detection approach based on hybrid multispectral features (HMF) with dynamic thresholds. This approach combined three spectral features, namely the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), WHITENESS and the Haze-Optimized Transformation (HOT), to detect the cloud pixels, which can take advantage of the hybrid Multispectral Features. Meanwhile, in order to meet the variety of the threshold values in different seasons, a dynamic threshold adjustment method was adopted, which builds a relationship between the features and a solar altitude angle to acquire a group of specific thresholds for an image. With the test of GF-1 remote sensing datasets and comparative trials with Random Forest (RF), the results show that the method proposed in this paper not only has high accuracy, but also has advantages in terms of time consumption. The average accuracy of cloud detection can reach 90.8% and time consumption for each GF-1 imagery can reach to 5 min, which has been reduced by 83.27% compared with RF method. Therefore, the approach presented in this work could serve as a reference for those who are interested in the cloud detection of remote sensing images.

TI  - Extraction of Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Concentrations of Chlorophyll-a and Total Suspended Matter in Poyang Lake Using GF-1 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China. Its ecosystem services and functions, such as water conservation and the sustaining of biodiversity, have significant impacts on the security and sustainability of the regional ecology. The lake and wetlands of the Poyang Lake are among protected aquatic ecosystems with global significance. The Poyang Lake region has recently experienced increased urbanization and anthropogenic disturbances, which has greatly impacted the lake environment. The concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) are important indicators for assessing the water quality of lakes. In this study, we used data from the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite, in situ measurements of the reflectance of the lake water, and the analysis of the Chl-a and TSM concentrations of lake water samples to investigate the spatial and temporal variation and distribution patterns of the concentrations of Chl-a and TSM. We analyzed the measured reflectance spectra and conducted correlation analysis to identify the spectral bands that are sensitive to the concentration of Chl-a and TSM, respectively. The study suggested that the wavelengths corresponding to bands 1, 3, and 4 of the GF-1 images were the most sensitive to changes in the concentration of Chl-a. The results showed that the correlation between the reflectance and TSM concentration was the highest for wavelengths that corresponded to band 3 of the GF-1 satellite images. Based on the analysis, bands 1, 3, and 4 of GF-1 were selected while using the APPEL (APProach by ELimination) model and were used to establish a model for the retrieval of Chl-a concentrations. A single-band model that was based on band 3 of GF-1 was established for the retrieval of TSM concentrations. The modeling results revealed the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in Poyang Lake between 2015 and 2016 and demonstrated the capacities of GF-1 in the monitoring of lake environment.

TI  - Landscape Sustainability Evaluation of Ecologically Fragile Areas Based on Boltzmann Entropy
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - From the perspective of landscape, it is important to evaluate the landscape sustainability of ecologically fragile areas and explore temporal and spatial evolution laws to promote their sustainable development. Presently, most studies on the analysis of landscape Boltzmann entropy (also called configurational entropy) are based on a single landscape, and most of these studies are theoretical discussions. However, there are few case studies on landscape ecology. The main objectives of this paper are to explore a quantitative relationship between Boltzmann entropy and landscape sustainability, to propose a method for evaluating landscape sustainability based on Boltzmann entropy, and to evaluate the sustainability of diverse landscapes in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, China. This article uses digital elevation model (DEM) data with a spatial resolution of 30 m in Mizhi County. The remote sensing data on Mizhi County from 2000 were obtained by the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) + sensor, and the high-resolution image of Mizhi County from 2015 was obtained by the Gaofen-1 satellite. In this article, the subbasins are taken as the evaluation unit, and the Boltzmann entropy of Mizhi County is calculated based on the experts' scoring of landscape sustainability in the study area. Through the analysis of landscape sustainability results from 216 subbasins in Mizhi County in 2000 and 2015, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the evaluation matrix proposed in this paper is effective, and the Boltzmann entropy obtained by this method can directly reflect the level of landscape sustainability; (2) during the research period, the landscape sustainability of Mizhi County showed a good trend overall, especially the three townships of Taozhen, Shadian, and Shigou, which were significantly improved, and these findings were consistent with the field investigation; (3) on the spatial level, the landscape sustainability of mid-eastern Mizhi County is relatively poor compared to that in other regions, but the sustainability is also slowly increasing.

TI  - Mapping Fine-Scale Urban Spatial Population Distribution Based on High-Resolution Stereo Pair Images, Points of Interest, and Land Cover Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale population distribution is increasingly becoming a research hotspot owing to its high demand in many applied fields. It is of great significance in urban emergency response, disaster assessment, resource allocation, urban planning, market research, and transportation route design. This study employed land cover, building address, and housing price data, and high-resolution stereo pair remote sensing images to simulate fine-scale urban population distribution. We firstly extracted the residential zones on the basis of land cover and Google Earth data, combined them with building information including address and price. Then, we employed the stereo pair analysis method to obtain the building height on the basis of ZY3-02 high-resolution satellite data and transform the building height into building floors. After that, we built a sophisticated, high spatial resolution model of population density. Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of the model using the survey data from 12 communities in the study area. Results demonstrated that the proposed model for spatial fine-scale urban population products yielded more accurate small-area population estimation relative to high-resolution gridded population surface (HGPS). The approach proposed in this study holds potential to improve the precision and automation of high-resolution population estimation.

TI  - Spatially Explicit Model for Statistical Downscaling of Satellite Passive Microwave Soil Moisture
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a spatially explicit statistical downscaling (SESD) method that fuses multiscale geospatial data with the soil moisture (SM) product from NASA's SM Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite. The multiscale data included the 9-km resolution SMAP SM image, 1-km resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), 1-km digital elevation model (DEM), 1-km resolution MODIS land surface temperature (LST), 500-m resolution gross primary productivity (GPP), 30-m resolution topographical water index (TWI), and West Texas Mesonet (WTM) station data. We used the random forest (RF) machine learning method to make a downscaled SM prediction at the 1-km resolution. Then, a regression kriging was applied to model the unpredicted variability at local scales to produce downscaled SM using the WTM station data. Due to the low number of ground truth samples, the validation was based on Monte -Carlo cross validation (CV) to calculate the unbiased root-mean-square deviation (ubRMSD), root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and bias of the test set randomly separated from the training set from the WTM station data. Model validation showed that the downscaled SM data at the 1-km resolution can significantly improve the accuracy of the SM product as well as enhancing its spatial resolution. This article has its novelty in using the spatially explicit model to reconcile the scale difference from satellite data and ground observations.

TI  - BP neural networks and random forest models to detect damage by <i>Dendrolimus punctatus</i> Walker
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of a pest detection algorithm is an important step to couple "ground-space" characteristics, which is also the basis for rapid and accurate monitoring and detection of pest damage. In four experimental areas in Sanming City, Jiangle County, Sha County and Yanping District in Fujian Province, sample data on pest damage in 182 sets of Dendrolimus punctatus were collected. The data were randomly divided into a training set and testing set, and five duplicate tests and one eliminating-indicator test were done. Based on the characterization analysis of the host for D. punctatus damage, seven characteristic indicators of ground and remote sensing including leaf area index, standard error of leaf area index (SEL) of pine forest, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wetness from tasseled cap transformation (WET), green band (B-2), red band (B-3), near-infrared band (B-4) of remote sensing image are obtained to construct BP neural networks and random forest models of pest levels. The detection results of these two algorithms were comprehensively compared from the aspects of detection precision, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve, and a paired t test. The results showed that the seven indicators all were responsive to pest damage, and NDVI was relatively weak; the average pest damage detection precision of six tests by BP neural networks was 77.29%, the kappa coefficient was 0.6869 and after the RF algorithm, the respective values were 79.30% and 0.7151, showing that the latter is more optimized, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05); the detection precision, kappa coefficient and AUC of the RF algorithm was higher than the BP neural networks for three pest levels (no damage, moderate damage and severe damage). The detection precision and AUC of BP neural networks were a little higher for mild damage, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05) except for the kappa coefficient for the no damage level (p < 0.05). An "over-fitting" phenomenon tends to occur in BP neural networks, while RF method is more robust, providing a detection effect that is better than the BP neural networks. Thus, the application of the random forest algorithm for pest damage and multilevel dispersed variables is thus feasible and suggests that attention to the proportionality of sample data from various categories is needed when collecting data.

TI  - Mapping the fine-scale spatial pattern of artificial light pollution at night in urban environments from the perspective of bird habitats
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in artificial light at night (ALAN) is a global concern, while the pattern of ALAN pollution inside urban areas has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap, we developed a novel method to map fine-scale ALAN pollution patterns in urban bird habitats using high spatial resolution ALAN satellite data. First, an ALAN pollution map was derived from JL1-3B satellite images. Then, the core habitat nodes (CHNs) representing the main habitats for urban birds to inhabit were identified from the land cover map, which was produced using Gaofen2 (GF2) data, and the high probability corridors (HPCs), indicating high connectivity paths, were derived from Circuitscape software. Finally, the ALAN patterns in the CHNs and HPCs were analysed, and the mismatch index was proposed to evaluate the trade-off between human activity ALAN demands and ALAN supply for the protection of urban birds. The results demonstrated that 115 woodland patches covering 4149.0 ha were selected as CHNs, and most of the CHNs were large urban parks or scenic spots located in the urban fringe. The 2923 modelled HPCs occupying 1179.2 ha were small remaining vegetation patches and vegetated corridors along the major transport arteries. The differences in the ALAN pollution patterns between CHNs and HPCs were mainly determined by the characteristics of the green space patches and the light source types. The polluted regions in the CHNs were clustered in a few regions that suffered from concentrated and intensive ALAN, while most of the CHNs remained unaffected. In contrast, the 727 HPCs were mainly polluted by street lighting was scattered and widely distributed, resulting a more varying influence to birds than that in the CHNs. Relating patterns of the ALAN to bird habitats and connectivity provides meaningful information for comprehensive planning to alleviate the disruptive effects of ALAN pollution.

TI  - Large-Scale Marsh Loss Reconstructed from Satellite Data in the Small Sanjiang Plain since 1965: Process, Pattern and Driving Force
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring wetland dynamics and related land-use changes over long-time periods is essential to understanding wetland evolution and supporting knowledge-based conservation policies. Combining multi-source remote sensing images, this study identifies the dynamics of marshes, a core part of wetlands, in the Small Sanjiang Plain (SSP), from 1965 to 2015. The influence of human activities on marsh patterns is estimated quantitatively by the trajectory analysis method. The results indicate that the marsh area decreased drastically by 53.17% of the total SSP area during the study period, which covered the last five decades. The marsh mostly transformed to paddy field and dry farmland in the SSP from 1965 to 2015, indicating that agricultural encroachment was the dominant contributor to marsh degradation in the area. Analysis of the landscape indexes indicates that marsh fragmentation was aggravated during the past five decades in the SSP. Trajectory analysis also indicated that human activities have acted as the primary driving force of marsh changes in the SSP since 1965. This study provides scientific information to better understand the evolution of the wetland and to implement ecological conservation and sustainable management of the wetlands in the future.

TI  - Modeling surface longwave radiation over high-relief terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal anisotropy is an important phenomenon in thermal infrared remote sensing as it restricts the retrieval accuracy of surface longwave radiation (SLR). Topography is an essential controlling factor for the directionality of SLR for high-relief regions (e.g., mountain regions) where there is land surface heterogeneity and non-isothermal properties at pixel scales. However, satellite sensors can only receive radiance from a specific surface object at a small number of simultaneous viewing angles, which makes the quantitative modeling of thermal anisotropy challenging. Therefore, we developed the topographic longwave radiation model (TLRM) to describe the directionality of SLR components taking into account the variability of both subpixel topography and thermal anisotropy in high-relief regions. The reliability of TLRM was validated using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model over two typical geomorphic areas: a valley scene and a peak scene. The preliminary validation shows good agreement in terms of surface upward longwave radiance, which confirms the potential of TLRM for capturing the anisotropic patterns of land surfaces. The radiance values simulated by the DART model were first revised for the spectral mismatch. Then, they are used to correct residual deviation for TLRM using linear regressions. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were 0.830 W/(m(2) .sr) and 0.746 for the valley scene, respectively, and 0.239 W/(m(2).sr) and 0.711 for the peak scene, respectively. Compared with TLRM, models that do not consider terrain effects generate significant discrepancies in high relief SLR components. The differences in downward longwave radiation can reach -60 W/m(2) in valleys without considering terrain effects. Based on the reference of hemispherical upward longwave radiation, surface upward longwave radiation estimated by the direct estimation method had a bias of 11.41 W/m(2) and standard deviation (STD) of 7.30 W/m(2), while the directional upward longwave radiation had a bias of 5.99 W/m(2) and STD of 4.08 W/m(2), showing lower estimation variation. The discrepancy between surface net longwave radiation (NLR) and terrain-corrected NLR ranged between 50 and -130 W/m(2) with clear negative biases mainly occurring in valleys. With higher spatial resolutions of remotely sensed imagery, the influence of complex terrain on land surface radiative flux has become more significant. This parameterization scheme is expected to better represent the topographic effects on SLR, enhance understanding of thermal anisotropy in non-isothermal mixed pixel areas of high relief, and improve the inversion accuracy of SLR.

TI  - MODIS-Derived Estimation of Soil Respiration within Five Cold Temperate Coniferous Forest Sites in the Eastern Loess Plateau, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration (R-s) is seldom analyzed using remotely sensed data because satellite technology has difficulty monitoring various respiratory processes in the soil. We investigated the potential of remote sensing data products to estimate R-s, including land surface temperature (LST) and spectral vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), using a nine-year (2007-2015) field measurement dataset of R-s and soil temperature (T-s) at five forest sites at the eastern Loess Plateau, China. The results indicate that soil temperature is the primary factor influencing the seasonal variation of R-s at the five sites. The accuracy of the model based on the observed data is not significantly different from the model based on MODIS-derived nighttime LST values. There was a significant difference with the model based on MODIS-derived daytime LST values. Therefore, nighttime LST was the optimum LST for estimation of R-s. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently exhibited a stronger correlation with R-s when compared to the green edge chlorophyll index and enhanced vegetation index. Further analysis showed that adding the NDVI into the model considering only T-s or nighttime LST could significantly improve the simulation accuracy of R-s. The models depending on nighttime LST and NDVI showed comparable accuracy with the models based on the in situ T-s and NDVI. These results suggest that models based entirely on remote sensing data from MODIS have the potential to estimate R-s at the cold temperate coniferous forest sites. The performance of the model in other vegetation types or regions has also been proved. Our conclusions further confirmed that it is feasible for large-scale estimates of R-s by means of MODIS data in temperate coniferous forest ecosystems.

TI  - Use of Mamdani Fuzzy Algorithm for Multi-Hazard Susceptibility Assessment in a Developing Urban Settlement (Mamak, Ankara, Turkey)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas may be affected by multiple hazards, and integrated hazard susceptibility maps are needed for suitable site selection and planning. Furthermore, geological-geotechnical parameters, construction costs, and the spatial distribution of existing infrastructure should be taken into account for this purpose. Up-to-date land-use and land-cover (LULC) maps, as well as natural hazard susceptibility maps, can be frequently obtained from high-resolution satellite sensors. In this study, an integrated hazard susceptibility assessment was performed for a developing urban settlement (Mamak District of Ankara City, Turkey) considering landslide and flood potential. The flood susceptibility map of Ankara City was produced in a previous study using modified analytical hierarchical process (M-AHP) approach. The landslide susceptibility map was produced using the logistic regression technique in this study. Sentinel-2 images were employed for generating LULC data with the random forest classification method. Topographical derivatives obtained from a high-resolution digital elevation model and lithological parameters were employed for the production of landslide susceptibility maps. For the integrated hazard susceptibility assessment, the Mamdani fuzzy algorithm was considered, and the results are discussed in the present study. The results demonstrate that multi-hazard susceptibility assessment maps for urban planning can be obtained by combining a set of expert-based and ensemble learning methods.

TI  - Assessing fractional vegetation cover changes and ecological quality of the Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve based on remote sensing spatial information
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve ( WYS) , established in 1979, is the largest and most intact subtropical forest ecosystem in southeastern China. No study has assessed the vegetation coverage change along with its ecological effect after the protection of the reserve for almost 40 years. In this study , the NDVI data of Landsat Image was corrected using the NDVI data of MODIS, the fractional vegetation cover ( FVC) and the remote sensing based ecological index ( RSEI) were calculated to assess the change of FVC and ecological quality in WYS with five Landsat images representing a period from 1979 to 2017. The results showed that after protection for nearly 40 years the FVC of the reserve had been significantly increased from 73.6% in 1979 to 89.5% in 2017, which consequently improved ecological quality from 0.801 in 1988 to 0.823 in 2017. In 2017, the area with the good and excellent ecological quality grades accounted for 98.7% of the total. Spatially, the ecologically-improved areas mainly distributed in the northeast core area and the center of the southwest core area. The ecologically-declined areas mostly occurred along roadsides and peaks. Vertically, the highest FVC and ecological quality areas distributed in the elevations between 1300-1900 m. In general, the improvement of FVC and ecological quality in the Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve was due largely to the effective policies and the successful protection by local government and people, except 14 some special year that may be affected mainly by climate conditions.

TI  - A semi-empirical method for estimating complete surface temperature from radiometric surface temperature, a study in Hong Kong city
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The complete surface temperature (T,) in urban areas, defined as the mean temperature of the total active surface area, is an important variable in urban micro-climate research, specifically for assessment of the urban surface energy balance. Since most vertically-oriented building facets are not observed by a nadir-viewing remote imaging radiometer, the radiometric surface temperature (T-r) measured at a specific view angle cannot be used with existing heat transfer equations to estimate radiative and convective fluxes in the urban environment. Thus, it is necessary to derive T-c for city neighborhoods. This study develops a simple method to estimate T-c from T-r with the aid of the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3D (TUF-3D) numerical model, which calculates 3-D sub-facet scale urban surface temperatures for a variety of surface geometries and properties, weather conditions and solar angles. The effects of geometric and meteorological characteristics - e.g., building planar area index (lambda(p)), wall facet area index (F), solar irradiance - on the difference between T-c and T-r were evaluated using the TUF-3D model. Results showed the effects of geometric and meteorological characteristics on the difference between T, and T-r differ between daytime and nighttime. The study then sought to predict the relationship between T-r and T-c, using lambda(p), F, and solar irradiance for daytime and only using lambda(p), and F for nighttime. Based on the simulated data from TUF-3D, the resulting relationships achieve a coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.97 and a RMSE of 1.5 K during daytime, with corresponding nighttime values of r(2) = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.69 K. The relationships between T-r and T-c are evaluated using high resolution airborne thermal images of daytime urban scenes: r(2) = 0.75 and RMSE = 1.09 K on August 6, 2013 at 12:40 pm; and r(2) = 0.86 and RMSE = 1.86K on October 24, 2017 at 11:30 am. The new relationships were also applied to estimate T-c from T-r in Hong Kong retrieved from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). In the present climatic context, the difference between T-c and T-r can reach 10 K during daytime in summer, and 6 K during daytime in winter, with seasonal variation attributable to the variations in shortwave irradiance. The nighttime difference between T-c, and T-r can also reach 2 K in both summer and spring seasons.

TI  - Improving prediction of soil organic carbon content in croplands using phenological parameters extracted from NDVI time series data
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or stock is important for climate change studies and land management decisions. When using environmental covariates to map SOC content or stock, variables indicating human activities have drawn growing attentions. Crop species/crop rotations and agricultural management significantly affect the spatial variation of SOC in croplands. For areas where climatic conditions and farming managements are generally consistent in cultivation territory of one crop species, crop phenology largely indicates the crop response to soil. Therefore, phenological parameters incorporating with crop rotation could be effective for mapping soil organic carbon in these areas. In this study, we extracted phenological parameters from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, and used these variables with crop rotation for predicting topsoil organic carbon content in a cropland area in Anhui province, China. Forty-nine sampling points were collected in field. For these points, there were three crop rotations each with two crop species per year. Twenty-two HJ-1 A/B images for 2010 year with a 30 m resolution were obtained. Eleven phenological parameters for each of the two growing seasons were obtained with a dynamic threshold method. Various combinations of predictive variables were developed based on variable importance and experimented for predicting topsoil organic carbon using random forest. The prediction results were validated using a cross validation approach. Results showed that base levels (given as the average of the left and right minimum values of a time series profile) for both seasons were the most important predictors in this area. Adding both crop rotation and the two phenological parameters to the natural environment variables increased the prediction accuracies by 50% in terms of R-2 and 13.4% in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of crop phenology in mapping SOC in croplands.

TI  - RivWidthCloud: An Automated Google Earth Engine Algorithm for River Width Extraction From Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The wetted width of a river is one of the most important hydraulic parameters that can be readily measured using remote sensing. Remotely sensed river widths are used to estimate key attributes of river systems, including changes in their surface area, channel storage, and discharge. Although several published algorithms automate river network and width extraction from remote sensing images, they are limited by only being able to run on local computers and do not automatically manage cloudy images as input. Here we present RivWidthCloud, a river width software package developed on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. RivWidthCloud automatically extracts river centerline and widths from optical satellite images with the ability to flag observations that are obstructed by features like clouds, cloud shadows, and snow based on existing quality band classification. Because RivWidthCloud is built on a popular cloud computing platform, it allows users to easily apply the algorithm to the platform's vast archive of remote sensing images, thereby reducing the users' overhead for computing hardware and data storage. By comparing RivWidthCloud-derived widths from Landsat images to in situ widths from the U.S. and Canada, we show that RivWidthCloud can estimate widths with high accuracy (root mean square error: 99 m; mean absolute error: 43 m; mean bias: -21 m). By making RivWidthCloud publicly available, we anticipate that it will be used to address both river science questions and operational applications of water resource management.

TI  - An Improved Mapping with Super-Resolved Multispectral Images for Geostationary Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution (SR) technology has shown great potential for improving the performance of the mapping and classification of multispectral satellite images. However, it is very challenging to solve ill-conditioned problems such as mapping for remote sensing images due to the presence of complicated ground features. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) mapping method called the mixed sparse representation non-convex high-order total variation (MSR-NCHOTV) method in order to accurately classify multispectral images and refine object classes. Firstly, MSR-NCHOTV is employed to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution time-series images obtained from the Gaofen-4 (GF-4) geostationary orbit satellite. Secondly, a support vector machine (SVM) method was used to classify the results of SRR using the GF-4 geostationary orbit satellite images. Two sets of GF-4 satellite image data were used for experiments, and the MSR-NCHOTV SRR result obtained using these data was compared with the SRR results obtained using the bilinear interpolation (BI), projection onto convex sets (POCS), and iterative back projection (IBP) methods. The sharpness of the SRR results was evaluated using the gray-level variation between adjacent pixels, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SRR results was evaluated by using the measurement of high spatial resolution remote sensing images. For example, compared with the values obtained using the BI method, the average sharpness and SNR of the five bands obtained using the MSR-NCHOTV method were higher by 39.54% and 51.52%, respectively, and the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of the classification results obtained using the MSR-NCHOTV method were higher by 32.20% and 46.14%, respectively. These results showed that the MSR-NCHOTV method can effectively improve image clarity, enrich image texture details, enhance image quality, and improve image classification accuracy. Thus, the effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed SRR method to improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing images was verified.

TI  - PCDRN: Progressive Cascade Deep Residual Network for Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is the process of fusing a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. In the process of pansharpening, the LRMS image is often directly upsampled by a scale of 4, which may result in the loss of high-frequency details in the fused high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. To solve this problem, we put forward a novel progressive cascade deep residual network (PCDRN) with two residual subnetworks for pansharpening. The network adjusts the size of an MS image to the size of a PAN image twice and gradually fuses the LRMS image with the PAN image in a coarse-to-fine manner. To prevent an overly-smooth phenomenon and achieve high-quality fusion results, a multitask loss function is defined to train our network. Furthermore, to eliminate checkerboard artifacts in the fusion results, we employ a resize-convolution approach instead of transposed convolution for upsampling LRMS images. Experimental results on the Pleiades and WorldView-3 datasets prove that PCDRN exhibits superior performance compared to other popular pansharpening methods in terms of quantitative and visual assessments.

TI  - Compilation of 1:50,000 vegetation type map with remote sensing images based on mountain altitudinal belts of Taibai Mountain in the North-South transitional zone of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The compilation of 1:250,000 vegetation type map in the North-South transitional zone and 1:50,000 vegetation type maps in typical mountainous areas is one of the main tasks of Integrated Scientific Investigation of the North-South Transitional Zone of China. In the past, vegetation type maps were compiled by a large number of ground field surveys. Although the field survey method is accurate, it is not only time-consuming, but also only covers a small area due to the limitations of physical environment conditions. Remote sensing data can make up for the limitation of field survey because of its full coverage. However, there are still some difficulties and bottlenecks in the extraction of remote sensing information of vegetation types, especially in the automatic extraction. As an example of the compilation of 1:50,000 vegetation type map, this paper explores and studies the remote sensing extraction and mapping methods of vegetation type with medium and large scales based on mountain altitudinal belts of Taibai Mountain, using multi-temporal high resolution remote sensing data, ground survey data, previous vegetation type map and forest survey data. The results show that: 1) mountain altitudinal belts can effectively support remote sensing classification and mapping of 1:50,000 vegetation type map in mountain areas. Terrain constraint factors with mountain altitudinal belt information can be generated by mountain altitudinal belts and 1:10,000 Digital Surface Model (DSM) data of Taibai Mountain. Combining the terrain constraint factors with multi-temporal and high-resolution remote sensing data, ground survey data and previous small-scale vegetation type map data, the vegetation types at all levels can be extracted effectively. 2) The basic remote sensing interpretation and mapping process for typical mountains is interpretation of vegetation type-groups -> interpretation of vegetation formation groups, formations and subformations -> interpretation and classification of vegetation types & subtypes, which is a combination method of top-down method and bottom-up method, not the top-down or the bottom-up classification according to the level of mapping units. The results of this study provide a demonstration and scientific basis for the compilation of large and medium scale vegetation type maps.

TI  - Evaluating the Contribution of Spectral Features to Image Classification Using Class Separability
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification needs the spectral similarity comparison between spectral features of each pixel and the representative spectral features of each class. The spectral similarity is obtained by computing the spectral feature vector distance between the pixel and the class. Each spectral feature contributes differently in the image classification depending on the class separability of the spectral feature, which is computed using a suitable vector distance measure such as the Bhattacharyya distance. We propose a method to determine the weight value of each spectral feature in the computation of feature vector distance for the similarity measurement. The weight value is determined by the ratio between each feature separability value to the total separability values of all the spectral features. We created ten spectral features consisting of seven bands of Landsat-8 OLI image and three indices, NDVI, NDWI and NDBI. For three experimental test sites, we obtained the overall accuracies between 95.0% and 97.5% and the kappa coefficients between 90.43% and 94.47%.

TI  - Improved thermal structure simulation and optimized sampling strategy for Lake Erie using a data assimilative model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Erie has experienced substantial environmental issues (e.g., hypoxia, harmful algal blooms) for decades, which are closely related to the lake's thermal characteristics. While three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic models have been widely applied to Lake Erie, challenges remain due to model representation of physical processes, errors and uncertainty in boundary conditions and forcing terms. The Great Lakes region has a relatively dense and long-term observational record, and these observational data have been used for model initialization and verification, but have not been incorporated into 3D model simulations through data assimilation (DA) to create reanalysis products or improve short-term forecasts. In this work, we developed and evaluated DA to improve thermal structure simulation of Lake Erie. Moored instrument data and satellite data are incorporated into a data-assimilative hydrodynamic model for analysis and evaluation. Results show that DA can effectively improve the model performance to create reanalysis fields when the DA formulation is appropriately developed in recognition of the dynamic complexities and anisotropic error covariances of Lake Erie. The data assimilative model also improves forecasting accuracy and restrains forecasting uncertainty to an acceptable level on a timescale of 1-7 days after being unleashed from DA. Lastly, data sampling strategies based on an error correlation map are examined. Results show the method can effectively reduce the sampling effort while still achieving similar model skills with potential for optimal design of an observation network or field sampling strategy.

TI  - Identification of Cancer Stem Cell Subpopulations in Head and Neck Metastatic Malignant Melanoma
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in many cancer types. This study identified and characterized CSCs in head and neck metastatic malignant melanoma (HNmMM) to regional lymph nodes using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) markers. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining performed on 20 HNmMM tissue samples demonstrated expression of iPSC markers OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC in all samples, while NANOG was expressed at low levels in two samples. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining demonstrated an OCT4+/SOX2+/KLF4+/c-MYC+ CSC subpopulation within the tumor nests (TNs) and another within the peritumoral stroma (PTS) of HNmMM tissues. IF also showed expression of NANOG by some OCT4+/SOX2+/KLF4+/c-MYC+ cells within the TNs in an HNmMM tissue sample that expressed NANOG on IHC staining. In situ hybridization (n = 6) and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (n = 5) on the HNmMM samples confirmed expression of all five iPSC markers. Western blotting of primary cell lines derived from four of the 20 HNmMM tissue samples showed expression of SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC but not OCT4 and NANOG, and three of these cell lines formed tumorspheres in vitro. We demonstrate the presence of two putative CSC subpopulations within HNmMM, which may be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of this aggressive cancer.

TI  - Review of snow cover variation over the Tibetan Plateau and its influence on the broad climate system
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Variation in snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a key component of climate change and variability, and critical for many hydrological and biological processes. This review first summarizes recent observed changes of snow cover over the TP, including the relationship between the TP snow cover and that over Eurasia as a whole; recent climatology and spatial patterns; inter-annual variability and trends; as well as projected changes in snow cover. Second, we discuss the physical causes and factors contributing to variations in snow cover over the TP, including precipitation, temperature, and synoptic forcing such as the Arctic Oscillation and the westerly jet, and large scale ocean-atmosphere oscillations such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ESNO), the Indian Ocean dipole, and the southern annular mode. Third, linkage between snow cover over the TP and subsequent weather and climate systems are discussed, including the East and South Asian Summer Monsoons, and their subsequent precipitation regimes. Finally, new perspectives and unresolved issues are outlined, including changes in extreme events and related disasters (e.g., avalanches), the use of novel datasets, the possible elevation dependency in snow cover change, expected snow cover changes under 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming, the physical mechanisms modulating climate extremes in the region, and the linkage between snow cover variation and atmospheric pollution. Despite a large body of work over the TP, we argue that there is a need for more comparative studies using multiple snow datasets, and snow cover information over the western TP and during summer would benefit from more attention in the future.

TI  - Twenty-three years of forest cover change in protected areas under different governance strategies: A case study from Ethiopia's southern highlands
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation has heightened the need for effective governance of protected areas aimed at conserving natural resources, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. The southern highlands of Ethiopia hold some of the largest expanses of contiguous tropical forest in Ethiopia. This area also is undergoing rapid land conversion. Multiple protected areas with different management strategies and objectives have been established, in part, to conserve forests and the ecosystem services they provide. We examined four types of protected areas; a national park, a state-run forest enterprise, two occupied privately leased hunting concessions, and two unoccupied hunting concessions, to evaluate their effectiveness at protecting forest cover. We used 1509 field plots with medium-resolution Landsat imagery from 1987 to 2015 to develop models of forest cover at approximately five-year time intervals. We found protected areas that were actively managed for timber production or hunting were more effective at conserving forest cover than the national park and the unoccupied hunting concessions. Over the study period, net forest cover change was -7.8% for the national park, 12.9% for the state-run forest enterprise, -0.2% and 13.3% for the occupied hunting concessions and -14.0% and -13.0% for the unoccupied hunting concessions. We also discuss how the change in forest cover relates to historic political events. In places like Ethiopia where the federal resources needed to conserve forests are limited, promoting a network that includes both federally and non-federally managed protected areas can result in more area and forests under protection.

TI  - Landslide detection based on contour-based deep learning framework in case of national scale of Nepal in 2015
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The deadly threat that landslide has brought about is drawing more and more attention to analyze the mechanisms of landslides and the relationship between landslides and climate change. Due to the limited record of historical landslides in developing countries, relevant research is mostly conducted in developed countries. Owing to the publicly available global long time-series Landsat images, such unbalance can be avoided by proposing a practical landslide detection model, especially in terms of national scale. This paper takes the advantage of google earth engine platform to synthesize the annual Landsat images covering the national scale of Nepal into one image and builds an end-to-end contour-based landslide detection deep learning framework. The framework consists of two parts, one is potential landslide detection using vegetation index and degradation of DEM, the other is exact landslide detection using semantic segmentation deep learning model based on the contour regions extracted from the detected potential landslide. The proposed method is applied to detect landslides of Nepal in the year of 2015 and achieves a satisfactory performance with 65% recall and 55.35% precision. The performance is 44% higher accurate than similarly published works, validating its promising applicability in practical landslide detection for national cases.

TI  - Economy Estimation of Mainland China at County-Level Based on Landsat Images and Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The social-economic statistics collected from local governments are the main access for the central government to achieve national economic circumstance, especially for China. However, the statistics of almost 10% of national counties are missing or inconsistent due to the statistical caliber change in the wave of urbanization during economic development. Some researchers proposed to apply a night luminosity product to solve such issue. However, it lacks the ability to distinguish between the wealthy populations with a dense distribution and the less developed places. In this paper, the publicly available daytime Landsat images are used to estimate economic statistics. An end-to-end multitask deep learning framework is constructed to estimate the county-level economy of Mainland China and the overall accuracy of this model achieves higher than 85%. The experiments show that our model provides a potential strategy to make up for the missing statistics and examines the reliability of the statistics collected for the central government.

TI  - A sensitivity study on the response of convection initiation to in situ soil moisture in the central United States
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture can affect precipitation, however there is significant debate about the sign and strength of land-atmosphere coupling. This may be due to the differences regarding the selection of data sources, the presence of atmospheric persistence, and the spatial and temporal scales of the analysis. This study is a sensitivity analysis that quantifies how each of these factors influences land-atmosphere coupling in the central United States from 2005 to 2007. Four different sources of soil moisture are used to represent soil moisture: in situ measurements and three satellite products. The Thunderstorm Observation by Radar (ThOR) algorithm is used to identify convective events. The results show that warm-season afternoon convection initiates preferentially over dry soil, if in situ measurements are used. However, when satellite data are used the sign and strength of the soil moisture-precipitation coupling varies depending on which satellite dataset is used. This demonstrates that evaluations of land-atmosphere coupling strength are sensitive to the source of soil moisture. Our results also show that accounting for atmospheric persistence tends to weaken apparent land-atmosphere coupling. Changing the spatial scale of the analysis can also influence the sign and coupling strength. Analyses that are performed at a coarser spatial resolution tend to indicate a wet preference because they do not capture the local negative feedbacks. This study demonstrates that contradictions in the literature regarding the sign and strength of soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks can be partly attributed to differences in datasets, methods and scale of the analysis.

TI  - Using broadband crop residue angle index to estimate the fractional cover of vegetation, crop residue, and bare soil in cropland systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC), crop residue cover (CRC), and bare soil (BS) in agricultural and vegetation-soil ecosystems is critically important. The traditional triangular space method uses a CRC spectral index (SI) and vegetation SI to create a two-dimensional scatter map in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation (FVC = 1), crop residue (CRC = 1), and bare soil (BS = 1). With this method, the CRC, FVC, and BS of each pixel are calculated based on their spatial locations in the triangular space. In practice, soil moisture and crop residue moisture (SM-CRM) affects the values of CRC spectral indices (SIs) for pure crop residue and soil, thereby reducing the accuracy of broadband remote sensing estimates of CRC, FVC, and BS. In the current work, we propose a new method for estimating fractional cover that uses a broadband spectral angle index (BAI) to estimate CRC. The proposed BAI is the included angle between (i) the line from the reflectance at band a to the reflectance at band b and (ii) the line from the reflectance at band b to the reflectance at band c, where bands a and b represent the VIS or NIR bands, respectively, and band c represents the SWIR1 or SWIR2 of the broadband remote sensing band. The proposed BAI method can mitigate the effects of soil and crop residue moisture content on spectral reflectance. This study evaluates proposed BAIs to estimate CRC and BAI-NDVI triangular space method to estimate CRC, FVC, and BS in cropland where water content varies greatly. Several different BAIs were validated using both laboratory-based measurements and field-based experiments using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument imaging. We used two laboratory-based treatments (mixed spectral reflectance of dry, saturated soil and crop residue and the mixed spectral reflectance of winter wheat leaf and dry, saturated soil and crop residue) to analyze the response of BAIs to CRC, SM-CRM, FVC, and vegetation water content. Next, we evaluated the performance of different BAIs in determining CRC based on the mixed spectral reflectance of crop residue and soil, as well as the performance of the BAI-NDVI triangular space method and linear spectral unmixing analysis to estimate CRC, FVC, and BS from mixed spectral reflectance measurements. Our results indicate that the proposed methods reduce the influence of moisture on broadband CRC SIs, provide accurate estimates of cropland CRC and fractional estimates of CRC, FVC, and BS, and may be applied in croplands where soil and crop residue moisture content varies greatly.

TI  - Water lead exposure risk in Flint, Michigan after switchback in water source: Implications for lead service line replacement policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In February of 2016, the City of Flint, Michigan commenced the FAST start initiative with the aim "to get the lead out of Flint" by replacing lead and galvanized steel service lines throughout the city. An estimated 29,100 parcels are scheduled for service line replacement (SLR) at an expected cost of $172 million. The lead exposure benefits of SLR are evaluated by analyzing Sentinel data on hundreds of repeatedly sampled homes in Flint from February 16, 2016 to July 21, 2017, comparing water lead (WL) in homes with and without lead service lines. Samples taken from homes with lead service lines were significantly more likely to exceed specified thresholds of WL than homes without lead service lines. Second, regardless of service line material type, sampled homes experienced significant reductions in WL with elapsed time from Flint's switchback to water provided by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department. Third, the risk of exceedance of WL > 15 mu g/L was uncorrelated with service line material type. These results are robust to sample restrictions, period stratification, time operations, reference group definitions, and statistical modeling procedures. On the question of what is gained from SLR over optimal corrosion control techniques, we simulated age-specific lead uptake (mu g/day) and blood lead levels (mu g/dL) for children in Flint at 16 and 90 weeks of elapsed time from Flint's switchback to Detroit water. At 90 weeks from the switchback in water source, the quantity of water lead consumed by children in homes with lead service lines decreased 93%, as compared to 16 weeks. Lead exposure benefits of SLR have declined in time, with modest differences in lead uptake across homes with different service lines. In light of results, policy considerations for Flint and nationwide are discussed.

T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we applied a new strategy to identify sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis by combining Ga-68-NOTA-Evans Blue (Ga-68-NEB) for SLN mapping and Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 for LN metastasis detection in breast cancer patients. A total of 24 female patients with breast cancer diagnosed by core biopsy or suspected by mammography or ultrasonography were recruited and provided informed consent. All patients underwent Ga-68-NEB and Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 PET/CT imaging. Visual analysis of Ga-68-NEB PET/CT images was used to determine SLNs, and then compared with the Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 results and histopathological findings. SLNs were visualized in 24 of 24 patients (100.0%) within 4.0-10.0 (5.6 +/- 1.4) min. All patients were pathologically diagnosed with breast cancer, and 12 patients had ipsilateral lymph node metastasis. By combining Ga-68-NEB and Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 images, 7/12 (58.3%) patients showed mild to intense uptake of Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 in SLNs, 1/12 patient (8.3%) had moderate uptake of Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 in the non-SLNs rather than SLN, indicating possible bypass lymphatic drainage, partially accounting for the false negatives in SLN biopsy during surgery. No false positives were found. The SUVmax of Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 activity in metastatic SLNs was significantly higher than that in non-metastatic SLNs (2.2 +/- 2.3 vs 0.7 +/- 0.1, P = 0.047). This study manifests the value of combination of Ga-68-NEB and Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 dual tracer PET/CT in preoperative evaluation of SLN metastasis in breast cancer patients, especially in those patients with lymphatic obstruction and bypass drainage. In general, positive Ga-68-NOTA-RM26 uptake in either SLN or other lymph nodes can apply lymph node dissection rather than intraoperative SLN biopsy.

TI  - Seasonal variation and driving factors of forest fire in Zhejiang Province, China, based on MODIS satellite hot spots
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes and driving factors of forest fire can provide scientific basis 14 prevention and management of forest fire. In this study, we analyzed the changes and driving factors of forest fire in Zhejiang Province during 2001 - 2016 based on trend analysis and Logistic regression model with the MODIS satellite fire point data combined with meteorological (daily average wind speed, daily average temperature, daily relative humidity , daily temperature difference , daily cumulative precipitation) , human activities (distance from road , distance from railway , distance from resident , population, per capita GDP) , topographic and vegetation factors ( elevation, slope, vegetation coverage) . The results showed that the number of forest fires in spring and summer had significantly increased , while the forest fires in the autumn and winter increased first and then decreased. Forest fire in autumn significantly declined. The four seasons' fire occurrence prediction models had good prediction accuracy, reaching 75. 8% (spring), 79. 1% (summer), 74.7% (autumn) and 79.6% (winter). The meteorological, human activity, topographic and vegetation factors significantly affected fire occurrence in spring and summer, while meteorological factors were the main fire drivers in autumn and winter in Zhejiang. The focus of forest fire management should be on human activities. Fire prevention campaign should be done in spring and summer when high-risk forest fires were scattered in the study area. In autumn and winter, observatory and monitoring equipment could be built to facilitate fire management and detect in the area of high fire risk that was concentrated in the southwest region.

TI  - Do Protected Areas Improve Ecosystem Services? A Case Study of Hoh Xil Nature Reserve in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although there is a consensus that protected areas (PAs) can provide various ecosystem services, it is unclear whether protected areas effectively contribute to the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services. We conducted a case study of the Hoh Xil Nature Reserve (HXNR) in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, in order to examine the effectiveness of PA in the conservation of ecosystem services. First, the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) were analyzed based on remotely sensed data sets. Then, the ecosystem service value (ESV) in the PA and non-PA were evaluated using a modified benefit transfer method that had been adjusted using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Finally, hotspot analysis was implemented to reveal the ESV changes for the different districts of the PA. The results of the comparison experiment indicate that: (1) The ESV of the HXNR has considerably increased after it was designated as protected, which had been in decline in the previous stage. The ESVs in a near-by non-PA showed opposite results where the values initially increased but then dropped due to urban expansion and desertification. (2) The areas in HXNR with increased ESV significantly outnumbered the areas that had declining values from 1980 to 2018. For the non-PA, the areas that had increased ESV in 1980-1995 saw a decline in value in 1995-2008; moreover, new areas with decreasing ESV emerged in 2008-2018. (3) The HXNR was found to be more effective than non-PA in improving ecosystem services. (4) The core zone of the nature reserve demonstrated better effectiveness in ecosystem service preservation.

TI  - A review of vegetation phenological metrics extraction using time-series, multispectral satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phonology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed 'land surface phonology', as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phonological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phonology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.

TI  - Onomaconcept as a language unit of nomadic conceptosphere
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article represents the methods relevant for onomaseology and gives the results of the etimological analysis of the ethnonyms of the medieval nomadic tribes. It offers a new term onomaconcept, whose structure modeling enables to reveal the conceptual semantics of ethnonym. Onomaconcept as a type of linguacultural concept can "unfold" pre-ethnonym and ethnonym meaning of the onim under study. The methods of studying the structure of onomaconcept involve the following particular techniques: the method of conceptual analysis; the method of component analysis enabling to study the dictionary definitions of onomaconcept; the method of sememic analysis enabling to revel the archisemes that contextually become conceptual signs developing the notional basis of concept; the method of conceptual analysis of metaphor elaborating an image component of onomaconcept; the onomaseological method describing the ethnocultural and ethnohistorical background of a concept, and the semasiological method. The study of the congeneric names of nomadic tribes has revealed the system of onomaconcepts verbalized by ethnonyms. The reconstruction of the conceptual field of a congeneric name using onomaseological and conceptual analysis has enabled, first, to establish the ethimological meaning of onim and, second, to model the conceptosphere of nomadic consciousness. The complex methods of the analysis of onimic lexics have enabled to restore the system of archaic mental mindsets, reflections, and worldview system of medieval nomadism as completely as possible. The studies of such ethnonyms as Mongol, Tungus, Churchzhen', and others in the context of their linguistic origin and etymology remain arguable in many respects. The linguaconceptual description of the nomadic linguistic worldview has enabled to reconstruct mental mindsets and the worldview of the nomadic consciousness at the period of establishing the Altai languages, for instance, and at the early stages of its existence. Thus, the onomaseological method of studying onims as verbalized onomaconcepts has enabled to consider an onim as the ethnocultural and ethnohistorical text deciphered by reconstructing the semantic archetype and conceptual archiseme and thereby to justify the author's hypothesis for nomadic conceptosphere. The conceptual approach to the analysis of ethnonyms based on the corpse of appellative lexica of typologically non-related languages has enabled to reveal the diachronic Ural-Altai areal linguistic union within the territory under study, which allowed us to make a conclusion about some typologically similar phenomena in the languages related to different linguistic families - the Mongol and the Samoyed.

TI  - Combining GF-2 and Sentinel-2 Images to Detect Tree Mortality Caused by Red Turpentine Beetle during the Early Outbreak Stage in North China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the red turpentine beetle (RTB) (Dendroctonus valens LeConte) has invaded the northern regions of China. Due to the short invasion time, the outbreak of tree mortality corresponded to a low level of damage. Important information about tree mortality, provided by remote sensing at both single-tree and forest stand scale, is needed in forest management at the early stages of outbreak. In order to detect RTB-induced tree mortality at a single-tree scale, we evaluated the classification accuracies of Gaofen-2 (GF2) imagery at different spatial resolutions (1 and 4 m) using a pixel-based method. We also simultaneously applied an object-based method to 1 m pan-sharpened images. We used Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery with different resolutions (10 and 20 m) to detect RTB-induced tree mortality and compared their classification accuracies at a larger scale-the stand scale. Three kinds of machine learning algorithms-the classification and regression tree (CART), the random forest (RF), and the support vector machine (SVM)-were applied and compared in this study. The results showed that 1 m resolution GF2 images had the highest classification accuracy using the pixel-based method and SVM algorithm (overall accuracy = 77.7%). We found that the classification of three degrees of damage percentage within the S2 pixel (0%, <15%, and 15% < x < 50%) was not successful at a forest stand scale. However, 10 m resolution S2 images could acquire effective binary classification (<15%: overall accuracy = 74.9%; 15% < x < 50%: overall accuracy = 81.0%). Our results indicated that identifying tree mortality caused by RTB at a single-tree and forest stand scale was accomplished with the combination of GF2 and S2 images. Our results are very useful for the future exploration of the patterns of spatial and temporal changes in insect pest transmission at different spatial scales.

TI  - Coincidence Analysis of the Cropland Distribution of Multi-Sets of Global Land Cover Products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern global cropland products have been widely used to assess the impact of land use and cover change (LUCC) on carbon budgets, climate change, terrestrial ecosystems, etc. However, each product has its own uncertainty, and inconsistencies exist among different products. Understanding the reliability of these datasets is essential for knowing the uncertainties that exist in the study of global change impact forced by cropland reclamation. In this paper, we propose a set of coincidence assessments to identify where reliable cropland distribution is by overlaying ten widely used global land cover/cropland datasets around 2000 AD. A quantitative assessment for different spatial units is also performed. We further discuss the spatial distribution characteristics of different coincidence degrees and explain the reasons. The results show that the high-coincidence proportion is only 40.5% around the world, and the moderate-coincidence and low-coincidence proportion is 18.4% and 41.1%, respectively. The coincidence degrees among different continents and countries have large discrepancies. The coincidence is relatively higher in Europe, South Asia and North America, while it is very poor in Latin America and Africa. The spatial distribution of high and moderate coincidence roughly corresponds to the regions with suitable agricultural conditions and intensive reclamation. In addition to the random factors such as the product's quality and the year it represented, the low coincidence is mainly caused by the inconsistent land cover classification systems and the recognition capability of cropland pixels with low fractions in different products.

TI  - Geographical Variation and Influencing Factors of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> Expansion Rate in Coastal China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion poses a huge threat to ecological security. Spartina alterniflora was introduced into China in 1979, and its arrival corresponded with negative effects on native ecosystems. To explore geographical variation of its expansion rate in coastal China, we selected 43 S. alterniflora sites from Tianjin Coastal New Area to Beihai. The area expansion rate, expansion rate paralleling and vertical to the shoreline were analysed based on Landsat images and field survey in 2015. Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) and climate data were collected to statistically analyse the influential factors of expansion rate. Results showed that significant difference of S. alterniflora area expansion rate among different latitude zones (P < 0.01), increasing from 6.08% at southern (21 degrees N-23 degrees N) to 19.87% in Bohai Bay (37 degrees N-39 degrees N) along latitude gradient. There was a significant difference in expansion rate vertical to shoreline in different latitude zones (P < 0.01) with the largest occurring in Bohai Bay (256 m/yr, 37 degrees N-39 degrees N), and showed an decreasing tendency gradually from north to south. No significant difference and latitudinal clines in expansion rate paralleling to shoreline were observed. Expansion rate had significant negative correlation with mean seawater temperature, the lowest seawater temperature, current zonal velocity and meridional velocity and presented a reducing trend as these biotic factors increased; however, they were not significantly correlated with the highest seawater temperature and mean seawater salinity. We identified significant correlations between expansion rate and annual mean temperature, the lowest temperature in January and annual precipitation, but there was little correlation with annual diurnal difference in temperature and the highest temperature in July. The rapid expansion rate in high-latitude China demonstrated a higher risk of potential invasion in the north; dynamic monitoring and control management should be established as soon as possible.

TI  - Lake water and glacier mass gains in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau observed from multi-sensor remote sensing data: Implication of an enhanced hydrological cycle
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and glaciers are widely distributed in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. A synchronized examination of lake and glacier mass variations there has not previously been conducted, which has limited the understanding of the lake water balance and the hydrologic cycle in the region. In this study, we comprehensively examine lake area and volume, and glacier mass changes using multi-sensor satellite data. We find that lake expansion in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau was more robust from 1976 to 2018 when compared to other regions of the plateau, especially for the glacier-fed and endorheic lakes. Lake volume changes show that most of the lakes had an increase in water volume, particularly in 20002018 with a total water storage gain of similar to 28.6 Gt. By using high-resolution KH-9 and TanDEM-X data, we observe that the glacier surface elevation of the western Kunlun Mountains had a slight thinning rate of -0.07 +/- 0.16 m/yr in 1973-2000, but a positive rate of 0.002 +/- 0.003 m/yr in 2000-2018. The heterogeneous pattern of glacier elevation changes between the north (N) and south (S) slopes are revealed, i.e. -0.02 +/- 0.01 m/yr (N) against -0.12 +/- 0.03 m/yr (S) in 1973-2000 and - 0.05 +/- 0.02 m/yr (N) against 0.06 +/- 0.02 m/yr (S) in 2000-2018. Overall, the glaciers trend to a stable state (similar to 0.05 m/yr) in both the south slope of the western Kunlun Mountains and Aru Co regions between 2000 and 2018. Similar patterns are also found for basin-wide examinations of lake storage changes (mass gains) and glacier mass budgets (positive or close to stable). The seasonal snow cover area changes, derived from cloud-free MODIS snow cover products, present a variable and insignificant trend between 2003 and 2017. Snow depth derived from passive microwave remote-sensing data, exhibits a decreasing trend between 1979 and 2015, but the water equivalent could contribute only an insignificant amount to the observed lake changes. The lake water gains, and almost positive glacier mass balance imply that the hydrological cycle in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau has become enhanced.

TI  - Extracting Impervious Surface from Aerial Imagery Using Semi-Automatic Sampling and Spectral Stability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of impervious surface through remote sensing provides critical information for urban planning and environmental management. The acquisition of quality reference data and the selection of effective predictor variables are two factors that contribute to the low accuracies of impervious surface in urban remote sensing. A hybrid method was developed to improve the extraction of impervious surface from high-resolution aerial imagery. This method integrates ancillary datasets from OpenStreetMap, National Wetland Inventory, and National Cropland Data to generate training and validation samples in a semi-automatic manner, significantly reducing the effort of visual interpretation and manual labeling. Satellite-derived surface reflectance stability is incorporated to improve the separation of impervious surface from other land cover classes. This method was applied to 1-m National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery of three sites with different levels of land development and data availability. Results indicate improved extractions of impervious surface with user's accuracies ranging from 69% to 90% and producer's accuracies from 88% to 95%. The results were compared to the 30-m percent impervious surface data of the National Land Cover Database, demonstrating the potential of this method to validate and complement satellite-derived medium-resolution datasets of urban land cover and land use.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of drought in arid area in northwest China based on FY-3C and TRMM Data.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on soil moisture ( VSM), land surface temperature ( LST) data of FY -3C/ MWRI (microwave imager) and precipitation data of TRMM3B43 in the growing season ( April October) during 2015-2017, three indices of Precipitation Condition Index ( PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) were obtained through down scaling and normalization. The three indices were merged to establish a Microwave Integrated Drought Index ( MIDI), which was used to assess drought status in the arid regions of northwest China. The results showed that: (1) Temporally, drought occurred in the arid regions of Northwest China every year from 2015 to 2017, with the dominance of extreme drought and heavy drought. Spatially, drought events had obvious regional differentiation. The degree of drought increased from east to west, and the trend of change was slightly aggravated and then alleviated. (2) From the perspective of spatiotemporal evolution, 10.57% of area in the arid northwest China became wetter during 2015-2017, and 12.87% of the area became drier. Drought within a single year was continuously reduced from April to August, and continued to increase from August to October. ( 3) The MIDI index had a better detection effect than the single drought index on short-term drought in the study area. The correlation of MIDI index with Humidity Index was optimal, with a high actual agreement rate in space. Our results provide a basis for drought monitoring and related research using other microwave remote sensing data.

TI  - Identification of Seed Maize Fields With High Spatial Resolution and Multiple Spectral Remote Sensing Using Random Forest Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed maize and common maize plots have different planting patterns and variety types. Identification of seed maize is the basis for seed maize growth monitoring, seed quality and common maize seed supply. In this paper, a random forest (RF) classifier is used to develop an approach for seed maize fields' identification, using the time series vegetation indexes (VIs) calculated from multispectral data acquired from Landsat 8 and Gaofen 1 satellite (GF-1), field sample data, and texture features of Gaofen 2 satellite (GF-2) panchromatic data. Huocheng and Hutubi County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China were chosen as study area. The results show that RF performs well with the combination of six VIs (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), triangle vegetation index (TVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and difference vegetation index (DVI)) and texture features based on a grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The classification based on "spectrum + texture" information has higher overall, user and producer accuracies than that of spectral information alone. Using the "spectrum + texture" method, the overall accuracy of classification in Huocheng County is 95.90%, the Kappa coefficient is 0.92, and the producer accuracy for seed maize fields is 93.91%. The overall accuracy of the classification in Hutubi County is 97.79%, the Kappa coefficient is 0.95, and the producer accuracy for seed maize fields is 97.65%. Therefore, RF classifier inputted with high-resolution remote-sensing image features can distinguish two kinds of planting patterns (seed and common) and varieties types (inbred and hybrid) of maize and can be used to identify and map a wide range of seed maize fields. However, this method requires a large amount of sample data, so how to effectively use and improve it in areas lacking samples needs further research.

TI  - High-Frequency Glacial Lake Mapping Using Time Series of Sentinel-1A/1B SAR Imagery: An Assessment for the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are an important component of the cryosphere in the Tibetan Plateau. In response to climate warming, they threaten the downstream lives, ecological environment, and public infrastructures through outburst floods within a short time. Although most of the efforts have been made toward extracting glacial lake outlines and detect their changes with remotely sensed images, the temporal frequency and spatial resolution of glacial lake datasets are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed processes of glacial lake dynamics, especially for potentially dangerous glacial lakes with high-frequency variability. By using full time-series Sentinel-1A/1B imagery over a year, this study presents a new systematic method to extract the glacial lake outlines that have a fast variability in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau with a time interval of six days. Our approach was based on a level-set segmentation, combined with a median pixel composition of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering coefficients stacked as a regularization term, to robustly estimate the lake extent across the observed time range. The mapping results were validated against manually digitized lake outlines derived from Gaofen-2 panchromatic multi-spectral (GF-2 PMS) imagery, with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 96.54% and 0.95, respectively. In comparison with results from classical supervised support vector machine (SVM) and unsupervised Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA) methods, the proposed method proved to be much more robust and effective at detecting glacial lakes with irregular boundaries that have similar backscattering as the surroundings. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of time-series Sentinel-1A/1B SAR data in the continuous monitoring of glacial lake outline dynamics.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Urban Expansion Using Landsat Time Series Data and Assessment of Its Influences on Forests
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of urban land use dynamics is essential for assessing ecosystem functionalities and climate change impacts. The focus of this study is on monitoring the characteristics of urban expansion in Hang-Jia-Hu and evaluating its influences on forests by applying 30-m multispectral Landsat data and a machine learning algorithm. Firstly, remote sensed images were preprocessed with radiation calibration, atmospheric correction and topographic correction. Then, the C5.0 decision tree was used to establish classification trees and then applied to make land use maps. Finally, spatiotemporal changes were analyzed through dynamic degree and land use transfer matrix. In addition, average land use transfer probability matrix (ATPM) was utilized for the prediction of land use area in the next 20 years. The results show that: (1) C5.0 decision tree performed with precise accuracy in land use classification, with an average total accuracy and kappa coefficient of more than 90.04% and 0.87. (2) During the last 20 years, land use in Hang-Jia-Hu has changed extensively. Urban area expanded from 5.84% in 1995 to 21.32% in 2015, which has brought about enormous impacts on cultivated land, with 198,854 hectares becoming urban, followed by forests with 19,823 hectares. (3) Land use area prediction based on the ATPM revealed that urbanization will continue to expand at the expense of cultivated land, but the impact on the forests will be greater than the past two decades. Rationality of urban land structure distribution is important for economic and social development. Therefore, remotely sensed technology combined with machine learning algorithms is of great significance to the dynamic detection of resources in the process of urbanization.

TI  - Enhanced Delaunay Triangulation Sea Ice Tracking Algorithm with Combining Feature Tracking and Pattern Matching
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice drift detection has the key role of global climate analysis and waterway planning. The ability to detect sea ice drift in real-time also contributes to the safe navigation of ships and the prevention of offshore oil platform accidents. In this paper, an Enhanced Delaunay Triangulation (EDT) algorithm for sea ice tracking was proposed for dual-polarization sequential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which was implemented by combining feature tracking with pattern matching based on integrating HH and HV polarization feature information. A sea ice retrieval algorithm for feature detection, matching, fusion, and outlier detection was specifically developed to increase the system's accuracy and robustness. In comparison with several state-of-the-art sea ice drift retrieval algorithms, including Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) method, the results of the experiment provided compelling evidence that our algorithm had a higher accuracy than the SURF and ORB method. Furthermore, the results of our method were compared with the drift vector and direction of buoys data. The drift direction is consistent with buoys, and the velocity deviation was about 10 m. It was proved that this method can be applied effectively to the retrieval of sea ice drift.

TI  - A Novel Feature-Level Fusion Framework Using Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Images for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Classification in Cloudy Mountainous Area
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data plays an important role in classifying land use/land cover (LULC) information from various sensors having different spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions. The fusion of an optical image and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is significant for the study of LULC change and simulation in cloudy mountain areas. This paper proposes a novel feature-level fusion framework, in which the Landsat operational land imager (OLI) images with different cloud covers, and a fully polarized Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) image are selected to conduct LULC classification experiments. We take the karst mountain in Chongqing as a study area, following which the features of the spectrum, texture, and space of the optical and SAR images are extracted, respectively, supplemented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope and other relevant information. Furthermore, the fused feature image is subjected to object-oriented multi-scale segmentation, subsequently, an improved support vector machine (SVM) model is used to conduct the experiment. The results showed that the proposed framework has the advantages of multi-source data feature fusion, high classification performance and can be applied in mountain areas. The overall accuracy (OA) was more than 85%, with the Kappa coefficient values of 0.845. In terms of forest, gardenland, water, and artificial surfaces, the precision of fusion image was higher compared to single data source. In addition, ALOS-2 data have a comparative advantage in the extraction of shrubland, water, and artificial surfaces. This work aims to provide a reference for selecting the suitable data and methods for LULC classification in cloudy mountain areas. When in cloudy mountain areas, the fusion features of images should be preferred, during the period of low cloudiness, the Landsat OLI data should be selected, when no optical remote sensing data are available, and the fully polarized ALOS-2 data are an appropriate substitute.

TI  - A case study on Landscape Component Niche based on Landscape Pattern Indices: Yanchi, Ningxia Province, China
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yanchi County is located in the agro-pastoral ecotone and belongs to the ecologically fragile area of Northwest China. It is important to study the evolution of landscape pattern to curb its environmental degradation. In order to intuitively show how the landscape pattern of the study area changes over time, Landsat Thematic Mappers (TM) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data of 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2017 were used. This paper attempts to apply niche theories and methods into landscape ecology, and constructs a niche model of landscape components by using "n-dimentional hypervolume niche theory" and landscape pattern indices. By evaluating the spatial and temporal evolution of niche from the perspective of two-dimensional space to reflect the changes of landscape pattern in the study area over the past 26 years, new theories and methods were introduced for the characterization of landscape pattern. The results indicate that: 1) The larger the attribute and dominance value of landscape components, the higher the ecological niche and the stronger the control effect on the overall landscape. 2) The ecological niche of each landscape component was significantly different, just as its control effect on the overall landscape. 3) The dynamic change of the ecological niche of each landscape component was different, with grassland, unused land and arable land always in a high dominant position, although the ecological niche of construction land and water area was always low. In general, the introduction of niche theory into the landscape ecology provided a new method to study the changes in regional landscape pattern.

TI  - How Well Do Deep Learning-Based Methods for Land Cover Classification and Object Detection Perform on High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information plays an important role in mapping ecological and environmental changes in Earth's diverse landscapes for ecosystem monitoring. Remote sensing data have been widely used for the study of land cover, enabling efficient mapping of changes of the Earth surface from Space. Although the availability of high-resolution remote sensing imagery increases significantly every year, traditional land cover analysis approaches based on pixel and object levels are not optimal. Recent advancement in deep learning has achieved remarkable success on image recognition field and has shown potential in high spatial resolution remote sensing applications, including classification and object detection. In this paper, a comprehensive review on land cover classification and object detection approaches using high resolution imagery is provided. Through two case studies, we demonstrated the applications of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to high spatial resolution remote sensing data for land cover classification and object detection and evaluated their performances against traditional approaches. For a land cover classification task, the deep-learning-based methods provide an end-to-end solution by using both spatial and spectral information. They have shown better performance than the traditional pixel-based method, especially for the categories of different vegetation. For an objective detection task, the deep-learning-based object detection method achieved more than 98% accuracy in a large area; its high accuracy and efficiency could relieve the burden of the traditional, labour-intensive method. However, considering the diversity of remote sensing data, more training datasets are required in order to improve the generalisation and the robustness of deep learning-based models.

TI  - Reconstructing Six Decades of Surface Temperatures at a Shallow Lake
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) plays a fundamental role in the lake energy budget. However, direct observations of LSWT require considerable effort for acquisition and hence are rare relative to a large number of lakes. In lakes where LSWT has not been covered sufficiently by in situ measurements, remote sensing and lake modeling can be used to produce a fine spatio-temporal record of LSWTs. In our study, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSWT was used to compare with in situ data at the overpass times over the six sites in Lake Chaohu, a large shallow lake in China. MODIS-derived LSWT reflected the variation of lake surface temperature well, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 and a cool bias of 1.25 degrees C. The bias was modified by an "Upper Envelop" smoothing method and then employed to evaluate the general lake model (GLM) performance, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The GLM simulations showed good performance compared with MODIS LSWT data at an interannual time scale. A 57-year record of simulated LSWT was hindcast by the well-calibrated GLM for Lake Chaohu. The results showed that LSWT decreased by 0.08 degrees C/year from 1960 to 1981 and then increased by 0.05 degrees C/year. These trends were most likely caused by a cooling effect of decreased surface incident solar radiation and a warming effect of reduced wind speed. Our study promoted the use of MODIS-derived LSWT as an alternative data source, and then combined with a numerical model for inland water surface temperature, and also further provided an understanding of climate warming effect on such a shallow eutrophic lake. Key points: (1) Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) lake water surface temperature (LSWT) was validated with real-time in situ data collected at Lake Chaohu with high accuracy; (2) MODIS LSWT was modified by the bias correction and employed to evaluate a one-dimensional lake model at interannual and intraannual scale; The LSWT hindcast by a well-calibrated model at Lake Chaohu decreased by 0.08 degrees C/year from 1960 to 1981 and increased by 0.05 degrees C/year from 1982 to 2016.

TI  - Satellite-Based Operational Real-Time Drought Monitoring in the Transboundary Lancang-Mekong River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing gauging networks are sparse and not readily available in real-time over the transboundary Lancang-Mekong River (LMR) basin, making it difficult to accurately identify drought. In this study, we aimed to build an operational real-time Lancang-Mekong drought monitor (LMDM), through combining satellite real-time data and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model at a 0.25 degrees spatial resolution. Toward this, three VIC runs were conducted: (1) a 60-year (1951-2010) historical simulation driven by Princeton's global meteorological forcing (PGF) for yielding 'normal' conditions (PGF-VIC), wherein the VIC was calibrated with 20-year observed streamflow at six hydrological stations; (2) a short-period (2011-2014) simulation to bridge the gap between the historical and the real-time modeling; (3) the real-time (2015-present) simulation driven by bias-corrected satellite data, wherein the real-time soil moisture (SM) estimate was expressed as percentile (relative to the 'normal') for drought monitoring. Results show that VIC can successfully reproduce the observed hydrographs, with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency exceeding 0.70 and the relative bias mostly within 15%. Assessment on the performance of LMDM shows that the real-time SM estimates bear good spatial similarity to the reference, with the correlation coefficient beyond 0.80 across >70% of the domain. In terms of drought monitoring, the LMDM can reasonably reproduce the two recorded droughts, implying extreme droughts covering the Lower LMR during 2004/05 and widespread severe 2009/10 drought across the upper domain. The percentage drought area implied by the LMDM and the reference is close, corresponding to 66% and 60%, 43% and 40%, and 44% and 36% for each typical drought month. Since January 2015, the LMDM was running in an operational mode, from which the 2016 unprecedented drought was successfully identified in Mekong Delta. This study highlights the LMDM's capability for reliable real-time drought monitoring, which can serve as a valuable drought early warning prototype for other data-poor regions.

TI  - Characteristics of Coastline Changes on Southeast Asia Islands from 2000 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The future of islands has been the subject of international concern, scientific debate and media interest in the last decade. As a result of global warming and sea level rise, increasingly more research and speculations about the morphology and positions of island coastlines have been produced. However, some assumptions are not well documented due to the lack of large-scale research and data support. This paper contributes to filling this gap by extracting and assessing coastline changes on Southeast Asian islands overall during 2000-2015 based on Landsat remote sensing images. The results are as follows: ? the coastline, defined by the mean high water line (MHWL), of Southeast Asia remained relatively stable but showed considerable variability in space, especially in estuaries, bays and straits. ? A total of 9035 islands were extracted, among which approximately 10% of islands witnessed locational changes in coastlines, resulting in net reductions of nearly 86 km(2) in area and 50,000 km in centroid displacement. Additionally, the coastline length increased by 532 km from 2000 (148,508 km) to 2015 (149,040 km). Natural coastlines decreased by 2503 km, while artificial coastlines increased by 3035 km. Among the total coastlines, 11% changed: 5% exhibited deposition, while 6% experienced retreat. ? The temporal and spatial changes in coastlines were the result of interactions between natural processes and human activities. Climatic and environmental changes had wide impacts, while human activities caused more dramatic local changes. In addition, the sizes, shapes and landforms of the islands played significant roles in coastline changes. ? Coastal erosion and expansion often coexisted in dynamic equilibrium under the influence of coastal hydrodynamics, such as cyclical tides and near-shore sediment transport. Our findings reveal spatial-temporal variations in island coastlines in Southeast Asia from 2000-2015 and provide critical information for the current study of islands. This work has great significance for the study of global climate change impacts and the integrated management of island coastal zones.

TI  - Glacier Variations at Xinqingfeng and Malan Ice Caps in the Inner Tibetan Plateau Since 1970
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inner Tibetan Plateau is a glacierized region where glaciers show heterogeneous change. The Xinqingfeng and Malan ice caps are located in this region, and a transition zone exists with shifting influences between the westerlies and Indian summer monsoon. However, there is a lack of detailed information regarding glacier area and mass changes in this region before 2000. In the present study, we describe an integrated view of the glacier area and its mass changes for Mt. Xinqingfeng and Mt. Malan as derived from topographic maps, Landsat, ASTER, SRTM DEM, and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X from 1970 to 2012 and from 1970 to 2018, respectively. Our results show that the glaciers experienced a slight shrinkage in area by 0.09 +/- 0.03% a(-1) from 1970 to 2018 with a median mass loss rate of 0.22 +/- 0.17 m w.e. a(-1) and 0.29 +/- 0.17 m w.e. a(-1) between 1999 and 2012 at Mt. Xinqingfeng and Mt. Malan, respectively. The glaciers of Mt. Malan had a total mass loss of 0.19 +/- 0.14 m w.e. a(-1) during the period 1970-1999. A minimum of seven glaciers at Mt. Xinqingfeng and Mt. Malan showed heterogeneous variations with either surging or advancing during the observation period. Among them, the West Monuomaha Glacier, Monuomaha Glacier, and Zu Glacier were identified as surging glaciers, and the others may also be surging glaciers, although more evidence is required. These glaciers showed a long active period and low velocities. Therefore, we suggested that thermal controls are important for surge initiation and recession.

TI  - A novel noise reduction method for space-borne full waveforms based on empirical mode decomposition
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - In this project, a novel noise reduction method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), referred to as EMD-AdaptiveP, is proposed and investigated with the expectation of providing an effective enhancement for the full waveform of nonlinear and nonstationary signals obtained by space-borne laser altimetry and the forthcoming GaoFen-7 (GF-7) mapping satellite in China. This method combines EMD with a similar strategy of wavelet filtering to adapt to the characteristics of each waveform. The reconstruction of an effective waveform signal is implemented through reverse superimposition of its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and the residual, which is thresholded by the three-sigma principle of background noise of the waveform signal and an additional check mechanism in the lower or higher signal of noise levels, after the waveform is decomposed by EMD. This method is qualitatively and quantitatively examined with simulated waveform data, real ice, cloud and land elevation satellite (ICESat)/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) waveforms and GF-7 proto-waveform data, in contrast with other IMF selection schemes, like EMD-soft, EMD-hard and EMD-Wavelet, or the traditional filtering methods, such as Gaussian, mu\lambda and wavelet. The results show that the method of EMD-AdaptiveP (1) is sufficiently robust to denoise the waveform signal with different levels of signal-to-noise ratio, (2) has the adaptive ability to distinguish effective signal IMFs from noise IMFs in signal reconstruction, and (3) performs noise reduction more effectively than traditional methods.

TI  - The Global Distribution of Cirrus Clouds Reflectance Based on MODIS Level-3 Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus clouds are crucially important to weather, climate and earth energy balance studies. The distribution of cirrus reflectance with latitude and season is an interesting topic in atmospheric sciences. The monthly mean Level-3 MODIS cirrus reflectance is used to analyze the global distribution of cirrus clouds, which covers a period from 1 March 2000 to 28 February 2018. The latitude, from 90 degrees S to 90 degrees N, is divided into 36 latitude zones with 5 degrees interval. Data in each latitude zone are analyzed. The research results show that the slopes of cirrus reflectance variation in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere are -1.253 x 10(-4)/year and -1.297 x 10(-4)/year, respectively. The yearly-average cirrus reflectance reveals strong negative correlation with time in the Northern Hemisphere, i.e., the correlation coefficient is -0.761. Then the statistical analysis of cirrus reflectance is performed in different seasons, the results show that cirrus reflectance varies obviously with seasonal change. Additionally, for the [30 degrees, 90 degrees] latitude regions, cirrus reflectance reaches the minimum in summer and the maximum in winter in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere.

TI  - Assessment of biomass and yield loss of maize caused by aerosols in heavily polluted agricultural areas of China based on APSIM model
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid economic growth, the government and the public pay more and more attention to the environmental effects caused by aerosols. In this study, the effects of aerosols on the biomass and yield of maize from 2001 to 2014 in heavily polluted agricultural areas of China were explored using global AErosol Robotic Network (AERONET) monitoring data, the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum radiative transfer (6S) model, and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop growth model. Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations were selected as research areas. The results showed that the APSIM-maize model was able to accurately simulate the interactions between maize and the climatic constraints in the maize planting areas at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations. Our results revealed that the aerosols reduced direct solar radiation, and that the decreasing trend was mainly due to the net radiation flux caused by aerosols. The average total radiation from 2001 to 2014 at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations decreased by 31.95%, 14.74%, and 28.30%, respectively, and the average maize biomass decreased by 34.12%, 20.78%, and 28.41%, respectively. As a result, the average maize yield at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations declined by 28.44%, 13.43%, and 14.89%, respectively. Our findings, particularly the understanding of the effect of aerosols on crop production, will have important implications for improving climate change impact studies and helping local agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change. They could also benefit strategic decision-making related to future agricultural adaptation methods in China.

TI  - Recognition of Water Colour Anomaly by Using Hue Angle and Sentinel 2 Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As polluted water bodies are often small in area and widely distributed, performing artificial field screening is difficult; however, remote-sensing-based screening has the advantages of being rapid, large-scale, and dynamic. Polluted water bodies often show anomalous water colours, such as black, grey, and red. Therefore, the large-scale recognition of suspected polluted water bodies through high-resolution remote-sensing images and water colour can improve the screening efficiency and narrow the screening scope. However, few studies have been conducted on such kinds of water bodies. The hue angle of a water body is a parameter used to describe colour in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) colour space. Based on the measured data, the water body with a hue angle greater than 230.958 degrees is defined as a water colour anomaly, which is recognised based on the Sentinel-2 image through the threshold set in this study. The results showed that the hue angle of the water body was extracted from the Sentinel-2 image, and the accuracy of the hue angle calculated by the in situ remote-sensing reflectance R-rs (lambda) was evaluated, where the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) were 4.397 degrees and 1.744%, respectively, proving that this method is feasible. The hue angle was calculated for a water colour anomaly and a general water body in Qiqihar. The water body was regarded as a water colour anomaly when the hue angle was >230.958 degrees and as a general water body when the hue angle was <= 230.958 degrees. High-quality Sentinel-2 images of Qiqihar taken from May 2016 to August 2019 were chosen, and the position of the water body remained unchanged; there was no error or omission, and the hue angle of the water colour anomaly changed obviously, indicating that this method had good stability. Additionally, the method proposed is only suitable for optical deep water, not for optical shallow water. When this method was applied to Xiong'an New Area, the results showed good recognition accuracy, demonstrating good universality of this method. In this study, taking Qiqihar as an example, a surface survey experiment was conducted from October 14 to 15, 2018, and the measured data of six general and four anomalous water sample points were obtained, including water quality terms such as R-rs (lambda), transparency, water colour, water temperature, and turbidity.

TI  - Linkages Between Phytoplankton and Bottom Oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary cause of coastal hypoxia is generally attributed to phytoplankton blooms and their subsequent benthic decay. However, direct linkages between phytoplankton and hypoxia have been rarely reported. Here using satellite and field data, we show that such linkages exist in the Chesapeake Bay. For deeper (>10 m) but nonhypoxic stations, bottom dissolved oxygen is significantly correlated with surface algal biomass during the preceding weeks. Optimal correlation exhibits a bimodal seasonal variation with two peaks in April and August, respectively. Significant particulate dislocation effect is also observed: In April, May, August, and September when water column is stratified, the most significant influencer of bottom oxygen is attributable to phytoplankton blooms located down-estuary; during destratified months of October and November, however, the dislocation effect switches to the opposite direction, that is, phytoplankton from up-estuary have the biggest impact. We also notice enhanced phytoplankton growth posterior to lower bottom oxygen, and the strongest correlation is during summer when release of recycled ammonium and hypoxia-induced phosphate is the most intense. These results demonstrate that the decay of phytoplankton exerts a significant impact on bottom oxygen and releases ammonium which sustains further bloom, whereas hypoxia promotes phytoplankton growth by enhancing the efficiency of phosphate recycling. Importantly, the capability of using satellite data to capture these linkages has significant ramifications for improving hypoxia forecasts in coastal systems. It essentially provides a way to characterize and constrain changes in bottom oxygen demand.

TI  - Land Subsidence Related to Coal Mining in China Revealed by L-Band InSAR Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological disasters, including ground deformation, fractures and collapse, are serious problems in coal mining regions, which have threatened the sustainable development for local industry. The Ordos Basin is most known for its abundant coal resources. Over-mining the underground coal resources had induced land deformation. Detecting the evolution of the land deformation features and identifying the potential risk are important for decision-makers to prevent geological disasters. We analyzed land subsidence induced by coal mining in a 200 <mml:semantics>km2</mml:semantics> area in the Ordos Basin for the time period 2006-2015. ALOS-1 PALSAR images from December 2006 to January 2011 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images from December 2014 to July 2015, optical remotely sensed images and coal mining information were collected. The small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) method and differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) method, GIS and statistical analysis were adopted. Results show that the maximum subsidence rate and cumulative subsidence along the line of sight (LOS) were -65 mm/year and -246 mm, respectively, from December 2006 to January 2011. The maximum cumulative subsidence was -226 mm from December 2014 to July 2015. The new boundary of the mining goafs from 2014 to 2015 and the most dangerous risk region were mapped. Moreover, the effect of large-scale mining coal, with the production volume exceeds 1.2 million tons per year, with the operation time more than 20 years on land subsidence was found greater than small and medium-scale coal mines and reached -59 mm/year. The recently established small-sized and medium-sized coal mines show high land subsidence. This study will contribute to better understand the land subsidence process in mining region and provide scientific support for government to prevent land subsidence.

TI  - Fire monitoring based on FY-3D/MERSI-II far-infrared data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-3D/MERSI-II polar orbiting meteorological satellite has 250 m resolution in 10.8 and 12 mu m wavelengths of far-infrared channels,which provide more abundant data sources for fire monitoring. The characteristics of fire monitoring in FY-3D/MERSI-II 10.8 mu m far-infrared channel were studied. Although 10.8 mu m far-infrared channel is far less sensitive than FY-3D/MERSI-II's 3.8 mu m mid-infrared channel in the spectral aspect to high-temperature heat source detection,its spatial resolution is 4 times higher than that of 1 km mid-infrared channel,so it can clearly reflect larger fire points,and its fire detection ability is better than that of 1 km resolution far-infrared channel. There has been a marked improvement. Using mixed pixel linear spectral separation method,the brightness temperature increment caused by the open fire area with an average temperature of 750 K and an area of 400 m(2) in far infrared channel pixels at 1 km resolution is about 0.47 K,while that caused by the same fire condition in far infrared channel pixels at 250 m resolution is about 7.30 K,which is quite different from the brightness temperature of surrounding background pixels. The fire location accuracy can be improved from kilometer level to hundreds meter level by using 1 km resolution mid-infrared channel to identify the fire range and 250 m resolution far-infrared channel to further determine the open fire area. Based on the method proposed in this paper,an example of forest and grassland fire application is analyzed. The location of fire point determined by 250 m resolution far-infrared channel is in good agreement with the field investigation information,which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. Several application examples showed that the FY-3D/MERSI far-infrared channel has obvious advantages over the mid-infrared channel in reflecting the location of the intense fire area and the distribution of the open fire line of grassland fire in large-scale fire field. It can reflect the spatial distribution of wildfire more accurately,so it has application value in fire monitoring.

TI  - Application and Evaluation of the Gaofen-3 Satellite on a Terrain Survey with InSAR Technology
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-3 satellite is the first SAR satellite independently developed in China that achieves interferometric imaging and measurement, which improves upon Chinese civil SAR satellite data. To verify the ability of the Gaofen-3 satellite's InSAR technology, we acquired data from Dengfeng, China, to evaluate the application and accuracy of an InSAR terrain survey. To reduce the effects introduced by data processing of Gaofen-3 data, high-accuracy InSAR image pair co-registration and phase filtering methods were adopted. Six GCPs data and 1:2000-scale DEM data were used to evaluate the elevation accuracy. In addition, for comparison with other satellites, we processed the dataset of the same area acquired by the non-civilian Yaogan-29 satellite with the same methods and evaluated the results. The experimental results indicated that the interferometric data of the Gaofen-3 satellite can achieve an accuracy of higher than 4 m of interferometric height measurement. Therefore, it will have broad prospects in the domestic InSAR application. Our research provides a certain value for the reference of the development of InSAR sensors in China.

TI  - An Atmospheric Correction Method over Bright and Stable Surfaces for Moderate to High Spatial-Resolution Optical Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many attempts have been made, it has remained a challenge to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from moderate to high spatial-resolution (MHSR) optical remotely sensed imagery in arid areas with bright surfaces, such as deserts and bare ground. Atmospheric correction for remote-sensing images in these areas has not been good. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm that can effectively estimate the spatial distribution of atmospheric aerosols and retrieve surface reflectance from moderate to high spatial-resolution imagery in arid areas with bright surfaces. Land surface in arid areas is usually bright and stable and the variation of atmosphere in these areas is also very small; consequently, the land-surface characteristics, specifically the bidirectional reflectance distribution factor (BRDF), can be retrieved easily and accurately using time series of satellite images with relatively lower spatial resolution like the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with 500 m resolution and the retrieved BRDF is then used to retrieve the AOD from MHSR images. This algorithm has three advantages: (i) it is well suited to arid areas with bright surfaces; (ii) it is very efficient because of employed lower resolution BRDF; and (iii) it is completely automatic. The derived AODs from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Gao Fen 1 Wide Field Viewer (GF-1/WFV), Gao Fen 6 Wide Field Viewer (GF-6/WFV), and Huan Jing 1 CCD (HJ-1/CCD) data are validated using ground measurements from 4 stations of the AErosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) around the world.

TI  - Satellite-ground integrated destriping network: A new perspective for EO-1 Hyperion and Chinese hyperspectral satellite datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - From the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer to the newly launched Chinese satellite hyperspectral imagers, stripe noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon that seriously degrades the data quality and usability. Although previous efforts have achieved inspiring results, hyperspectral image (HSI) destriping remains a challenging task, as the stripe degradations are sometimes more complicated than the predefined assumptions, i.e., the preselected reference, filter, or handcrafted priors. With the rapid advances in deep learning technologies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a new potential to learn essential priors in an automatic manner. However, the training of CNNs is highly reliant on a large high-quality standard dataset, which is difficult to acquire for hyperspectral spaceborne sensors. In this paper, an innovative approach termed the satellite-ground integrated destriping network (SGIDN) is proposed for HSIs. Rather than using self-training, a satellite-ground integrated strategy is proposed, for the first time, to mitigate the data dependency, so that a large set of striped-clean pairs is generated from the ground-based HSIs. Considering the varied stripes among different bands, a unique CNN architecture design, including the combination of 3D convolution and 2D convolution, residual learning, and supplementary gradient channels, is integrated to capture the intrinsic spectral-spatial features in the HSIs and the unidirectional property of stripe noise. Compared with the traditional methods, SGIDN can be flexibly extended to specific HSI destriping tasks, e.g., coexisting horizontal and vertical stripes, and generalizes well to different hyperspectral satellite sensors. Given the same study area (Shanghai, China), three HSIs acquired by the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer, the Chinese HJ-1A HSI sensor, and the wide-range hyperspectral imager onboard the Chinese SPARK spectral micro-nano satellite are adopted to assess the proposed SGIDN model. Both simulated and real-data experiments confirm that SGIDN can consistently outperform the benchmark methods, with a higher degree of efficiency. Moreover, the land-cover mapping results further demonstrate the necessity of destriping and the suitability of the destriped results for use in further applications.

TI  - Evaluation of Evapotranspiration for Exorheic Catchments of China during the GRACE Era: From a Water Balance Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is usually difficult to estimate at the regional scale due to scarce direct measurements. This study uses the water balance equation to calculate the regional ET with observations of precipitation, runoff, and terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) in nine exorheic catchments of China. We compared the regional ET estimates from a water balance perspective with and without considering TWSC (ETWB: ET estimates with considering TWSC, and ETPQ: ET estimates from precipitation minus runoff without considering TWSC). Results show that the regional annual ET ranges from 417.7 mm/yr to 831.5 mm/yr in the nine exorheic catchments based on the water balance equation. The impact of ignoring TWSC on calculating ET is notable, as the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of annual ET between ETWB and ETPQ range from 12.0-105.8 mm/yr (2.6-12.7% in corresponding annual ET) among the exorheic catchments. We also compared the estimated regional ET with other ET products. Different precipitation products are assessed to explain the inconsistency between different ET products and regional ET from a water balance perspective. The RMSEs between ET estimates from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and ET from land surface models can be reduced if the deviation of precipitation forcing data is considered. ET estimates from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) can be improved by reducing the uncertainty of precipitation forcing data in three semiarid catchments. This study emphasizes the importance of considering TWSC when calculating the regional ET using a water balance equation and provides more accurate ET estimates to help improve modeled ET results.

TI  - Land Subsidence Response to Different Land Use Types and Water Resource Utilization in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term overexploitation of groundwater leads to serious land subsidence and threatens the safety of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH). In this paper, an interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) with small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique was used to derive the land subsidence in a typical BTH area from 2012 to 2018 with 126 Radarsat-2 and 184 Sentinel-1 images. The analysis reveals that the average subsidence rate reached 118 mm/year from 2012 to 2018. Eleven subsidence features were identified: Shangzhuang, Beijing Airport, Jinzhan and Heizhuanghu in Beijing, Guangyang and Shengfang in Langfang, Wangqingtuo in Tianjin, Dongguang in Cangzhou, Jingxian and Zaoqiang in Hengshui and Julu in Xingtai. Comparing the different types of land use in subsidence feature areas, the results show that when the land-use type is relatively more complex and superimposed with residential, industrial and agricultural land, the land subsidence is relatively more significant. Moreover, the land subsidence development patterns are different in the BTH areas because of the different methods adopted for their water resource development and utilization, with an imbalance in their economic development levels. Finally, we found that the subsidence changes are consistent with groundwater level changes and there is a lag period between land subsidence and groundwater level changes of approximately two months in Beijing Airport, Jinzhan, Jingxian and Zaoqiang, of three months in Shangzhuang, Heizhuanghu, Guangyang, Wangqingtuo and Dongguang and of four months in Shengfang.

TI  - Training Data Selection for Annual Land Cover Classification for the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) Initiative
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey's Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative involves detecting changes in land cover, use, and condition with the goal of producing land change information to improve the understanding of the Earth system and provide insights on the impacts of land surface change on society. The change detection method ingests all available high-quality data from the Landsat archive in a time series approach to identify the timing and location of land surface change. Annual thematic land cover maps are then produced by classifying time series models. In this paper, we describe the optimization of the classification method used to derive the thematic land cover product. We investigated the influences of auxiliary data, sample size, and training from different sources such as the U.S. Geological Survey's Land Cover Trends project and National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2011). The results were evaluated and validated based on independent data from the training dataset. We found that refining the auxiliary data effectively reduced artifacts in the thematic land cover map that are related to data availability. We improved the classification accuracy and stability considerably by using a total of 20 million training pixels with a minimum of 600,000 and a maximum of 8 million training pixels per class within geographic windows consisting of nine Analysis Ready Data tiles (450 by 450 km(2)). Comparisons revealed that the NLCD 2001 training data delivered the best classification accuracy. Compared to the original LCMAP classification strategy used for early evaluation (e.g., Trends training data, 20,000 samples), the optimized classification strategy improved the annual land cover map accuracy by an average of 10%.

TI  - Assessment of bidirectional reflectance effects on desert and forest for radiometric cross-calibration of satellite sensors
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-calibration is a wildly used approach to radiometrically calibrate satellite sensors to meet uncertainty requirements. However, its accuracy is greatly influenced by bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. To understand such influences, we analyzed the long-term BRDF characteristics of two commonly used cross-calibration targets (`bright' desert and 'dark' forest) using long-term (2002 - 2016) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF products. BRDF characteristics derived by MODIS observations of both land cover types had 365-day cycles. Furthermore, both solar and sensor zenith angles showed more influence on BRDF than relative azimuth angles, and BRDF variations were approximately 10 times sensitive when solar or sensor zenith angles surpassed the boundary of 75 degrees, which is therefore not recommended for selecting image pairs between target and reference satellite sensors for cross-calibration. Due to cloud cover, three prevailing interpolation methods (nearest, linear, and spline interpolation) were also assessed in their capacity to fill temporally missing BRDF products. Linear interpolation was preferred when valid MODIS scenes were more than two in five days, while nearest interpolation outperformed the other two methods for no more than two valid MODIS scenes in five days. In addition, BRDF look up tables (LUTs) were established for radiometrically cross-calibrating satellite sensors when BRDF products were unavailable. The LUTs were further validated with Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance simulated by the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum model (6S) with BRDF effects corrected using the BRDF LUTs and MODIS BRDF products for typical geometries at two sites. High consistency was achieved with mean biases less than 0.3%, which suggests that BRDF LUTs could be used as alternatives when BRDF products are unavailable. These results provide guidelines to improve the accuracy of cross-calibration including image-matchup selecting criteria, efficient BRDF effect removal, and selection of potential calibration sites.

TI  - Effects of changing spatial extent on the relationship between urban forest patterns and land surface temperature
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of spatial pattern of urban greenspace on land surface temperature (LST) have been extensively documented. Previous studies have confirmed that the relationship between urban green spatial pattern and LST is sensitive to spatial resolution and remote sensing imagery with higher resolution could be more accurate on quantifying the urban green patterns, but little is known about another scaling issue- spatial extent. This paper examined whether the spatial extent applied to derive landscape metrics affect the relationship between LST and spatial pattern of urban forested areas of highly urbanized Shanghai and the seasonal variations using correlation analyses and regression analyses. Spatial pattern of forested areas was measured with eight class-level landscape metrics over four spatial extents/scales (90 m x 90 m, 180 m x 180 m, 360 m x 360 m and 720 m x 720 m) using moving-window approach based on a land-use and land cover (LULC) map derived from SPOT 6 datasets. Results demonstrated that changing spatial extent had significant impacts on the relationship between spatial pattern of urban forested areas and LST. The responses of correlations between spatial pattern metrics and LST to changing extent fell into three categories: correlation decreases with extent increases, correlation increases with extent increases and unpredictable pattern. In general, the amount of forested cover accounts for greater variability in LST than its spatial arrangement. This study extended our scientific understanding of the effects of spatial pattern of urban forested area on LST. In addition, it can provide insights for urban forest planning and management.

TI  - Temperature and Humidity Profiles Retrieval in a Plain Area from Fengyun-3D/HIRAS Sensor Using a 1D-VAR Assimilation Scheme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a one-dimensional variational (1D-VAR) retrieval system is proposed to simultaneously retrieve temperature and humidity atmospheric profiles under clear-sky conditions. Our technique requires observations from the Fengyun-3D Hyperspectral Infrared Radiation Atmospheric Sounding (HIRAS) satellite combined with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. In the method, the radiative transfer for the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS (RTTOV) model is also used as a forward observation operator. The accuracy of our approach was evaluated using as a case study the region of Beijing in China. Predicted temperature and humidity profiles were compared against ERA-Interim data, which was used as reference. Mean bias (MB) of the temperature profiles varied between -0.8 K to 0.9 K, while the root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.5 K to 2.6 K. In the boundary layer, the 1D-VAR algorithm performed better compared with the first guess. In the middle troposphere, the retrievals were more dependent on the first guess. With respect to relative humidity predictions, the accuracy of the evaluation of the whole troposphere was improved with the inclusion of the satellite observations, reporting an MB varying from -5.68% to 2.83%. Compared with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder's (AIRS') products, our predicted temperature profiles showed a very good consistency and the humidity predictions were also of an acceptable prediction accuracy. All in all, results clearly evidenced the promising potential of our proposed approach for retrieving temperature and humidity profiles under clear-sky conditions.

TI  - Geometric Accuracy Improvement Method for High-Resolution Optical Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery Combining Multi-Temporal SAR Imagery and GLAS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the widespread availability of satellite data, a single region can be described using multi-source and multi-temporal remote sensing data, such as high-resolution (HR) optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and space-borne laser altimetry data. These have become the main source of data for geopositioning. However, due to the limitation of the direct geometric accuracy of HR optical imagery and the effect of the small intersection angle of HR optical imagery in stereo pair orientation, the geometric accuracy of HR optical imagery cannot meet the requirements for geopositioning without ground control points (GCPs), especially in uninhabited areas, such as forests, plateaus, or deserts. Without satellite attitude error, SAR usually provides higher geometric accuracy than optical satellites. Space-borne laser altimetry technology can collect global laser footprints with high altitude accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a geometric accuracy improvement method for HR optical satellite remote sensing imagery combining multi-temporal SAR Imagery and GLAS data without GCPs. Based on the imaging mechanism, the differences in the weight matrix determination of the HR optical imagery and SAR imagery were analyzed. The laser altimetry data with high altitude accuracy were selected and applied as height control point in combined geopositioning. To validate the combined geopositioning approach, GaoFen2 (GF2) optical imagery, GaoFen6 (GF6) optical imagery, GaoFen3 (GF3) SAR imagery, and the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) footprint were tested. The experimental results show that the proposed model can be effectively applied to combined geopositioning to improve the geometric accuracy of HR optical imagery. Moreover, we found that the distribution and weight matrix determination of SAR images and the distribution of GLAS footprints are the crucial factors influencing geometric accuracy. Combined geopositioning using multi-source remote sensing data can achieve a plane accuracy of 1.587 m and an altitude accuracy of 1.985 m, which is similar to the geometric accuracy of geopositioning of GF2 with GCPs.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Biomass in Beijing (China) Using Multisource Remote Sensing and Forest Inventory Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass reflects the material cycle of forest ecosystems and is an important index to measure changes in forest structure and function. The accurate estimation of forest biomass is the research basis for measuring carbon storage in forest systems, and it is important to better understand the carbon cycle and improve the efficiency of forest policy and management activities. In this study, to achieve an accurate estimation of meso-scale (regional) forest biomass, we used Ninth Beijing Forest Inventory data (FID), Landsat 8 OLI Image data and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data to establish different forest types (coniferous forest, mixed forest, and broadleaf forest) of biomass models in Beijing. We assessed the potential of forest inventory, optical (Landsat 8 OLI) and radar (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) data in estimating and mapping forest biomass. From these data, a wide range of parameters related to forest structure were obtained. Random forest (RF) models were established using these parameters and compared with traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Forest biomass in Beijing was then estimated. The results showed the following: (1) forest inventory data combined with multisource remote sensing data can better fit forest biomass than forest inventory data alone. Among the three forest types, mixed forest has the best fitting model. Forest inventory variables and multisource remote sensing variables can match each other in time and space, capturing almost all spatial variability. (2) The 2016 forest biomass density in Beijing was estimated to be 52.26 Mg ha(-1) and ranged from 19.1381-195.66 Mg ha(-1). The areas with high biomass were mainly distributed in the north and southwest of Beijing, while the areas with low biomass were mainly distributed in the southeast and central areas of Beijing. (3) The estimates from the RF model are better than those from the MLR model, showing a high R2 and a low root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 values of the MLR models of three forest types were greater than 0.5, and RMSEs were less than 15.5 Mg ha(-1), The R2 values of the RF models were higher than 0.6, and the RMSEs were lower than 13.5 Mg ha(-1). We conclude that the methods in this paper can help improve the accurate estimation of regional biomass and provide a basis for the planning of relevant forestry decision-making departments.

TI  - Raw Signal Simulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter Over Complex Terrain Surfaces
T2  - RADIO SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In comparison with the conventional radar altimeter, synthetic aperture radar altimeter (SRAL) is developed with better along-track spatial resolution and height precision. When SRAL improves the performance of height measurement, it also complicates the radar system designing, signal processing, data analyzing, and system testing. The SRAL raw signal is the result of the interaction between the transmitted signal and the complex terrain surfaces. Generally, the SRAL is used in ocean applications since the PDF can be derived from different ocean surfaces. However, the actual acquired SRAL waveforms can be from complex and variable surface, which may include mountains, cities, forests, lakes, and other types of terrain surfaces. These waveforms contain information about the surfaces of the Earth although difficult to analyze. This paper focuses on the study of the raw signal simulation of SRAL for complex terrain surfaces including land surfaces. The principle of radar altimeter, the electromagnetic characteristics of land targets, and the SRAL signal processing are analyzed. The geometric models are extracted from digital elevation model, and the scattering characteristics of the terrain surface are established with three scattering models. Finally, three cases of terrain surfaces, namely, ice surface, mountain area, and urban area, are simulated and validated against actual SRAL signals measured by the Sentinel-3 SRAL sensor.Plain Language Summary This is a preliminary study on the raw signal simulation approach to extend SRAL from ocean to complex terrain applications, helping to dig out the underlying information from SRAL echo with the forward modeling of SRAL raw signal over complex terrain surfaces. Started with the SRAL working principle and the radio transmission principles, we propose a forward modeling approach to simulate the SRAL raw signal with geophysical data, scattering model, and mapping and projection algorithm. Such approach establishes the simulation of SRAL detection and processing from the most basic radar principle and target scattering characteristics. Most importantly, this study can help us to discover and use the information hidden in the SRAL echo.

TI  - Assessing the Response of Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency to Drought During and after Drought Events across Central Asia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and intensity of drought are expected to increase worldwide in the future. However, it is still unclear how ecosystems respond to drought. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is an essential ecological index used to measure the global carbon-water cycles, and is defined as the carbon absorbed per unit of water lost by the ecosystem. In this study, we applied gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to calculate the WUE and drought index (temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI)), all of which were retrieved from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We compared the mean WUE across different vegetation types, drought classifications, and countries. The temporal and spatial changes in WUE and drought were analyzed. The correlation between drought and WUE was calculated and compared across different vegetation types, and the differences in WUE between drought and post-drought periods were compared. The results showed that (1) ecosystems with a low (high) productivity had a high (low) WUE, and the mean ecosystem WUE of Central Asia showed vast differences across various drought levels, countries, and vegetation types. (2) The WUE in Central Asia exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2014, and Central Asia experienced both drought (from 2000 to 2010) and post-drought (from 2011 to 2014) periods. (3) The WUE showed a negative correlation with drought during the drought period, and an obvious drought legacy effect was found, in which severe drought affected the ecosystem WUE over the following two years, while a positive correlation between WUE and drought was found in the post-drought period. (4) A significant increase in ecosystem WUE was found after drought, which revealed that arid ecosystems exhibit high resilience to drought stress. Our results can provide a specific reference for understanding how ecosystems will respond to climate change.

TI  - BDNF is obverse to oxidative stress (adenosine deaminase and nitric oxide) in type II diabetes mellitus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIABETES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The relational analysis of adenosine deaminase (ADA), nitric oxide (NO), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and TP (total protein) is accomplished by comparing these parameters with glucose levels of healthy and type II diabetes mellitus people. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with impairment in many domains of cognitive function which may result from reduced BDNF. ADA is an important enzyme that plays a relevant role in purine and DNA metabolism, immune responses, and peptidase activity and for modulating the bioactivity of insulin. Nitric oxide is associated with loss of normal cellular function and increases the generation of nitric oxide synthetase products like nitroxyl (NO-), peroxynitrite (OONO-), and S-nitrosothiol (RSNO). Method In our study, a group of one hundred adult patients of either sex who had a history of not less than 6 years of diabetes mellitus and an equal number of healthy non-diabetics was selected as controls, respectively. Results The results of the parameters were analyzed using the SISA software and the correlation between the parameters was retrieved and represented graphically. A significant increase in adenosine deaminase activity and nitric oxide levels was observed in diabetic subjects when compared with that in controls. A significant decrease in total protein concentration and BDNF was observed in diabetic subjects when compared with that in controls. The results suggest that the increase in the glucose level has contributed to an increase in the inflammation factor ADA and oxidative stress factor NO and decrease in the total proteins especially BDNF, a neuron sentinel.

TI  - Estimating urban growth in peri-urban areas and its interrelationships with built-up density using earth observation datasets
T2  - ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the complex nature of urban dynamics, especially in the fast-growing cities of developing countries, has become crucial to the urban planners and researchers. It is also relevant from the viewpoint of smart city projects as the foundation of successful smart city lies in proper planning and urban growth analysis. In this context, the present study attempts to assess the urban expansion and land-change dynamics in and around Delhi. Multi-temporal Landsat data of 1977, 2003 and 2014 were used for analyzing the spatio-temporal pattern of built-up density, urban expansion, spatial change and their interrelationships. The annual urban expansion index of the study area reveals that it was comparatively high in Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT) during 1977-2003, but the expansion was much higher in peri-urban centers in the later period. However, the growth was not happened homogeneously across the peri-urban zones; instead, it occurred around few urban centers of peri-urban area. The annual urban expansion of Delhi NCT (2.52) was significantly less than peri-urban centers like Gurgaon (6.19) in the period, 2003-2014. Since the areas with high built-up density have little or no space for new settlement, the expansion of built-up area took place in the less dense areas. The correlation between urban expansion index and annual rate of change in built-up area shows that there is a good agreement and significant positive relationship (r >= 0.62) present between them. A negative correlation (r >= 0.92) between built-up density and urban expansion index indicates that areas with high built-up density have less potentiality to expand and vice versa.

TI  - Time series analysis of remotely sensed water quality parameters in arid environments, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of inland water resources in arid environments is an essential element due to their fragility. Reliable prediction of the water quality parameters helps to control and manage the water resources in arid regions. Water quality parameters were estimated using remote sensing data acquired from the beginning of 2017 until the end of 2018. The prediction of the water quality parameters was comprehended by using an adjusted autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and its extension seasonal ARIMA (S-ARIMA). Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) were the tested water quality parameters using Sentinel-2 sensor on temporal resolution basis of the sensor. Results indicated that the implementation of the ARIMA model failed to sustain a reliable prediction longer than one-month time while S-ARIMA succeeded to maintain a robust prediction for the first 3 months with confidence level of 96%. MCI has its ARIMA at (1,2,2) and S-ARIMA at (1,2,2) (2,1,1)6, GNDVI has its ARIMA at (2,1,2) and S-ARIMA at (2,1,2) (2,2,2)6, and finally, NDTI has its ARIMA at (2,2,2) and S-ARIMA at (2,2,2) (1,1,2)6. The accuracy of S-ARIMA predictions reached 82% at 6-month prediction period. Meanwhile, there was no solid prediction model that lasted till 12 months. Each of the forecasted water quality parameters is unique in its prediction settings. S-ARIMA model is a more reliable model because the seasonality feature is inherited within the forecasted water quality parameters.

TI  - Application of geospatial technology for delineating groundwater potential zones in the Gandheswari watershed, West Bengal
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of groundwater potential zones needs an understanding of different hydro-geological parameters of the concerned region. This present study done on Gandheswari watershed of West Bengal is mainly based on RS and GS techniques. Seven important parameters are taken into consideration namely geology, lineament, slope, drainage, soil, rainfall, and land use and land cover which are mutually interdependent to each other in the groundwater development process. Satellite image of Landsat-8, SRTM-DEM of USGS, rainfall data of IMD, topographical sheets of SOI, geological map of GSI, soil map of NBSS&LUP are collected and processed as per requirements in the ArcGIS, Erdas Imagine and PCI Geometica software to create or extract layers for all the parameters. The MIF technique is applied to assign weight to each parameter based on its level of influence to other parameters. All the layers are now integrated together adopting weighted overlay method in ArcGIS software. The prepared final map shows the groundwater potential zones of the Gandheswari watershed. An accuracy assessment is done based on groundwater fluctuation data of last 10 years (2018-2009) from CGWB calculating Kappa co-efficient to validate the study. The study reveals that an area of 275.9 km(2) (69.86%) is found to be good prospect of groundwater. The overall accuracy level of the study is calculated to be 84.62%, while the result of the Kappa co-efficient is 88% for the same.

This philosophy is particularly pertinent in Aotearoa-New Zealand because of the country's relatively isolated island ecosystem, economic reliance on agriculture and its intensification, and existing indigenous worldview that emphasises holism and interconnectivity between humans, animals and the environment. In New Zealand, the One Health Aotearoa (OHA) alliance was established in order to better connect researchers and to address a growing number of infectious diseases challenges. The emphasis of OHA is to bring together and facilitate interactions between people from diverse disciplines, link to stakeholders and communities, and engage with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders, thus providing a holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to address priority questions and achieve desired outcomes in One Health. The initial focus of OHA has been on infectious diseases, but there is increasing recognition of the potential benefits of the alliance to address broader complex issues. Greater involvement and overlap of the environmental sciences, human and animal health sciences, social science, and indigenous kaupapa Maori research is particularly critical for ensuring its success within the New Zealand context. Given the economic and cultural importance of New Zealand's "clean, green" image, a One Health approach that draws strongly on the environmental sciences makes particular sense. Furthermore, as the global environment becomes increasingly stressed by anthropogenic pressures our research may hold potential solutions for similar challenges elsewhere.

TI  - Relating regional and point measurements of accumulation in southwest Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has frequently experienced record melt events, which have significantly affected surface mass balance (SMB) and estimates thereof. SMB data are derived from remote sensing, regional climate models (RCMs), firn cores and automatic weather stations (AWSs). While remote sensing and RCMs cover regional scales with extents ranging from 1 to 10 km, AWS data and firn cores are point observations. To link regional scales with point measurements, we investigate the spatial variability of snow accumulation (b(s)) within areas of approximately 1-4 km(2) and its temporal changes within 2 years of measurements. At three different sites on the southwestern GrIS (Swiss Camp, KAN-U, DYE-2), we performed extensive ground-penetrating radar (GPR) transects and recorded multiple snow pits. If the density is known and the snowpack dry, radar-measured two-way travel time can be converted to snow depth and b(s). We spatially filtered GPR transect data to remove small-scale noise related to surface characteristics. The combined uncertainty of b(s) from density variations and spatial filtering of radar transects is at 7 %8% per regional scale of 1-4 km(2). Snow accumulation from a randomly selected snow pit is very likely representative of the regional scale of 1-4 km(2) (with probability p = 0.8 for a value within 10% of the regional mean for KAN-U, and p > 0.95 for Swiss Camp and DYE-2). However, to achieve such high representativeness of snow pits, it is required to determine the average snow depth within the vicinity of the pits. At DYE-2, the spatial pattern of snow accumulation was very similar for 2 consecutive years. Using target reflectors placed at respective end-of-summer-melt horizons, we additionally investigated the occurrences of lateral redistribution within one melt season. We found no evidence of lateral flow of meltwater in the current climate at DYE-2. Such studies of spatial representativeness and temporal changes in accumulation are necessary to assess uncertainties of the linkages of point measurements and regional-scale data, which are used for validation and calibration of remote-sensing data and RCM outputs.

TI  - Ecological Niche Modeling for Halophyte Species with Possible Anthropogenic Use in Agricultural Saline Soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to generate an ecological niche modeling (ENM) to determine potential sites or areas where the growth and development of halophyte species are the most appropriate. To determine the number of halophyte species in the zone of study, the random quadrant method was used. The material collected per site was separated and identified. One hundred samples were taken from the soil at a depth of 20 cm for the analysis of five chemical properties. Evaporation, precipitation, and minimum and maximum temperature data were obtained from 34 meteorological stations. Geostatistical techniques were applied for the spatial prediction of the climate and soil variables. In addition, five scenes from the Sentinel-2A satellite and the digital elevation model were retrieved. Principal component analysis was performed on the 15 environmental predictors. Ten algorithms were used to conduct the ENM. The ENM results of the halophyte species were reclassified in binary maps. A species richness (PRS) map was created according to the predictions from the sum of binary maps. The PRS map was used to define the potential sites to grow and develop halophyte species of anthropogenic interest. Ten halophyte species were found in the sampled zone, of which 70% were native. The first seven principal components (95% of the cumulative variance) were used for the ENM. The AUC values of the halophyte species models ranged from 0.61 to 0.98. A total of 38% of the study area was considered suitable for potential sites of halophyte species.

TI  - ChinaCropPhen1km: a high-resolution crop phenological dataset for three staple crops in China during 2000-2015 based on leaf area index (LAI) products
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Crop phenology provides essential information for monitoring and modeling land surface phenology dynamics and crop management and production. Most previous studies mainly investigated crop phenology at the site scale; however, monitoring and modeling land surface phenology dynamics at a large scale need high-resolution spatially explicit information on crop phenology dynamics. In this study, we produced a 1 km grid crop phenological dataset for three main crops from 2000 to 2015 based on Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index (LAI) products, called ChinaCropPhen1km. First, we compared three common smoothing methods and chose the most suitable one for different crops and regions. Then, we developed an optimal filter-based phenology detection (OFP) approach which combined both the inflection- and threshold-based methods and detected the key phenological stages of three staple crops at 1 km spatial resolution across China. Finally, we established a high-resolution gridded-phenology product for three staple crops in China during 2000-2015. Compared with the intensive phenological observations from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the dataset had high accuracy, with errors of the retrieved phenological date being less than 10 d, and represented the spatiotemporal patterns of the observed phenological dynamics at the site scale fairly well. The well-validated dataset can be applied for many purposes, including improving agricultural-system or earth-system modeling over a large area.

TI  - High prevalence of Phasi Charoen-like virus from wild-caught <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Grenada, W. I. as revealed by metagenomic analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arboviruses cause diseases of significant global health concerns. Interactions between mosquitoes and their microbiota as well as the important role of this interaction in the mosquito's capacity to harbor and transmit pathogens have emerged as important fields of research. Aedes aegypti is one of the most abundant mosquitoes in many geographic locations, a vector capable of transmitting a number of arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Currently, there are few studies on the metavirome of this mosquito particularly in the Americas. This study analyzes the metavirome of A. aegypti from Grenada, a Caribbean nation with tropical weather, abundant A. aegypti, and both endemic and arboviral pathogens transmitted by this mosquito. Between January and December 2018, 1152 mosquitoes were collected from six semi-rural locations near houses in St. George Parish, Grenada, by weekly trapping using BG-Sentinel traps. From these, 300 A. aegypti were selected for analysis. The metavirome was analyzed using the Illumina HiSeq 1500 for deep sequencing. The generation sequencing library construction protocol used was NuGEN Universal RNA with an average read length of 125 bp. Reads were mapped to the A. aegypti assembly. Non-mosquito reads were analyzed using the tools FastViromeExplorer. The NCBI total virus, RNA virus, and eukaryotic virus databases were used as references. The metagenomic comparison analysis showed that the most abundant virus-related reads among all databases and assemblies was Phasi Charoen-like virus. The Phasi Charoen-like virus results are in agreement to other studies in America, Asia and Australia. Further studies using wild-caught mosquitoes is needed to assess the impact of this insect-specific virus on the A. aegypti lifecycle and vector capacity.

TI  - Analysis of heterogeneous satellite networks with multi-user detectors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a heterogeneous network, where both terrestrial- and multiple spot beam-based geosynchronous satellite networks use the same sub-channel, is investigated. Moreover, the satellite uses same sub-channel to serve users across all spot beams. Apart from inter spot beam interference, satellite users also receive strong interfering signal from the terrestrial base station. The satellite receivers manage the inter system interference (ie, interference from terrestrial network) while the inter spot beam interference is mitigated through precoding at the gateway. To be specific, the following interference-aware detectors are used to mitigate the inter system interference: successive interference canceller (SIC) and joint decoder (JD). The proposed decoders are shown to achieve better data rate and bit error rate (BER) than the interference ignorant decoder at moderate to strong interference levels. Although JD and SIC achieve same sum rate at moderate and strong interference levels, JD is shown to allow the terrestrial user achieve higher data rate than SIC.

TI  - Multimodel-based analyses of evapotranspiration and its controls in China over the last three decades
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a key role in linking water, energy, and carbon cycles. However, at regional scales, variations and controls of ET are still not well understood, due to the substantial uncertainties in ET estimates. Here, the variations in ET over China during the last three decades and their drivers and controls were analysed at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales, using well-evaluated land surface model simulations. The results suggested that (a) the spatially averaged ET over China increased during 1979-2012 at each temporal scale. Overall, the ET significantly increased (p < .05) in most of western China and decreased in several regions in eastern China during most months and seasons. (a) The increases in spatially averaged ET during the nongrowing season were mainly determined by warming. The increased annual ET, seasonal ET, and monthly ET within the growing season were jointly caused by vegetation greening and climate warming. (c) During November-March, ET was primarily determined by temperature in most of central China and was determined by water availability in the remaining regions. The annual ET and the monthly ET within April-October were mainly controlled by water availability in most of northern and western China, and several regions in central China, by solar radiation in most of central and southern China and by temperature in some regions in the Tibetan Plateau. The study highlights the large effects of warming and greening on ET over China during the last three decades. The results may benefit water resource management under climate change.

TI  - Definition of Internal Mammary Node Target Volume Based on the Position of the Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Nodes Presented on SPECT/CT Fusion Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Mapping the distribution of internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes (IM-SLNs) presented on single photon emission computed tomography in conjunction with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) images to explore the value of IM-SLN to guide tailored clinical target volume (CTV) delineation of postoperative prophylactic IMNI.Materials and methods: Ninety-seven patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy by SPECT/CT and had imaging of IM-SLN were selected in this study. The imaging IM-SLNs on SPECT/CT of eligible patients were projected onto corresponding anatomical positions of a representative axial CT image. The IMN CTVs were delineated on the representative axial CT images according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) guideline, and defined as CTVRTOG and CTVDBCG. The location of the IM-SLNs was compared with the RTOG and DBCG guidelines of IMN target volume delineations, respectively. The intercostal space distribution of IM-SLNs was recorded. The distances from the CTVRTOG and CTVDBCG to the IM-SLNs were measured, respectively.Results: The total number of imaging IM-SLNs was 136. IM-SLNs were mostly found in the first intercostal space (40.4%), with 30.2, 24.3, 4.4, and 0.7% of IM-SLNs in the second, third, fourth, and fifth intercostal space, respectively. The average distance from the edge of the CTVRTOG and the edge of CTVDBCG to the central points of the IM-SLNs was 4.10 mm (SD, 3.3 mm) and 1.60 mm (SD, 2.6 mm), respectively (t = 16.640, P = 0.000). The average distance from the edge of CTVRTOG and the edge of CTVDBCG to the lateral border IM-SLN was 6.40 mm (SD, 3.5 mm) and 3.34 mm (SD, 3.3 mm), respectively (t = 19.815, P = 0.000). Only 18.4% of IM-SLN central points were included in the CTVRTOG, and 60.3% of IM-SLN central points were included in the CTVDBCG. When covering 90 and 100% of the IM-SLN center points, the CTVRTOG needs to expand 8 and 15 mm, respectively, and the CTVDBCG needs to expand 5 and 13 mm, respectively.Conclusion: Neither the RTOG nor DBCG consensus guideline about the delineation of IMN CTV was sufficient to cover 90% of IM-SLNs. For 90% coverage of IM-SLN central points, CTVRTOG needed to be expanded by 8 mm, and CTVDBCG needed to be expanded by 5 mm.

TI  - Impacts of spatial heterogeneity patterns on long-term trends of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter for global climate change studies. LST changes are also directly associated with the large-scale changes in land cover. Previous studies carried out a comparative analysis of satellite-derived LST response between periods before and after homogenous land cover changes. We present an alternative approach that quantifies long-term LST variability in response to various land use/land cover change (LULCC) patterns over Phuket Island, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017. First, four Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) overpass times of LST time series were adjusted for seasonal effects using a cubic spline function to preserve the number of original data and enable estimates of LST dynamics and trends using the generalized least squared models. Second, LULCC patterns were classified according to land cover type conversion and spatial pattern transformations between the years 2000 and 2016. Spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity were quantified by the coverage percentage for each land use and land cover (LULC) type within a given location. Finally, the influence of LULCC patterns on the long-term spatiotemporal behavior of LST was assessed using the generalized estimating equation model. Results showed that different land cover transitions influence the dynamics of daytime LST but not the nighttime LST. The proportion of different land cover types within an LST pixel and transition amounts contributed to the quantity of increasing surface temperature, especially over impervious surface types. Diverse LULCC patterns with considerations of spatial heterogeneity improved our insight about a relatively strong effect of combined LULC types on LST responses. The climatic effect through the gradual conversion of heterogeneous land cover is necessary to be considered in climate research studies.

TI  - Toward Operational Mapping of Woody Canopy Cover in Tropical Savannas Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Savanna woody plants can store significant amounts of carbon while also providing numerous other ecological and socio-economic benefits. However, they are significantly under-represented in widely used tree cover datasets, due to mapping challenges presented by their complex landscapes, and the underestimation of woody plants by methods that exclude short stature trees and shrubs. In this study, we describe a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application and present test case results for mapping percent woody canopy cover (%WCC) over a large savanna area. Relevant predictors of %WCC include information derived from radar backscatter (Sentinel-1) and optical reflectance (Sentinel-2), which are used in conjunction with plot level %WCC measurements to train and evaluate random forest models. We can predict %WCC at 40 m pixel resolution for the full extent of Senegal with a root mean square error of & SIM;8% (based on independent sample evaluation). Further examination of model results provides insights into method stability and potential generalizability. Annual median radar backscatter intensity is determined to be the most important satellite-based predictor of %WCC in savannas, likely due to its relatively strong response to non-leaf structural components of small woody plants which remain mostly constant across the wet and dry season. However, the best performing model combines radar backscatter metrics with optical reflectance indices that serve as proxies for greenness, dry biomass, burn incidence, plant water content, chlorophyll content, and seasonality. The primary use of GEE in the methodology makes it scalable and replicable by end-users with limited infrastructure for processing large remote sensing data.

TI  - Soil erosion assessment using RUSLE model and GIS in Huluka watershed, Central Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is the loss of soil by physical movement of particles from a given site leading to land degradation. The present study was carried out in Huluka watershed of the Oromia regional state of Ethiopia. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes and their potential impacts on soil erosion during 1998-2018 were studied. Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) and sentinel images of 1998, 2008 and 2018 were acquired and classified using maximum likelihood classification method. Soil erosion maps were generated with RUSLE model. Soil loss in the study area was 400 t ha(-1) year(-1), which was the highest rate of erosion. Severe erosion class covered 1115 ha (6% of the total watershed), while high to very high erosion-risk class covered 4032 ha (21%) and low to moderate erosion risk class covered 13,424 ha (73%), respectively. Critical sub-watersheds were identified and prioritized based on their average annual soil loss for future intervention and soil and water conservation measures. Average annual soil loss from these sub-watersheds ranged from 14.4 to 27 t ha(-1) year(-1). Based on the findings, it is recommended that the study area having extreme erosion should be given priority during integrated management interventions for soil conservation. Spatial erosion inputs generated with RUSLE model can serve as effective inputs in deriving strategies for land planning and management in the environmentally sensitive watershed areas.

TI  - Variations and climate constraints of terrestrial net primary productivity over Mongolia
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystems of Mongolia are among the most sensitive to global climate change because they are located in the circumpolar boreal zone, with its arid and semiarid climate. This study used the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model parameterized by meteorological and remote-sensing data to quantify vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) for Mongolia for 1982-2011 and further constructed a map of the relative contributions of climatic constraints to NPP. The results showed that 30-year average NPP in Mongolia varied spatially from 18.1 to 662.8 g C/m(2), with an average of 228.2 g C/m(2). From the map of climatic constraints on NPP, it was estimated that temperature constrains NPP variation over about 3.9% of Mongolia's land area, whereas precipitation constraints are dominant over about 77.5%. NPP in temperature-constrained regions has continuously increased from 1982 to 2011, with an annual increment of 2.18 g C/m(2) (R=0.61, p < 0.01) with continuous climate warming (0.07 degrees C/year, R=0.73, p < 0.01). In contrast, the NPP trend in precipitation-constrained regions has changed from increasing (R=0.68, p=0.01) to decreasing (R=-0.38, p=0.12) since 1994, which can be attributed to a reversal of precipitation trends in 1994. At national scale, NPP appeared stable during 1982-2011, due primarily to the high proportion of precipitation-constrained area in Mongolia, which obscured NPP trends in the temperature-constrained regions. Given that NPP trends clearly varied with different climatic constraints, the importance of differentiating climatic constraints on NPP for exploring NPP trends under different climatic drivers should be emphasized. The seasonal-scale analysis further showed that summer climate and associated vegetation productivity is an important factor regulating NPP over the entire growing season, due primarily to the high proportion of summer NPP and precipitation for the entire growing season, and warmer temperatures in summer relative to those in spring and autumn. In addition to temperature and precipitation, radiation is an important factor responsible for the NPP variations, and the shape of the correlations between radiation and NPP with changing precipitation gradient suggests that the impact process of radiation on NPP with changing water stress is similar to that of temperature, but its impact is weaker than that of temperature.

TI  - Drivers of tropical forest cover increase: A systematic review
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Promoting natural regeneration can be a viable strategy to achieve ambitious restoration commitments, but predicting where native forest cover is likely to expand is challenging. Different biophysical and socioeconomic factors may determine the chances of native forest regrowth at different spatial and temporal scales, producing complex spatial patterns in the landscape and adding more and deeper information about potential for different forms of forest restoration. On the basis of a systematic literature review including 64 peer-reviewed articles from the global tropics and subtropics published from 1990 to 2017, we assessed the methodologies employed to remotely detect forest cover increase and to identify its biophysical and socioeconomic drivers. Automatic classification of multitemporal images and transition matrices were the most popular methods to detect areas of forest regrowth, whereas regression analysis was the most used analytical approaches to assess drivers. Forest cover increased more often on steeper slopes, close to forest remnants, inside protected areas, and far from population centers. However, the effects of most drivers varied among scales of evaluation and may be further affected by the scale of forest regrowth. The most influential biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest cover increase identified here can be used to develop predictive models on the likelihood of native forest regrowth to guide the implementation of cost-effective tropical forest restoration, thus contributing to the mitigation of climate change and species extinction. Current remote-sensing literature evaluating forest cover changes seems to be largely focused on deforestation dynamics, with little attention given to forest cover increase.

TI  - Retrieval of the vertical evolution of the cloud effective radius from the Chinese FY-4 (Feng Yun 4) next-generation geostationary satellites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical evolution of the cloud effective radius (R-e) reflects the precipitation-forming process. Based on observations from the first Chinese next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites (FY-4A, Feng Yun 4), we established a new method for objectively obtaining the vertical temperature vs. R-e profile. First of all, R-e was calculated using a bispectral lookup table. Then, cloud clusters were objectively identified using the maximum temperature gradient method. Finally, the R-e profile in a certain cloud was then obtained by combining these two sets of data. Compared with the conventional method used to obtain the R-e profile from the subjective division of a region, objective cloud-cluster identification establishes a unified standard, increases the credibility of the R-e profile, and facilitates the comparison of different R-e profiles. To investigate its performance, we selected a heavy precipitation event from the Integrative Monsoon Frontal Rainfall Experiment in summer 2018. The results showed that the method successfully identified and tracked the cloud cluster. The R-e profile showed completely different morphologies in different life stages of the cloud cluster, which is important in the characterization of the formation of precipitation and the temporal evolution of microphysical processes.

TI  - Upstaging of melanoma in situ and lentigo maligna treated with Mohs micrographic surgery rarely results in additional surgical management
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is more widely utilized for melanoma in situ (MIS) and lentigo maligna (LM), there is increasing concern over whether the procedure can negatively affect the treatment of upstaged tumors. Previous studies have shown that about 1-2% of MIS/LM treated with MMS require sentinel lymph node biopsy, but little is still known regarding surgical outcomes. We performed a retrospective chart review of 117 MIS/LM lesions treated with MMS at Brigham and Women's Hospital. We found a low rate of tumor upstaging (8.5% or 10/117), and only 1.7% (2/117) required wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy. In both patients, there was successful location of the sentinel nodes by surgical oncologists. This study highlights the low risk of MIS/LM upstaging, with the majority changing to T1a, and the low need for further surgical management after MMS. Collaboration with other surgical specialties ensures appropriate management of patients with upstaged tumors.

TI  - 'ToWrite? What's This Torture For?' Bronia Baum's Manuscripts as Testimony to the Formation of a Writer, Activist, and Journalist
T2  - JEWISH HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bronia (Breyndl) Baum (1896-1947) was an Orthodox Jewish writer, activist, and journalist. She was born into a Hasidic family in Tomaszow Mazowiecki, moved to Piotrkow Trybunalski in 1918, and then to Lodz. In 1925, she left Poland for the Land of Israel. Among poems and articles that she published in Yiddish papers were "Der Yud," "Dos Yidishe Togblat," and "Beys Yankev." She also wrote in Hebrew-"Bat Israel" and "Baderekh" are two examples-with her Hebrew writing collected in Ketavim le-bat Yisra'el, published in Tel Aviv in 1954. Baum energetically promoted women's education, an active role for religious Jewish women, and a number of charities. This article analyzes Bronia Baum's unpublished manuscripts from the years 1912 to 1921. They include a diary in Russian and poems in Polish and Yiddish, and together constitute a unique literary and historical document. Baum's work is considered from five perspectives: (1) the critical importance of education; (2) the role of World War I in shaping and determining her opinions and worldview, and of antisemitism in developing her Zionist stance; (3) her position on tradition and religion; (4) feminist motifs in her manuscripts, along with her attitude toward men and her relations with women; and (5) her approach toward her own writing, her compulsion to write and its source.

TI  - Preliminary tests on the performance of MLC-RFE and SVM-RFE in Lansat-8 image classification
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During image classification, it is important to select optimal bands in order to reduce the amount of information while maintaining a considerable accuracy. However, problems exist in the artificial subjective selection of the bands, and as a result, the true accuracies of the classifications are not effectively expressed. This research was conducted using 10 bands of the Landsat-8 fusion data as the information sources. The maximum likelihood classification-recursive feature elimination (MLC-RFE) method and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) method were used to select the most appropriate bands, and to analyse the classification results of different methods. The results showed that the bands obtained from MLC and SVM were different, with MLC being more sensitive to the change in features compared with SVM. The highest and lowest overall accuracies of MLC were 99.1667% and 92.2312%, respectively (the corresponding Kappa coefficients were 0.9903 and 0.9094). The highest and lowest overall accuracies of SVM were 98.7231% and 86.6398%, respectively (the corresponding Kappa coefficients were 0.9851 and 0.8441). The two classifiers differed greatly as regards the classification accuracies of the optimal and worst band combinations. This indicates that the selection of the participating bands was very important for the image classification, and MLC-RFE is more suitable than SVM-RFE for Landsat-8 image classification.

TI  - The global long-term microwave Vegetation Optical Depth Climate Archive (VODCA)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Since the late 1970s, space-borne microwave radiometers have been providing measurements of radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. From these measurements it is possible to derive vegetation optical depth (VOD), a model-based indicator related to the density, biomass, and water content of vegetation. Because of its high temporal resolution and long availability, VOD can be used to monitor short- to long-term changes in vegetation. However, studying long-term VOD dynamics is generally hampered by the relatively short time span covered by the individual microwave sensors. This can potentially be overcome by merging multiple VOD products into a single climate data record. However, combining multiple sensors into a single product is challenging as systematic differences between input products like biases, different temporal and spatial resolutions, and coverage need to be overcome.Here, we present a new series of long-term VOD products, the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA). VODCA combines VOD retrievals that have been derived from multiple sensors (SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, and AMSR2) using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model. We produce separate VOD products for microwave observations in different spectral bands, namely the Ku-band (period 1987-2017), X-band (1997-2018), and C-band (2002-2018). In this way, our multi-band VOD products preserve the unique characteristics of each frequency with respect to the structural elements of the canopy. Our merging approach builds on an existing approach that is used to merge satellite products of surface soil moisture: first, the data sets are co-calibrated via cumulative distribution function matching using AMSR-E as the scaling reference. To do so, we apply a new matching technique that scales outliers more robustly than ordinary piecewise linear interpolation. Second, we aggregate the data sets by taking the arithmetic mean between temporally overlapping observations of the scaled data.The characteristics of VODCA are assessed for self-consistency and against other products. Using an auto-correlation analysis, we show that the merging of the multiple data sets successfully reduces the random error compared to the input data sets. Spatio-temporal patterns and anomalies of the merged products show consistency between frequencies and with leaf area index observations from the MODIS instrument as well as with Vegetation Continuous Fields from the AVHRR instruments. Long-term trends in Ku-band VODCA show that since 1987 there has been a decline in VOD in the tropics and in large parts of east-central and north Asia, while a substantial increase is observed in India, large parts of Australia, southern Africa, southeastern China, and central North America. In summary, VODCA shows vast potential for monitoring spatial-temporal ecosystem changes as it is sensitive to vegetation water content and unaffected by cloud cover or high sun zenith angles. As such, it complements existing long-term optical indices of greenness and leaf area.The VODCA products (Moesinger et al., 2019) are open access and available under Attribution 4.0 International at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2575599.

TI  - Failure of sentinel lymph node mapping in breast cancer patients qualified for treatment sparing axillary lymph nodes-Clinical importance and management strategy-One-center analysis
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard in diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with nonadvanced invasive breast cancer. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the clinical importance of the failure of sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification during SLNB performed to spare axillary lymph nodes. A total of 5396 patients with invasive breast cancer qualified for SLNB, treated in a period from Jan 2004 to June 2018. All cases of the failure of SLN identification and reasons underlying this situation were analyzed retrospectively. In 196 (3.6%) patients, SLN was not identified (group I), and this resulted in a simultaneous axillary lymph node dissection. 48.5% patients from this group were diagnosed with cancer metastases to lymph nodes (vs 23.6% patients with SLN removed-group II, P < .00001)-stage pN1 in 44.2% of the cases, stage pN2 in 22.1% of the cases, and pN3 in 33.7% (in group II-73.4%, 19.5% and 7.1%, respectively), with a presence of extracapsular infiltration in 68.4% patients (vs 41.7% in group II) and with a significantly higher percentage of micrometastatic nature in group II (17.0%, vs 3.2% in group I). The failure of intraoperative sentinel lymph node mapping indicates a significantly increased risk of breast cancer metastases to the axillary lymph system. At the same time, it can also indicate higher cancer stage and its increased aggressiveness. For this reason, in such situation performance of axillary lymph node dissection still appears to be the approach most advantageous for patients.

TI  - Synergistic potential of dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar and multispectral optical imagery for invasive alien species detection and mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien species are a major threat to global biodiversity and result in adverse environmental and socioeconomic implications, such as reduced ecosystem services, landscape productivity, and costly eradication initiatives. The ability to monitor the extent and spread of alien species invasions provides valuable insight for the mitigation of these adverse implications. The generation of Earth Observation (EO) Sentinel sensor provides unprecedented freely available imagery, which is suitable for both local and regional invasive species monitoring. Specifically, its radar (S1) and optical (S2) sensors offer unique tandem datasets valuable for landscape analysis. Hence, we sought to determine the synergistic potential of fused S1 dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with S2 optical imagery for invasive alien species detection and mapping. S1 and S2 imageries were fused at the feature level, and the support vector machine algorithm used for the multiclass image classification. Results indicated that the fusion of the S1 dual-polarized imagery with S2 optical imagery produced the highest classification accuracy (85%), whereas stand-alone S2 optical bands produced the lowest classification accuracy (79%). Findings from this study underline the significant synergistic potential and complementarity of new-age S2 optical imagery and dual-polarized S1 SAR imagery for invasive alien species detection and mapping. Due to large swath, higher pixel resolution, free availability, and possible tandem complementarity between optical and SAR sensors, we recommend Sentinel EO imagery as an economically viable option for the invasive alien species detection and mapping.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptualisation of geo-hydrological characteristic of a drainage basin quantitative measurement of morphometric parameters has been required. Assessment and understanding the hydrological characteristics of Nagar River Basin morphometric analysis has been carried out. Remote sensing and ArcGIS techniques have been used for measuring and calculating the morphometric characteristics of the Nagar River Basin. Total area of Nagar River Basin is 2381.69 sq.km with dendritic drainage pattern. This stream frequency of the Nagar River Basin is 0.09 km/sq.km. Probability of flooding is quite high with intense rainfall in dendritic type of drainage system. Monsoonal rainfall is the main cause for the formation of stream segment. Very coarse drainage texture has been found in this Nagar River Basin with T value 0.04. This river basin is highly elongated in nature. The presence of a large number of stream segments exhibits the soil erosion in this study area by surface runoff, and the eroded materials deposited into the river bed aggregated channel depth causing flooding in rainy season. Flood is one of the major natural hazards having massive damage every year all over the world. For constructing flood vulnerability mapping of Nagar River Basin, AHP method has been used by compiling some morphometric parameters with other flood-influencing factors of Nagar River Basin. It can be concluded that the lower portion of the Nagar River Basin is highly vulnerable to flooding.

TI  - A Systematic, Regional Assessment of High Mountain Asia Glacier Mass Balance
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-mountain Asia (HMA) constitutes the largest glacierized region outside of the Earth's polar regions. Although available observations are limited, long-term records indicate sustained HMA glacier mass loss since similar to 1850, with accelerated loss in recent decades. Recent satellite data capture the spatial variability of this mass loss, but spatial resolution is coarse and some estimates for regional and HMA-wide mass loss disagree. To address these issues, we generated 5,797 high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from available sub-meter commercial stereo imagery (DigitalGlobe WorldView-1/2/3 and GeoEye-1) acquired over HMA glaciers from 2007 to 2018 (primarily 2013-2017). We also reprocessed 28,278 ASTER DEMs over HMA from 2000 to 2018. We combined these observations to generate robust elevation change trend maps and geodetic mass balance estimates for 99% of HMA glaciers between 2000 and 2018. We estimate total HMA glacier mass change of -19.0 +/- 2.5 Gt yr(-1) (-0.19 +/- 0.03 m w.e. yr(-1)). We document the spatial pattern of HMA glacier mass change with unprecedented detail, and present aggregated estimates for HMA glacierized sub-regions and hydrologic basins. Our results offer improved estimates for the HMA contribution to global sea level rise in recent decades with total cumulative sea-level rise contribution of similar to 0.7 mm from exorheic basins between 2000 and 2018. We estimate that the range of excess glacier meltwater runoff due to negative glacier mass balance in each basin constitutes similar to 12-53% of the total basin-specific glacier meltwater runoff. These results can be used for calibration and validation of glacier mass balance models, satellite gravimetry observations, and hydrologic models needed for present and future water resource management.

TI  - Landsat images and artificial intelligence techniques used to map volcanic ashfall and pyroclastic material following the eruption of Mount Agung, Indonesia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the 829 active volcanoes distributed worldwide, 129 are located in Indonesia. Two recent eruptions of Mount Agung on Bali Island, Indonesia, on November 21, 2017, and January 11, 2018, produced massive ash, steam, and gas emissions. Rainwater carried these pyroclastic materials in cold lahars to southwestern parts of the island. Because explosive eruptions of Mount Agung during 1963-1964 produced voluminous ashfall and catastrophic pyroclastic flows, the monitoring of this volcano has been considered essential. Land cover (LC) mapping is one method commonly used to monitor the spread of materials in volcanic areas due to the inaccessibility of field data during ongoing eruptions. We analyzed multispectral data using two different classifiers: an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). Landsat imagery was used to generate a LC map with four feature classes: rock and sand, vegetation, cloud, and shadow. The ANN method was more accurate than the SVM method, with classification accuracies of 94.67% and 97% for the first and second Mount Agung eruptions, respectively. The SVM classifier was better than ANN at classifying images taken prior to eruption, with an overall accuracy of 91.60%. Thus, both classifiers accurately distinguished eruption products and environmental features, and are suitable for LC classification in volcanic regions.

TI  - Soil salinization in the oasis areas of downstream inland rivers -Case Study: Minqin oasis
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is the main resource and environmental problem in arid and semiarid regions, and it seriously restricts regional ecological security and sustainable agricultural development. Accurate monitoring of soil salinization and analysis of its main influencing factors are of great significance to the improvement and management of soil salinization. In this paper, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and salinity index (SI) were extracted from Landsat images of the Minqin oasis from 2000 to 2018, and these data were used to construct a soil salinization remote sensing monitoring index model (SDI). The index extracted by the model was used to monitor the soil salinization information, and the index values were graded to obtain different degrees of soil salinized land. The measured data were used to verify the accuracy of the SDI through trend analysis, stability analysis and other methods, and explore the characteristics and main influencing factors of soil salinization in the Minqin oasis. The results showed that the spatial distribution characteristics of the different degrees of soil salinity extracted by the SDI model were consistent with the measured results. The area of salinized soil in the Minqin oasis exceeded 80%, and the proportion of lightly salinized soil was the largest. The area ratio of salinized soil did not change much from 2000 to 2018, but the changes between different degrees of salinized soil were large.The unused land in the Minqin oasis exhibited a high degree of salinization, which was manifested spatially in the northwest of the Minqin oasis and the areas surrounding Qingtu Lake. In addition, the soil salinization of the Minqin oasis exhibited obvious seasonal differences, and the different degrees of salinization also changed with the change in seasons. The analysis of the main influencing factors of soil salinization in the Minqin oasis revealed that the large land occupation ratio of salinized land in the Minqin oasis was related to the local climatic factors. In recent years, changes in soil salinity in parts of the Minqin oasis and Qingtu Lake area were mainly the result of ecological water conveyance.

TI  - Classification of Indian cities using Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of cities and the impacts of urbanization on local and global environmental factors such as biodiversity and climate change are of great concern. Reliable rapid approaches for mapping the expansion of cities are of increasing importance today. In this paper, we explore the use of Google Earth Engine to classify land cover in Indian cities from Landsat imagery, using a Random Forest approach, a robust per-pixel approach to supervised classification which generates classification trees based on the band values of the desired classes. Cities were classified into four classes - urban, vegetation, waterbody, and fallow land. We developed global and individual random forest models and used them to classify India's 10 largest cities. Our results show that the global model produces accuracies greater to individual models, with an overall classification accuracy greater than 80% for each city. This research provides an empirically grounded method to map cities.

TI  - Glacier algae accelerate melt rates on the south-western Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the largest single contributor to eustatic sea level and is amplified by the growth of pigmented algae on the ice surface, which increases solar radiation absorption. This biological albedo-reducing effect and its impact upon sea level rise has not previously been quantified. Here, we combine field spectroscopy with a radiative-transfer model, supervised classification of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite remote-sensing data, and runoff modelling to calculate biologically driven ice surface ablation. We demonstrate that al- gal growth led to an additional 4.4-6.0 Gt of runoff from bare ice in the south-western sector of the GrIS in summer 2017, representing 10 %-13 % of the total. In localized patches with high biomass accumulation, algae accelerated melting by up to 26.15 +/- 3.77 % (standard error, SE). The year 2017 was a high-albedo year, so we also extended our analysis to the particularly low-albedo 2016 melt season. The runoff from the south-western bare-ice zone attributed to algae was much higher in 2016 at 8.8-12.2 Gt, although the proportion of the total runoff contributed by algae was similar at 9 %-13 %. Across a 10 000 km(2) area around our field site, algae covered similar proportions of the exposed bare ice zone in both years (57.99 % in 2016 and 58.89 % in 2017), but more of the algal ice was classed as "high biomass" in 2016 (8.35 %) than 2017 (2.54 %). This interannual comparison demonstrates a positive feedback where more widespread, higher-biomass algal blooms are expected to form in high-melt years where the winter snowpack retreats further and earlier, providing a larger area for bloom development and also enhancing the provision of nutrients and liquid water liberated from melting ice. Our analysis confirms the importance of this biological albedo feedback and that its omission from predictive models leads to the systematic underestimation of Greenland's future sea level contribution, especially because both the bare-ice zones available for algal colonization and the length of the biological growth season are set to expand in the future.

TI  - A simulator for the CLARA-A2 cloud climate data record and its application to assess EC-Earth polar cloudiness
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a new satellite simulator for the CLARA-A2 climate data record (CDR). This simulator takes into account the variable skill in cloud detection in the CLARA-A2 CDR by using a different approach to other similar satellite simulators to emulate the ability to detect clouds.In particular, the paper describes three methods to filter out clouds from climate models undetectable by observations. The first method is comparable to the current simulators in the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP), since it relies on a single visible cloud optical depth at 550 nm (tau(c)) threshold applied globally to delineate cloudy and cloud-free conditions. Methods two and three apply long/lat-gridded values separated by daytime and nighttime conditions. Method two uses gridded varying tc as opposed to method one, which uses just a tau(c) threshold, and method three uses a cloud probability of detection (POD) depending on the model tau(c). The gridded POD values are from the CLARA-A2 validation study by Karlsson and Hakansson (2018).Methods two and three replicate the relative ease or difficulty for cloud retrievals depending on the region and illumination. They increase the cloud sensitivity where the cloud retrievals are relatively straightforward, such as over midlatitude oceans, and they decrease the sensitivity where cloud retrievals are notoriously tricky, such as where thick clouds may be inseparable from cold snow-covered surfaces, as well as in areas with an abundance of broken and small-scale cumulus clouds such as the atmospheric subsidence regions over the ocean.The simulator, together with the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) simulator of the COSP, is used to assess Arctic clouds in the EC-Earth climate model compared to the CLARA-A2 and ISCCP H-Series (ISCCP-H) CDRs. Compared to CLARA-A2, EC-Earth generally underestimates cloudiness in the Arctic. However, compared to ISCCP and its simulator, the opposite conclusion is reached. Based on EC-Earth, this paper shows that the simulated cloud mask of CLARA-A2, using method three, is more representative of the CDR than method one used for the ISCCP simulator.The simulator substantially improves the simulation of the CLARA-A2-detected clouds, especially in the polar regions, by accounting for the variable cloud detection skill over the year. The approach to cloud simulation based on the POD of clouds depending on their tau(c), location, and illumination is the preferred one as it reduces cloudiness over a range of cloud optical depths. Climate model comparisons with satellite-derived information can be significantly improved by this approach, mainly by reducing the risk of misinterpreting problems with satellite retrievals as cloudiness features. Since previous studies found that the CLARA-A2 CDR performs well in the Arctic during the summer months, and that method three is more representative than method one, the conclusion is that EC-Earth likely underestimates clouds in the Arctic summer.

TI  - Changing land use/land cover patterns and growing human population in Wular catchment of Kashmir Valley, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The profound increase in human activities and the degrading scenario in fragile ecosystems of the western Himalayas like that of Wular Lake have highlighted the need to analyze the impact of increasing human population on such environments. Wular Lake, the largest freshwater lake, has under gone/witnessed degradation from the last few decades because of tremendous increase in human population in its catchment area. The present work deals with the land transformation in the Wular lake catchment over a period of 28 years (1991-2018) which represents the specific changes in the classes, majorly like waterbody (- 51.60%), swamps/marshy (- 30.92%), plantation (- 6.34%), dense forest (- 10.56%) and snow cover (- 3.66%). To carry out this study, Landsat-5 (TM) images of 1991, 2001, 2011 and Landsat-8 image of 2018 have been used. The population data for the same time period has also been used to coincide with the study dates. Thereafter, the correlation between the changing LULC and human population has been calculated using Pearson's correlation (rho rho). LULC categories like barren/rocky, agriculture, horticulture and settlement showed a positive correlation while the categories like snow cover, waterlogged/swampy, water body, dense forest and plantation showed negative correlation with the growing population.

TI  - Performance of near-infrared dyes as effective contrast agents for breast cancer detection through simulation of photoacoustic imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Targeted photoacoustic imaging using exogenous contrast agents can potentially improve early detection of breast cancer, even at significant depths inside the breast. In this study, computer simulations were performed to compare the photoacoustic performance of 11 different near-infrared (NIR) dyes for detecting tumours deep inside the breast tissue. It was observed that the three high performing NIR dyes produced at least two-fold contrast enhancement of a spherical breast tumour embedded at 4 cm depth inside the breast than those of the corresponding endogenous contrast agents. These three selected dyes were employed to visualize small blood vessels deep inside the breast tissue. Although methylene blue provided the best contrast in visualizing tumour blood vessels at depths beyond 3 cm, considering other factors such as availability of suitable targeting agent, indocyanine green at 800 nm may be preferred over all other dyes for deep breast imaging applications.

TI  - Productivity Improvement of Wasteland in Drought-Prone, Overdrafted and Rocky Terrain Watershed: A Case Study of Upper Thurinjalar Watershed in Ponnaiyar Basin Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A great extent of productive land has become wasteland due to climatic change, frequent monsoon failure and inadequate water supply for irrigation. Identification of such lands can be helpful for conversion into productive land. Present study focuses on identification of wasteland in the watershed by utilising land use map of 2018 by interpreting satellite image of IRS-P6 LISS IV over upper Thurinjalar watershed in Thiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu. For this purpose, digital image processing software ERDAS IMAGINE 2015 and GIS Software ArcGIS 10.5 version were used. Fifty percentage of the total geographical area of the watershed is reported as wasteland in our study. Favourable wasteland layer was superimposed upon the administrative village boundary map by GIS overlay analysis. Type of wasteland was demarcated using remote sensing and GIS techniques, and thematic layers such as lineament map, geomorphology map and depth to bedrock map were generated. Through GIS overlay analysis, wasteland map of the study area was overlaid on the three thematic layers and favourable artificial recharge sites were identified. In upper Thurinjalar watershed, 61.06 km(2) is highly favourable and 214.18 km(2) is moderately favourable for recharge, and the sites are recommended for groundwater recharge using structures such as pits, percolation ponds, borewells and check dams. Among wastelands, degraded lands under plantation, lands with scrub and lands without scrub were prioritised for groundwater recharge. Technique adopted in our study can be applied over other watersheds and wasteland to convert them into productive land.

TI  - Efficient agricultural yield prediction using metaheuristic optimized artificial neural network using Hadoop framework
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-resolution imagery of satellite is used extensively for monitoring crops and forecasting of yield which has a major role to play in the operational systems. A combination of high levels of temporal frequency along with an extended coverage was connected with lower costs per each area unit making the images a choice that is convenient at the national level and the regional level scales. There are various quantitative and qualitative approaches for low-resolution satellite imagery to be used for the primary predictor of the final yield of crops. But, very little work is done on the yield prediction that is based on environmental and satellite data. To handle such satellite images may be very challenging owing to large data amounts. Big data analysis is efficient in handling a large amount of data generated for predicting agricultural yield. In this work, a neural network is used for prediction and to enhance its performance; a population-based incremental learning technique is proposed for optimizing the weights. The results of the experiment proved that the method proposed has better results compared to that of the other methods.

TI  - Indices based assessment of built-up density and urban expansion of fast growing Surat city using multi-temporal Landsat data sets
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The population growth in urban areas leads to the expansion of built-up area which leads to a number of serious problems like environmental pollution, destruction of urban ecology, climatic modification etc. In this study, we have tried to assess the linkages and association between population growth and built-up expansion in Surat city. Landsat satellite data (TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS) has been used for 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2019 to extract the built-up area while the demographic data of the city was obtained from the Census of India and SMC. The built-up area has been extracted using index based built-up index (IBI) method. The association between urban expansion rate (RUE) and population growth rate (PGR), distribution of population and built-up area and the population and built-up density was analyzed using linear regression technique. The result shows that both the population and built-up area of Surat has increased rapidly but the rate of increase of built-up area is higher than the population. The statistical analysis shows that the density of population and built-up area have very strong-positive relationship while their distribution have moderate-positive relationship. On the other hand the PGR and RUE shows positive but weak relationship. The main finding of the study is that the growth rate of population and urban area are not identical to each other but their distribution and density have strong relationships with each other. The association between PGR and RUE is not always significant because of the variation in their rate.

TI  - A double peak in the seasonality of California's photosynthesis as observed from space
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown to be a powerful proxy for photosynthesis and gross primary productivity (GPP). The recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) features the required spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve SIF from space. Here, we present a downscaling method to obtain 500m spatial resolution SIF over California. We report daily values based on a 14 d window. TROPOMI SIF data show a strong correspondence with daily GPP estimates at AmeriFlux sites across multiple ecosystems in California. We find a linear relationship between SIF and GPP that is largely invariant across ecosystems with an intercept that is not significantly different from zero. Measurements of SIF from TROPOMI agree with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation index (NIRv) - at annual timescales but indicate different temporal dynamics at monthly and daily timescales. TROPOMI SIF data show a double peak in the seasonality of photosynthesis, a feature that is not present in the MODIS vegetation indices. The different seasonality in the vegetation indices may be due to a clear-sky bias in the vegetation indices, whereas previous work has shown SIF to have a low sensitivity to clouds and to detect the downregulation of photosynthesis even when plants appear green. We further decompose the spatiotemporal patterns in the SIF data based on land cover. The double peak in the seasonality of California's photosynthesis is due to two processes that are out of phase: grasses, chaparral, and oak savanna ecosystems show an April maximum, while evergreen forests peak in June. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis corroborates the phase offset and spatial patterns driving the double peak. The EOF analysis further indicates that two spatiotemporal patterns explain 84% of the variability in the SIF data. Results shown here are promising for obtaining global GPP at sub-kilometer spatial scales and identifying the processes driving carbon uptake.

TI  - The evaluation of FY4A's Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) long-wave temperature sounding channels using the GRAPES global 4D-Var
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The theory of classical variational assimilation assumes that biases are unbiased Gaussian. This article investigates the bias characteristic estimate and the bias correction of Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on board the FY-4A satellite. Quality-control procedures for GIIRS long-wave temperature channels brightness temperature include cloud detection based on the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) and outlier removal. The mean biases for most channels are within +/- 2 K after quality control except for the contaminated channels. Statistical evaluation of the first-guess departures of GIIRS observations in GRAPES (Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction Enhanced System) global 4D-Var reveal that biases for the long-wave temperature channels depend on fields of view (FOVs) and latitudinal distribution. Additionally, the diurnal variation of biases is obvious only for the upper tropospheric channels, and the biases for high tropospheric channels are smaller than the biases for low tropospheric channels. Finally, off-line bias correction that was used in this study accounts for the field-of-regard (FOR) dependence and the diurnal variation bias characteristics of GIIRS. After bias correction, the results show that biases of long-wave temperature sounding channels are reduced to +/- 0.02 K, and the standard deviations are less than 1 K except for the contaminated channels. The probability density function of the differences between observations and simulations for some common assimilation channels is closer to the unbiased Gaussian distribution.

TI  - Estimating hospital catchments from in-patient admission records: a spatial statistical approach applied to malaria
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Admission records are seldom used in sub-Saharan Africa to delineate hospital catchments for the spatial description of hospitalised disease events. We set out to investigate spatial hospital accessibility for severe malarial anaemia (SMA) and cerebral malaria (CM). Malaria admissions for children between 1 month and 14 years old were identified from prospective clinical surveillance data recorded routinely at four referral hospitals covering two complete years between December 2015 to November 2016 and November 2017 to October 2018. These were linked to census enumeration areas (EAs) with an age-structured population. A novel mathematical-statistical framework that included EAs with zero observations was used to predict hospital catchment for malaria admissions adjusting for spatial distance. From 5766 malaria admissions, 5486 (95.14%) were linked to specific EA address, of which 272 (5%) were classified as cerebral malaria while 1001 (10%) were severe malaria anaemia. Further, results suggest a marked geographic catchment of malaria admission around the four sentinel hospitals although the extent varied. The relative rate-ratio of hospitalisation was highest at <1-hour travel time for SMA and CM although this was lower outside the predicted hospital catchments. Delineation of catchments is important for planning emergency care delivery and in the use of hospital data to define epidemiological disease burdens. Further hospital and community-based studies on treatment-seeking pathways to hospitals for severe disease would improve our understanding of catchments.

TI  - Near Real-Time Wildfire Progression Monitoring with Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series and Deep Learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the world witnessed many devastating wildfires that resulted in destructive human and environmental impacts across the globe. Emergency response and rapid response for mitigation calls for effective approaches for near real-time wildfire monitoring. Capable of penetrating clouds and smoke, and imaging day and night, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can play a critical role in wildfire monitoring. In this communication, we investigated and demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR time series with a deep learning framework for near real-time wildfire progression monitoring. The deep learning framework, based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is developed to detect burnt areas automatically using every new SAR image acquired during the wildfires and by exploiting all available pre-fire SAR time series to characterize the temporal backscatter variations. The results show that Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter can detect wildfires and capture their temporal progression as demonstrated for three large and impactful wildfires: the 2017 Elephant Hill Fire in British Columbia, Canada, the 2018 Camp Fire in California, USA, and the 2019 Chuckegg Creek Fire in northern Alberta, Canada. Compared to the traditional log-ratio operator, CNN-based deep learning framework can better distinguish burnt areas with higher accuracy. These findings demonstrate that spaceborne SAR time series with deep learning can play a significant role for near real-time wildfire monitoring when the data becomes available at daily and hourly intervals with the launches of RADARSAT Constellation Missions in 2019, and SAR CubeSat constellations.

TI  - Evaluation of the Spatial Pattern of the Resolution-Enhanced Thermal Data for Urban Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of urbanization, land surface temperature (LST), as a vital variable for the urban environment, is highly demanded by urban-related studies, especially the LST with both fine temporal and spatial resolutions. Thermal sharpening methods have been developed just under this demand. Until now, there are some thermal sharpening methods proposed especially for urban surface. However, the evaluation of their accuracy still stopped at the level that only considers the statistical aspect, but no spatial information has been included. It is widely acknowledged that the spatial pattern of the thermal environment in an urban area is relatively critical for urban-related studies (e.g., urban heat island studies). Thus, this paper chose three typical methods from the limited number of thermal sharpening methods designed for the urban area and made a comparison between them, together with a newly proposed thermal sharpening method, superresolution-based thermal sharpener (SRTS). These four methods are analyzed by data from different seasons to explore the seasoning impact. Also, the accuracy for different land covers is explored as well. Furthermore, accuracy evaluation was not only taken by statistical variables which are commonly used in other studies; evaluation of the spatial pattern, which is equally important for urban-related studies, was also carried out. This time, the spatial pattern not only was analyzed qualitatively but also has been quantified by some variables for the comparison of accuracy. It is found that all methods obtained lower accuracies for data in winter than for data in other seasons. Linear water features and areas along it are difficult to be detected correctly for most methods.

TI  - Etiologic agents of acute diarrhea in sentinel surveillance sites in Vientiane Capital, Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2012-2015
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the pathogens of diarrhea in Vientiane Capital, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The data of 2482 patients who visited eight health facilities due to diarrhea in 2012-2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Stool or rectal swabs collected from all patients were tested for bacteria. Children who were under 5 years old were additionally tested for rotavirus. Of 2482 cases, 1566 cases were under 5 years old, and at least one enteropathogen was detected in 475 cases (19.1%). Salmonella species was the most commonly detected bacterial pathogen. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Salmonella species was the major pathogen in the dry season and the wet season, respectively. Eighty-seven patients tested positive for multiple bacteria. Rotavirus was detected in 291 children under 5 years old (32.4%), mostly from October to April. The major bacteria of coinfection with rotavirus were EPEC followed by Salmonella species. Salmonella species was the predominant bacterial pathogen of diarrhea of all ages, and rotavirus was the predominant pathogen among children under 5 years old. Further studies examining other types of pathogens for diarrhea and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine for children are needed in Lao PDR.

TI  - How to Specify an Electro-optical Earth Observation Camera? A Review of the Terminologies Used and its Interpretation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972, several earth observation satellites have been launched by government and private agencies. To select the optimum data for a specific application and for combining data from different sources require good clarity and understanding of various specifications provided by the sensor manufacturers. Many of the sensor parameters are not unambiguously defined in the product data-sheet. The paper reviews how the specifications adopted to describe various performance parameters of earth observation electro-optical camera are understood, and addresses the need for consistency in defining various specifications. The paper also proposes a figure-of-merit to compare various cameras for its target discrimination capability. A possible standard set of specifications are suggested, to be provided by all camera developers which would benefit both developers and users of such instruments.

TI  - Estimating nationwide cases of sexually transmitted diseases in 2015 from sentinel surveillance data in Japan
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The rates of newly diagnosed cases of sexually transmitted diseases, including genital chlamydial infection and gonorrhea, are important for prevention and control of these diseases. However, nationwide rates are not reported in Japan. Methods We used the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases reported by nationwide sentinel surveillance in 2015, together with the number of all disease outpatients in September 2014 at all medical institutions, drawn from the Survey of Medical Institutions of Japan. The number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the total population was estimated using the ratio estimation method with the number of all disease outpatients as auxiliary information. This method is currently used for estimating influenza cases from sentinel surveillance data in Japan. Results The estimated number of newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 population in 2015 in Japan was 244 (95% confidence interval 211-277) for genital chlamydial infection, 87 (95% confidence interval 74-100) for genital herpes, 61 (95% confidence interval 29-93) for condyloma acuminatum, and 89 (95% confidence interval 64-113) for gonorrhea. Conclusion We estimated the nationwide number of newly diagnosed cases of sexually transmitted diseases in Japan from sentinel surveillance data. This provides useful information for public health policy-making.

TI  - Learning curve for sentinel lymph node mapping in gynecologic malignancies
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Only a few studies have reported the learning curve for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in gynecologic malignancies. We investigated the learning curve for SLN detection during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for endometrial and cervical carcinomas. Methods This retrospective analysis included patients with stage IA to IIA1 cervical cancer or stage I to III endometrial cancer who underwent SLN mapping using indocyanine green during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery performed by a single surgeon. Learning curves were analyzed in consecutive cases using SLN detection rates and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method. Results SLN mapping was achieved in 81.25% (65/80), 77.50% (62/80), and 66.25% (53/80) of the cases involving the right, left, and simultaneous bilateral pelvic areas, respectively. Learning curve analysis based on the cumulative detection rate showed initial fluctuations followed by stabilization; the time required for proficiency was discordant among the LN regions. However, the CUSUM method showed proficient mapping of the right, left, and bilateral SLNs after 27 to 28 cases. Conclusion At least 27 cases were required for SLN mapping proficiency in gynecologic cancer; the learning period could influence the surgical quality. Further studies are warranted to confirm the impact of this learning curve on disease outcomes.

TI  - An Assessment of PBL Heights and Low Cloud Profiles in CAM5 and CAM5-CLUBB Over the Southeast Pacific Using Satellite Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Instantaneous satellite cloud top height (CTH) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation, as well as planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights corresponding to the minimum refractivity gradient (PBLHN) from GPS radio occultation over the Southeast Pacific, are jointly used for the first time to assess the ability of three versions of National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) to simulate low-level cloud extent and boundary layer heights. Observed CTH and PBLHN match most closely in the stratocumulus and stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition region, but CTH becomes lower than PBLHN since not all trade cumulus clouds reach the inversion. Simulated CTH and PBLHN are too shallow, but clouds with a new subgrid low cloud parameterization, Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CAM5-CLUBB), have a reduced bias, with the CTH-PBLHN distribution from Hi-Res CAM5-CLUBB, the most similar to observations. For PBLHN > 2.7 km, the base CAM5 model shows a bimodal cloud structure and surface-to-500 hPa ascent not seen in observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re analysis Interim data.

TI  - A reassessment of the discrepancies in the annual variation of δD-H<sub>2</sub>O in the tropical lower stratosphere between the MIPAS and ACE-FTS satellite data sets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual variation of delta D in the tropical lower stratosphere is a critical indicator for the relative importance of different processes contributing to the transport of water vapour through the cold tropical tropopause region into the stratosphere. Distinct observational discrepancies of the delta D annual variation were visible in the works of Steinwagner et al. (2010) and Randel et al. (2012). Steinwagner et al. (2010) analysed MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) observations retrieved with the IMK/IAA (Institut fur Meteorologie und Klimaforschung in Karlsruhe, Germany, in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia in Granada, Spain) processor, while Randel et al. (2012) focused on ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer) observations. Here we reassess the discrepancies based on newer MIPAS (IMK/IAA) and ACE-FTS data sets, also showing for completeness results from SMR (Sub-Millimetre Radiometer) observations and a ECHAM/MESSy (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Hamburg and Modular Earth Sub-model System) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) simulation (Eichinger et al., 2015b). Similar to the old analyses, the MIPAS data set yields a pronounced annual variation (maximum about 75 parts per thousand), while that derived from the ACE-FTS data set is rather weak (maximum about 25 parts per thousand). While all data sets exhibit the phase progression typical for the tape recorder, the annual maximum in the ACE-FTS data set precedes that in the MIPAS data set by 2 to 3 months. We critically consider several possible reasons for the observed discrepancies, focusing primarily on the MIPAS data set. We show that the delta D annual variation in the MIPAS data up to an altitude of 40 hPa is substantially impacted by a "start altitude effect", i.e. dependency between the lowermost altitude where MIPAS retrievals are possible and retrieved data at higher altitudes. In itself this effect does not explain the differences with the ACE-FTS data. In addition, there is a mismatch in the vertical resolution of the MIPAS HDO and H2O data (being consistently better for HDO), which actually results in an artificial tape-recorder-like signal in delta D. Considering these MIPAS characteristics largely removes any discrepancies between the MIPAS and ACE-FTS data sets and shows that the MIPAS data are consistent with a delta D tape recorder signal with an amplitude of about 25 parts per thousand in the lowermost stratosphere.

TI  - Informing Policy Change: A Study of Rapid Repeat Pregnancy in Adolescents to Increase Access to Immediate Postpartum Contraception
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP) is common among adolescents and is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Despite evidence that use of long-acting forms of contraception before hospital discharge can help minimize RRP rates, barriers to placement existed within the state of Indiana. We sought to determine state-specific RRP and induced abortion rates for adolescents based on chosen postpartum contraception to inform policy change. Methods: We examined a retrospective cohort of 227 adolescents (ages 12-18 years) who gave birth in Indiana between 2010 and 2012. Demographics, postpartum contraception, and subsequent pregnancies or abortions after the sentinel delivery were obtained. Rates of RRP based on type of immediate postpartum contraception, etonogestrel (ENG) contraceptive implant, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injection, and short-acting methods were compared. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: RRP rates were 3.7% for those with ENG contraceptive implant, 22.6% for those with DMPA, and 39.1% for those who choose short-acting methods (p = 0.01). Adolescents who did not choose an ENG contraceptive implant were significantly more likely to have an RRP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 11.8, 95% confidence interval: 2.74-110.3), compared with other contraceptive methods, even after adjusting for covariates such as age, prior pregnancies, and postpartum visit attendance. Conclusions: Immediate postpartum receipt of ENG implant was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of RRP in adolescents in Indiana. These data facilitated state policy change regarding insurance reimbursement to improve statewide access for all women, regardless of age, showing how local data can inform policy change.

TI  - Complex evolving patterns of mass loss from Antarctica's largest glacier
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine Island Glacier has contributed more to sea level rise over the past four decades than any other glacier in Antarctica. Model projections indicate that this will continue in the future but at conflicting rates. Some models suggest that mass loss could dramatically increase over the next few decades, resulting in a rapidly growing contribution to sea level and fast retreat of the grounding line, where the grounded ice meets the ocean. Other models indicate more moderate losses. Resolving this contrasting behaviour is important for sea level rise projections. Here, we use high-resolution satellite observations of elevation change since 2010 to show that thinning rates are now highest along the slow-flow margins of the glacier and that the present-day amplitude and pattern of elevation change is inconsistent with fast grounding-line migration and the associated rapid increase in mass loss over the next few decades. Instead, our results support model simulations that imply only modest changes in grounding-line location over that timescale. We demonstrate how the pattern of thinning is evolving in complex ways both in space and time and how rates in the fast-flowing central trunk have decreased by about a factor five since 2007.Thinning rates of Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica's largest glacier, are now highest in slowly flowing regions, suggesting that future changes in the grounding line may be more modest than thought, according to high-resolution satellite data.

TI  - Surgical Management of the Axilla in Patients with Occult Breast Cancer (cT0 N+) After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Occult breast cancer (OBC) is a rare clinical entity. Current surgical management includes axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) with or without mastectomy. We sought to investigate the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with OBC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods Patients with clinical T0N+ breast cancer were selected from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB, 2004-2014) and compared according to axillary surgical approach, SLNB (<= 4 LNs) or ALND (> 4 LNs). Primary outcome was overall survival (OS), calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Secondary outcome was complete pathological response (pCR). Results A total of 684 patients with OBC were identified: 470 (68.7%) underwent surgery upfront and 214 (31.3%) received NAC. Of the NAC patients, 34 (15.9%) underwent SLNB and 180 (84.1%) ALND. One hundred and fifty-three (72%) patients received radiotherapy (RT). There was no difference in pCR rates between the ALND and SLNB (34.3% vs 24.5%, respectively p = 0.245). In patients undergoing surgery first, improved OS was observed with ALND compared to SLNB (106.9 vs 85.5 months, p = 0.013); however, no difference in OS was found in patients who received NAC (105.6 vs 111.3 months, p = 0.640). RT improved OS in patients who underwent NAC followed by SLNB (RT, 123 months vs no RT, 64 months, p = 0.034). Of NAC patients who did not undergo RT, ALND had superior survival compared to SLNB (113 vs 64 months, p = 0.013). Conclusion This is the first comparative analysis assessing the surgical management of the axilla in patients with OBC who underwent NAC. In this population, there was a decrease in survival in patients who underwent SLNB alone; however, with the addition of RT, there was no difference in OS between SLNB and ALND. SLNB plus RT may be considered as an alternative to ALND in patients with OBC who have a good response to NAC.

TI  - Thermal Remote Sensing for Global Volcano Monitoring: Experiences From the MIROVA System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic activity is always accompanied by the transfer of heat from the Earth's crust to the atmosphere. This heat can be measured from space and its measurement is a very useful tool for detecting volcanic activity on a global scale. MIROVA (Middle Infrared Observation of Volcanic Activity) is an automatic volcano hot spot detection system, based on the analysis of MODIS data (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The system is able to detect, locate and quantify thermal anomalies in near real-time, by providing, on a dedicated website (www.mirovaweb.it), infrared images and thermal flux time-series on over 200 volcanoes worldwide. Thanks to its simple interface and intuitive representation of the data, MIROVA is currently used by several volcano observatories for daily monitoring activities and reporting. In this paper, we present the architecture of the system and we provide a state of the art on satellite thermal data usage for operational volcano monitoring and research. In particular, we describe the contribution that the thermal data have provided in order to detect volcanic unrest, to forecast eruptions and to depict trends and patterns during eruptive crisis. The current limits and requirements to improve the quality of the data, their distribution and interpretation are also discussed, in the light of the experience gained in recent years within the volcanological community. The results presented clearly demonstrate how the open access of satellite thermal data and the sharing of derived products allow a better understanding of ongoing volcanic phenomena, and therefore constitute an essential requirement for the assessment of volcanic hazards.

TI  - Tackling coastal "overfishing" in Fiji: advocating for indigenous worldview, knowledge, and values to be the backbone of fisheries management strategies
T2  - MARITIME STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, natural resource management programmes are expected to integrate the holistic environmental knowledge of the indigenous people concerned, and this is supposed to significantly contribute to the empowerment of the latter. Yet, social science studies have established that, in practice, this is not automatically the case. Based on anthropological research in Fiji (South Pacific), this paper aims to contribute, through a specific focus on fisheries management, to the challenging of the power asymmetries still underlying most endeavours to combine indigenous knowledge systems and western ecological science. In particular, it highlights that the concept of "overfishing"-a decisive driver of today's coastal and reef fisheries management efforts in Fiji and beyond-tends to veil the "connectedness in all things" that is at the core of the indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) epistemology, articulated around the vernacular concept of vanua. In the frame of this concept, human and fish behaviours are intrinsically interrelated, not only from ecological and economic perspectives but also through fundamental sociocultural, spiritual, and political relationships. The authors therefore advocate for a framing of coastal and reef fisheries management efforts that systematically (1) builds upon the iTaukei relational ontology and knowledge system and (2) involves the local customary and religious leaders in accordance with their own worldview and values.

TI  - Surgical Management of Early Cervical Cancer: When Is Laparoscopic Appropriate?
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review This paper reviews the recent literature data on minimally invasive surgical approach to early cervical cancer compared to abdominal approach, with the aim of evaluate the oncological outcomes and the appropriateness of current indications. Recent Findings A recent multicenter randomized controlled trial and a concurrent large epidemiological study, contrary to the previous retrospective data, showed that minimally invasive surgery is associated with significantly poorer survival than the open approach. Open surgery is to be considered the standard of care for early cervical cancer as implemented in the current guidelines, and the patients must be carefully counseled if minimally invasive surgery is offered. Minimally invasive surgery can be considered safe only for sentinel lymph node mapping in a fertility-sparing setting and could be considered after preoperative conization and for small tumors, adopting preventive surgical maneuvers and in reference centers. However, prospective evidences about the suggested indications are not yet available.
