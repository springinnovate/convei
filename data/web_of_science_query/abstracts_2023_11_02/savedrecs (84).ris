AB  - Degree days have been determined using temperature data measured at nearby weather stations to a site of interest to produce information for supporting decision-making on agricultural production. Alternatively, the data products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used for estimation of degree days in a given region, e.g., Korean Peninsula. The objective of this study was to develop a simple tool for processing the MODIS product for estimating cooling degree days (CDD), which would help assessment of heat stress conditions for a crop as well as energy requirement for greenhouses. A set of scripts written in R was implemented to obtain temperature profile data for the region of interest. These scripts had functionalities for processing spatial data, which include reprojection, mosaicking, and cropping. A module to extract air temperature at the surface pressure level was also developed using R extension packages such as rgdal and RcppArmadillo. Random forest (RF) models, which estimate mean temperature and CDD with a different set of MODIS data, were trained at 34 sites in South Korea during 2009 - 2018. Then, the values of CDD were calculated over Korean peninsula during the same period using those RF models. It was found that the CDD estimates using the MODIS data explained >74% of the variation in the CDD measurements at the weather stations in North Korea as well as South Korea. These results indicate that temperature data derived from the MODIS atmospheric products would be useful for reliable estimation of CDD. Our results also suggest that the MODIS data can be used for preparation of weather input data for other temperature-based agro-ecological models such as growing degree days or chill units.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to understand the series of cultural liturgy written by J. K. A. Smith, professor of Philosophy at Calvin university. Through his three volumes, he attempted to depict what Christian education and Christian formation should look like when it is based on a more holistic view of human beings in accord with Scriptures and his philosophical anthropology. He envisions a new way of approaching Christian education by restoring the relationship between worship and Christian education in that the human being is viewed primarily homo adorans. He does so by engaging in critical reflection on so-called 'a worldview model' highly upheld in Christian educational fields. He gives preeminence and primacy to affect over cognition in order to explain how human beings operate in the world, and suggests that human beings are narrative beings and bodily creatures. They are directed by the ultimate desires and telos more than by what they consciously think. Therefore, based on the view of human beings as homo adorans, he argues that the purpose of Christian education is sanctification of perception and acquisition of social imaginary inspired by story-filled worship and Christian habitus through participation in repetitive practice and liturgy in which people can immerse themselves in Christian narratives. To offer re-enchanted Christianity is a great service to our disenchanted secular world.

TI  - Analysis on the long-term variance of surface urban heat island (SUHI) using Landsat thermal infrared: in case of the city of Seoul
T2  - 한국지적정보학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - Unique heat sources different from peripheral rural areas are formed in urban areas due to impermeable surfaces and thermal peculiarities of absorbance processes. Urban heat island is a symptom that displays higher temperature in urban areas, compared to rural areas. Rural areas surrounding urban areas generate temperature differences. Land surface temperature consisting of two areas is leaded by the pattern of land use and land cover. A Land surface temperature is estimated, and are used as an index to evaluate urban heat island. Accumulated land surface temperature information from long-term studies could be important quantitative data to understand the progress and current situation in urban heat island. In this study, the Landsat thermal infrared sensors of the remote sensing satellite that cover from 1994 to 2015 are utilized to identify long-term changes of the surface urban heat island and its trends in the study area of Seoul, Korea. Each satellite image is used to measure surface temperature, and produce land cover/land use map simultaneously. However, atmospheric mutual responses produced in surface observation with optical satellite remote sensing cause inaccurate results affected by information contamination. In this study, the cosine approximation model atmospheric correction in visible and near infrared bands and single channel algorithm in thermal infrared band are conducted to secure valid information level in the process of surface urban heat island calculation. surface urban heat island in Seoul for 20 years was gradually increased from the results of this study. In case of especially celestial longitude classified from 45 to 120 in the period from May 5 to August 23 every year, surface urban heat island was increased from 2.51 to 3.98. It was identified that its incremental progress has high statistical correlations.

AB  - We analyzed ALOS-2 and TerraSAR-X SAR images to interpret and qualify the tendency of the displacement caused by the 6th Nuclear Test of North Korea at Mt. Mantap. 3-D true displacement vectors around the rim of the explosion were obtained by using three interferograms from different tracks of ALOS-2. It indicates a uniform explosive tendency of up to 25cm in the east to west direction. The movement of the ruptured zone where interferometric coherence is completely lost was detected by visual inspection and offset tracking technique using two pairs of TerraSAR-X images acquired in descending and ascending orbits. The major tendency of the motion on slopes covered with vegetation was mostly towards the direction of gravity. However, many stable features that haven't moved at all were observed corresponding to outcrops and bedrock. It implies that the motion of displacements was mostly the landslides of the topsoil and boulder stones.

AB  - This study focuses on developing FMI and TMI through looking at the MODIS data on forest fires that occurred in inaccessible areas for 2011 to 2015 years. In order to do this, 1,469 fire ignition points were extracted from 3,637 fire spots. The ratio of forest fires for each of forest types showed 59.4% (deciduous), 21.7\% (evergreen), and 18.9% (mixed). In terms of altitude and aspect, the fire frequency was the highest at 56.3% under 550m and 18.9% in the southeast. The results of calculating the FMI and the TMI by the weight of the fire frequency, the deciduous forest showed FMI 10, FMI 4 in evergreen forest and mixed forest showed FMI 3. The highest TMI of 10 has an altitude index of 5.0 under 550m and a southeast aspect index of 5.0. On the other hand, the altitude index of 1,537m or more was 0.5, and the aspect index of northeast, east, and south was 1.0, which was the lowest of FMI 1.5. Thus, this study results will be useful for decision-makers to prevent forest fires in accessible areas, and when coming up with system to do intensive monitoring of the fire risk areas.

TI  - Dialog State Tracking for Unseen Values Using an Extended Attention Mechanism
T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SPOKEN DIALOGUE SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on Spoken Dialogue Systems Technology (IWSDS)
CL  - Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB  - Recently, discriminative models using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown good performance for dialog state tracking (DST). However, the models have difficulty in handling new dialog states unseen in model training. This paper proposes a fully data-driven approach to DST that can deal with unseen dialog states. The approach is based on an RNN with an attention mechanism. The model integrates two variants of RNNs: a decoder that detects an unseen value from a user's utterance using cosine similarity between word vectors of the user's utterance and that of the unseen value; and a sentinel mixture architecture that merges estimated dialog states of the previous turn and the current turn. We evaluated the proposed method using the second and the third dialog state tracking challenge (DSTC 2 and DSTC 3) datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved DST accuracy of 80.0% for all datasets and 61.2% for only unseen dataset without hand-crafted rules and re-training. For the unseen dataset, the use of the cosine similarity-based decoder leads to a 26.0-point improvement from conventional neural network-based DST. Moreover, the integration of the cosine similarity-based decoder and the sentinel mixture architecture leads to a further 2.1-point improvement.

TI  - Skeleton Transformer Networks: 3D Human Pose and Skinned Mesh from Single RGB Image
T2  - COMPUTER VISION - ACCV 2018, PT IV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV)
CL  - Perth, AUSTRALIA
AB  - In this paper, we present Skeleton Transformer Networks (SkeletonNet), an end-to-end framework that can predict not only 3D joint positions but also 3D angular pose (bone rotations) of a human skeleton from a single color image. This in turn allows us to generate skinned mesh animations. Here, we propose a two-step regression approach. The first step regresses bone rotations in order to obtain an initial solution by considering skeleton structure. The second step performs refinement based on heatmap regressor using a 3D pose representation called cross heatmap which stacks heatmaps of xy and zy coordinates. By training the network using the proposed 3D human pose dataset that is comprised of images annotated with 3D skeletal angular poses, we showed that SkeletonNet can predict a full 3D human pose (joint positions and bone rotations) from a single image in-the-wild.

AB  - Lockheed Martin's Space Object Tracking (SpOT) facility consists of three 1meter telescopes in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The telescope mounts are capable of slewing fast enough to rate-track Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, and have enough sensitivity to detect dim objects in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO).During 2018, the SpOT facility has been operating predominantly as an autonomous Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system. This paper presents a summary of the data captured in the autonomous operational campaign. The imagery content is further analyzed with the use of a Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT) that was able to identify signals and characterize them as stars, objects, or noise.SpOT observed over 3,600 satellite passes between February and August of 2018. Of the 1,300 imagery sets collected on rocket bodies with similar characteristics, the MET identified 350 stars and 2048 satellite tracks with a type I error rate less than 0.1%.

TI  - A Phase Filter for Multi-Pass InSAR Stack Data by Hybrid Tensor Rank Representation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) stack data denoising is a significant prerequisite for extracting geophysical parameters. InSAR stack data can be considered as a third-order tensor in the complex domain, and the process of tensor decomposition to acquire the low-rank tensor has been employed as an effective interferometric phase filter for InSAR stack data. It is noted that the definition of tensor rank is the core of tensor-based filter. In this paper, we investigate the properties of Tucker rank, CANDECAMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and Kronecker Basis Representation (KBR) in InSAR stack data, and then we found that it is suitable to extend KBR, as a hybrid tensor rank representation, into InSAR tensor filtering. Firstly, an improved InSAR phase tensor model is utilized to represent the phenomenon of interferometric phase, which perceives the observed InSAR phase tensor as the combination of low-rank, sparse noise and Gaussian noise tensors. Based on the principle of KBR, then the novel phase filtering method, named as KBR-InSAR, is proposed to decompose the complex InSAR tensor supported by the improved InSAR phase tensor model. With the comparison of other tensor filters, i.e. HoRPCA and WHoRPCA and the widespread traditional filters operating on a single interferometric pair, e.g. Goldstein, NL-SAR, NL-InSAR and InSAR-BM3D, it can be proved that the KBR-InSAR can efficiently reduce the noise with superior fringes preservation in the experiments on the simulated and real InSAR stack data collected from Sentinel-1B.

AB  - This paper examines the theological messages and educational values of the initiation process practiced in the Church of Jerusalem in the fourth century and suggests its implications on the Korean Protestant churches.The initiation process is reconstructed based on Cyril’s catechetical lectures, which include procatechesis, catecheses, and mystagogical catecheses, and Egeria’s documents. The process consists of three stages―pre-baptism, baptism, and post-baptism, and is characterized as a sacred socialization designed with tightly organized instructions and rites. This whole process highlights metanoia and sanctification―a catechumen’s renunciation of Satan’s reign and acceptance of God’s reign, followed by transformation of her/his worldview, values, ethical beliefs, and lifestyle.

AB  - In order to investigate the density of seasonal incidence of mosquitoes, a vector of infectious diseases in Jeju region, this study collected mosquitoes using a Black light trap (BL) and Biogents’ Sentinel 2 Mosquito Trap (BG), dividing the region into cattle sheds, habitats for migratory birds, and the downtown area, twice a month for 9 months from March through November 2018. Then, this study conducted identification and classification and checked for the presence of Flavivirus using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As for the mosquito population, 1,847 mosquitoes (six genera, 12 species) were collected. The places where most mosquitoes were collected were copses near craft workshops in habitats for migratory birds and Jungang-dong in the Seogwipo downtown area. For the population, Culex pipiens pallens was the dominant species (76.9%), followed by Aedes albopictus (8.9%). Most of the population was collected in June, followed by August and October. This study conducted a RT-PCR test with 1,847 collected mosquitoes, which were divided into 50 pools if they had Flavivirus. All turned out to be negative. However, the results of the investigation show the presence of Culex tritaineniorhychus, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles sinensis and can be used as a basis for the comprehensive prevention management of mosquitoes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, large-scale net primary productivity (NPP) estimation and its impact feature variables are drawing more and more attention. Traditional process-based and empirical models are limited by their model structure and input variable design. The available field measurement data are limited by their small coverage. We propose to train an NPP calculation model using random forest and quantify the influence of multiple meteorological features on NPP. The calculated NPP correlates well with the MODIS product (correlation coefficient higher than 0.8). The importance rankings of multiple features are related to the local economy and development strategy of research areas. In developed areas, vegetation indexes are the most important, while in developing areas, land classification type influences NPP the most. The experiments suggest random forest is promising for estimating NPP and useful in analysing the impact features in terms of global change.

AB  - Decapterus maruadsi is a small pelagic fish and is of great significance to the ecosystems in the northern South China Sea. We collected and analyzed the data recorded by the fishing vessels in the western Guangdong waters in winter and summer and remote sensing data including sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) and sea level anomalies (SLA) from 2011 to 2015, using generalized additive model (GAM). Results showed that the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of D. maruadsi in the western Guangdong waters had a significant positive linear correlation with longitude, and the D. maruadsi populations were concentrated in the east of the study area. The total explanation of D. maruadsi CPUE in GAMs was 47.40%, among which, the factors year, month, lunar phase, latitude, Chl a, SLA and water depth explained 9.30%, 13.50%, 6.50%, 1.90%, 1.70%, 4.60%, and 9.90%, respectively. The D. maruadsi populations in the study were concentrated in the area of latitude 21 degrees N, Chl a 0.1- 0.5 mg.m(-3), SLA -0.05 m and water depth 80 m. Results of this work will help in understanding the environmental factors affecting D. maruadsi distribution in the western Guangdong waters.

TI  - STUDY ON A SINGLE INTERPOLATION FUSION ALGORITHM FOR MULTISOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA OF SOIL MOISTURE
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of soil moisture can provide important data for monitoring large-scale agricultural drought. Due to differences between the various sensors and inversion methods, remote sensing data from different sources are unsuitable for direct comparison and analysis. Data fusion has become an area of active research regarding the application of remote sensing data. Based on the principle of cumulative distribution function matching, this study proposed a continuous relationship establishment algorithm for multisource remote sensing soil moisture data. Using this new algorithm, soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Climate Change Initiative (CCI) satellite data from the Songnen Plain as test data were fused to a long time series product of real-time remote sensing soil moisture data. This application validation of this new method to SMOS and CCI indicated that this Lagrange interpolation continuous fusion algorithm could improve the fusion accuracy of multisource remote sensing soil moisture data significantly. The low -value region of the cumulative probability distribution curve is a crucial data segment for characterization of agricultural drought. Through implementation of the proposed continuous fusion algorithm, fused SMOS and CCI data were found to have high coincidence at each quantile in the low -value region of the curve.

TI  - Prevalence of rotavirus and rapid changes in circulating rotavirus strains among children with acute diarrhea in China, 2009-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. In China, the universal immunization of children with the rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced, and the two globally distributed vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) are not licensed in the country. We aim to determine the prevalence and strain diversity of rotavirus in children with diarrhea aged <= five years across China.Materials and methods: Sentinel-based surveillance of acute diarrhea was conducted at 213 participating hospitals in China from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2015. Group A rotavirus (RVA) was tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and G- and P-genotype of RVA were tested by RT-PCR methods.Results: Of 33,616 children with diarrhea, 10,089 (30%) were positive for RVA; RVA-associated diarrhea was identified in 2247 (39.5%, n=2247/5685) inpatients and 7842 (28.1%, n=7842/27931) outpatients. Children living in low-middle-income regions suffered from the highest burden of rotavirus, with 40.7% of diarrhea cases attributed to rotavirus infection, followed by 31.3% in upper-middle-income and 11.2% in high-income regions. The majority of children (88.9%, n=8976/10089) who tested positive for RVA were children aged <= 2 years. The seasonal peak of RVA was in the winter. Among all 2533 RVA strains genotyped, five strain combinations, G9P[8], G3P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and G3P[4], contributed to 71.3% (1807/2533) of the RVA-associated diarrhea cases. The predominant strain of RVA has rapidly evolved from G3P[8] and G1P[8] to G9P[8] in the recent years, with the proportion of G9P[8] having increased remarkably from 3.4% in 2009 to 60.9% in 2015.Conclusions: The burden of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus is high in China, highlighting the potential value of vaccination. The rapid shift of RVA strains highlights the importance of conducting rotavirus surveillance to ensure that currently marketed vaccines provide protective efficacy against the circulating strains.

TI  - Long-term vegetation changes in four types of wetland in China and USA between 2000 and 2011: observations from MODIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation assessment is a critical component of evaluating wetland protective policies and providing useful information for global climate change research. In this study, four types of wetland are chosen to evaluate their long-term changes and potential linkage to anthropogenic (e. g., agricultural activities) and natural influences (e. g., hydrometeorological effects). These wetland types include the Yancheng wetland (coastal wetland), the Chongming wetland (river wetland), the Hongze Lake wetland (lake wetland) and the Everglades wetland (marsh wetland) in the contrasting environments of China and USA. The vegetation coverages of these wetlands were evaluated from 2000 to 2011 by using over 2,200 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m resolution images. Four vegetation indices (VIs) were compared to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing relative changes: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Floating Algae Index (FAI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Visible Atmospherically Resistance Index (VARI). FAI performance was relatively insensitive in terms of both the statistical error and the aerosol effects compared with other VIs and was thus chosen to study the long-term vegetation changes. The results showed that 1) agricultural influence appeared to be relatively minimal compared with hydrometeorological effects in the Everglades wetland and in the core partitions of the Yancheng, Chongming, and Hongze Lake wetlands over the 12-year period, and 2) the entire partitions of the Yancheng, Chongming and Hongze Lake wetlands showed noticeable influences from agricultural activities in addition to natural variability. The cost-effective method that we demonstrate in this study may be extended to other wetlands near the same geographical location and to other satellite platforms.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) in Korea, referring to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance (GPG) (2003), and propose a method for the systematic construction of statistics for LULUCF. Land-use changes across six categories, including settlement, forest, cropland, grassland, wetland, and other land types, were analyzed using digital topographic, land cover, and land zone maps from the Korea Land Information System (KLIS) using Landsat TM satellite images as primary data. The results of this study indicate that a classification system for each LULUCF category should be established to improve the statistical accuracy of this data and spatial big data applications for land-use analysis should be developed. Furthermore, a method is proposed for the systematic construction of statistics for LULUCF to determine the Korean national greenhouse gas inventory. An explanation of the recommended approach, including gathering satellite image data, LULUCF classifications, and establishing land-use change statistics, is presented. To fulfill the emission reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement, these greenhouse gas emission statistics are essential for different sectors to establish the diverse policies and action plans required to be effective. This will make the national-level monitoring of LULUCF more efficient, leading to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emission.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - It is challenging to estimate wind speed of tropical cyclones directly using remote sensing image patterns. This paper approaches the task in two major steps: cyclone category estimation and wind speed regression. A novel framework based on Tensor Convolutional Neural Network (Tensor CNN) is proposed to solve the problem. Not only does the framework combine Tensor analysis for dimensionality reduction and deep neural networks for pattern recognition, the Tensor CNN also provides a unitary and concise mathematical representation form of the two significant models. The proposed framework is able to categorize cyclones by classification based on the Tensor CNN as well as exploit the estimated categories and predict the wind speed by a successive regression model. Experiments are conducted on multispectral imagery acquired by the FY-4 Satellite. Results show that the framework outperforms several classic models in cyclone category estimation and one state-of-the-art method, Deviation Angle Variance Technique (DAVT), in wind speed regression.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three Rivers Headwaters Region (TRHR) plays a key role in regulating water supply and climate of East Asia. A comprehensive understanding of the processes and driving forces of the long-term land use dynamics of the TRHR is needed to guide sustainable land resource management and regional ecological conservation strategies. This study examined long-term land change patterns in the TRHR and investigated the driving forces of the change. First, Landsat TM/ETM+ images covering TRHR of four time points from 1987 to 2016 were used to derive land use patterns, and statistical metrics were applied to quantify the spatial and temporal changes. Second, Principal Component Analysis and correlation analysis were employed to analyze environmental and social-economic data to identify the driving forces of land use change. Third, potential influences of the religion of Tibetan Buddhism on land use change were explored using GIS analysis, questionnaire survey and field observation. Results showed that areas of barren land, agricultural land, and built-up land largely increased, while areas of grassland and forest greatly decreased, with the highest change rate occurring in the most recent decade of analysis (from 2007 to 2016). Among the three headwater regions, the Yellow River Headwater Region showed an overall higher changing speed than the other two headwater regions. The regional driving forces of change in TRHR included social-economic development, climatic condition, pressure of population growth, and environmental protection activities. It was also found that Tibetan Buddhism can help slow down the changes caused by human activities.

AB  - Land surface shortwave downward radiation (SWDR) is generally defined as incident solar energy over land surfaces in the shortwave spectrum (300-3000nm). As one of important parameter of the land surface radiation budget (SRB) and many land process models, it is usually required as part of the input variables to address a large variety of scientific application issues in fields of agricultural management, climate trends, ecological forecasting, reusable energy production, public health and so on. Currently, regional or global SWDR can be estimated from polar-orbiting or geostationary satellite observations based on empirical or physical-based retrieval models. These remote-sensed SWDR products with fine spatial resolution provide us valuable information about a series of critical Earth science problems and enable us to gain more insight into the planet we live on. In this paper, an improved method was proposed based on a look-up table approach via MODTRAN-5 simulations to estimate clear-sky instantaneous SWDR and its direct component from TOA radiance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) observation. Ground measurements from seven SURFRAD sites are used for validating the algorithm and the result shows good accuracy. This approach is suitable for producing clear-sky instantaneous SWDR and its direct component at the spatial resolution of finer than 5 km.

TI  - AgileSAR: Achieving Wide-Swath Spaceborne SAR Based on Time-Space Sampling
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution and wide swath, which are related to imaging quality and observation efficiency, are the key specifications for spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Owing to the restrictions of the Nyquist sampling theorem, it is difficult to improve both specifications simultaneously. The increase of the swath width often leads to the decrease of the spatial resolution, e.g., in scanning SAR and terrain observation with progressive scan SAR. For a sparse scene, an image containing only a few targets has massive data but little useful information. This paper proposes a novel SAR observation mode, AgileSAR, which is based on the time-space sampling method and can overcome the limitations of the Nyquist theorem. It also increases the swath width while preserving the resolution of the sparse scene. AgileSAR steers the antenna beam towards a different sub-swath, generally after one or two pulse intervals, and the average pulse repetition rate corresponding to every sub-swath is much lower than that determined by the Nyquist theorem. Compared with Sentinel-1, which can achieve 5-m resolution and 80-km swath, a single azimuth-channel AgileSAR system can achieve 5-m resolution and 300-km swath for a sparse scene, once the corresponding system parameters are designed. The l(1) relaxation method is used to reconstruct sparse SAR images, and the reconstruction performance is quantitatively analyzed based on the estimation error. The simulation results validating the proposed method with sub-Nyquist samples can achieve approximately similar performance as conventional SAR with Nyquist samples.

AB  - To promote uranium exploration in Chaganhada and provide remote sensing alteration anomaly information, this paper extracted chlorite alteration and iron-strained alteration by principal component analysis on the basis of analysis of wall rocks related to uranium mineralization and spectral characteristics of the typical alteration minerals in WorldView-3(shorthand for WV-3 in the following) bands. Then, the alteration information extracted was made processing on the ArcGIS platform, and an integrated anomalous information figure was compiled. The results of field verification show that the alteration anomaly information which extracted from WV-3 data is consistent with the reality. And the alteration anomaly information should be taken as one of the important clues in the uranium exploration in this area.

TI  - Natural forests exhibit higher carbon sequestration and lower water consumption than planted forests in China
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale planted forests (PF) have been given a higher priority in China for improving the environment and mitigating climate change relative to natural forests (NF). However, the ecological consequences of these PF on water resource security have been less considered in the national scale. Moreover, a critically needed comparison on key ecological effects between PF and NF under climate change has rarely been conducted. Here, we compare carbon sequestration and water consumption in PF and NF across China using combination of remote sensing and field inventory. We found that, on average, NF consumed 6.8% (37.5 mm per growing season) less water but sequestered 1.1% (12.5 g C m(-2) growing season(-1)) more carbon than PF in the period of 2000-2012. While there was no significant difference in water consumption (p = 0.6) between PF and NF in energy-limited areas (dryness index [DI] < 1), water consumption was significantly (p 0.001) higher in PF than that in NF in water-limited regions (DI > 1). Moreover, a distinct and larger shift of water yield was identified in PF than in NF from the 1980s to the 2000s, indicating that PF were more sensitive to climate change, leading to a higher water consumption when compared with NF. Our results suggest NF should be properly valued in terms of maximizing the benefits of carbon sequestration and water yield. Future forest plantation projects should be planned with caution, particularly in water-limited regions where they might have less positive effect on carbon sequestration but lead to significant water yield reduction.

AB  - A crucial step for mRNA polyadenylation is poly(A) signal recognition by trans-acting factors. The mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex components CPSF30 and WD repeat-containing protein33 (WDR33) recognize the canonical AAUAAA for polyadenylation. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the flowering time regulator FY is the homolog of WDR33. However, its role in mRNA polyadenylation is poorly understood. Using poly(A) tag sequencing, we found that >50% of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events are altered in fy single mutants or double mutants with oxt6 (a null mutant of AtCPSF30), but mutation of the FY WD40-repeat has a stronger effect than deletion of the plant-unique Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro-Pro (PPLPP) domain. fy mutations disrupt AAUAAA or AAUAAA-like poly(A) signal recognition. Notably, A-rich signal usage is suppressed in the WD40-repeat mutation but promoted in PPLPP-domain deficiency. However, fy mutations do not aggravate the altered signal usage in oxt6 Furthermore, the WD40-repeat mutation shows a preference for 3' untranslated region shortening, but the PPLPP-domain deficiency shows a preference for lengthening. Interestingly, the WD40-repeat mutant exhibits shortened primary roots and late flowering with alteration of APA of related genes. Importantly, the long transcripts of two APA genes affected in fy are related to abiotic stress responses. These results reveal a conserved and specific role of FY in mRNA polyadenylation.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) classification using satellite images is an important approach to monitor changes on earth. To produce LULC maps, supervised classification methods are often used. For many supervised classification algorithms, independence of features is an implied assumption. However, this assumption is rarely tested. For LULC classification, using all bands as input features to models is the default approach. However, some of the bands may be highly correlated, which may cause model performances unstable. In this research, correlations and multicollinearity among multi-spectral bands are analyzed for four major LULC types, i.e. cropland, forest, developed area and water bodies. Guided by the correlation analysis, different band combinations were used to train Support Vector Machines (SVM) for four-class LULC classification and the results were compared. From our experiments, hand 4, 5, 6 is the best three-band combination and band 1, 2, 5, 7 is the best four-band combination which achieved almost identical performance as using all bands for LULC classification.

TI  - Determining the Optimal Shape-Related Indicator on Noncontrast Computed Tomography for Predicting Hematoma Expansion in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among several novel predictors on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) for hematoma expansion in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), shape irregularity grade, satellite sign, and island sign are all related to irregular shape of hematoma. This study is aimed to compare the accuracy of these imaging markers for predicting hematoma expansion in the same cohort of sICH patients.METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled sICH patients who underwent diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans within 6 hours after onset and another follow-up CT scan within 24 hours after initial CT scan. Shape irregularity grade, satellite sign, and island sign were assessed according to the definitions in previous studies. The accuracy of these imaging indicators for predicting hematoma expansion was analyzed using receiver operator analysis.RESULTS: Finally, a total of 196 patients were included. Shape irregularity grade >= 3 was found in 87 (44.39%) patients, satellite sign was identified in 76 (38.78%) patients, and island sign was shown in only 41 (20.92%) patients. Only island sign remained an independent predictor for hematoma expansion in multivariate logistic regression. The sensitivity values of shape irregularity grade >= 3, satellite sign, and island sign were 0.52, 0.63, and 0.48, respectively. By contrast, the specificity values of these 3 predictors were 0.58, 0.69, and 0.85, respectively. Shape irregularity grade >= 3 had the smallest area under the curve (0.597), and island sign had the largest (0.676).CONCLUSIONS: Island sign seems to be the optimal shape-related predictor for hematoma expansion in sICH patients and could be included in the future predictive model for hematoma expansion.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very interesting and important to determine the function model for remote-sensing data. The existing statistical and artificial intelligence models still have some defects. The statistical models rely heavily on prior knowledge and cannot objectively reflect the real function model contained in the remote-sensing data. In addition, the existing artificial intelligence models can very easily fall into the local optimum and have a low efficiency for high-dimensional remote-sensing data. In this paper, we first decrease the complexity of remote-sensing data by using rough sets and propose an attribute reduction algorithm based on rough sets for remote-sensing data (ARRS-RSD). On the basis of the algorithm, this paper presents a function mining algorithm for remote-sensing data by using gene expression programming and rough sets (FMRS-ARGEP). In FMRS-ARGEP, a dynamic population generation policy and a new mutation operation based on self-adaptive rate adjustment are introduced to improve the convergence of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of the average running time, the number of condition attributes after reduction, the attribute reduction ratio, the average convergence speed, the number of convergences, and the R-2 value of the model.

AB  - Severe convective weather is a catastrophic weather that can cause great harm to the public. One of the key studies for meteorological practitioners is how to recognize severe convection weather accurately and effectively, and it is also an important issue in government climate risk management. However, most existing methods extract features from satellite data by classifying individual pixels instead of using tightly integrated spatial information, ignoring the fact the clouds are highly dynamic. In this paper, we propose a new classification model, which is based on image segmentation of deep learning. And it uses U-net architecture as the technology platform to identify all weather conditions in the datasets accurately. As heavy rainfall is one of the most frequent and widespread server weather hazards, when the storms come ashore with high speed of wind, it makes the precipitation time longer and causes serious damage in turn. Therefore, we suggest a new evaluation metric to evaluate the performance of detecting heavy rainfall. Compared with existing methods, the model based on Himawari-8 dataset has a better performance. Further, we explore the representations learned by our model in order to better understand this important dataset. The results play a crucial role in the prediction of climate change risks and the formulation of government policies on climate change.

AB  - Monitoring the spatial pattern and growth of sugarcane timely and accurately is of great importance at regional and global scales. In this paper, the focus was on sugarcane identification in Southern China with FuSui country as the study area. Classification was based on sentinel-1 different polarizations and sugarcane phenology. In order to explore the optimum periods and polar metric characters, time series of C-band dual polarization sentinel-1 data in 2017 totally 130 images were collected over the whole sugarcane growth season. Then the growth curve was built based on the former exploration. After that, there was a following analysis by combining growth curve and polarimetric characters of sugarcane, which contributes to setting attribute to identity. At last, the advanced rules were built to identify sugarcane according to growth curve above and subordinating degree function. Sugarcane extraction accuracy was verified by numerous ground data. The conclusions are as follows: (1)The results of this study show the importance of using C-hand muti-temporal dual polarization data on crop identification especially for sugarcane comparing with traditional optical data. In other words, it's crucial for crop identification to extract the backscattering coefficient. When combining with a part of samples, the curve of crop growth used for classification can be portrayed. To deepen the difference between sugarcane and other typical features, additional three kinds of reference object like eucalyptus, water and buildings, all of which distributes in the experimental area, with an extensive representation. (2)The analysis of polarimetric characters has shown that the inherent SAR backscatter feature VH is superior in classification accuracy to the VV, which achieved an accuracy of 88.07%. During the stage of seedling and tillering, the amplitude from sugarcane is higher than that in other objects, proving the advantage of VV in sugarcane identification. On the contrary, the giant grass and aiphyllium appearing stable in sequential variation, corresponding banana and eucalyptus respectively. (3)Moreover, the sugarcane has shown strong difference in March when it comes to the optimum periods, the data is more sensitive to the change of sugarcane. There was an evidently reduction as time goes by, so choosing the data from March makes higher accuracy. Therefore, the data from March with the polarimetric character VH was used as the optimum periods.

TI  - Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Sparse Dictionary Learning Method of Capped Norm
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral anomaly detection is a research hot spot in the field of remote sensing. It can distinguish abnormal targets from the scene just by utilizing the spectral differences and requiring no prior information. A series of anomaly detectors based on Reed-Xiaoli methods are very important and typical algorithms in this research area, which generally have the hypothesis about background subject to the Gaussian distribution. However, this assumption is inaccurate to describe a hyperspectral image with a complex scene in practice. Besides, due to the unavoidable existence of abnormal targets, background statistics will be affected which will reduce the detection performance. To address these problems, we propose a sparse dictionary learning method by using a capped norm to realize hyperspectral anomaly detection. Moreover, a new training data selection strategy based on clustering technique is also proposed to learn a more representative background dictionary. The main contributions are concluded in threefold: 1) neither making any assumptions on the background distribution nor computing the covariance matrix, the proposed method is more adaptive to all kinds of complex hyperspectral images in practice; 2) owing to the good qualities of the capped norm, the learned sparse background dictionary is resistant to the effect of anomalies and has stronger distinctiveness to anomalies from background; 3) without using the traditional sliding hollow window technique, the proposed method is more effective to detect different sizes of abnormal targets. The extensive experiments on four commonly used real-world hyperspectral images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superiority over the benchmark methods.

TI  - A New Framework for Modelling and Monitoring the Conversion of Cultivated Land to Built-up Land Based on a Hierarchical Hidden Semi-Markov Model Using Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of farmland loss caused by urban expansion has been a severe global environmental problem. Therefore, monitoring urban encroachment upon farmland is a global issue. In this study, we propose a novel framework for modelling and monitoring the conversion of cultivated land to built-up land using a satellite image time series (SITS). The land-cover change process is modelled by a two-level hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model, which is composed of two Markov chains with hierarchical relationships. The upper chain represents annual land-cover dynamics, and the lower chain encodes the vegetation phenological patterns of each land-cover type. This kind of architecture enables us to represent the multilevel semantic information of SITS at different time scales. Specifically, intra-annual series reflect phenological differences and inter-annual series reflect land-cover dynamics. In this way, we can take advantage of the temporal information contained in the entire time series as well as the prior knowledge of land cover conversion to identify where and when changes occur. As a case study, we applied the proposed method for mapping annual, long-term urban-induced farmland loss from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series in the Jing-Jin-Tang district, China from 2001 to 2010. The accuracy assessment showed that the proposed method was accurate for detecting conversions from cultivated land to built-up land, with the overall accuracy of 97.72% in the spatial domain and the temporal accuracy of 74.60%. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, the spatial-temporal patterns of urban expansion revealed in this study are consistent with the findings of previous studies, which also confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - EFFECTS OF THE PRECIPITATION PATTERN AND VEGETATION COVERAGE VARIATION ON THE SURFACE RUNOFF CHARACTERISTICS IN THE EASTERN TAIHANG MOUNTAIN
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a kind of important component in natural environment, while the ecological construction can influence the hydrological regime. A successful ecology construction is based on effective recognition of the relationship between the regional vegetation and surface water resources. This work used several datasets, including meteorological data, remote sensing data and hydrologic data. The objective of this work is to identify the effects of the precipitation and the ecological succession of vegetation on the surface runoff. The results indicated that: (1) the precipitation and surface runoff reduced by 4.8-7.3% and 20.6-43.2% during 1961-1985 and 1986-2011, respectively. The reduction of the surface runoff was higher than that of the precipitation; (2) the natural surface runoff of the Taihang Mountain is positively correlated with the precipitation and negatively correlated with NDVI. The natural surface runoff would increase by 16.6-66.7% with the hypothesis that vegetation during 1986-2011 was the same with that during 1961-1985; (3) considering the regional climate conditions, drought-tolerant native species should be chosen in landscape engineering of the Taihang Mountain. This effort can avoid exhaustion of water resource caused by the excessive construction of ecological project.

AB  - Land cover classification is an important application in remote sensing and it plays a critical role in urban planning, land cover change monitoring and agricultural monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has long been recognized as an effective sensing tool for land cover monitoring, because of its ability of capturing images day and night without affected by weather conditions. On the other hand, the interpretation of SAR imagery and to get many labeled SAR images are still a challenging problem for remote sensing. Therefore, the aim of this paper is the implementation of unsupervised classification methods which require unlabeled data and comparison of their performances. In order to achieve this goal, Vertical - Vertical (VV) and Vertical - Horizontal (VII) polarization Sentinel-1 SAR images are used. The acquisition year of these images is 2018. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, Eigenface and Autoencoder feature extraction methods and also user defined features are implemented for unsupervised classification and the results have been reported and discussed. The performances of these methods are compared by using the cluster validity indices which is the criterion for unsupervised classification, and also the optimum cluster number is determined. Results demonstrate that, KPCA and Autoencoder methods are better for VII polarization. Also, user defined features and Autoencoder are better for VV polarization.

AB  - Based on Sentinel-1 EW mode data and GEE platform, this paper proposes an Antarctic ice sheet freezing and thawing detection method based on change detection and decision tree. On the GEE platform, first of all, the median value of the Sentinel-1 data in the winter months of June, July and August is as a base image set, then the difference between the summer and the base image of the same orbit is detected. At last, the thresholds of both the elevation and the backscattering coefficient difference are used to judge the freezing state of the Antarctic ice sheet. Use this method, the monthly update information on the freezing and thawing of the Antarctic ice sheet from October 2016 to March 2017, and from October 2017 to March 2018 are obtained. For the detection results, the accuracy of the self-selected samples and automatic weather station data is used for verification. The average overall accuracy of the self-selected sample verification is 93%, the average Kappa coefficient is 0.90, and the average accuracy of the automatic weather station verification is 83.86%.

The two satellites had been developed under a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Centre and Airbus in the interest of the commercial marketing for German satellite data. However, the data of high-grade earth remote-sensing system, such as those of the satellites, has been produced by a military satellite and thus used under limited circumstances in Germany. Therefore, a legislation to commercialize the German satellite data and to protect its national security is needed. For this, SatDSiG was enacted in December 2007.

AB  - Within the pluralistic worldview framework, the study of the fundamental state legal categories often requires clarification of their meanings. Constitutional legal protection as an integral part of constitutionalism is manifested in all spheres of public administration and is an imminent characteristic of the essence of the state. The absence of an integrated approach, revealing the nature of the constitutional legal protection, prevents its further conceptual development and efficiency. The first three parts of the essay are dedicated to the "Introduction" into the problems of constitutional legal protection and the formation of a primary understanding of this category on the basis of its relationship with the Constitution and also the degree of its elaboration of themes and etymology. The fourth and fifth parts are intended to help the reader gain the most complete understanding of the major social meanings and assumptions of constitutional legal protection, as well as of the depth of its implementation in the framework of constitutionalism on the meta-level of scientific knowledge.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study analyzed historical records of Terra and Aqua MODIS snow products and comparatively evaluates their potentials as an environmental monitoring tool over the Korean Peninsula. Monthly analyses revealed that MODIS snow cover data had a curvilinear relationship with the amount of snowfall but a linear relationship with snow depth measurements on the ground. Satellite-measured snow cover responded to snow depth in a linear fashion until snow depth reached a certain threshold level, but it did not increase much afterwards even if snowpacks accumulated thicker. Although both Terra and Aqua snow cover data had significant correlations with the ground measurements, Terra MODIS better represented the ground observations than Aqua MODIS. Spatial correlation analyses also showed that the MODIS snow cover responded sensitively to places where snow depth was shallower, but their geographical sensitivity decreased as local snow depth increased. Knowing that the amount of snowfall tended to increase with decreasing winter temperature, cold conditions might keep humidity levels low despite increases in snowfall. As a result, S/P ratio increased with snowfall, showing a negative correlation with humidity and a positive correlation with the number of dry days.

TI  - The "Plotless Novel" debate: literary discussion between Akutagawa Ryunosuke and Tanizaki Jun'ichiro
T2  - JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to one of the most well-known discussions in the literary circles of Japan at the beginning of the twentieth century, the dispute between Akutagawa Ryunoske and Tanizaki Jun'ichiro about the essence of prose, which was called the "plotless novel" debate. In 1927, when the discussion was published in the magazine "Kaizo", literary life was concentrated in the circles of the creative elite, or bundan, within which various associations and magazines were created. During the discussion, Akutagawa proposed the concept of "poetic spirit" in a prose work as the central category of his aesthetic theory, implying the dominant role of the hero's lyrical mood over the storyline. Akutagawa considered the work containing the "poetic spirit" to be the pinnacle of prose creativity and called such prose "a story without a story", believing that the "interesting story" and interest in the story as such diminish the quality of the work, bringing it closer to the mass entertaining literature. Tanizaki, whose works Akutagawa criticized for "an interesting plot," defended the story with many plot lines, arguing that this creates the "architectural beauty" of the work, which implies, firstly, its structural complexity, and, secondly, provides internal energy. In contrast to Akutagawa, Tanizaki did not consider the general accessibility of literature as a quality that crossed out its artistic value. In essence, this discussion, in which the recognized classics of modern literature present the basis of their aesthetic views, is a dispute about the role of pure literature (junbungaku) and mass (taishu bungaku) - a problem that will be most developed after Akutagawa's death. This is the main significance of this dispute, which should rather be called a discussion, since there was no fundamental difference between the writers.The discussion took place due to differences in attitude, character, aesthetic perception, psychological organization of the writers, as well as the polarity of their life moments at that time. For Akutagawa, prone to melancholy, rational analysis, and intellectual perception of the world, the end of his life and the end of the era of "pure" literature was nearing, while Tanizaki, demonstrating a sensual-mystical worldview and confidently gathering the fruits of glory, still had much to do in his literary career.

AB  - The accuracy of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (Era-Interim) data on total atmospheric water vapor content (WVC), cloud liquid water content (CLW) and sea surface wind speed (SWS) over the Arctic open ocean area, was estimated using the geophysical parameters, retrieved from satellite data, as a source of reference data. The Era-Interim reanalysis WVC, CLW and SWS were compared with the parameters, retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data using improved algorithms, for one year of data. The Era-Interim reanalysis WVC, CLW and SWS errors, as compared with the AMSR2 parameters, were calculated both for the whole data ranges and specifically for high value ranges. Analysis of one year data set showed that the Era-Interim WVC had the accuracy of 1.1 kg/m(2), high correlation, and no systematical bias relative to the AMSR2 retrieved WVC. Consideration of the range of WVC > 15 kg/m(2) led to 50% increase in the error and appearance of a systematical bias of about 2 kg/m(2). The Era-Interim SWS had an error of 1.6 m/s, which increased up to 3 m/s for the range of high winds with SWS > 15 m/s. The accuracy of Era-Interim LWC relative to AMSR2 retrieved LWC was found to be unsatisfactory.

AB  - The accuracy of two satellite products on the atmospheric total water vapor content (WVC) over the Arctic sea ice is estimated with Era-Interim reanalysis WVC. Daily WVC product, based on the NOAA Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit - B (AMSU-B) measurements and daily and monthly WVC products, created from MODIS near infrared data, are considered. AMSU-B based WVC accuracy is estimated for the 4 months of 2008. MODIS based WVC accuracy is estimated for the whole 2008. We found, that in summer months, featured by comparatively wet atmosphere even over the sea ice, both products are distinguished by very low accuracies and cannot be used in any research. During the whole year notable underestimation of Era-Interim WVC by MODIS product and overestimation by AMSU-B product are established.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of the research study Measurement of the degree of value solidarity and the level of social trust in the Russian society conducted by the ZIRCON Research Group in late 2018 - early 2019. The main goal of the study was to identify value orientations of Russians, determine the unifying potential of diverse values and measure the level of social trust. A special section of the study was devoted to religious values, which made it possible to compare the religious identity of respondents with their value orientations, ideological attitudes and opinions on the current issues of the socio-political agenda.The empirical data obtained in the course of the study indicate that the declared religiosity of Russians is often superficial (nominal), unstable, and is not supported either by appropriate religious practice or ethical views and value orientations. Its influence on the ideological and political choices of citizens is minimal, and religious institutions do not seem to possess a serious potential for mass political mobilization.According to the authors, the public consciousness of Russians is highly fragmented. If earlier it was possible to spot large groups of people with a holistic, logically consistent, internally connected worldview that can be regarded as a common set of ideological views (for example, Russian - Orthodox - loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church - against abortions, etc.), nowadays such integrity is absent. Ideological chains no longer unite people into large communities. The society is divided into quite narrow and at the same time very different in terms of their internal parameters groups. Any combination of three or four dimensions (issues, value ideological constructs) of public discourse divides the Russian society into small fragments.

AB  - Pakistan is a coastal country (Arabian sea) with 1000 km longer coastline which lies south of the country. Karachi, Ormara, Pasni, and Gwadar are the major seaports. Tropical cyclones are not new for Pakistan. Pakistan has been affected by the several cyclones in few past decades. It is also a region of south Asian monsoon which occurs during June and July and receives heavy and torrential rainfall. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) is used here for identifying the effects of the 2014 cyclone (named as "Nanauk" of category-I) on Indus delta's (wetland) landcovers and the community. Tropical storm Nanauk formed in the west of India on June 10, 2014, and hits the coastal areas on 11 June,2014. The objectives of this study were to; 1) analyze the extent of flooding in Indus delta, 2) to check that after four years of cyclone how many villages/communities returned to their homes and 3) to identify the areas where they migrated at the time of flooding. For 2nd objective, only three tehsils (Ghorabari, Keti Bander and Kharochan) of Thatta district along the three creeks (Khobar, Hajambro, and Turshian) of Indus delta were selected. Landsat-8 satellite images have been used on 10 may(pre-cyclone), 26 may(pre-cyclone), 11 June(during-cyclone) and 27 June(post-cyclone) used to map the flooding extent. Initially, villages were marked using Google earth and Landsat 8 were used to identify the inundated villages. The current status of the inundated villages was checked on google earth which shows that the villages were destroyed, and no boats are standing near the villages as compared to the pre-cyclone images (January and March 2014). The dates of satellite images in Google is not certain, so we requested digital globe for the provision of satellite images to confirm this damage. Digital globe provided images of before cyclones (1st March 2014) which confirms the existence of these villages. Total 27 villages were marked, 18 inundated, 7 Migrated, three relocated and eight returned. The results show that the return ratio of the communities is only 44%, only 16 %return and relocated within the delta and 38% never returned.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to map the spatial growth of the urban group of Oran and western coastal cities of Oran by use of photo interpretation and GIS approach to measure the spatial dynamics of built spaces and their surfaces and locations. For this, two spatial images were used from Landsat satellites respectively from 1987 and 2016, and also the topographic maps of 1987. The results obtained are discussed and compared in the study of demographic changes over the last four censuses RGHP (General Census of population and habitat). The results showed that the phenomenon of the saturation of the main western coastal cities of Oran (Oran, Ain El Turck) was accompanied by a significant population growth, and on the other side of the creation of new areas of intense planned urban housing. Thus, the adopted methodology proves to be effective for the evaluation and the monitoring of the spatial dynamics in a so important region as the Oran coastline which knows strong land pressures.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a great transformation that radically changes human civilisation through the application of Internet of Things (IoT) and advancement of technology without borders. The main driver for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is science and technology based on IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) that transform the meaning of being human to post-humanism. Science in the Islamic civilisation emerged as the result of its comprehensive worldview; therefore the science of the Fourth Industrial Revolution should not be accepted based upon its claim of truth purely because of its alien foundation in epistemology and methodology from the worldview of Islam. Based upon the abovementioned premise, the Muslim ummah needs itw own science that originated from the worldview of Islam and its own sets of values. This article studies the Islamic science premises in epistemology and methodology based upon document analysis method founded in the writings of some contemporary Muslim scholars namely Ziauddin Sardar, Alparslan Acikgenc and Osman Bakar. Finally, it synthesizes Islamic science and technology within its own framework and set to be an alternative to Western science and technology.

AB  - The paper discusses the allocation of disturbances in the ionosphere associated with large atmospheric events - tropical typhoons or cyclones. The experimental results of measurements of electron concentration by Langmuir probes carried out on ECA SWARM satellites were used. Selection technique for relative electron density perturbation in the selected frequency band were proposed and substantiated. The paper uses a frequency band equivalent to 15180 s, which is associated with the characteristic spatial dimensions of the studied phenomenon in the atmosphere, this way allows us to distinguish disturbances from tropical cyclones in the ionosphere against the background of regular changes in the electron concentration determined by the dynamics of the Equatorial anomaly. The results of the calculations show a high correlation coefficient between the data from individual satellites of the constellation and a pronounced relationship between the spatial parameters of the cyclone and changes in the electronic content of the ionosphere.

T2  - SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the influence of large atmospheric processes on the ionosphere by the example of tropical typhoon Vongfong 2014. We use data obtained from three SWARM satellite missions (450-500 km altitude). We discuss two possible mechanisms of transfer of atmospheric disturbances to ionospheric heights. The first mechanism is the generation of acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs); the second mechanism considers the excitation of electric fields in the atmosphere. We propose new techniques for detecting the ionospheric response to AGW, which rely on low orbit satellite data. The first technique is based on determination of relative electron density variations in the frequency band from 15 to 150-180 s, corresponding to certain scales of AGW. The second technique estimates space-time derivatives of the electron density, measured by two nearby SWARM satellites. We present and estimate the characteristic magnitudes of ionospheric response effects, their localization and spatial-temporal characteristics for the large tropical cyclone under study.

TI  - Radiomic features from PSMA PET for non-invasive intraprostatic tumor discrimination and characterization in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer - a comparison study with histology reference
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the performance of radiomic features (RF) derived from PSMA PET for intraprostatic tumor discrimination and non-invasive characterization of Gleason score (GS) and pelvic lymph node status.Patients and methods: Patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent [Ga-68]-PSMA-11 PET/CT followed by radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection were prospectively enrolled (n=20). Coregistered histopathological gross tumor volume (GTV-Histo) in the prostate served as reference. 133 RF were derived from GTV-Histo and from manually created segmentations of the intraprostatic tumor volume (GTV-Exp). Spearman's correlation coefficients (p) were assessed between RF derived from the different GTVs. We additionally analyzed the differences in RF values for PCa and non-PCa tissues. Furthermore, areas under receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) were calculated and uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the RF based discrimination of GS 7 and >= 8 disease and of patients with nodal spread (pN1) and non-nodal spread (pN0) in surgical specimen. The results found in the latter analyses were validated by a retrospective cohort of 40 patients.Results: Most RF from GTV-Exp showed strong correlations with RF from GTV-Histo (86% with p>0.7). 81% and 76% of RF from GTV-Exp and GTV-Histo significantly discriminated between PCa and non-PCa tissue. The texture feature QSZHGE discriminated between GS 7 and >= 8 considering GTV-Histo (AUC=0.93) and GTV-Exp (prospective cohort: AUC=0.91 / validation cohort: AUC=0.84). QSZHGE also discriminated between pNl and pN0 disease considering GTV-Histo (AUC=0.85) and GTV-Exp (prospective cohort: AUC=0.87 / validation cohort: AUC=0.85). In uni- and multivariate analyses including patients of both cohorts QSZHGE was a statistically significant (p<0.01) predictor for PCa patients with GS tumors and pN1 status.Conclusion: RF derived from PSMA PET discriminated between PCa and non-PCa tissue within the prostate. Additionally, the texture feature QSZHGE discriminated between GS 7 and GS >= 8 tumors and between patients with pNl and pN0 disease. Our results support the role of RF in PSMA PET as a new tool for non-invasive PCa discrimination and characterization of its biological properties.

TI  - Dynamics of fluvial terraces in the Grijalva-Villahermosa sub-basin, Mexico
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial analysis, based on comparative studies of satellite images through geographical information systems, has allowed to highlight territorial changes generated by the interaction between natural morphological processes and anthropogenic activities. The Grijalva-Villahermosa sub-basin is part of one of the largest watersheds in Mexico,the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin. Based on geographic allocation and geological characteristics Grijalva River is formed by sediments of recent quaternary alluvial Holocene. Geomorphology corresponds to the fluviodeltaic plain with an almost flat slope, so floods are constant. In order to evaluate the effect of water control systems in the dynamics of the fluvial terraces an environmental assessment was developed, taking into account the effect of flood mitigation structures. The fluvial terraces were identified through spectral analysis of 2011 LiDAR images and verified throughphoto-interpretation and field visits. The environmental assessment was based on Landsat images 1986 and 2016, to which the analysis of change trend with Markov chains was applied. The environmental criterion of the analysis was based on the evaluation of change on the vegetation coverage,wetlands, water bodies, soil and anthropic infrastructure. The most significant results on the dynamics of the fluvial terraces in terms of surface gain occurred in wetlands with 13034 ha and a loss of 6475 ha, in anthropic infrastructure gaining was 3242 ha and losing 3793 ha, as well as a gain of 1145 ha and a loss of 3519 ha in water bodies. The results showed an intensive change trend in wetlands coverage on the analysis period. The current dynamics in the Sub-basin shows a regular behavior in the formation of the fluvial terraces, but a negative impact due to anthropic factors.

AB  - Fires are disruptive events that should be carefully studied. To this date, the monitoring at large scale of fire events is mainly performed using low spatial resolution sensors such as MODIS and VIIRS and ancillary data like active fire maps. However, the data produced by the new generation of spaceborne multispectral missions can be used for burned area detection at a finer spatial and temporal scale with respect to existing methods. In this paper we present a method that analyzes time series of optical images acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 to detect burned areas in a fully automatic and unsupervised way. The method analyzes each image in the time-series to extract Candidate Burned Areas (CBAs). CBAs are analyzed accounting for the temporal correlation to reduce the number of false alarms. In particular, only pixels that have a temporal profile consistent with the physical event of a fire are selected. Moreover, the time variable is used to compute the confidence of the detection. The method has been tested on a time-series of the Attica region, Greece, which was affected by large fires in 2018. Preliminary experimental results showed that the method correctly identified the burned areas of the region.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present research is part of the project "From Aquileia to Singidunum: reconstructing the paths of the Roman travelers-RecRoad", developed at the Universite Bordeaux Montaigne, thanks to a Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowship. One of the goals of the project was to detect and reconstruct the Roman viability between the Roman cities of Aquileia (Aquileia, Italy) and Singidunum (Belgrade, Serbia), using different sources and methods, one of which is satellite remote sensing. The research project analyzed and combined several data, including images produced by the Sentinel-2 mission, funded by the European Commission Earth Observation Programme Copernicus, in which satellites were launched between 2015 and 2017. These images are freely available for scientific and commercial purposes, and constitute a constantly updated gallery of the whole planet, with a revisit time of five days at the Equator. The technical specifications of the satellites' sensors are particularly suitable for archaeological mapping purposes, and their capacities in this field still need to be fully explored. The project provided a useful testbed for the use of Sentinel-2 images in the archaeological field. The study compares traditional Vegetation Indices with experimental trials on Sentinel images applied to the Srem District in Serbia. The paper also compares the results obtained from the analysis of the Sentinel-2 images with WorldView-2 multispectral images. The obtained results were verified through an archaeological surface survey.

AB  - In this study, the crop water stress index (CWSI) was monitored at a commercial apple orchard in Brandenburg (Germany). In this regard, two methods were applied; an established method based on canopy leaf temperature using infrared thermometers (IRT), followed by calculation of CWSI according to Idso (CWSIIDSO). The established method was compared to satellite-based approach (CWSIsat-based) using Landsat 8 satellite images. During the IRT measurements, the sampling for estimating vegetation water content (VWC) was carried out. The results showed that the average differences between CWSI estimation methods were less than 3%, indicating good agreement between both methods. There is a negative correlation between VWC and two CWSI, indicating CWSIsat-based d has the potential to replace direct VWC measurements and to provide the tree water status that includes spatial distribution, through mapping of extended areas of the apple orchards, which may more effectively monitor water stress and irrigation scheduling

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Changes Using Taguchi-Based Optimized SVM Classification Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover mapping is of great importance in many research areas. The main objective of this study was to assess land cover changes using support vector machine (SVM) classification approach. The most important challenge in this case is to determine the optimum structure of classification method. The optimization Taguchi method was performed to optimize the structure of SVM. Results showed that Taguchi method can be effectively used to cope with this problem. In fact, using Taguchi method to optimize SVM parameters can significantly decrease the number of classification tests. In this study, land use/cover maps of the Yazd-Ardakan plain were produced in three dates of 1990, 2002 and 2015. Maximum and minimum accuracy of the classification was 0.9 and 0.85 for 2015 and 1990 imagery, respectively. This may be related to the differences in the quality of the imagery. The land use/cover changes were then assessed based on the best classification results. It was shown that maximum change in the land use/cover was taken place in residential areas.

AB  - We present the current development of the Carbon Balance Observatory (CARBO). CARBO is a wide-swath mapping, low Earth orbit (LEO) new generation of instruments that expands on the ground-breaking CO2 and Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) measurements pioneered by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2/3) by adding CH4 and CO detection. The instrument's spatial coverage is delivered at 2 km by 2 km resolution with a field-of-view of 10 degrees to 15 degrees from LEO for a similar to 200 km wide swath. It achieves roughly 20x better spatial coverage than the OCO-2 instrument, and 3x better Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) detection sensitivity, in a smaller package. CARBO will measure CO2 at <1.5 ppm, CH4 at <7 ppb, CO at <5 ppb and SIF < 20%. The measurement of CO2/CH4/CO/SIF at these concentrations will significantly increase our ability to disentangle carbon fluxes into their constituent components. CARBO utilizes innovative immersion grating technology and enables high resolving power spectroscopy (roughly 20,000) in a smaller and lighter package that is more cost effective than current space-based CO2 remote sensing instruments. CARBO modules cover 4 different spectral ranges (from 740 nm to 2.3 mu m), where two channels will be built and field tested. CARBO's modular architecture reduces implementation risk, accelerates access to space, and extends opportunities to a more diverse set of platforms and launch vehicles. CARBO significantly improves our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Here we discuss an overview of the design elements and focus on the expected radiometric performance of channels 1 (similar to 760 nm) and 2 (similar to 1600 nm).

AB  - Cactus pear is grown mainly under rain-fed conditions in marginal semi-arid and arid highlands of central and north-central Mexico. Drip irrigation may increase fruit yield similar to 3.5-fold. However, the effects of supplemental irrigation (SI) on preharvest growth and water saving have not been assessed previously. The objective of this study was to determine the possibility of saving water and improving water-use efficiency (WUE) in 'Dalia Roja' cactus pear, without adverse effects on fruit yield (FY) and fruit quality (FQ). Irrigation treatments (IT) were as follows: non-irrigated (NI) as control, supplemental irrigation (SI), and full irrigation (FI). Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates. The response variables were irrigation water applied (IWA), WUE, FY, fruit size distribution (FSD), and FQ. The following FQ determinations were made: mean fruit mass (MFM), flesh firmness (FF), pulp and peel mass, total soluble solids concentration (TSSC), and dry matter concentration (DMC) of fruit. The experiment was conducted in Zacatecas, Mexico. At harvest, SI saved similar to 52% of IWA, increased the efficiency of IWA by similar to 1.4-fold, but reduced FY by 12.9% compared to FI. Over 70% of the fruit produced by FI and SI plants was most marketable (categories 1 and 2), while NI plants produced only 28% category 2 fruits. The quality indicators FF and pulp-to-peel ratio were similar among IT, while NI fruit had the highest TSSC and DMC and the lowest MFM. SI produced similar responses to FI while saving irrigation water and enhancing FY, FSD, and MFM, but TSSC and DMC were reduced. Nevertheless, SI has potential for growing cactus pear in this region and similar production zones around the world where water availability is limited.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF JIHAD CONCEPT: MINIMALISM AND MAXIMALISM IN ISLAM
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses evolution of the interpretations of jihad from the angle of two worldview platforms represented in the system of views of intellectuals in the Islamic world - minimalist and maximalist. These platforms differ in their perception of social reality, as well as concepts of truth and justice, which are basic for Islam. Minimalism in general allows critical attitude to the surrounding reality, even in Islamic states, as well as local interpretation of the concepts of truth and justice. Maximalism endorses critical attitude towards reality only in the states where Islamic laws do not apply, and only if approved by the highest religious authorities. Maximalism interprets concepts of truth and justice as universal. In accordance with Islamic moral and ethical norms, both platforms have the right to exist, and the choice between them is an individual matter of every Muslim. As a result, the Islamic communities witness stratification not only of the elite, but also of the Ummah, which is divided into a "systemic" opposition that is ready for a dialogue with the government, and a "non-systemic" opposition that a priori excludes the possibility of a dialogue with the government.According to the authors, the events of the Arab Spring were caused by the spread of the elite's split into the entire Ummah, which created the basis for intra-Islamic tension, which, in its turn, pushed a poorly organized mass of believers into the streets of Arab cities. The authors describe the current stage in the development of the Islamic community as a period of liminality i.e., a structural crisis associated with political and social instability, a change in group and individual forms of self-identification and sharp cognitive dissonance among ordinary believers, coupled with an increasing trend towards re-Islamization in countries of non-canonical Islam.

AB  - The research is aimed at the development and testing of the system for operational river flood forecasting. The system is based on the use of a complex of hydrological and hydrodynamic models, as well as in situ and satellite data integrated processing, and implemented on the basis of a service-oriented architecture. A distinctive feature of the system is the complete automation of the entire simulation cycle - from loading initial data to interpreting results, visualizing and alerting interested parties. The theoretical basis for ensuring the coordinated functioning of all system components is the qualimetry of models and polymodel complexes. The practical implementation is carried out using open codes, free software and GIS platform "RegionView".All the complexity associated with the use of heterogeneous geographically distributed information resources is hidden from the user. This allows the system to be used not only by specialists in GIS, IT or relevant subject area, but also by other users interested in the results of flood monitoring and forecasting - emergency services, local authorities, commercial organizations and citizens.The described technologies and the system of operational flood forecasting were tested in the Russian Federation on the Northern Dvina River, from the city of Velikiy Ustyug to the city of Kotlas in 2014-2019.Given test results prove that the application of such an approach ensures full implementation of the required functionality of operational flood forecasting systems, the fulfilment of the basic requirements for such systems and also indicate the possibility of a widespread use of such systems authorities and emergency services.

The reliability of the results is ensured with a considerable amount of speech material (more than 300 utterances). The particular attention is given to evaluative contexts, the analysis of which resulted in reconstruction of the value aspect of the speaker's worldview. It was established that in the informant's speech both universal and specific characteristics of the concepts "Laughter" and "Crying" are manifested. As universal characteristics, the relationship of the emotive and perceptual components in the structure of the studied concepts is determined, the prevalence of negative emotions over positive nominations, the inclusion of these concepts in virtue oppositions (i.e. "us" - "them") is established. The features of the traditional folk worldview were reconstructed, including value of the family, attention to the material side of life, comprehension of animals as creatures of a lower layer in comparison with humans. The following personal characteristics of the informant are revealed: a high level of speech culture and communicative competence, vagueness, self-irony, the desire to harmonize communication.

TI  - Construction of land surface dynamic feedbacks for digital soil mapping with fusion of multisource remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Pedometrics Conference
CL  - Wageningen, NETHERLANDS
AB  - The use of environmental covariates to predict soil spatial variation is a widely adopted approach to digital soil mapping. However, commonly used covariates such as topography, landform and vegetation are often ineffective for estimating soil variation in areas of low relief. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of a new covariate called land surface dynamic feedback (LSDF) for digital soil mapping in such areas. The construction of LSDF relies on remote sensing (RS) data with high temporal resolution to record the drying process after a rain event. The trade-off of obtaining high temporal resolution with RS data is that they are often of low spatial resolution. To overcome this limitation, our study uses the ESTARFM (enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model) algorithm to fuse MODIS and Landsat 8 data to obtain images that benefit from the high temporal resolution of MODIS and high spatial resolution of Landsat. The LSDF was then derived from the fused images to predict soil texture in a case study in north Xuancheng, Anhui Province. Compared with particle-size fractions estimated with LSDF derived from the original MODIS data, the results were more accurate and produced more spatial detail when mapped. We conclude that the ESTARFM algorithm can improve the spatial resolution of high temporal resolution RS data and offers an effective approach to derive more accurate measures of LSDF for digital soil mapping in areas of low relief.

TI  - Measurement and analysis of surface deformation after the sixth nuclear explosion in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea using InSAR
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the small baseline subset (SBAS) method and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar data to obtain the cumulative surface deformation at highly coherent points and different times (12-d intervals from September 10, 2017 to June 1, 2018) following the sixth nuclear explosion conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The study is conducted for a 17 kmx22 km area centered on the explosion. Measurement points are aggregated into 14 sets according to their spatial neighborhood. According to the average coherence of each point in the set, the point deformation is weighted and averaged to obtain the cumulative deformation of each set. The location of each set is also weighted and averaged according to the average coherence of each point in standing for all points in the set. The analysis and discussion in this paper are based on these 14 sets for 14 different regions. Results show that the deformation process in the thermal radiation aftereffect stage of the sixth nuclear test can be effectively observed using interferometric synthetic aperture radar. There was still surface uplift near the epicenter for similar to 10 d after the explosion, after which the surface began to sink. The sinking rate and total sinking amount varied by location. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of subsidence slowing or even the surface uplifting possibly due to the freeze-thaw cycle of water in underground rock in winter was observed. After May 24, 2018, deformation began to rise because the government of the DPRK bombed the entrance of the nuclear facilities. We indirectly demonstrate the reasonableness and consistency of the observation results via the coherence of high-resolution optical images, meteorological data, and interferograms for the area of the nuclear explosion. The spatial and temporal distributions of surface deformation and their causes are then modeled. The results of modeling analysis are as follows. (1) In the thermal radiation aftereffect stage of the DPRK's sixth nuclear explosion, the surrounding rock softened under high temperature and high pressure, and the surrounding metamorphic rock then compressed under the action of its own gravity and began to sink. This time-varying process is fitted by a deformation prediction model based on the Weibull function, and four parameters-namely the acceleration factor of deformation, comprehensive influence factor of deformation, initial surface deformation, and prediction value of maximum deformation-are obtained. The average correlation coefficient of the fitting curve is about 0.97. Model fitting results show that the sinking deformation tended to stop around May 20. (2) A function model was proposed to analyze the genetic mechanism of surface deformation, where the thickness of the layer of metamorphic rock is taken as the independent variable and the maximum deformation is taken as the dependent variable. The thickness of the layer of metamorphic rock was calculated for explosion burial depths of 450 and 770 m. The vertical impact distance of the explosion from the epicenter was about 1800-2300 m while the deformation coefficient of the metamorphic rock was about 7x10(-5)-8x10(-5). The statistical fitting degree R-2 is about 0.8 and the P value is close to zero. In conclusion, the scope of the impact of the explosion metamorphism is the intrinsic condition of deformation, and gravity is the driving force of surface subsidence in the explosion area.Differences in the deformation rate and amount in different geomorphological locations are due to different thicknesses of the compressible layer relating to the rock thickness and metamorphism. Such differences have directionality, possibly because the attenuation of high-temperature and high-pressure propagation in the direction of tunnel works is less than that in the direction of surrounding rock.

AB  - This paper presents a method to intercalibrate the brightness temperature (TB) acquired by the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on Chinese meteorological satellite Fengyun 3C (FY-3C) against the measurements obtained by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) based on an ocean microwave radiative transfer model, and the intercalibration coefficients of FY-3C MWRI are obtained. The results show that the MWRI measurements are underestimated, especially the TB in the low frequency bands, and the calibration bias decreases with the frequency increment. In addition, the calibration of FY-3C MWRI ascending data is much better than that of FY-3C MWRI descending data.

AB  - The surface albedo indicates the ability of the Earth's surface to reflect solar radiation, and it is an important land surface characteristic parameter that affects the radiation and energy balance of the Earth system. This paper presents a surface albedo inversion method for FY-3C MERSI. First, we estimated the narrow-band surface albedo for different surface cover types by using constrained least squares and the RossThick-LiTransit model. Then, we calculated the conversion coefficient of the FY-3C MERSI narrow-band surface albedo to the broad-band surface albedo conversion by using the FY-3C MERSI spectral response function, the 6S radiation transmission model and the USGS spectral library. Finally, we obtained the surface black and white albedo of the four narrow-band and visible-light bands of the FY-3C MERSI, and the spatial resolution of the data is 250m. In the comparative verification experiment, we crossvalidated the surface albedo of FY-3C with the surface albedo of MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer), CGLS (Copernicus Global Land Service) and GLASS (Global LAnd Surface Satellite). The results show that the correlation coefficient is mostly above 0.75, the overall absolute deviation is 0.068 on average and the minimum root mean square error is 0.02 between the albedo products obtained in this paper and the above three products. Therefore, FY-3C MERSI surface albedo products and MODIS, CGLS, GLASS surface albedo products have good consistency in four narrowband and visible light bands.

The landscape index was calculated by the FRAGSTATS to analyse the landscape pattern of urban land use in Hunan hilly areas, and the minimum cumulative distance model was used to construct the urban ecological pattern. The results showed that: (1)The most dominant landscape types in the city area were forest lands with high degree of aggregation and cluster distribution. The fragmentation of landscape types in urban areas was obvious, especially the grassland fragmentation. (2)There are few landscape types in the city area, and there are obvious dominant landscapes. (3)The article builds an ecological security pattern by searching for ecological sources, corridors and nodes, and guarantees the ecological security of hilly urban cities.

AB  - Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo is important for studying Earth's energy budget and climate dynamics. As no direct validation can be conducted to determine their accuracies, comprehensive intercomparisons are of significance for robust applications. In this study, five TOA albedo products over land surfaces have been intercompared, including three global TOA albedo products from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (TAL-AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (TAL-MODIS) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), the regional product from the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF), and the harmonized product called Diagnosing Earth's Energy Pathways in the Climate system (DEEP-C). Results show that there is good consistence among the five products overall, especially after the year 2000. The differences among these products in the high-latitude regions are relatively larger (similar to 0.2). The differences among TAL-AVHRR, TAL-MODIS and CERES are mostly less than 0.05 while the differences between TAL-AVHRR and DEEP-C before 2000 can be up to 0.1.

AB  - This study developed hydrologic models based on satellite remote sensing data from 2002 to 2010. Daily meteorological and hydrological data (1959-2010) were used as model inputs to analyse the relationships between meteorological factors and water area, and to calculate the daily water area and mean reduced water area on an annual basis to analyse the trend of changes. By analysing BCC-CSM1-1 model data, the study derived a qualitative assessment of the future water area of the Poyang Lake Basin, China The following results were found. (1) The water area had shrunk substantially since the 1990s, especially during the 2000s. Because of aridification, the water area had decreased by 22.5% from 1845 km' in the 1980s to 1430 km' in the 2000s. (2) Since 1990, the first day of its wet season had become delayed and the final day had advanced. Generally, the number of wet season days had reduced while that of the dry season has increased. (3) In all future scenarios, extreme events were projected to occur more frequently, suggesting dramatic volatility in water resources and great frequency of droughts, which would exacerbate the shrinking of Poyang Lake and represent a severe threat to its water security.

During the wet season, the SSC in the northwestern estuary (NWE) is high, which could reach up to 100 mg/L, while during the dry season it suffers from a markedly decrease. Over the southeastern estuary (SEE), however, the pattern is reversed. This seasonality is mainly affected by freshwater discharge, winds and water column stratification. During the wet season, freshwater discharge dominates the SSC in the NWE while stratification and water discharge control the SSC variation in the SEE. During the dry season, freshwater discharge also plays a more important role in changing the SSC in the NWE, while the combined effect of wind mixing and tidal mixing dominates the SSC in the SEE. The interannual variability of the SSC is revealed by an EOF analysis. The first mode is highly related to water discharge of the Pearl River, indicating that the interannual variability is mainly subject to the rainfall over the Pearl River basin. The long-term SSC trend is characterized by a general decrease across the entire estuary and proved to be closely related to human activity. The reduction rate of the SSC varies spatially and seasonally. Spatially, the northern West Shoal and upper eastern part of the PRE suffer from a much greater SSC decrease, while the rest of the estuary, especially the southern West Shoal, is relatively less influenced. Seasonally, the decreasing rate in the dry season (49.3%) is higher than that in the wet season (30.1%).

AB  - Co- and cross-polarized geophysical model function (GMFs) both have limitations to retrieve ocean surface wind speeds. The former underestimates high winds and the latter overstimates low winds. In this study, we both use Co- and cross-polarized SAR observations to retrieve hurricane wind speeds and directions. The local gradient method is first used to estimate hurricane wind directions from C-band RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A dual-polarization SAR imagery. We compare wind directions derived from 10 dual-polarization SAR images with collocated wind directions from buoys, GPS dropsondes, scatterometer, radiometer, and Hurricane Research Division Real-time Hurricane Wind Analysis System (H*Wind) data. Statistical comparisons show that the wind direction bias and root-mean-square error are 3.22 degrees and 21.53 degrees, respectively. Subsequently, as a case study for Hurricane Maria, the retrieved wind directions, along with Co- and cross-polarized GMFs are used to derive wind speeds. The retrieved wind speeds are validated with collocated Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) measurements. The results show that the combination of Co- and cross-polarized GMFs has capability of obtaining more reasonable hurricane wind speeds and directions than by only using co-or cross-pol GMF.

TI  - Detection of Rice Phenological Variations under Heavy Metal Stress by Means of Blended Landsat and MODIS Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring phenological changes of crops through remote sensing methods is becoming a new perspective in assessing heavy metal contamination in agricultural farmlands. This paper proposes a method that combines the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) to detect heavy metal stress-induced variations in satellite-derived rice phenology. First, we applied the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model to obtain the NDVI and NDWI time series for the NDVI-NDWI phase-space construction. Then, six specific rice phenometrics were derived from the NDVI and the phase-space, respectively. Last, we introduced a relative phenophase index (RPI), which characterizes the relative change of the phenometrics to identify the rice paddies under heavy metal stress. The results indicated that satellite-derived rice phenometrics are generally influenced by human and natural factors (e.g., transplanting date, air temperature, and solar radiation), while the RPI showed weak correlations with all of these variables. In the determination of heavy metal stress, the NDVI- and phase-space-based RPIs of unstressed rice both show significantly (p < 0.001) higher values than those of stressed rice, while the phase-space-based RPI shows more apparent statistical difference between the stressed and unstressed rice compared to the NDVI-based one. Our work proved the capability of the phase-space-based method as well as the RPI in the discrimination of regional heavy metal pollution in rice fields.

TI  - The scale effects of the spatial autocorrelation measurement: aggregation level and spatial resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The scale effects of the spatial autocorrelation (SA) measurement has been explored for decades. However, the effects of the data aggregation levels and spatial resolution on the SA measurement are often confused. Whether the two types of scale effects are the same is still unclear and requires further investigation. We retrieved the land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 images in 30 capital cities of China. By aggregating the LST images, we observed a decrease in the SA of the LST as the data aggregation level increased; this relationship can be fitted well with a negative logarithmic function. We derived an indicator to measure the scale effects intensity of SA, which was negatively correlated with the spatial complexity of LST. Both aggregating images and the increasing spatial resolution induce weaker SA, but the effect of the former was stronger. The aggregating images negatively affected the SA degree regardless of the spatial resolutions of the original images. The SA degrees of the aggregated images were far below those of the real-life images. This study suggests that the scale effects caused by aggregation levels and spatial resolutions are different, and cautions should be taken when applying relevant conclusions derived from aggregating images.

TI  - Weather Visibility Prediction Based on Multimodal Fusion
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads, sailing, and aviation. Visibility prediction is meaningful in guiding production and life. Different from weather prediction, which relies solely on atmosphere factors, the factors that affect meteorological visibility are more complicated, such as the air pollution caused by factory exhaust emission. However, the current prediction of visibility is mostly based on the numerical prediction method similar to the weather prediction. We proposed a method using multimodal fusion to build a weather visibility prediction system in this paper. An advanced numerical prediction model and a method for emission detection were used to build a multimodal fusion visibility prediction system. We used the most advanced regression algorithm, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to train the fusion model for numerical prediction. Through the estimation of factory emission by the traditional detector in the satellite image, we propose to add the result of estimation based on Landsat-8 satellite images to assist the prediction. By testing our numerical model in atmosphere data of various meteorological observation stations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2002 to 2018, our numerical prediction model turns out to be more accurate than other existing methods, and after fusing with emission detection method, the accuracy of our visibility prediction system has been further improved.

TI  - A NEW BP NEURAL NETWORK FUSION ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA ON GROUNDWATER
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to enhance the accuracy and reduce the cost of the fusion of multi-source remote sensing data. For this purpose, the existing multi-source remote sensing data fusion methods were reviewed in detail. Then, a new back propagation (BP) neural network (BPNN) fusion algorithm for the groundwater was put forward based on hybrid soft computing. Using the function approximation ability of BP neural network, it was combined with the Kalman filter to form an optimization method. The BP neural network was coupled with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm into the PSO-BPNN-EKF data fusion algorithm. On this basis, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) was introduced to create the LSSVM-PSO data fusion algorithm. Through simulation experiments, it is learned that the proposed algorithm can effectively fuse the multi-source remote sensing data on groundwater, especially in the case of big data. The research findings shed a new light on the fusion of remote sensing data collected by multiple sensors.

AB  - To investigate the capability of ocean wind monitoring by the C-band compact-polarimetry (CP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), we develop a theoretical model based on the fundamental mechanisms of interactions between sea surface wind-waves and radar microwave. We simulate the dependencies of the NRCSs (normalized radar cross-sections) on wind speeds and incidence angles, for up-wind (wind direction is 0 degrees) and cross-wind (wind direction is 90 degrees) conditions. Analysis of the model results lead to two ocean wind retrieval methods for RV-polarization and RH-polarization (pol) SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, respectively. The RV-polarized method is proposed based on the CMOD framework and a sensitivity analysis, while the RH-polarized method and model are based on application of a quadratic function. Both the theoretical model and wind retrieval methods suggest that the RV-pol should be more suitable for ocean wind especially hurricane monitoring than the RH-pol method. The database used in this study includes wind vectors observed by in situ buoys of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and simulated C-band CP radar signals, created by a simulator based on imputing C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR images.

TI  - Star Detection and Accurate Centroiding for the Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder of Fengyun-4A
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting accurate star centroids in the observed star images is one of the key problems for image navigation of the geosynchronous interferometric infrared sounder (GIIRS) of Fengyun-4A Satellite (FY-4A), the first scientific experimental satellite of the new generation of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun-4 series. Compared with star sensors which are widely used for star observation, it is challenging to detect the 2 x 2 star spot from the focused star images of GIIRS and calculate the star centroid in high precision. In this paper, we propose a star detection and centroiding method based on trajectory search and trajectory fitting. Since the launch of FY-4A in December 2016, our centroiding method has been tested in-orbit for over two years. The extensive experiments show that the star centroiding error of our method is less than 0.3 pixels, which makes an important contribution to image navigation of FY-4A.

AB  - Urban agglomeration becomes increasingly important because of the globalization of world economies. Change detection of urban agglomeration based on remote sensing technology is one of the hotspots of research. In this paper, an automatic change detection method using Sentinel-1 SAR data over a large area is proposed. After the image is segmented into several blocks of the same size by using multi-scale chessboard segmentation method, combining bimodal detection method with skewness coefficient, the decision rules are designed to search blocks containing balanced mixture of positive and unchanged region, as well as blocks containing balanced mixture of negative and unchanged region. Taking the urban agglomerations of Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou as examples, the change detection research is carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed change detection method can effectively identify new construction land and damage areas, and provide effective basic data support for urban managers.

AB  - Land surface albedo is one of the key parameters in the radiation budget, the hydrological cycle and climate modeling studies. It is wildly known that large errors may occur in the estimation of surface albedo without taking into consideration the anisotropy reflectance effect, which is a general feature of the earth surface. In the present study, a new approach that utilizes prior BRDF knowledge, which is extracted from MODIS BRDF product, for estimating surface albedo has been proposed. The density plot of MODIS BRDF model parameters shows model parameters was in obvious assembled distribution. The prior BRDF knowledge was extracted from the most concentrated (top 60 percent) area. Results show that the prior BRDF-based albedo from simulated nadir reflectance enables 90 percent of all pixels have the absolute difference between -0.02 and 0.02.

AB  - We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the MODIS images in the Wei River Basin of the Loess Plateau from 2000 to 2016 based on the support of RS/GIS technology. The results indicate that: (1) The vegetation cover in the Wei River Basin has accelerated and improved since 2000. Afterwards, the vegetation decreased slightly; (2) More than 90% of the area in the past 17 years showed vegetation restoration. The significant recovery area mainly accounted for 6.80% of the vegetation reduction area in the Ziwuling and Liupanshan areas, and was mainly attributed to the urbanization process. The acceleration of the results further confirms the remarkable achievements of the ecological restoration project on the Loess Plateau and provides theoretical support for regional sustainable development.

AB  - Quad-polarimetric SAR data has been proved to be useful for marine oil spill classification. Different SAR polarimetric features have been proposed to discriminate between oil spills and look-alikes which could cause false detection. In this paper we explored the ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) in automatic oil spill classification, by taking the advantage of H/A/Alpha polarimetric decomposition features and co-polarized correlation coefficients(CC). The convolutional neural network (CNN) was refined to realize the classification, in which global average pooling layer is applied instead of full connection layer. The quad-polarimetric Radarsat-2 data acquired during the Norwegian oil-on-water exercise was tested in the experiment. Sea surface was classified as clean sea, oil spill, look-alikes(biological oil spill in this case), and emulsion. The experiment results show that H/A/Alpha parameters and the combination of H/A/Alpha and co-polarized CC obtained higher accuracy, and the refined CNN has better performance than the traditional one in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - Mountain glaciers are sensitive to climate change and are thus relevant indicators of regional climate variability. In order to understand the dynamics of glaciers, retrieving glacier surface velocity is valuable in understanding physical processes in glaciers. We apply an image cross-correlation algorithm in the frequency domain to derive glacier velocity on the Yanong glacier between 2013 and 2018. The results indicate that the flow patterns are related to the terrain complexity. Yanong Glacier maximum velocity was 168 m/year at the elevation around 4700 meters. The surface velocity exceeded 100 m/year above the elevation of 4200 m, while above 5000 m the surface velocity fluctuated around 60 m/year along the main stream.

AB  - Remote sensing data sharing will be an important part of the development of remote sensing. Remote sensing data is of great value, but the government is still the largest buyer behind the massive remote sensing data, and the commercial value of remote sensing has not been well discovered. In the future, data sharing will be one of the most effective methods in order to stimulate the commercial development of remote sensing data. Open sharing of data not only drives innovation in technology and industry, but also breaks down data barriers between various sectors of the economy, and generates great economic value for the country. According to this idea, this paper puts forward the remote sensing data sharing model which can conform to the development under the general trend of remote sensing data sharing. Remote sensing data often involves a series of security issues that need attention, such as land, so it is special. The remote sensing data involved in this paper is limited to commercially available data with the purpose of promoting the commercial development of remote sensing. The remote sensing data sharing envisaged in this paper involves remote sensing data that is built on the basis of being screened, not endangering or disclosing national geographic security information, and such data processing will help make people's life more convenient. Remote sensing data sharing faces three major problems, one is the data is large, and the resulting storage and processing problems, the second is that the data owner loses the control of the data, ownership, and the third is the real-time of remote sensing data, requiring the time of data processing must be timely and fast. We put forward a blockchain-based remote sensing data sharing model, which has the characteristics of cannot be tampered with, decentralized, secure, credible and collective maintenance, which is suitable for solving the security problems of data sharing of remote sensing institutions.

TI  - Multi-Time Scale Analysis of Regional Aerosol Optical Depth Changes in National-Level Urban Agglomerations in China Using Modis Collection 6.1 Datasets from 2001 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of China's economy and industry, characterizing the spatial and temporal changes of aerosols in China has attracted widespread attention from researchers. The national-level urban agglomerations are the most concentrated areas of China's economic, population and resource. Studying the spatial and temporal changes of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in these regions has practical guiding significance for effective monitoring of atmospheric particulate pollution. This paper analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of AOD in China's urban agglomerations during 2001-2017 by using Terra Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Level 2 aerosol products (MOD04_L2). Five national-level urban agglomerations were chosen: Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Middle-Reach (YRMR) and Cheng-Yu (CY). We analyzed the change patterns of AOD in different urban agglomerations at multi-time scales and built a time series decomposition model to mine the long-term trend, seasonal variation and abnormal change information of AOD time series. The result indicated that averaged AOD values in the five urban agglomerations were basically increased first and then decreased at the annual time scale during 2001-2017. The averaged AOD showed strong seasonal differences and AOD values in spring and summer were typically higher than those in autumn and winter. At the monthly time scale, the AOD typically varied from low in cold months to high in warm months and then decreased during the rainy periods. Time series decompositions revealed that a notable transition around 2007-2008 dominated the long-term overall trend over the five selected urban agglomerations and an initial upward tendency followed by a downward tendency was observed during 2001-2017. This study can be utilized to provide decision-making basis for atmospheric environmental governance and future development of urban agglomerations.

AB  - Multiple feeds per beam (MFB) antennas are currently one of the most popular solutions for modern high-throughput satellites (HTS). This paper presents an effective optimization method based on genetic algorithm for MFB antennas, which is composed of 7 feeds to composite one beam, namely "Medusa-like" configuration. Orthogonality constraints, introduced by lossless Beam Forming Network (BFN), are taken into account in overall optimization process. The optimized results for this type MFB antenna are given and shown good performances, with the gain, carrier to interference ratio (C/I) and cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) higher than 40.2dBi, 15.2dB and 22.6dB individually in each spot beam coverage.

AB  - Tropical natural forest plays an important role in environmental change and biodiversity researches. However, the complexity of structures and its cloudy and rainy environment make tropical natural forest classification difficult. Taking Hainan, China as study area, we conduct a tropical natural forest classification study by combining multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected from Sentinel-1 satellite and optical images collected from Landsat-8 satellite in this paper. The backscatter coefficient, spectrum information, digital elevation mod (DEM), temporal information offered by multiple remote sensing data have been analyzed to identify the evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest, evergreen coniferous forest, tropical monsoon forest, typical tropical rain forest and other forest types. In addition, a two-stage tropical forest classification strategy is proposed based on support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, namely the primary land cover type classification and tropical natural forest type classification in which the time-series backscattering information is used. Finally, the Hainan tropical forest mapping image is obtained based on the proposed classification strategy and the overall accuracy reaches to 90% based on field survey data. The results show the effectiveness of the classification strategy on tropical natural forest classification.

AB  - Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites play a central role in Earth observation systems. Due to high-speed movement, LEO satellites have very limited contact time with earth stations (ESs). Satellites that store too much data need to wait until they reconnect to ESs. In this case, the system may not meet the delay requirement. Existing works have scheduled the data downloading from satellites to ESs and made use of inter-satellite links (ISLs) to offload data among other satellites. However, such algorithms only maximize the overall throughput but neglect the truth that energy is always a scarce resource for satellites. To solve this problem, based on the proposed enhanced superposed multi-power level multi-transmission (ESMLMT) graph, we propose an iterative algorithm to minimize the energy consumption of data transmission while maximizing the throughput and satisfying the delay requirement. It is shown by simulations that our proposed algorithm achieved significantly higher energy efficiency without data downloading throughput performance degradation in satellite systems.

AB  - The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERSI) onboard FY-3 satellite possesses the Characteristics of wide scanning range, short revisit period and high spectral resolution, which can provide wide-area and long-term sequence data for leaf area index (LAI) retrieval research. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has great advantages of nonlinear fitting and can utilize the relationships between samples, can also solve the problem of large dimension of sample features. It is of great significance to apply it for LAI retrieval. Based on the FY-3B/ MERSI data simulated by hyperspectral data for five stages of maize canopy, this study explored multi-layer LSTM for LAI retrieval. Then, the results were compared with those of stepwise regression, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and single-layer LSTM method. The retrieval accuracies of Multi-layer LSTM model were better than those of other three models. Multi-layer LSTM provides a methodological reference for LAI retrieval studies.

TI  - Object-based rice mapping using time-series and phenological data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are often used in mapping rice, but high quality time-series remote sensing data are difficult to obtain due to the cloudy weather of rice growing areas and long satellite revisit interval. As such, rice mapping is usually based on mono-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ data, which have large uncertainties due to the spectral similarity of different vegetation types. Moreover, conventional pixel-based classification method is unable to meet the required accuracy for rice mapping. Therefore, this study proposes a new strategy for mapping rice in cloud-prone areas using fused data of Landsat-8 OLI time-series and phenological parameters, based on the object-based method. We determine the critical growth stages of paddy rice from observed phenological data and MODIS-NDVI time series data. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is used to blend the MODIS and Landsat data to obtain a multi-temporal Landsat-like dataset for classification. Finally, an object-oriented algorithm is used to extract rice paddies from the Landsat-like,I time-series dataset. The validation experiments show that the proposed method can provide high accuracy rice mapping, with an overall accuracy of 92.38% and a kappa coefficient of 0.85. (C) 2018 COSPAR.

TI  - Estimation of Vegetation Productivity Using a Landsat 8 Time Series in a Heavily Urbanized Area, Central China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the net primary production (NPP) of vegetation is essential for eco-environment conservation and carbon cycle research. Remote sensing techniques, combined with algorithm models, have been proven to be promising methods for NPP estimation. High-precision and real-time NPP monitoring in heterogeneous areas requires high spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing data, which are not easy to acquire by single remote sensors, especially in cloudy weather. This study proposes to fuse images of different sensors to provide high spatio-temporal resolution data for NPP estimation in cloud-prone areas. Firstly, the time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 days, are obtained by the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM). Then, the time series NDVI data, combined with meteorological data are input into an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model for NPP estimation. This method is validated by a case study of a heavily urbanized area, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in China. The results indicate that the NPP estimated by the fused NDVI data has more detailed spatial information than by using the MODIS data. The results show a strong correlation between the actual Landsat8 NDVI and the fused NDVI images, which means that the accuracy of synthetic NDVI images (a 16 day interval and a 30 m resolution) is reliable, and it can provide superior inputs for accurate estimations of a NPP time series. The correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error between the NPP, based on the fused NDVI and the measured NPP, are 0.66 and 14.280 g C/(m(2).yr), respectively, indicating a good consistency. The small discrepancy is caused by the uncertainties of fused NDVI, measurement errors, conversion errors, and other factors in the CASA model. In this study, we achieved NPP with high spatial and temporal resolutions, which can provide higher accuracies of NPP data for analyzing the carbon cycling heavily urbanized areas, compared with similar studies using mono-temporal NPP data. The spatio-temporal fusion technique is an effective way of generating high spatio-temporal resolution images from different sensors, thereby providing enough data for NPP monitoring in urbanized areas.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution and Regional Differentiation Features of Urbanization in China from 2003 to 2013
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the temporal and spatial patterns of impervious surfaces (IS) is important for assessing the environmental and ecological impacts of urbanization. In order to better extract IS, and to explore the divergence in urbanization in different regions, research on the regional differentiation features and regional change difference features of IS are required. To extract China's 2013 urban impervious area, we used the 2013 night light (NTL) data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) temporal series data, and used three urban impervious surface extraction indexes-Human Settlements Index, Vegetation-Adjusted NTL Urban Index, and the EVI-adjusted NTL index (EANTLI)-which are recognized as the best and most widely used indexes for extracting urban impervious areas. We used the classification results of the Landsat-8 images as the benchmark data to visually compare and verify the results of the urban impervious area extracted by the three indexes. We determined that the EANTLI index better reflects the distribution of the impervious area. Therefore, we used the EANTLI index to extract the urban impervious area from 2003 to 2013 in the study area, and researched the spatial and temporal differentiation in urban IS. The results showed that China's urban IS area was 70,179.06 km(2), accounting for 0.73% of the country's land area in 2013, compared with 20,565.24 km(2) in 2003, which accounted for 0.21% of the land area, representing an increase of 0.52%. On a spatial scale, like economic development, the distribution of urban impervious surfaces was different in different regions. The overall performance of the urban IS percentage was characterized by a decreasing trend from Northwest China, Southwest China, the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River, Northeast China, the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Southern Coastal China, and Northern Coastal China to Eastern Coastal China. On the provincial scale, the urban IS expansion showed considerable differences in different regions. The overall performance of the Urban IS Expansion index showed that the eastern coastal areas had higher values than the western inland areas. The cities or provinces of Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Shanghai had the largest growth in impervious areas. Spatially and temporally quantifying the change in urban impervious areas can help to better understand the intensity of urbanization in a region. Therefore, quantifying the change in urban impervious area has an important role in the study of regional environmental and economic development, policy formulation, and the rational use of resources in both time and space.

AB  - The black-odor water has significant negative impacts on the sustainable development of society and survival of mankind. The paper presents a new Urban Black-Odor Water (UBOW) model to identify the urban black-odor water body from high-resolution remote sensing image Gaofen-2(GF-2), to help monitor and control urban black-odor water bodies. The new UBOW model is derived from the analysis of the in-situ observation data and the spectral characteristics of GF-2. It takes advantage of the spectral difference at the blue band, the green band and the red band and has certain theoretical ground. The UBOW model can effectively identify the severe black-odor water and the mild black-odor water. The model is validated by the observation and the overall accuracy can be up to 81%. The UBOW model is used to analyze the dynamics of the urban black-odor water bodies of Beijing China, with monthly GF-2 images from March 2017 to October 2018. Results show that the urban blackodor water bodies, whether it is mild black-odor water bodies or severe black-odor water bodies, have been reduced significantly, which is consistent with the governmental report. This confirms that the Beijing government takes effective measurements to remedy the urban blackodor water bodies.

AB  - This paper addresses the forest height inversion based on the modified RMoG model using repeat-pass Pol-InSAR data. The linear variance of the Gaussian motion distribution in the RMoG model is replaced by a linear standard deviation to describe the volumetric motion heterogeneity and related coherence function is deduced based on that. Furthermore, a forest parameter inversion algorithm is proposed based on this modified model and its performance is investigated with L-band repeat-pass ALOS-1 quad-polarization data acquired over German forest site with temporal baselines of 46 days. Inversion results indicates that in comparison with the traditional RVoG and RMoG methods, the modified method can reduce 27.73% and 8.57% of the overestimation errors caused by the temporal decorrelation.

Finally, all the ergodic patches are weighted aggregated with integrity measure, then updated spatial data and its mask are regenerated through progressive iteration. Two experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on Sentienl-2 MSI data, with single/multiple temporal imageries in small and large-scale scenarios.

AB  - With the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, the resolution of satellite image is getting higher and higher, and more and more satellite data can be obtained on the ground. Traditional artificial image translation methods can not deal with massive data, and can not efficiently, quickly and accurately obtain the information of interested objects. In view of this problem, considering that the depth convolution neural network technology has achieved good results in the natural image target recognition, this paper uses the typical depth neural frame Faster R-CNN as the basic frame, and uses the image augmentation method to enhance the accuracy and generalization ability of the neural network model, and multi-resolution optical remote sensing image data to achieve automatic target recognition processing. The results show that the proposed method can translate images automatically and quickly, the recognition rate of ship and other targets is better than 75%.

TI  - A new road extraction method using Sentinel-1 SAR images based on the deep fully convolutional neural network
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a pressing need for an automatic road extraction method due to the continuous development of transportation networks. Free from the influence of weather, satellite-mounted synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) opens the way for such a road detection application. This study introduces an automatic discrimination method based on a deep neural network (DNN) adjusted for roads from dual-polarimetric (VV and VH) Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. In this proposed method, the U-Net extended the convolutional neural network (CNN), is adjusted for road extraction from SAR images. To investigate the potential of using the U-Net based fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for road extraction, LeNet-5, is applied as a preliminary DNN model. Additionally, several training optimizations are introduced to improve accuracy. To assess the performance of the different polarization modes used in road extraction, both single-polarimetric and dual-polarimetric data were investigated. Moreover, four machine learning algorithms have been compared for accuracy and speed. As a result, the outcome evaluation of Precision, Recall, and F-1 obtained by FCN is better than the original CNN, and the training time has been significantly reduced. The DNN model (CNN and FCN) is superior to machine learning methods in accuracy and elapsed computation time.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is widely used in remote sensing field, especially for the acquisition of quantitative information about the earth's environment. Calibration processing is critical for SAR image quantitative applications. This paper proposes a spaceborne SAR calibration simulator to describe the calibration process. First, Amazon rainforest area SAR image from Gaofen-3 was chosen to generate backscatter coefficient by adding a reference reflector for the purpose of quantitative analysis. Then the backscatter coefficient was entered into the spaceborne SAR calibration simulator. The simulator will perform echo simulation based on the system parameters of Gaofen-3. Based on the simulation echo, image formation processing is implemented for generating the focusing image. Furthermore, peak method and integral method were utilized to calibrate the SAR image. Simulation results show that integral method is better for calibration accuracy.

TI  - Developing a Method to Estimate Maize Area in North and Northeast of China Combining Crop Phenology Information and Time-Series MODIS EVI
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) is a convenient technology to estimate the regional cultivation areas of crops. However, the accurate estimation of maize areas using RS over a broad region is a significant challenge due to the large phenology differences and insufficient prior knowledge in space. To address this issue, a new method was developed in this work. In this method, the correlation (r) and root mean standard error (RMSE) between the time-series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index (MODIS EVI) and the standard EVI curve of maize from a reference area are computed. Pixels with a high value of r and a lowvalue of RMSE were identified as maize areas. The phenology information observed at agro-meteorological stations was also used to recognize maize pixels from the pixel-level phenology derived from time-series MODIS EVI. The proposed method provides an accurate characterization of the phenology differences over the study area by making use of the planting and maturity dates only. In addition, the few location-dependent parameters make the recognition of maize planting areas over large regions easier than previous studies. The proposed method was implemented over the Northeast China Plain (NECP) and North China Plain (NCP). The derived results were compared with official statistical results, and a close agreement was observed. At the city level, the satellite-derived estimates agreed well with the statistics with the R-2(RMSE) of 0.86(110.97 k hm(2)) in the NECP and 0.76(68.74 k hm(2)) in the NCP. At the county level, the R-2(RMSE) is 0.82(25.47 k hm(2)) in the NECP and 0.75(5.93 k hm(2)) in the NCP. At both temporal levels, the R-2(RMSE) results obtained in this work are higher(lower) than those published in other studies. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method is effective in maize area estimation over broad regions.

AB  - An advanced terahertz atmospheric profiling sounder for Chinese next generation meteorological satellite (FY-5 satellite) is introduced in this paper, driven by recent advances in microwave device technology that now permit broad frequency bands and higher frequencies into more sounding channels in order to not only improve both the vertical and horizontal resolutions of the retrieved atmospheric profile, but also enhance sounding capability of atmospheric hydrometeor parameters, like water cloud, ice, snow, rain and gaupel. Global simulation studies over ocean and land in clear and cloudy atmospheres using WMO radiosonde datesets and NWP reanalysis are presented that assess the temperature, moisture, and precipitation sounding capability with channels sampled near the 89, 118.75, 183.31, 380 and 425GHz absorption lines. Channel specification and configuration are presented after channel correlation and retrieval demonstration, and the distribution of subsystem units are determined based on previous design experience and requirements of satellite platform.

TI  - A Comprehensive Evaluation of Approaches for Built-Up Area Extraction from Landsat OLI Images Using Massive Samples
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information about built-up areas is valuable for mapping complex urban environments. Although a large number of classification algorithms for such areas have been developed, they are rarely tested from the perspective of feature engineering and feature learning. Therefore, we launched a unique investigation to provide a full test of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery for 15-m resolution built-up area classification in 2015, in Beijing, China. Training a classifier requires many sample points, and we proposed a method based on the European Space Agency's (ESA) 38-m global built-up area data of 2014, OpenStreetMap, and MOD13Q1-NDVI to achieve the rapid and automatic generation of a large number of sample points. Our aim was to examine the influence of a single pixel and image patch under traditional feature engineering and modern feature learning strategies. In feature engineering, we consider spectra, shape, and texture as the input features, and support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and AdaBoost as the classification algorithms. In feature learning, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as the classification algorithm. In total, 26 built-up land cover maps were produced. The experimental results show the following: (1) The approaches based on feature learning are generally better than those based on feature engineering in terms of classification accuracy, and the performance of ensemble classifiers (e.g., RF) are comparable to that of CNN. Two-dimensional CNN and the 7-neighborhood RF have the highest classification accuracies at nearly 91%; (2) Overall, the classification effect and accuracy based on image patches are better than those based on single pixels. The features that can highlight the information of the target category (e.g., PanTex (texture-derived built-up presence index) and enhanced morphological building index (EMBI)) can help improve classification accuracy.

TI  - Recent Surface Deformation in the Tianjin Area Revealed by Sentinel-1A Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we employed multitemporal InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) (MT-InSAR) to detect spatial and temporal ground deformations over the whole Tianjin region in the North China Plain area. Twenty-five ascending Sentinel-1A terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes covering this area, acquired from 9 January 2016 to 8 June 2017, were processed using InSAR time series analysis. The deformation results derived from Sentinel-1A MT-InSAR were validated with continuously operating reference stations (CORS) at four sites and four stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC). The overall results show good agreement, demonstrating the suitability of applying Doris with Sentinel-1A data to high-resolution monitoring of surface deformation. Significant deformation variations have been observed in different parts of Tianjin. These gradually increased from the central part of the metropolitan area to the nearby suburbs. The deformation rate of the main urban area is well-balanced and it is also relatively linear, with uplifting rates ranging from 0 to 20 mm/yr. However, due to the diversity of the geological conditions and anthropogenic activities, remarkable signs of subsidence were found in several parts of Tianjin. In particular, the south-western part of Wuqing District and western part of Beichen District showed subsidence rates of up to -136 mm/yr. We also found that, in addition to groundwater over-exploitation and lithological characteristics, additional factors also influence ground subsidence, including dynamic loads (e.g., railways), static loads (e.g., urban construction), and groundwater recharging.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Oil spill detection algorithms for the low spectral resolution of high spatial resolution land satellite images are currently limited. Some algorithms are based on the difference of the reflectance between the seawater and the oil spill; however, a proper threshold to detect the oil spill pixel from seawater pixel is much more difficult to define. This paper proposes a new dynamic threshold oil spill detection algorithm for the Landsat ETM+ for demonstration purposes. The new MOD09A1 Version 6 surface reflectance ocean products all year round were selected for constructing the monthly priori surface reflectance database for the dynamic threshold calculations. The 6S model simulates the relationship between the surface reflectance and the apparent reflectance with different geometric parameters, atmospheric models, and aerosol optical depths. The dynamic threshold models are established based on the simulated relationship by the 6S model. The Landsat ETM+ images with oil spill that happened in the Gulf of Mexico were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm showed a better result of oil spill detection in high accuracy.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Nitrogen is crucial for crop growth and nitrogen fertilization is essential for agriculture production. Nitrogen deficiency can reduce the yields, while excessive nitrogen fertilization can pollute the environment and cause the economic losses. Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is an effective indicator for assessing nitrogen content of crops and guiding nitrogen fertilization. The red edge (RE)-based and chlorophyll-related vegetation indices (VIs) have already been used to estimate LNC. However, the VI-based methods only use limited information provided by multispectral remote sensing data. The optical sensors onboard recently launched satellites, such as the WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2, have already included RE band, as well as other useful bands, for crop monitoring. To make full use of such multispectral data, the ANN-based retrieval models were constructed for LNC estimation of winter wheat using WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 imagery, respectively. Results show that the ANN-based methods can achieve better accuracies compared with the VI-based methods. The consistency between the estimated LNC of WorldView-2 and that of Sentinel-2 is satisfactory, while the difference between the two estimated LNC remains to be improved.

AB  - Building extraction from remote sensing images is always a nontrivial topic in the field of earth observation. Recently, approaches based on fully convolutional networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the semantic segmentation and made it possible to perform dense pixel-wise classification, among which the U-Net architecture is one of the most popular models. In this paper, three U-Nets consisting of normal convolution blocks, residual units and inception modules, named Normal-U-Net, Residual-U-Net and Inception-U-Net respectively, are designed for building extraction. Experimental results on the public Massachusetts building dataset show that the Inception U-Net is the most competitive architecture comprehensively. In addition, the three single U-Nets are combined into a stronger model called EU-Net, which has achieved a remarkable performance for building extraction.

TI  - Comparative study of remote sensing estimation methods for grassland fractional vegetation coverage - a grassland case study performed in Ili prefecture, Xinjiang, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) is an important biophysical parameter of terrestrial ecosystems. Based on Gaofen satellite no. 1 (GF-1) wide field-of-view (WFV) data from the Ili area of Xinjiang measured during the 2014 peak grassland vegetation season (from July to early August), this study adopted the statistical modelling, partitioned sub-pixel modelling, linear spectral unmixing, and maximum three-band gradient difference methods to estimate the FVCs of grasslands in the aforementioned region. The accuracies of the four estimation methods were compared and the effect of grassland type on accuracy was analysed. Based on ground quadrat data, the accuracies of the four methods of estimating grassland FVC in Xinjiang, Ili, were 88.66%, 87.31%, 88.01%, and 75.21%, respectively. The statistical modelling method was the most accurate, while the maximum three-band gradient difference method was the least. Temperate meadow steppe estimates developed using statistical modelling were the most accurate at 94.36%. The average accuracy of the four methods was highest when estimating temperate desert (90.10%) and the lowest accuracy was achieved with alpine meadow, with an average accuracy of 77.27%. Statistical modelling provided the highest accuracy in estimating the grassland FVC when adequate ground quadrat data was available, while the partitioned sub-pixel model had some advantages in estimating the low vegetation coverage area represented by temperate desert, and its precision reached 92.57%. Although the overall estimation accuracy of the maximum three-band gradient difference method was low, it achieved higher accuracy in the alpine meadow area than the other methods, reaching 85.62%.

AB  - Aerosol remote sensing monitoring is facing great challenges in complex background areas such as urban and industrial and mining enterprises, for the high surface reflectivity and the obvious characteristics of bidirectional reflection. This paper provides a MODIS aerosol inversion method for complex background conditions that is supported by BRDF/Albedo products. Using these products, the accuracy of surface reflectivity and the resulting inversion results of aerosols are improved. Three typical complex background areas (Beijing, Baltimore and Paris) were selected for application testing. Aerosol inversion was calculated using MODIS BRDF/Albedo data for six years from 2012 to 2017. Accuracy was verified using the AERONET ground-based observations in the corresponding areas, and results were compared with the existing MODIS aerosol product (MOD04 AOD). The inversion results of the new algorithm have higher precision and stability.

TI  - Modeling and Simulation of High-Frequency Solar Irradiance
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the use of solar power as a source of electricity is increasing, so is the interest in modeling radiation at high temporal resolutions. High-dimensional remote sensing data products depend on cloud cover variability, atmosphere aerosol levels, and other atmospheric parameters. Because of weather fronts and aerosols, it is difficult to quantify solar power variability based on distributed solar networks. The global horizontal irradiance (GHI) component in the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is available at a 30-min time resolution. The algorithm proposed in this paper produces 1-mm-resolution GHI samples at locations where NSRDB data are available. The synthetic irradiance datasets are produced using log-additive non-Gaussian mixture models and resampling techniques. The model is trained over historical data, and predicted values are compared with in situ data. This approach allows for estimating the solar irradiance at subhourly temporal resolutions, while featuring variability for locations where measurements are otherwise not available.

TI  - Identifying Emerging Reservoirs along Regulated Rivers Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of reservoirs is rapidly increasing owing to the growth of the world's economy and related energy and water needs. Yet, for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world, their locations and related information, especially for newly dammed reservoirs, are not readily available due to financial, political, or legal considerations. This study proposes an automated method of identifying newly dammed reservoirs from time series of MODIS-derived NDWI (normalized difference water index) images. Its main idea lies in the detection of abrupt changes in the NDWI time series that are associated with land-to-water conversion due to the reservoir impoundment. The proposed method is tested in the upper reach of the Yellow River that is severely regulated by constructed reservoirs. Our results show that five newly dammed reservoirs were identified in the test area during 2000-2018. Validated against high-resolution Google Earth imagery, our method is effective to determine both locations of the emerging medium-size reservoirs and the timing of their initial water impoundments. Such information then allows for a refined calculation of the reservoir inundation extents and storage capacities through the combination of higher-resolution Landsat imagery and SRTM DEM. The comparison of our estimated reservoir areas and capacities against documented information further indicates that the integration of multi-mission remote sensing data may provide useful information for understanding reservoir operations and impacts on river discharges. Our method also demonstrates a potential for regional or global inventory of emerging reservoirs, which is crucial to assessing human impacts on river systems and the global water cycle.

TI  - Translate SAR Data into Optical Image Using IHS and Wavelet Transform Integrated Fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors function well at all times and under all weather conditions, the images they produce are not intuitively straightforward. A novel idea based on data fusion is introduced to translate SAR data into optical image in this paper. The proposed SAR-optical image translation is implemented using an intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and wavelet transform integrated fusion (IHSW), so as to preserve as much as spatial details from SAR data, and minimize the spectral distortion of translated output. COSMO-SkyMed and ENVISAT-ASAR images are translated into optical images with the fusion of Landsat TM images, and the fusion results are compared with some conventional fusion methods, as well as the texture synthesis approach. Quality assessment of different fused outputs is carried out by using six quality indices. Visual and statistical comparisons of the final results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an effective translation from SAR to optical image and is superior to texture synthesis-based algorithm in terms of preserving spatial and spectral information. The proposed translation technique presents an alternative to improve the interpretability of SAR images.

TI  - A Novel Multitemporal Cloud and Cloud Shadow Detection Method Using the Integrated Cloud Z-Scores Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection in multispectral remote sensing imager due to the high spectral variations of clouds and the complexities of underlying landscapes, especially for images without thermal bands. In this paper, we proposed a multitemporal integrated cloud z-score (MTICZ) method for cloud and cloud shadow detection for multitemporal optical images. First, an integrated cloud z-score (ICZ) index was designed to identify clouds and cloud shadows, and measure the likelihood of a pixel being either a cloudy or shadowed pixel. Clouds and cloud shadows were then detected by differencing the ICZ values between the reference image and the cloudy image, and they were refined using a cloud and shadow matching algorithm. Finally, the MTICZ method was evaluated through cloud fraction estimation and 3,000 random validation samples from the cloudy Landsat scenes. The results indicate that MTICZ method achieved a significant agreement with reference cloud fractions (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 4.31%) and performed well under complicated land surface conditions, with an average overall accuracy of 91.65%. In addition, the MTICZ method was compared with two popular cloud detection methods, the Fmask method and the multitemporal cloud detection (MTCD) algorithm. This comparison reveals some improvements for cloud identification in complex landscapes, such as impervious surfaces and mixed areas of snow and cloud. Therefore, we argue that MTICZ provides an effective multitemporal method to detect cloud and cloud shadow for optical imagery in complicated landscapes.

AB  - Nowadays, the access of Landsat data-sets and the ever-lowering costs of computing make it feasible to monitor the Earth's land cover at Landsat resolutions of 30 meter. However, the rapid forest-covered products on a large scale, such as intercontinental or global, is still challenging. By utilizing the huge catalog of satellite imagery as well as the high-performance computing capacity of Google Earth Engine, we proposed an automated pipeline for generating 30-meter resolution global-scale forest map from time-series of Landsat images, and a novel 30-meter resolution global forest map of 2018 is released. In this paper, we describe the methods to create products of forest cover at Landsat resolutions. First, we partitioned the landscapes into sub-regions of similar forest type and spatial continuity, thus maximizing spectral differentiation, simplifying classifier model and improving classification accuracy. Then, with the existing forest cover, which come from a variety of sources, a multi-source forest/non-forest sample set was established for machine algorithm learning training. Finally, a machine learning algorithm was used to obtain samples automatically, extract the characteristics of satellite images and establish the forest / non-forest classifier models. Taking the Landsat8 images in 2018 as a case, selecting satellite image features based on the study of forest reflectance, including on-board reflectivity, the index of forest vegetation and the texture features of each hand, using established forest eco-zoning and multi-source forest / non-forest sample points, we realized automated learning and classification of forest cover for three initial zones. The accuracy verification of forest cover products in the three region was carried on two aspects: collecting verification points on high resolution satellite imagery (e.g. google earth), and cross-validating the current globally disclosed forest cover products. These two methods will illustrate the accuracy of the forest cover product.

AB  - The surface anisotropy plays a key role in the quantitative remote sensing inversion, which is usually described as bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Studies show that BRDF sampling has a significant effect on parameter inversion such as albedo. However, BRDF samplings are complex, and only specific samplings were considered in previous studies. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of BRDF sampling to albedo and the normalized difference between hotspot and dark spot (NDHD) angular index based on the kernel-driven Ross-Li BRDF model. Albedo and NDHD calculated by a set of dense sampling airborne data were used as the reference data, and inversion results from many sparse samplings were compared to the reference results. The result shows the overall number, plane, range and symmetry in observing condition of BRDF sampling can affect albedo and NDHD estimation. Among typical sensors, POLDER shows best sampling while Landsat shows largest errors.

An alternative method to obtain LSTs at a high-spatial resolution is to downscale LSTs from a coarse resolution to a finer resolution. In this article, we propose a new algorithm based on temperature and vegetation dryness index in combination with elevation correction to downscale Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST data from 1000m to 90m. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer LST data as a reference LST data set. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the temperature sharpening algorithm, which is widely used nowadays. The root mean square error and mean absolute error values of downscaled LSTs decrease from 3.1K (2.4K) to 2.8K (2.3K).

AB  - Based on the GF-1 satellite remote sensing data of the forage growing season in 2017 and 2018, the vegetation coverage was obtained by using dimidiate pixel model in Haiyan County demonstration area. The study area was divided into three areas with vertical zonality based on DEM data, which were high mountain, medium mountain and low mountain. The temporal and spatial variation characteristics of vegetation coverage in Haiyan County demonstration area from 2017 to 2018 were studied. Results showed: 1) The vegetation coverage of Haiyan County demonstration area was high in 2017 and 2018. The vegetation coverage area accounted for over 93% of the total area of Haiyan County demonstration area. 2) Spatially, the vegetation in Haiyan County demonstration area was mainly distributed in the medium mountain area, and the least in the high mountain area. 3) The vegetation coverage in Haiyan demonstration area was generally higher in the north and lower in the south. The monthly variations in vegetation coverage were basically the same in 2017 and 2018. The high vegetation coverage area increased from June to August, and decreased from August to September. The overall vegetation coverage showed an increasing trend. The analysis of the annual variation of vegetation coverage showed that the vegetation coverage was on the rise from 2017 to 2018, and the high vegetation coverage area had the largest increase.

AB  - Land surface water is one of the most important components of surface cover and global water cycle. In this study, the standard water spectrum selected from FY/MERSI image was firstly used to calculate the water probability. Then, based on water probability, the image was roughly classified into four classes: homogeneous ground, junction of land cover, minor tributaries and other. To extract land surface water from small tributaries, the Duda's Road Operator (DRO) was introduced to enhance the linear features, while Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) was applied to extract land surface water from other three classes. The results show that the method could effectively extract land surface water, especially from small tributaries, and overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient are improved compared to DPSO algorithm based on spectral matching (SMDPSO).

TI  - Misplaced optimism in agricultural land usage driven by newly available climate resources: A case study of estimated and realized cropping intensity in northern and northeastern China
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change may provide new opportunities for agricultural development at higher latitudes. High expectations for increasing cropping intensity have driven increases in crop production in northeastern and northern China. However, effectively utilizing the increased climate resources available at higher latitudes (due to longer growing seasons) remains controversial due to the increased risks involved. Here, we employed a phenology-based sliding segmentation algorithm and cropping system zoning index to survey the development of actual and potential multiple-cropping systems. Our results revealed that the development of multiple cropping clearly lags behind its increased potential area, as the actual multiple-cropping area increased by only 7.06% over the past 30 years. The use of newly available climate resources is quite low (>= 0.86%), especially given the newly available potential multiple-cropping area. Consideration of results from Chile, Brazil, Vietnam, and the Nordic countries shows that cropping intensity development due to climatic warming face limitations from climate risk that must be reasonably addressed to achieve the potential benefits. Other barriers to the full use of such new environmental resources include proper information, conservative farmer behavior, agricultural product prices, and labor transfers. Therefore, any hypothesized optimism that the simple addition of climate resources would result in the effective utilization of arable lands is misplaced, and more cautious estimates of the potentially positive effects of climatic change on agricultural production should be emphasized by both scientists and policy makers.

TI  - TransLand: An Adversarial Transfer Learning Approach for Migratable Urban Land Usage Classification using Remote Sensing
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)

AB  - Urban land usage classification is a critical task in big data based smart city applications that aim to understand the social-economic land functions and physical land attributes in urban environments. This paper focuses on a migratable urban land usage classification problem using remote sensing data (i.e., satellite images). Our goal is to accurately classify the land usage of locations in a target city where the ground truth land usage data is not available by leveraging a classification model from a source city where such data is available. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that primarily rely on a rich set of ground-truth data for accurate model training, which encounters high annotation costs. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) the target and source cities often have different urban characteristics that prevent the direct application of a model learned from the source city to the target city; ii) the complex visual features in satellite images make it non-trivial to "translate" the images from the target city to the source city for an accurate classification. To address the above challenges, we develop TransLand, an adversarial transfer learning framework to translate the satellite images from the target city to the source city for accurate land usage classification. We evaluate our scheme on the real-world satellite imagery and land usage datasets collected from five different cities in Europe. The results show that TransLand significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art land usage classification baselines in classifying the land usage of locations in a city.

TI  - Long-term change of total suspended matter in a deep-valley reservoir with HJ-1A/B: implications for reservoir management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The valley reservoirs service as a critical resource for society by providing drinking water, power generation, recreation, and maintaining biodiversity. Management and assessment of the water environment in valley reservoirs are urgent due to the recent eutrophication and water quality deterioration. As an essential component of the water body, total suspended matter (TSM) hinder the light availability to underwater and then affect the photosynthesis of aquatic ecosystem. We used long-term HJ-1A/B dataset to track TSM variation and elucidating the driving mechanism of valley reservoirs. Taking a typical deep-valley reservoir (Xin'anjing Reservoir) as our case study, we constructed a TSM model with satisfactory performance (R-2, NRMSE, and MRE values are 0.85, 18.57%, and 20%) and further derived the spatial-temporal variation from 2009 to 2017. On an intra-annual scale, the TSM concentration exhibited a significant increase from 2.13 +/- 1.10mgL(-1) in 2009 to 3.94 +/- 0.82mgL(-1) in 2017. On a seasonal scale, the TSM concentration in the entire reservoir was higher in the summer (3.36 +/- 1.54mgL(-1)) and autumn (2.74 +/- 0.82mgL(-1)) than in the spring (1.84 +/- 1.27mgL(-1)) and winter (1.44 +/- 2.12mgL(-1)). On a monthly scale, the highest and lowest mean TSM value occurred in June (4.66 +/- 0.45mgL(-1)) and January (0.67 +/- 1.50mgL(-1)), and the monthly mean TSM value increased from January to June, then dropped from June to December. Combing HJ-1A/B-derived TSM, climatological data, basin dynamic, and morphology of the reservoir, we elucidated the driving mechanism of TSM variation. The annual increase of TSM from long-term HJ-1A/B data indicated that the water quality of Xin'anjiang Reservoir was decreasing. The annual increase of phytoplankton jointed with an increase of built-up land and decrease of forest land in the basin may partially be responsible for the increasing trend in TSM. This study suggested that combining the long-term remote sensing data and in situ data could provide insight into the driving mechanism of water quality dynamic and improve current management efforts for local environmental management.

AB  - Wetlands and oceans, forests are the three major ecosystems and it is one of the most important living environment of human being. Wetland change has a great impact on climate change, biodiversity, economic development, etc. It is of great significance for wetland conservation and management to study the change of wetland landscape pattern and the causes of the change. At present, the research on wetland landscape pattern change mainly focuses on the spatial-temporal law and driving force of wetland landscape change, but the relationship between landscape pattern index and driving factor needs to be further studied. In this paper, the Shengjin Lake wetland in Chizhou City, Anhui Province, was selected as the research object. Using the Landsat TM remote sensing data from 1993, 2000, 2008 and 2016, the maximum likelihood classification was used to extract the wetland. The landscape evaluation indexes such as patch density, maximum patch index, incense density evenness index, dominance degree and aggregation degree were selected to study the temporal and spatial changes of wetland area in this area by using landscape pattern index analysis method. The main causes of wetland change were also analyzed. The results show (1) The change of wetland area showed an upward trend from 1993 to 2000. The wetland area decreased continuously in 2000-2008 and 2008-2016, and the decline was smaller in 2008-2016. The wetland landscape area in 2000 was the largest, and the area was 144.973 km(2). (2) From 1993 to 2016, the area of wetland and the largest patch in Shengjin Lake area first increased and then decreased, and the maximum patch index reached 10.55% in 2008. The shape of the patch was complicated, and the degree of human disturbance gradually increased. The landscape dominance of Shengjin Lake wetland is higher, but it shows the trend of decreasing first and then rising. (3) The influence of man-made interference on the area connectivity of the landscape wetland in the Lijin Lake area is weakened firstly, the influence of man-made interference on the shape of the wetland patch is large, and the main cause of the change of the wetland landscape area in the Shengjin Lake area is also the main reason. It is found that the wetland area of Shengjin Lake has been decreasing continuously since 2000, which is mainly influenced by human activities. What needs to be studied is the mechanism of interaction between landscape pattern and man-made disturbance in this area. It provides important basis for protection and management of Shengjin Lake wetland.

AB  - Classification and recognition of crops is an important prerequisite for crop yield estimation and crop growth monitoring. Rapid and accurate acquisition of crop type, spatial distribution and area information can provide basic basis for crop planting structure optimization and structural reform of agricultural supply side. It is of great significance to the formulation of agricultural policy, the development of social economy and the guarantee of national food security. In recent years, hyperspectral remote sensing has been able to fine classify crop types and varieties and obtain spatial distribution maps and planting structure information of crops by virtue of its many hands, abundant spectral information and sensitivity to small spectral differences among ground objects. This paper summarizes the application of hyperspectral remote sensing in crop fine classification, summarizes the hyperspectral data sources commonly used in crop fine classification at home and abroad, such as Hyperion data, environmental satellite data, CASI data and OMIS data, and analyses the applicability of various data. Meanwhile, the methods of crop fine classification using hyperspectral remote sensing are summarized, including decision tree classification, support vector machine classification, multi-classifier integration, spatial-spectral feature classification, hyperspectral data and radar data fusion classification, and the characteristics of various classification methods are analyzed. It was found that the classification accuracy of crop fine classification based on hyperspectral data was higher (better than 90%). But there are still some shortcomings: (1) At present, scholars at home and abroad focus on areas with simple planting structure. Most of the crop types in these areas are rice, wheat and other large-scale food crops, but less on cash crops such as sesame, rape, peanut and so on. (2) Hyperspectral remote sensing has high classification accuracy for regions with fewer crop types, but the classification accuracy needs to be improved in regions with many crop types. (3) Hyperspectral data has a high dimension and a large amount of data processing workload, which is not suitable for fine classification of crops in large-scale areas. Future research directions: (1) Expanding the scope of hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring objects, mainly cash crops. (2) Selecting areas with complex planting structure, fragmented plots, fluctuating topography and various crop types for fine classification of crops. (3) Attaching importance to the essential features of hyperspectral remote sensing fine classification and finding a stable classifier which is generally suitable for crop fine classification. (4) The mechanism of crop fine classification using hyperspectral remote sensing and the method of multi-source data fusion need to be further studied.

TI  - Driving force analysis of landscape pattern changes in Honghu Wetland Nature Reserve in recent 40 years
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - This study took Honghu National Nature Reserve as an example to investigate the driving forces on Landscape pattern changes based on the land use and land change data of 1974, 1979,1984, 1990, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2009, 2014 and 2017, which were obtained from interpretation of Landsat images. Correlation analysis was adopted for finding characteristics of the interaction by combining with meteorological hydrological data such as temperature, precipitation and water stage. The results showed that: Land use intensity index risen from 207 at the begining of the study to 249.36 at the end of the study during the period of 1974-2017, these changes were more due to enlargement in the interference of human activities for land-use change. About 30% of the natural wetlands translated into ponds, farmland and bottomland and construction land by 2017. The landscape pattern indices of different types have changed greatly, the lakeside zone has formed a low enclosed ponds dominated by aquaculture after entering twenty-first Century. On the whole, landscape tended to be diversified, fragmented, reduced in connectivity and weakened in stability. The correlation coefficient between land use intensity index and the composite index of landscape pattern is 0.84, it shows that LUCC is very closely related to the landscape pattern. With the increase of land use intensity, the landscape is more fragmented, the degree of connectivity between patches is weakly, the landscape aggregation degree of the area is decreasing, and the landscape heterogeneity is increasing. In general, the Honghu Wetland Nature Reserve is affected obviously by human interference. The goal of maintaining the balance of Honghu wetland ecosystem is achieved through rational exploitation and utilization, returning farmland to grass and lake, restoring the vegetation of the lakeside zone, increasing the diversity of its aquatic plants, realizing the effective restoration of the wetland, improving its structure and function. A combination of the natural restoration of vegetation and the establishment of demonstration area of vegetation restorations is carried out, and the hygrophilous vegetation, emergent aquatic vegetation, floating vegetation, floating-leaved vegetation, and submerged vegetation, should be constructed from the lakeside to the heart of the lake.

AB  - With the rapid development of space technology, the use of low-orbit micro-nano satellite platform to build communication network has become a hot spot in the future development. Laser communication has the outstanding advantages of large communication capacity, light weight, low power consumption, small size and good confidentiality. In order to solve the bottleneck problem of communication capacity and confidentiality of traditional microwave communication methods and the load volume of micro-nano satellites, The requirements for weight and power consumption provide a new way. They are highly valued by countries such as Europe, the United States, and Japan. They invest a lot of resources in related research, and are actively developing into commercialization and practical use to establish global micro- Nano satellite laser communication network is an inevitable trend. In this paper, the application background of laser communication antenna for low-orbit micro-nano satellite is carried out, and the in-depth study of laser communication and sighting antenna is carried out. The modal analysis and thermo-coupling analysis of the mirror assembly are used to optimize the design and the antenna is inspected. In the light and miniaturized design process, the problems of different axes of the telephoto axis of the telephoto unit and the azimuth axis are encountered. Through the analysis of the problem, the coaxiality adjustment device based on the wedge and the optical axis of the wedge is designed and designed. Based on the principle of double wedge refraction, the optical axis is effectively adjusted by rotating the wedge angle to ensure its coaxiality. It has important theoretical value and guiding significance for the related research of laser communication antenna for micro-nano satellite.

CP  - 16th IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) / IEEE Visualization Conference (IEEE VIS)
CL  - Vancouver, CANADA
AB  - Composite temporal event sequence visualizations have included sentinel event alignment techniques to cope with data volume and variety. Prior work has demonstrated the utility of using single-event alignment for understanding the precursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events surrounding a sentinel event. However, the usefulness of single-event alignment has not been sufficiently evaluated in composite visualizations. Furthermore, recently proposed dual-event alignment techniques have not been empirically evaluated. In this work, we designed tasks around temporal event sequence and timing analysis and conducted a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to examine four sentinel event alignment approaches: no sentinel event alignment (NoAlign), single-event alignment (SingleAlign), dual-event alignment with left justification (DualLeft), and dual-event alignment with stretch justification (DualStretch). Differences between approaches were most pronounced with more rows of data. For understanding intermediate events between two sentinel events, dual-event alignment was the clear winner for correctness-71% vs. 18% for NoAlign and SingleAlign. For understanding the duration between two sentinel events, NoAlign was the clear winner: correctness-88% vs. 36% for DualStretch-completion time-55 seconds vs. 101 seconds for DualLeft- and error-1.5% vs. 8.4% for DualStretch. For understanding precursor and aftereffect events, there was no significant difference among approaches.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, incurable autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans in which the body stops producing insulin and blood glucose levels rise. The goal of intensive diabetes management is to lower average blood glucose through frequent adjustments to insulin protocol. diet. and behavior. Manual logs and medical device data are collected by patients, but these multiple sources are presented in disparate visualization designs to the clinician making temporal inference difficult. We conducted a design study over 18 months with clinicians performing intensive diabetes management. We present a data abstraction and novel hierarchical task abstraction for this domain. We also contribute IDMVis: a visualization tool for temporal event sequences with multidimensional. interrelated data. IDMVis includes a novel technique for folding and aligning records by dual sentinel events and scaling the intermediate timeline. We validate our design decisions based on our domain abstractions, best practices, and through a qualitative evaluation with six clinicians. The results of this study indicate that IDMVis accurately reflects the workflow of clinicians. Using IDMVis, clinicians are able to identify issues of data quality such as missing or conflicting data; reconstruct patient records when data is missing, differentiate between days with different patterns; and promote educational interventions after identifying discrepancies.

AB  - A preliminary layer perceptible water vapor (LPW) products retrieval algorithm for FengYun-4 (FY-4) advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI) was briefly introduced in this paper. The product generation needs IR BTs from 6 AGRI infrared channels along with NWP output. The LPW output includes TPW, PW at three atmospheric layers in sigma ordinate (PW_low: 0.9 - SFC, PW_mid: 0.7 - 0.9, PW_high: 0.3 - 0.7). TPW (total precipitable water) is the amount of liquid water (in cm) if all the atmospheric water vapor in the column was condensed. The second generation geostationary satellite series of China - FY-4 will enable many improvements and new capabilities for imager-based products.

AB  - Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) refers to the ratio of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by the green part of the vegetation canopy to the total PAR. Accurate and quantitative monitoring of rice FPAR is of great significance for cultivation management and yield estimation. High spatial and temporal resolution optical images, and all-time all-weather radar images are widely used in crop monitoring. In this study, a rice FPAR synergistic inversion model was established using a combination of optical and radar remote sensing dataset. The results suggest that the estimated FPAR is more approximate to the measured values, compared with the commonly used MODIS FPAR product. The FPAR spatiotemporal distribution maps are generated based on the synergistic inversion model.

AB  - Modern satellite communication systems are designed to meet broadband, high-capacity and high-speed service requirements, but spectrum-limited and quality-of-service issues due to spatial multiplexing of spectrum resources can not be ignored. Because of the multicast mode, the interference problem between multi-users in satellite communication is very serious. Therefore, multi-beam forming in the digital domain is the development trend of multi-beam forming structure. In this paper, we propose a block-adaptive least mean square algorithm, which is based on the strong rainfall attenuation of the Ka-band GEO satellite system. The algorithm is applied in the use of 37 array elements evenly arranged phased array antenna to form 7 spot beams. The convergence and tracking characteristics of the improved algorithm are analyzed by comparing the typical LMS algorithm. Finally, a pattern of the given coverage area beam is formed.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing Open Access Journal (RS OAJ) is an international leading journal in the field of remote sensing science and technology. It was first published in the year 2009 and is currently celebrating tenth year of publications. In this research, a bibliometric analysis of RS OAJ was conducted based on 5588 articles published during the 10-year (2009-2018) time-period. The bibliometric analysis includes a comprehensive set of indicators such as dynamics and trends of publications, journal impact factor, total cites, eigenfactor score, normalized eigenfactor, CiteScore, h-index, h-classic publications, most productive countries (or territories) and institutions, co-authorship collaboration about countries (territories), research themes, citation impact of co-occurrences keywords, intellectual structure, and knowledge commutation. We found that publications of RS OAJ presented an exponential growth in the past ten years. From 2010 to 2017 (for which complete years data were available), the h-index of RS OAJ is 67. From 2009-2018, RS OAJ includes publications from 129 countries (or territories) and 3826 institutions. The leading nations contributing articles, based on 2009-2018 data, and listed based on ranking were: China, United States, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Canada, England, Australia, Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland and Austria. The leading institutions, also for the same period and listed based on ranking were: Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Normal University, The university of Maryland, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, China University of Geosciences, United States Geological Survey, German Aerospace Centre, University of Twente, and California Institute of Technology. For the year 2017, RS OAJ had an impressive journal impact factor of 3.4060, a CiteScore of 4.03, eigenfactor score of 0.0342, and normalized eigenfactor score of 3.99. In addition, based on 2009-2018, data co-word analysis determined that remote sensing, MODIS, Landsat, LiDAR and NDVI are the high-frequency of author keywords co-occurrence in RS OAJ. The main themes of RS OAJ are multi-spectral and hyperspectral remote sensing, LiDAR scanning and forestry remote sensing monitoring, MODIS and LAI data applications, Remote sensing applications and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Through author keywords citation impact analysis, we find the most influential keyword is Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), followed, forestry, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), terrestrial laser scanning, airborne laser scanning, forestry inventory, urban heat island, monitoring, agriculture, and laser scanning. By analyzing the intellectual structure of RS OAJ, we identify the main reference publications and find that the themes are about Random Forests, MODIS vegetation indices and image analysis, etc. RS OAJ ranks first in cited journals and third in citing, this indicates that RS OAJ has the internal knowledge flow. Our results will bring more benefits to scholars, researchers and graduate students, who hopes to get a quick overview of the RS OAJ. And this article will also be the starting point for communication between scholars and practitioners. Finally, this paper proposed a nuanced h-index (nh-index) to measure productivity and intellectual contribution of authors by considering h-index based on whether the one is first, second, third, or nth author.This nuanced approach to determining h-index of authors is powerful indicator of an academician's productivity and intellectual contribution.

AB  - As the second largest freshwater lake in Yunnan Province of China, Erhai Lake has suffered harmful algal blooms (HABs) since 1996. In January 2017, Dali government issued a series of ecological protection measures to prevent the outbreak of HABs. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of those protection measures, we studied the spatio-temporal distribution of HABs in Erhai Lake by using multi-source remote sensing data during 2016-2018. The results demonstrate that coverage area and frequency of HABs occurrence were decreasing after January 2017, which indicates a good respond to water protection regulations. However, in 2018, HABs still occurred around residential and tourist area. Furthermore, drastic measures also impeded local economic development due to shuttering businesses and banning fanning around lake. Therefore, there is still a long way to go for local government to achieve long-tern goals of sustainable economy and water environment stability of Erhai region.

AB  - Cloud-contaminated pixels exist ubiquitously in satellite images, which limit the usability of satellite images and increase the difficulty of image analysis. To reconstruct these pixels, a basic idea is to transfer cloud-free pixels from corresponding multi-temporal images to the target image, and the performance of this category of methods depends on the quality of information transfer between images. We propose in this work a novel pixel reconstruction method based on optimal transport. Our method first conducts an adaptive color transfer between multi-temporal images and then replaces cloud-contaminated pixels by transferred cloud-free pixels. The proposed method fully explores the potential of optimal transport to generate a more adaptive color transfer plan and thus ensure a high quality information transfer between images. Compared with other widely used methods, visual and statistical results on Landsat and MODIS images demonstrate the capacity of our method.

AB  - With the global climate changing and increasing of anthropogenic activity, the dynamics permafrost environment of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is becoming fragile. As one of the most important infrastructures in the QTP, the Qinghai-Tibet Power Transmission Line (QTPTL) has been constructed since 2011. In some section, the stability of QTPTL has been damaged due to the harsh climate and the effect of freezing and thawing of permafrost. In this paper, structural health and stability of QTPTL are evaluated using time-series InSAR with TerraSAR X-band data. The structure feature of the transmission line tower in high resolution SAR image are analyzed. Then the deformation velocity, height and thermal dilation of the QTPTL is retrieved.

AB  - In coal mining areas, ground subsidence persistently happens, which brings serious environmental issues and affects the safety of infrastructure. In order to effectively assess and control the security problems especially traffic problems brought by mining in Dayan mining area which located in Hulunbeier, Inner Mongolia, China. This paper uses the sentinel-1 data to monitor land subsidence through D-InSAR. According to D-InSAR results, it can be clearly found that the uplifting of railways and the subsidence basin caused by human activities. Subsidence basin is the most risky area and should be concerned, so we analyzed it carefully through combining subsidence profile and coherence profile. By comparing with the leveling results, the accuracy of D-InSAR reaches 7.7 mm. The research shows that D-InSAR can accurately reflect the trend of land subsidence, which is important for land deformation monitoring in mining areas and D-InSAR results can provide data support for mine safety assessment.

AB  - In view of the problem of extensive irrigation in water diversion irrigation in Hetao irrigation area, and the problem of increasing the planting area in order to increase the output, it is necessary that building a water-saving ecological irrigation area in Hetao irrigation area. The information extraction of canal system is the precondition of precision irrigation. Compared with satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform is easier to improve resolution and more flexible than ground station. Based on the UAV remote sensing image, the image is preprocessed with ENVI 5.1 software, and the three channels of the remote sensing image are stretched and displayed respectively, and the contrast is enhanced by combination of the three channels. In this paper, the object-oriented method is used to segment the image, and the rule-based classification method is used. Based on the separate and combined analysis of different rules, the optimal combination rule of the spectral mean value is less than 98, the minimum bounding rectangle length width ratio is between the minimum and 0.85, and the lengthening line is more than 1 m. The recognition accuracy reaches to the sublateral ditches grade ecological canal and evaluates the extraction results. The accuracy of the combined interpretation is 96.4%, which provides the information of the canal system for the management of precision irrigation.

TI  - Retrieval of leaf water content from remotely sensed data using a vegetation index model constructed with shortwave infrared reflectances
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate estimation of leaf water content (LWC) is of great practical significance for monitoring the state of vegetation growth and forecasting crop yield. As the spectral capabilities of terrestrial spectroscopy instruments and high-spatial-resolution satellite sensors steadily increase, people pay more and more attentions to the application potential for the spectral characteristics of the plant in shortwave infrared (SWIR) domain. The major purpose of this article was to investigate the relationship between leaf spectral reflectance and LWC in SWIR. A normalized vegetation index model constructed with SWIR reflectances centred at 1725 and 2200nm yielded a high overall performance compared to the previous normalized difference water index (NDWI). The Leaf Optical Properties Experiment 1993 data set was introduced to validate the LWC estimated with the proposed model. The results showed that the accuracy of LWC estimation from this index can reach 0.0046gcm(-2), which is better than that from traditional NDWI with root mean square error equalled to 0.0104gcm(-2). The effects of band width and random noise on the LWC estimation from these two indices were also analysed and the results showed that LWC retrieved from both indices were insensitive to band width choices and random noise variations.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel 1-bit SAR imaging scheme with the assistance of a single-frequency threshold. Such a threshold is able to maintain the amplitude information lost in the 1-bit quantization. Moreover, the influence of high order harmonics is also suppressed due to the spectrum shifting effect brought by the threshold and its high order harmonics. The 1-bit SAR imaging quality is thus improved while the system simplification brought by 1-bit sampling, which is gained by replacing a conventional multiplier with a logic gate, can still be retained. Strategy for SAR parameter selection is discussed to guarantee the performance. Experiment based on the RADARSAT-2 data verifies the validity of the proposed scheme.

TI  - Improved Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Optimal Phase History Retrieval of Distributed Scatterers in InSAR Stacks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed scatterer (DS) decorrelation poses a challenge to multibaseline SAR interferometry. To overcome this challenge, the SqueeSAR retrieves an optimal phase time-series using a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, which has been commonly used due to its remarkable effect. Unfortunately, however, the MLEs performance is compromised for various reasons, such as inaccurate statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and the bias in the estimator used. In this paper, we present an approach aiming to improve the MLEs performance. The proposed approach includes the employment of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to realize more accurate SHP selection and the use of the second kind statistical estimator to mitigate the coherence bias. The performance of the conventional MLE is significantly improved by the proposed approach, making it close to its optimal performance. The experimental results on both simulated and real TerraSAR-X data demonstrate the improvements of the proposed approach with respect to the conventional MLE.

CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - As the most commonly used hyperspectral data source, the acquisition method of Hyperion hyperspectral reflectance became more and more important. In this study, a batch atmospheric correction method based on Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum radiative transfer code (6SBAC) has been presented. The 6SBAC was used MODIS synchronous atmospheric data products to obtain meteorological parameters, and set up automatic input-output parameter module to obtain Hyperion reflectance data. At the same time, using Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), Quick Atmospheric Correction(QUAC) atmospheric correction methods on Hyperion satellite images, the results was compared with the synchronous hyperspectral data measured in Dunhuang test site. The authenticity of the obtained hyperspectral reflectance was verified by MODIS surface products. The results showed that the hyperspectral reflectance obtained by the three kinds of atmospheric correction methods were consistent with the measured reflectance in trend. Despite the compromises in different wavelength regions 6SBAC is found to be a better corrector method for the Hyperion hyperspectral reflectance acquisition. The precision of the 6SBAC obtained hyperspectral reflectance can meet the application requirements and improve the acquisition efficiency of Hyperion hyperspectral reflectance data.

AB  - Canopy water content (CWC) is one of the factors that influence photosynthesis and evapotranspiration. Vegetation indices have been proposed to destribe the relationship between spectral profiles and canopy water content. In this paper, we propose a retrieval method using the common swir bands of satellites (such as sentinel-2), and develop a split-window algorithm to weaken the effect of other influential factors. PROSAIL model and the SPARC03 dataset are used for validation by resampling the hyperspectral data to board bands using spectral response function of sentinel-2. The result shows that the method can retrieve the canopy water content of different species of vegetation, with a satisfactory R of 0.669. After dividing the vegetation into two classes, both classes have an improvement with R of 0.783 and 0.939.

TI  - Modelling and analysis of net primary productivity and its response mechanism to climate factors in temperate grassland, northern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland productivity is the most direct indicator of grassland's ecological status; thus, precise and rapid estimation of grassland productivity has an important significance for evaluating regional ecological carrying capacity, utilizing and developing natural resources reasonably. In this study, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer remote-sensing data, meteorological data, and ground measured data, the light utilization efficiency parameter of Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model was optimized, and the optimized model was used to estimate net primary productivity (NPP) and analyse its spatio-temporal distribution of Xilingol grassland between 2005 and 2014. In addition, we investigated the NPP response mechanism to climate factors from two aspects, i.e. the accumulation amount and time of NPP. The results indicated that (i) Maximum light utilization efficiency was calculated to be 0.539g C MJ(-1) for Xilingol grassland according to the least error criterion. (ii) Validation against NPP observations from 30 sites showed good performance of the optimized model in the research area, with an overall coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.72 and mean relative estimation error of 0.29. (iii) The annual mean NPP of Xilingol grassland was 161.23g C m(-2)year(-1), with a decreasing trend from the northeast to the southwest. (iv) NPP presented increasing trend with a rate of 3.89g C m(-2)year(-1) overall during 20052014, and the largest increase in NPP was found in temperate meadow-steppe. However, desert ecosystems showed the largest increasing rate after NPP standardization. (v) Precipitation was the main factor for driving carbon accumulation at the inter-annual scale, and the time to maximum NPP was significantly correlated with spring precipitation (R-2=0.637), NPP peaked early as the spring precipitation increasing.

TI  - ANALYZING AND MODELING THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN EXPANSION: A CASE STUDY OF HANGZHOU CITY, CHINA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion is increasingly important for assisting the decision making related to sustainable urban development. By integrating remote sensing (RS), spatial metrics, and the cellular automata (CA) model, this study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion and simulated future scenarios for Hangzhou City, China. The land cover maps (2002, 2008, and 2013) were derived from Landsat images. Moreover, the spatial metrics were applied to characterize the spatial pattern of urban land. The CA model was developed to simulate three scenarios (Business-As-Usual (BAU), Environmental Protection (EP), and Coordination Development (CD)) based on the various strategies. In addition, the scenarios were further evaluated and compared. The results indicated that Hangzhou City has experienced significant urban expansion, and the urban area has increased by 698.59 km(2). Meanwhile, the spatial pattern of urban land has become more fragmented and complex. Hangzhou City will face unprecedented pressure on land use efficiency and coordination development if this historical trend continues. The CD scenario was regarded as the optimized scenario for achieving sustainable development. The findings revealed the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion and provide a support for future urban development.

AB  - One of the significant challenges of spatiotemporal big data management is the inconsistent data structures and organization methods of different data sources, such as remote sensing raster data and location-aware social sensing data. Traditional spatial data management systems are unable to support the integrated process and analysis of those data with different data types. Currently, in the field of remote sensing data management and processing, the data cube model is promising for constructing "analysis ready" remote sensing big data. This paper is initiated by the data cube model from data warehousing research area, and investigates the integrated data model and organization methods for remote sensing data and location-based social sensing data based on spatiotemporal data cube. Moreover, we implement the spatiotemporal data cube model on an array DBMS, and show a disaster analysis scenario for integrated analysis of multi-source spatiotemporal big data.

AB  - The ocean gravity field has always been an important part of marine scientific research. Combining ship survey data and satellite data to obtain high-resolution and high-precision gravity data attracts many researchers. In this paper, we present two fusion methods of gravity anomaly data, which are data fusion based on the analysis of error trend surface and the data fusion method based on the combination of net function and fractal interpolation. The experimental results show that the data fusion based on the analysis of error trend surface can effectively improve the effect of data fusion. The data fusion method based on the combination of net function and fractal interpolation is not obvious for accuracy improvement, but it shows great potential in terms of detail.

TI  - Temporal-Spatial Distribution of Chlorophyll-a and Impacts of Environmental Factors in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Better understanding of the temporal-spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) is crucial in controlling harmful water blooms. In this study, the dynamical change of Chl-a over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea from 20032017 were analyzed by using the MODIS/Aqua satellite data, and the effects of sea surface temperature (SST), wind and wave were investigated. The typical distribution modes of long-term surface Chl-a were extracted by using the Self-organizing Mapping (SOM), neural network model. The results showed distinct seasonal variations of the Chl-a along with a gradual increase in the study period. The total Chl-a of the whole area reached the lowest value of 2.41mg/m(3) in July, and the highest value 3.43mg/m(3) in April; though in Laizhou Bay, the Chl-a concentration was significantly higher than other regions and the value reached at the peak in September. The spatial distribution showed that Chl-a decreased from inshore to offshore. Meanwhile, from clear mode to low, medium, and high concentration modes, the Chl-a gradually increased in coverage and concentration, and modes extracted by the SOM neural network have effectively elucidated the trend of Chl-a in spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was used to evaluate the effect of SST, wind, and wave on the changing patterns of Chl-a. It was found that there is a significant nonlinear correlation between Chl-a and SST, wind speed, mean wave direction and significant height of the wave. These influencing factors accounted for 47.9 of the change of Chl-a, which had significant effects on Chl-a change. Compared with wind speed, mean wave direction and significant height of wave, SST can better explain the change of Chl-a. Besides, wind direction and increased human activity (e.g., river discharge) played a significant role in changing the Chl-a distribution in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea.

TI  - Model Simulation and Prediction of Decadal Mountain Permafrost Distribution Based on Remote Sensing Data in the Qilian Mountains from the 1990s to the 2040s
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the results of remote sensing data interpretation, this paper aims to simulate and predict the mountain permafrost distribution changes affected by the mean decadal air temperature (MDAT), from the 1990s to the 2040s, in the Qilian Mountains. A bench-mark map is visually interpreted to acquire a mountain permafrost distribution from the 1990s, based on remote sensing images. Through comparison and estimation, a logistical regression model (LRM) is constructed using the bench-mark map, topographic and land coverage factors and MDAT data from the 1990s. MDAT data from the 2010s to the 2040s are predicted according to survey data from meteorological stations. Using the LRM, MDAT data and the factors, the probabilities (p) of decadal mountain permafrost distribution from the 1990s to the 2040s are simulated and predicted. According to the p value, the permafrost distribution statuses are classified as 'permafrost probable' (p > 0.7), 'permafrost possible' (0.7 >= p >= 0.3) and 'permafrost improbable' (p < 0.3). From the 1990s to the 2040s, the 'permafrost probable' type mainly degrades to that of 'permafrost possible', with the total area degenerating from 73.5 x 10(3) km(2) to 66.5 x 10(3) km(2). The 'permafrost possible' type mainly degrades to that of 'permafrost impossible', with a degradation area of 6.5 x 103 km(2), which accounts for 21.3% of the total area. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the simulation results can reach about 90%, which was determined by the validation of the simulation results for the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s based on remote sensing data interpretation results. This research provides a way of understanding the mountain permafrost distribution changes affected by the rising air temperature rising over a long time, and can be used in studies of other mountains with similar topographic and climatic conditions.

AB  - To solve the limitation of coarse spatial resolution of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) product, many spatial downscaling methods has been proposed under the theoretic basis of the land surface temperature (LST)/vegetation index triangle space. However, in most studies, the topographic influences on the downscaling results is rarely analyzed but the impacts should be significant due to the strong effect of topographic changes on LST. To effectively solve this issue, a downscaling approach was developed in this study to disaggregate the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) SSM product with the use of the Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite for a typical mountain region located in the west of U.S. Two steps are included in the approach: (1) normalizing the terrain effect on LST and (2) downscaling passive SSM product based on a machine learning approach. The SNOTEL soil moisture observation network located in the study area was used to validate the downscaled SSM.

AB  - The radar backscatter from the sea surface plays an important role in ocean observation. Many theoretical models have been developed to accurately estimate the scattering coefficient over the past few decades. A comparison between simulations of different scattering models with three roughness spectra and field measurements in Ku, C, and L bands and several empirical functions is obtained, demonstrating the behavior of normalized radar cross section (NRCS) for different incidence angles, wind speeds, azimuth angles, and frequencies. The verification of RADARSAT-2 measurements to these combinations suggests that NRCS values can be best reproduced in VV polarization by the CB model when the E spectrum is imported, and best in HH and VH polarizations by the SSA2 model with the H2 and E spectra, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.62, 1.57 and 2.10 dB, respectively.

AB  - Collaborative classification of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data is investigated using effective hierarchical random walk networks, denoted as HRWN. The proposed HRWN jointly optimizes dual tunnel CNN, pixelwise affinity and seeds map via a novel random walk layer, which enforces spatial consistency in the deepest layers of the network. In designed random walk layer, the predicted distribution of dual-tunnel CNN serves as global prior while pixelwise affinity reflects local similarity of pixel pairs, which preserves boundary localization and spatial consistency well. Experimental results validated with two real multisource remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed HRWN can significantly outperform other state-of-art methods.

TI  - A Nomogram Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis in T1 Breast Cancer based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Patients with early stage breast cancer with lymph nodes metastasis were proven to have more aggressive biologically phenotypes. This study aimed to build a nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis in patients with T1 breast cancer.Methods: We identified female patients with T1 breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. The patients were randomized into training and validation sets. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to assess the relationships between lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological characteristics. A nomogram was developed and validated by a calibration curve and receptor operating characteristic curve analysis.Result: Age, race, tumour size, tumour primary site, pathological grade, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status were independent predictive factors of positive lymph node metastasis in T1 breast cancer. Increasing age, tumour size and pathological grade were positively correlated with the risk of lymph node metastasis. We developed a nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis and further validated it in a validation set, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.733 and 0.741 in the training and validation sets, respectively.Conclusions: A better understanding of the clinicopathological characteristics of T1 breast cancer patients might important for assessing their lymph node status. The nomogram developed here, if further validated in other large cohorts, might provide additional information regarding lymph node metastasis. Together with sentinel lymph node biopsy, this nomogram can help comprehensively predict lymph node metastasis.

CP  - 8th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)

AB  - A critical nitrogen (N-c) concentration, defined as the minimum nitrogen (N) concentration required for maximum plant growth, could he used as an intermediate variable between remote sensing data and recommendation for N fertilizer. In this study, the critical N concentration dilution curve was established based on aboveground biomass (AGB) from data at jointing, hooting, anthesis and filling stages. The quantitative correlations between normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) were established. Finally, an N recommendation model combined with the N fertilizer effect function and NDVI was established and verified by field test data. Results showed that the N concentration of winter wheat decreased gradually during the reproductive growth period, and The plant N concentration could be described by N-c = 6.27*AGB(-0.54), with the R-2 value of 0.80. Moreover, the thresholds of NDVI were 0.87, 0.91, 0.91 and 0.81 at jointing, booting, anthesis and filling stages, respectively, and the amounts of recommending nitrogen fertilizer were 2.63, 10.00, 11.11 and 10.00 kg N/hm(2) when NNI value lowed 1% of corresponding period's thresholds. Field experiments illustrated that jointing and booting stage could be used as the N fertilizer periods to guarantee winter wheat yield, and integrating N-c curve and hyperspectral data had advantages in N fertilizer recommendations.

TI  - WILDFIRE-INDUCED FOREST COVER CHANGE IN THE BARGUZINSKY NATURE RESERVE
T2  - Russian Journal of Ecosystem Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Every summer, wildfires caused by human activity and extreme weather conditions are ravaging vast areas of Siberian boreal forests. Due to its links to ecosystem change and carbon balance, it is particularly important to research forest recovery after these events. This work attempts to integrate remotely sensed and fieldwork data in order to explore the variability of after-fire succession due to environmental factors and burn severity in the Barguzinsky reserve. Additionally, we assess the applicability of spectral indices as a means of the forest regrowth estimation. Three key areas impacted by numerous fires since 1961 were selected for surveying, and a broad Landsat 5-7 imagery analysis had been carried out prior to it. Change of summer values of NBR spectral index provided information about burn severity, while annual changes in summer and early spring (illustrative of evergreen conifers) NDVI - about the intensity and direction of after-fire forest cover change. The results show high heterogeneity in succession processes, which can be attributed to environmental conditions. Boggy plains are characterised by slow but successful recovery of the larch (deciduous) and Siberian pine (establishing late and growing slow) forest, which, however, is poorly noticeable on satellite imagery. Drier areas within the plains and hill-slopes show a different pattern: they are rapidly occupied by pioneer species such as birch and fireweed, which constitute a full 'recovery' of NDVI after as little as 5-7 years after the fire. Resulting mixed birch and Scots pine stands with Siberian pine saplings highlight a substantial difference between secondary and intact coniferous taiga. Mountain fire site has much slower rates of recovery, the mosaic of which is majorly influenced by relief and microclimate. Suggested by imagery analysis differences in after-fire death rates of different species have also been confirmed by field data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - High-resolution images with abundant detailed information are necessary elements for various applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In this paper, a novel super-resolution image reconstruction method based on self-normalizing generative adversarial network (SNGAN) is proposed. Compared with other published GAN-based super-resolution algorithms, the proposed method reflects its superiority in two aspects. First, the scaled exponential linear units (SeLU) is introduced as the activation function of generator to give the GAN system self-normalization ability and make it more suitable for SAR images. Second, the batch normalization layers after convolution are canceled to reduce the computational requirement and model oscillation. Experiment results on the images of TerraSAR and MSTAR dataset demonstrate that the proposed method acquires satisfactory performance on the resolution enhancement and target recognition of SAR images.

TI  - Earth Observations-Based Evapotranspiration in Northeastern Thailand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thailand is characterized by typical tropical monsoon climate, and is suffering serious water related problems, including seasonal drought and flooding. These issues are highly related to the hydrological processes, e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET), which are helpful to understand and cope with these problems. It is critical to study the spatiotemporal pattern of ET in Thailand to support the local water resource management. In the current study, daily ET was estimated over Thailand by ETMonitor, a process-based model, with mainly satellite earth observation datasets as input. One major advantage of the ETMonitor algorithm is that it introduces the impact of soil moisture on ET by assimilating the surface soil moisture from microwave remote sensing, and it reduces the dependence on land surface temperature, as the thermal remote sensing is highly sensitive to cloud, which limits the ability to achieve spatial and temporal continuity of daily ET. The ETMonitor algorithm was further improved in current study to take advantage of thermal remote sensing. In the improved scheme, the evaporation fraction was first obtained by land surface temperature-vegetation index triangle method, which was used to estimate ET in the clear days. The soil moisture stress index (SMSI) was defined to express the constrain of soil moisture on ET, and clear sky SMSI was retrieved according to the estimated clear sky ET. Clear sky SMSI was then interpolated to cloudy days to obtain the SMSI for all sky conditions. Finally, time-series ET at daily resolution was achieved using the interpolated spatio-temporal continuous SMSI. Good agreements were found between the estimated daily ET and flux tower observations with root mean square error ranging between 1.08 and 1.58 mm d(-1), which showed better accuracy than the ET product from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), especially for the forest sites. Chi and Mun river basins, located in Northeast Thailand, were selected to analyze the spatial pattern of ET. The results indicate that the ET had large fluctuation in seasonal variation, which is predominantly impacted by the monsoon climate.

TI  - The Potential of Multispectral Vegetation Indices Feature Space for Quantitatively Estimating the Photosynthetic, Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation and Bare Soil Fractions in Northern China
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) is widely distributed in the arid and semi-arid area, especially in the sandy areas. The hyperspectral-based cellulose absorption index (CAI) is an accepted method for estimating the cover fractions of NPV. However, the spaceborne hyperspectral data currently available to us are very limited. In this study, we tried to identify one or more combinations based on the multispectral vegetation indices feature space model to quantitatively estimate the PV, NPV and bare soil fractions of the Otindag Sandy Land in northern China. Three frequently-used green vegetation indices, NDVI, EVI and OSAVI, and nine multispectral-based indices sensitive to NPV were used to examine the spatial patterns based on the field measured endmember spectra and non-growing and growing season Landsat-8 OLI image reflectance spectra. The capabilities of these different combinations were tested in this study area using mosaicked Landsat-8 OLI imagery. The results show that the feature space of different combinations based on the field measured spectra and image reflectance spectra has good consistency. The separability of feature space determines the availability of this model. The normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI) and brightness index (BI) were found to have greater potential to combine with the three selected green vegetation indices for simultaneous estimation of the fractional cover of PV, NPV, and bare soil in the Otindag Sandy Land because of their clear and separable feature space. We obtained the best and medium-precision estimates for NDVI-NDSVI (f(PV): RMSE=0.26; f(NPV): RMSE=0.17) and OSAVI-BI (f(PV): RMSE=0.27; f(NPV): RMSE=0.25) for 104 field observations.

TI  - Impact of Land Use/Land Cover Changes on the Thermal Environment in Urbanization: A Case Study of the Natural Wetlands Distribution Area in Minjiang River Estuary, China
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Under accelerated urbanization and high-intensity human activities, the natural wetlands distribution area (NWDA) in Minjiang River estuary faces the great challenge of a deteriorative urban thermal environment. This work aims to analyze the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on the urban thermal environment and model wetland surface temperature disturbance characteristics during the process of urbanization. The study utilized the following methodological steps: (1) mapping of LULC spatial and temporal distribution through photo interpretation; (2) applying the mono-window algorithm to obtain the spatiotemporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST); (3) examining the correlation between LST and different LULC classes, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI); and (4) exploring wetland surface temperature characteristics based on profile analysis and regression models. The results showed that the LST pattern depended on the LULC distribution; the high LST zones were mainly observed in the center of Fuzhou city, and the low LST zones were mainly observed in forest and river areas. Moreover, the urban thermal environment was influenced by both LULC classes and urban growth types. Finally, the positive relationship between LST and NDISI indicated an amplifying effect of the impervious surface for wetland surface temperature, while vegetation with high liquid water attenuated the regional high temperature. The obtained conclusions are expected to be beneficial in improving the design and management of the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Effects of agriculture, climate, and policy on NDVI change in a semi-arid river basin of the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - In 1999, the Grain for Green Project was implemented by the Chinese government. Since then, the vegetation of Zuli River Basin, a semi-arid river basin of the Chinese Loess Plateau, has been greatly changed. Clearly understanding the impact of natural and artificial factors on vegetation change is important for policy making and ecosystem management. In this study, spatio-temporal variations in vegetation cover in Chinese Zuli River Basin during 1999-2016 were investigated using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Analyses of several indicators, including changes in NDVI in different slopes and land use changes and the relationships between climatic factors and NDVI change, were presented to quantitatively evaluate the effects of agriculture, climate, and policy on NDVI change. The NDVI in the Zuli River Basin increased during the study period, and the main contributors to this change were forest in 1999-2011, cropland, abandoned farmland, and grassland in 2009-2016, and land with slopes ≤ 15°. Land with slope 15°, where the Project was implemented, slightly contributed to the increase in regional NDVI. In 1999-2011, the project (98.16%) combined with climate change (68.18%) showed negative effects on the increase in NDVI in the Zuli River Basin, but agriculture (22.28%) played a positive role in increasing this index. In 2009-2016 and 1999-2016, the project (38.45% and 35.25%, respectively), the project combined with climate change (49.83% and 46.30%, respectively), agriculture (18.61% and 23.30%, respectively), promoted increases in NDVI in the basin.

AB  - This study focuses on the land surface ecosystem change in Ordos, Inner Mongolia from 1994 to 2015. Due to the typical climate, geographic location and abundant mineral resources, this region is an ecological vulnerable zone. Landsat images were collected to detect the change of vegetation coverage and waterbody distribution considering the global climate change and the anthropogenic drivers. During the process, the dimidiate pixel model and tasseled cap transformation technology were adopted. The result shows that the evolution characteristics of vegetation and waterbody have a similar trend, which is decreasing from 1994 to 2000 and continuous increasing from 2000 to 2015. We found that the changes of this study area in vegetation and waterbody are mainly dominated by precipitation under the influence of global climate change.

TI  - Analysis of Pre- and Post-Mine Closure Surface Deformations in Western Xuzhou Coalfield From 2006 to 2018
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic development and population expansion in mining cities have led to a growing scarcity of land for construction and thus the closed mines land reuse is extremely urgent. Exploration of the law of surface deformation in closed mine is therefore significance for the development of mining cities. In this study, we first used the StaMSBAS technique to reveal surface deformation of western Xuzhou coalfield from 16/6/2006 to 19/8/2018, based on 77 SAR images. The result of ALOS-1 monitoring was validated by levelling data, and it was shown that the root-mean-square-error and standard deviation were 31.8 mm and 28.9 mm, respectively. The law of surface deformation that occurred before and after mine closure was finally analysed. It was found that: 1) After mine closure, the surface deformation of Jiahe mine experienced the process of subsidence, relative stability and then uplift, and the surface deformations of Zhangxiaolou and Pangzhuang mines changed from slow subsidence to accelerated subsidence. 2) Where the maximum pre-closure subsidence occurred at Jiahe mine, the residual subsidence and uplift that occurred after mine closure was also significant, the correlation coefficients were 0.62 and 0.65, respectively. When the mines were active, surface subsidence of Jiahe and Zhangxiaolou mines was positively correlated with the strike mining degree, with correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.83, respectively. After Jiahe mine closure, the residual subsidence was positively correlated with the strike mining degree, and the surface uplift was positively correlated with the depth-to-thickness ratio, the correlation coefficients were both 0.70.

AB  - The growing number of remote sensing data create more opportunity for scientific studies in various disciplines, along with new challenges to data processing techniques. Most of existing solutions show limitations at either throughput or automation level. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for building and dynamically managing remote sensing data processing workflows in a distributed high-throughput environment. We use HTCondor system to allocate computing resource and schedule tasks while developing Python modules for processing operations and workflow management. The proposed framework not only illustrate a general way to process mass remote sensing data in a high-throughput manner but also demonstrates a novel solution to dynamically manage scientific workflows in the HTCondor system.

AB  - The approach of monitoring flood by using multi-source satellite data is presented in order to make full use of these data to obtain flood information. Taken the Songhua River flood in 2013 as an example, Fengyun-3 Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3/MWRI) data with 10-km spatial resolution was utilized to reveal soil wetness and flood patterns of whole basin with the water surface fraction (WSF) method due to the penetration of microwave data on clouds. The Fengyun-3 Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (FY-3/MERSI) and Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS/MODIS) data with 250m spatial resolution were put forward to reflect the flood information in the area of main stream. The details of the flooded area were further analyzed based on the Radarsat and Landsat/TM with high resolution. The method shows promising results. The comparison result among WSF maps, and flood map from MERSI and MODIS images show a high consistency. Comprehensive and effective utilization of multi-source satellite data could provide reliable flood information for early flood warning, real-time monitoring of flood development, and rapid and accurate assessment of flood losses.

AB  - The method of flood monitoring based on Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer data is put forward. The SMAP LIC enhanced brightness temperature product with 9 km spatial resolution is higher than others passive microwave data, such as AMSR-E, ATMS and SSM/I. In order to study the SMAP's potential ability, the case of flood induced by Hurricane Harvey occurred in 2017 in United State was selected to apply the SMAP data to monitor the inundated water. The result showed that the flood area can be reflected based on SWAP data, and H polarization data is more sensitive to the V polarization data. The mixed pixel separation method is applied to estimate the water fraction and provide more detailed sub-pixel scale water information. The SMAP LIC enhanced brightness temperature product with 9 km spatial resolution can provide more detailed flood information than previous passive microwave data. By compare the result with Fengyun-3 Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3/MWRI) data and NASA's Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS/MODIS) data, there are better accordance with the SMAP data, which prove the effect of SMAP data for flood monitoring.

CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The expansion of urban areas is always accompanied by land use/land cover (LULC) changes and associated with the distribution of urban heat islands (UHI) simultaneously. In particular, in the metropolis such as Shanghai, the land cover transitions between the impervious surface (IS) and vegetation areas highly influence the ecological quality. This study focused on the monitoring and analysis on the LULC and land surface temperature (LST) spatio-temporal changes in Shanghai during the period between 2009 and 2019. We evaluated LULC and LST changes based on the multitemporal Landsat images acquired over five individual years (i.e., 2009, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2019). In particular, the Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS) spectral unmixing and several derived spectral indices are used for generating the LULC maps, and Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) temperature inversion method is utilized for estimating the LST. In order to compare the dominance of different land classes, then we analyzed the classification maps from different landscape levels. Experimental results demonstrate that during the past ten years the IS of Shanghai continually expanded from the city center mainly towards the Pudong, Songjiang and Jiading three districts directions. Vegetation especially the cropland in the urban fringe areas were replaced by the newly appeared IS, which lead to the rising temperature in the corresponding areas. This may further accelerate the urban heat island phenomenon.

AB  - Regional synergy is seen as an advanced form of coordinating the social economy and maintaining competitiveness in today's global competition system. Since China's reform and development, under the background of rapid urbanization and regional coordinated development, cities with geographical proximity and close economic and social ties have gradually formed a new mode of urban development, which is called integrated city. As a new phenomenon in the process of China's urbanization, the existing research mainly focuses on the typical case studies, and the research methods are mostly limited to literature review and theoretical analysis. Therefore, in this paper, the Guangfo city (the most representative case in China, resulting from the integration of Guangzhou and Foshan cities) was selected as research objective. Specifically, the work analyses the transitional zone of the integrated city, based on multi-spectral Landsat 8 and nighttime light NPP/VHRS images, focusing on landuse conversion, block light fluctuation and light gravity center migration. In the analyzed period (2013-2017), results highlight significant spatial heterogeneity in the integration level of Guangfo city's development. Moreover, the combined analysis of nighttime light and urban expansion in the boundary zone shows that the enhancement effect of construction land expansion on nighttime light is increasing with the development of integration, and the inhibition effect of vegetation cover on nighttime light intensity is weakening. The proposed approach applied to integrated city research and achieved results can potentially support decision-making and planning in the process of urban development.

AB  - With several decadal accumulations of remotely sensed data and products and advances in satellite based vegetative drought detection methods, the global and regional characteristics of drought are expected be discovered from those long-term historical inventory data. In this study, we investigate the trend and variability of global vegetative drought using 1981-2017 NOVAA/AVHRR weekly VHI products. We proposed a methodological framework to perform trend and variability analysis from overall trend test to trend location detection to trend magnitude estimate. Accounting for the effect of the global geographical heterogeneity on trend analysis, we aggregated the VHI dataset on designated zones in view of latitude ranges and climate zones. We found that: (1) although the overall trends are not obvious for some cases, the local trends are significant in some specific periods, and (2) the trends of vegetative drought in the north hemisphere is better than that in the south hemisphere.

TI  - Evolution of the Pattern of Spatial Expansion of Urban Land Use in the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To grasp the evolutionary characteristics and regularity of urban land expansion patterns in the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone, this study, based on nighttime lighting data, uses the Landsat series satellite simultaneous data and cluster analysis to correct the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime lighting data and then uses the auxiliary data-based comparison method to determine the threshold for extracting the urban built-up area. Based on this threshold, a total of eight typical landscape pattern indicators, including landscape total area, total patches number, patches density, maximum patches index, and agglomeration index, etc., are selected. Next, the landscape spatial pattern analysis method and standard deviation ellipse method are used. The results show the following: (1) In 1992-2013, urbanization in the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone expanded rapidly. The urban built-up area increased by 8.13 times, the number of plaques increased by 1.5 times, and the shape complexity of landscape plaques gradually increased. There is a large correlation between the changes in the total boundary length, and the average boundary density, the average annual growth rate of the two is 21.33% and 17.45%. (2) The two indicators of maximum plaque index and aggregation index show a downward trend year by year. However, there are some fluctuations and irregularities in the evolution of the total landscape area, total plaque number and plaque density. (3) The long axis and the short axis of the standard deviation ellipse of the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone show small variation during the inspection period and generally have an elliptical shape. The movement of the center of gravity is mainly from the southwest to the northeast, but the migration of the center of gravity is relatively small. Based on this, this paper proposes three countermeasures and suggestions as a guide to promote the optimization and development of the spatial expansion pattern of the Poyang Lake eco-economic zone.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-quality pansharpened image with both high spatial resolution and high spectral fidelity is highly desirable in various applications. However, existing pansharpening methods may lead to spatial distortion and spectral distortion. To measure the degrees of distortion caused by the pansharpening methods, we conduct in-deep studies on the subjective and objective quality assessment of pansharpened images. We built a subjective database consisting of 360 images generated from 20 couples of panchromatic (PAN)/multispectral (MS) images using 18 pansharpening methods. Based on the database, we proposed a no-reference quality assessment method to blindly predict the quality of pansharpened images via opinion-unaware learning. The proposed method first extracted features from the MS images' spectral bands and typical information indexes which comprehensively reflect spatial distortion, spectral distortion, and the effects of pansharpening on applications. Based on the features extracted from the pristine MS image training dataset, a benchmark multivariate Gaussian (MVG) model is learned. The distance between the benchmark MVG and the MVG fitted on the test image is calculated to measure the quality. The experimental results show the superiority of our method on our database.

AB  - The cirrus band (Band-9) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) can well detect cirrus clouds, which should be the desired supplement to the existing thin cloud removal algorithms Thus, the cirrus band has been incorporated into an available RTM-based algorithm to remove thin clouds in the visible bands of Landsat-8 data. The reason to add Band-9 to the RTM-based algorithm was to suppress the ground information contained in the modeled thin-cloud reflectance data of the visible bands. The new algorithm was effective and valid in the thin-cloud removal as shown in this study. The algorithm outperformed the original RTM-based algorithm as well.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing of Surface Urban Heat Islands: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the coverage and capacity analysis for LEO satellite network supporting Internet of Things. We propose a metric of coverage degree to measure average cover level during a return circle of a satellite constellation in different latitudes, and furter consider the spot beam communication process with TDMA as a discrete time queueing process to caculate the number of devices in a unit area, which can be accessed during a period. Finally, we derive the relationship among device density, maximum tolerant delay, and coverage degree of the satellite constellation. The obtained theoretical results are verified by extensive simulation experiments.

TI  - COMPARISON OF THE WINTER PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS OVER THE TIBETAN PLATEAU

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - The multi-model results from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) showed obvious wet biases over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during winter. However, sparse meteorological stations and the limited capacity for getting accurate snowfall may introduce dry biases into the observation and then exaggerate the overestimation of winter precipitation. In order to explore the spatiotemporal variations and reliability of winter precipitation over the TP, we compared five precipitation products, including: ERA-Interim, GLDAS, HAR, TRMM, and the observation provided by China Meteorological Administration (CMA), against a sublimation dataset which is severed as the minimum value of precipitation. The sublimation was estimated by the Kuzmin formula constrained with IMS snow cover product and land surface temperature. The intercomparison reveals that CMA has an obvious underestimation (precipitation is less than the one third of sublimation) over the Qiangtang Plateau where there is no observation site while no underestimation in East TP where dense stations available. For reanalysis and remote sensing data, HAR shows the smallest underestimation, while TRMM and GLDAS shows comparable underestimation and both are more apparent than ERA-interim. It implies that the observation data has considerable dry biases (similar to 200%) in winter precipitation over the Western TP where more ground stations are needed to get a reliable precipitation observation.

TI  - Progress and perspective on interactions between ocean and typhoon
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Review
AB  - Typhoon is one of the most destructive natural disasters on the earth. A lot of fruitful research has been conducted, especially from the perspective of atmospheric sciences. During a typhoon, the ocean also undergoes dramatic variabilities, which can have significant feedbacks to the atmosphere and typhoon. Generally, the sea surface temperatures (SST) decrease and inertial oscillations are greatly enhanced. The fingerprints of typhoon on the ocean are not constrained to the local sea surface, but can be extended to the ocean interior and remote areas, which play an important role in the climate change on a much longer and larger spatiotemporal scales. In addition, the mesoscale eddy accounts for a large amount of kinetic energy in the ocean. Much progress has been achieved on the responses and feedbacks of ocean eddy to typhoon, but it remains a large uncertainty for the ocean-typhoon interaction. Particularly, the three-dimensional structure of ocean eddy during typhoon is unclear due to the lack of observations. Overall, so far, there have been no comprehensive understandings of the ocean-typhoon interactions, which are believed to be a bottleneck for improving the typhoon prediction. Therefore, the mechanisms of ocean-typhoon interactions at various spatiotemporal scales, as well as their contributions to the short-term and long-term typhoon forecast, have become a hot and challenging topic for both the oceanic and the atmospheric sciences.In this paper, recent progress in the ocean-typhoon interactions is reviewed, based on several collaborative projects in China. The foci are on the local responses and feedbacks between mesoscale variabilities in the upper ocean and typhoon, the ocean-typhoon interactions at low frequency and the impacts on global climate, data assimilation during typhoon, and typhoon forecast in the ocean-atmosphere coupled framework. The major challenge to the ocean-typhoon interactions resides in the lack of persistent and reliable observations, especially the synchronized observations in both the ocean and the atmosphere. Some valuable experiments have been conducted recently and are summarized in this study. For example, mooring/buoy arrays are carefully designed and deployed in the northern South China Sea consecutively from 2014 up to now. The monitoring for a long period accumulates very useful in-situ data for the study on the ocean-typhoon interactions. In addition, several novel technics are also proposed and tested recently, such as the one using rocket-deployed dropsondes to obtain vertical profiles in the atmosphere within a typhoon, and the Iridium Argo the sampling frequency of which can be remotely and manually increased when a typhoon is coming. On the mechanisms of ocean-typhoon interaction, a hypothesis of "cold suction" in the ocean is proposed and examined, which is another avenue for the typhoon's impacts on the subsurface in the ocean, except for the traditional concept of "heat pump". Evidence for "cold suction" is found in in-situ observations. The new concept makes the theory for ocean-typhoon interactions more comprehensive. For the practical application, the improvement of typhoon prediction is the golden goal. A lot of efforts have been put into the data assimilation, which synthesizes data from different resources, such as the remote sensing data of the sea surface properties and the Argo data for the ocean interior. Improved data assimilation methods are proposed to facilitate the extreme conditions during typhoon. Until now, most operational typhoon forecast still rely on the atmosphere-only model. Nevertheless, the atmosphere-ocean-wave coupled systems have been established and evaluated. Some improvement has been shown for the operational typhoon forecast.Finally, some key scientific problems and technical challenges are raised in this paper, which are expected to shed light on the future studies on the ocean-typhoon interaction.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - The design of a parabolic polarization selective reflectarray for dual-band dual-circular polarization for multiple beam applications in Ka-band is presented. The reflectarray has a diameter of 0.65m and is a single-layer design consisting of rotated split hexagonal-loop dipole elements. For RHCP, the reflectarray scans the reflected beam half a beamwidth in one direction, and for LHCP, the reflectarray scans the reflected beam half a beamwidth in the opposite direction. This is achieved in both Tx (19 GHz) and Rx (29 GHz). Using a feedarray of 27 feeds, 54 beams can be generated. With this concept, a full multiple beam coverage employing the 4-color frequency/polarization reuse scheme can be covered using only two reflectarrays while maintaining the single-feed-per-beam operation.

AB  - In this paper, a security patrol method using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) [1] as a carrier was proposed to solve the problems caused by traditional patrol methods such as low patrol frequency, low patrol efficiency and high security patrol cost. The ZigBee[2] module (the chip using CC2530 of ti) was adopted to locate the UAV. Also, the Kalman filter algorithm was used to reduce the influence of noise on the airborne patrol system to improve the positioning accuracy. This system was equipped with a ground station. and users could select nodes at the ground station for planned flight. The data exchanged between the ground station and the UAV through the XBee S3B module[3]. The UAV transmitted the images captured by the camera to the ground station in real time through the Athreros AR9271 WIFI launcher for security personnel to check in time. The ground station also handled the situation on the spot. As the UAV reached the area with poor GPS signal, we used ZigBee networking to locate and enhance the accuracy of positioning. Security patrols with UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) as carriers improved traditional patrol methods to some extent. After a certain amount of data analysis, the results show that the ZigBee positioning data processed by Kalman filter are reliable.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON RESPONSES OF VEGETATION PRODUCTIVITY RELATIVE TO DIFFERENT DROUGHT MONITOR PATTERNS IN KARST REGIONS OF SOUTHWESTERN CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate conditions are complex and diverse in Southwest China (SWC), especially the karst area, and the interaction between climate change and terrestrial ecosystems has become complex. Vegetation productivity is an important indicator in terrestrial ecosystems, and can visually reveal the impacts of extreme climate. Drought affects not only the process of photosynthesis directly, but also the changes in vegetation productivity from other forms of interference with photosynthesis. Against this background, we analyzed the time series and spatial distribution characteristics of drought, the temporal and spatial distribution and anomalies of vegetation productivity. For the observation period 2001-2012, we used different drought monitor patterns (including Pa, SPI, SPEI and PDSI) to assess the impact of drought on vegetation productivity (annual NPP and monthly GPP). We mainly want to explore the response of different monitor patterns to vegetation productivity at different stages. NPP exhibited considerable variation during 2001-2012; the droughts in 2009 and 2010 led to NPP reduction by 14.7% and 8.4%, respectively. The NPP is directly proportional to the severity of drought, severe drought had a greater impact on monthly GPP than mild drought, especially for evergreen forests, shrublands, and deciduous forests, while little variation was found for croplands. We compared drought indices-vegetation productivity during the drought season between 2009 and 2010; SPEI has a better correlation with SPI and PDSI. The results demonstrate that SPEI and PDSI are most capable of monitoring the vegetation drought conditions. There will be large differences of the influence on vegetation productivity on different drought levels. Our findings suggested that multi-indices in drought monitoring are needed in order to acquire robust conclusions.

AB  - Tianjin city, China has seen rapid urban expansion and economy development especially since the Chinese reform and opening up in 1978. Understanding their internal relationship is important for urban management. Considering of the long-history records with medium spatial resolution (30 meters), Landsat time series (LTS) has become a key remote sensing dataset for monitoring urban changes. As the impervious surface is an important indicator for assessing urban environment, in this study, we extracted the impervious surface maps in Tianjin between 1990 and 2017 based on LTS using a Continue Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. On the other hand, we quantitatively explored the relationships between the impervious surface and Gross National Product (GDP). Results show that the impervious surface expansion in Tianjin experienced two stages between 1990 and 2017 with the area increased by 521.95 km(2), and the correlation coefficient between the area of impervious surface and GDP value was as high as 0.9718.

TI  - Predictors of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer with metastasis in the sentinel node
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To predict the factors related to axillary nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis in patients with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) of early breast cancer.The retrospective data are collected from the patients with positive SLN who received further completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in Peking Union Medical Hospital between March 2016 and December 2017. Univariate analysis was conducted on data with various clinicopathologic factors at first. Those factors with statistic significance (P < .05) in univariate analysis were then used to implement multivariate analysis and logistic regression.There were total of 734 patients who received SLN biopsy, among whom 153 cases were included in our study. About 39.22% (60/153) of 153 paitents with positive SLN had no NSLN metastasisted to SLN. Univariate analysis showed that 3 variables were significantly correlated with NSLN involvement: tumor size (X-2 = 10.384, P = .001), SLN metastasis ratio (number of positive SLNs/number of SLNs removed x 100%) (X-2 = 10.365, P = .001) and the number of negative sentinel nodes (X-2 = 10.384, P = .006). In multivariate analysis and logistic regression, tumor size (odds ratio [OR] = 3.392, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.409-8.166, P = .006) and SLN metastasis ratio (OR = 3.514, 95% CI: 1.416-8.72, P = .007) were the independent risk factors. While the number of negative sentinel nodes (OR = 0.211, 95% CI: 0.063-0.709, P =.014) was the independent protective factor. The calculated risk resulted in an area under the curve of 0.746 (95% CI: 0.644-0.848), suggesting stable discriminative capability in Chinese population.For those patients with positive SLN, larger tumor burden and SLN metastasis ratio are independent risk factors for NSLN metastasis. However, the more of the detected negative SLN, the less possibility with NSLN involvement.

AB  - The dielectric constant of seawater at L-band is determined by a resonant cavity technique. Based on the measurement data, an accurate dielectric model function has been developed and employed to retrieve the ocean surface salinity from the satellite data. The retrieved salinities indicate that the accuracy of the dielectric model needs to be improved to resolve the bias correlated with sea surface temperature. This paper reports the new measurements that have been recently made for the development of a more accurate model function. These new measurements are made using 20, 34 and 36 psu seawater samples from 10 degrees-30 degrees C with a 5 degrees C interval. An improved model function is developed based on the new measurements and on the previous measurements. The salinity retrieval results using the new model function will be presented at the meeting.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chemotherapy is the predominant treatment option for patients with breast cancer. Selection of patients according to biomarker will improve chemotherapy efficacy. In the present study, we examined the relations of the expression of candidate genes and 21-recurrence score (RS) results to patients' demographic characteristics, histopathological factors, and outcomes.Methods: A total of 146 patients were enrolled in this study. The patients underwent 21-gene RS testing. In addition, expressions of candidate genes, TYMS, RRM1, TUBB3, TOP2A, PTEN, were detected. Information was obtained on age, tumor size, TMN stage, tumor grade, and status of IG-67, HER2, ER and PR. The treatment information on the type of endocrine therapy was also obtained.Results: Results clearly showed that the 21-gene RS significantly correlated with the TNM stage of breast cancer (P = 0.047). The RS also correlated with the number of sentinel lymph node (P = 0.038). The pathological type of tumors was strongly associated with the expression of RRM1 (P < 0.015), and slightly correlated with TYMS (P = 0.095) and tumor size (P = 0.061). Further analysis showed that TYMS and RRM1 were two independent factors affecting the disease progression of patients. Besides, for HER-2 stain, staining of grade 2 or above significantly increased the risk of disease progression.Conclusion: Our studies showed that TNM stage and sentinel lymph node were important clinical parameters correlated with 21-gene RS results. Also, RRM1, TYMS and HER2 expressions were independent factors associated with disease progression in breast cancer patients. Future study is warranted to investigate the usefulness of these genes in treatment efficacy.

AB  - The surface deformation of the eastern section of the third-ring bypass as well as its surrounding areas, Chengdu, China was studied. The Permanent Scatterer (PS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1 multi-temporal datasets acquired along the ascending and descending orbits were used. With sixty-two ascending orbit datasets (from July of 2015 to May of 2018) and sixty-nine descending orbit datasets (between October of 2014 and May of 2018), the subsidence occurred in the study area mainly. The overall spatial patterns of the deformation derived from the ascending and descending SAR observations were similar. Five locations with significant subsidence were identified and analyzed. The causes for the subsidence were attributed to the construction and the operation of the subway system and highway overpasses, and the local commercial activities.

TI  - Study of Multiple Land Use Planning Based on the Coordinated Development of Wetland Farmland: A Case Study of Fuyuan City, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuyuan City is located in the black soil region of northeast China. Its fertile soil and flat terrain provide a reliable guarantee for the scale, intensification, and standardization of farmland. A large amount of land resources that can be used for the national food base has been developed, and the contradiction between the need for wetland protection and arable land development has become increasingly prominent. Based on the remote sensing data of 2000, 2005, and 2010, this paper simulates the future land use/land cover changes structure in Fuyuan City based on the Markov Chain model. According to the characteristics of Fuyuan City's structure, economy, society, and natural environment, within the overall planning of the city, we explore three scenarios: business-as-usual scenarios, farmland conservation scenarios, and wetland conservation scenarios. The results revealed the following: (1) Under the business-as-usual scenario, the rapid development of Fuyuan City showed the characteristics of the continued expansion of urban area and the reduction of farmland and wetland area in 2020 compared with 2010. (2) Under farmland conservation scenarios, farmland was well protected and stable, while construction land expansion was restricted. (3) Under wetland conservation scenarios, wetland increased dramatically, which mainly derived from farmland, grassland, and unused land. According to the result, optimized countermeasures are proposed to balance the coordinated development of farmland and wetlands, to deepen the multiperiod planning of land use in Fuyuan City and to provide data support and a basis for decision-making.

TI  - Mapping fractional cropland covers in Brazil through integrating LSMA and SDI techniques applied to MODIS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS time-series imagery is promising for generating regional and global land cover products. For Brazil, however, accurate fractional cropland covers (FCC) information is difficult to obtain due to frequent cloud coverage and the mixing-pixel problem. To address these problems, this study developed an innovative approach to mapping the FCC of the Mato Grosso State, Brazil through integrating Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA) and Seasonal Dynamic Index (SDI) models. With MOD13Q1 time-series EVI imagery, a SDI was developed to represent the phenology of croplands. Furthermore, fractional land covers (e.g., vegetation, soil, and low albedo components) were derived with the LSMA algorithms. A stepwise regression model was established to estimate the FCC at the regional scale. Finally, ground truth cropland cover information was extracted from Landsat TM imagery using a hybrid method. Results indicated that the combination of multiple feature variables produced better results when compared with individual variables. Through cross-validation and comparative analysis, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the reference and estimated FCCs reached 0.84 with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.13. This indicates that the proposed method effectively improved the accuracy of fractional cropland mapping. When compared to the traditional per-pixe l "hard" class ification, the sub-pixel level maps illustrated detailed cropland spatial distribution patterns.

AB  - Sea fog can have both negative and positive impacts on humans life. At present, remote sensing has become the main means of long-term and large-scale observation of sea fog. With the improvement of spectral resolution and increase of data volume, the traditional threshold method is simple and convenient as the main method of current sea fog detection, but it's not flexible and accurate enough which causes people need a more automated and intelligent algorithm to achieve efficient sea fog detection. In this article, we use the U-Net deep learning model to construct the sea fog detection model for MODIS multi-spectral images. The main steps include: (1) Data preprocessing, including the PCA method for dimensionality reduction of data; (2) Manual samples extraction with CALIPSO data assist; (3) Construction and training of U-Net sea fog detection model. The experimental results show that the U-Net model can effectively and machine learning method has good potential in sea fog detection.

AB  - Soil moisture content is a key parameter in water resources management. It is important to obtain reliable soil moisture content data that being consistent in space and time for water resources management. Land surface process model and data assimilation are effective means to obtain reliable spatial and temporal continuous soil moisture content. However, the lack of real observations and dynamically updated surface parameters often greatly affect the accuracy of stimulated results of the land surface model. Based on high-resolution remote sensing data, we continuously invert vegetation coverage which is the crucial parameter of land surface process model during the study period, dynamically update it, and consider the remote sensing inversion of soil moisture content as the observation input, combined with the data assimilation algorithm to carry out model simulation and data assimilation research. We choose China's Hetao Irrigation District as the research area, use Noah LSM model and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm to build the data assimilation system, and set the land use parcels of the irrigation district as the research unit. Based on the Chinese Gaofen-1 and environmental disaster reduction satellites' remote sensing data, we retrieve the vegetation coverage fraction every ten days, and generate monthly vegetation coverage fraction data to update the Noah LSM model parameter. Meanwhile, we use the TVDI algorithm to invert the soil moisture content as the observation data in assimilation system and the simulation of the Noah LSM model. Model simulation and data assimilation experiments show that the remote sensing retrieval vegetation coverage fraction can improve the effectiveness of model simulation, which approaches to the true value, and also improves the data assimilation accuracy. The overall performance is better than that using the fixed state parameter.

AB  - For achieving the snow mapping of AVHRR/2 (i.e. the second version of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data, clouds need to be eliminated in AVHRR/2 images. However, the clouds are difficult to be identified from the AVHRR/2 image with clouds and snow together. Here, clouds were divided into high clouds, medium clouds, low clouds, and thin clouds. Based on the respective thresholds from experiments using AVHRR/2 data of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the four kinds of clouds were identified and eliminated from the AVHRR/2 images. According to visual validation, the results of cloud elimination were reliable and accurate.

AB  - Terrain geometry and radiation characteristics of radar images have strong influence. The correction of these effects becomes indispensable when quantitative image analysis is performed with respect to the derivation of geo- and biophysical parameters. Based on RD geo-location model and digital elevation model, an ortho-rectification and TRC implementation flow was introduced. The correctness and effectiveness of the method were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated through several experimentations. By comparing two kinds of effective TRC methods, we found the project-angle based method is more effective than the local incidence-angle based method. The rationality of computing effective TRC factor using initial SAR geo-location model was also demonstrated.

AB  - Boundary and area information could be used to study various interesting relations of multiple disasters such as "magnitude-area" relation for earthquakes. In this paper, a new method using InSAR-derived interferograms to determine the boundary of the crustal deformation area is introduced. Although InSAR has been widely used in crustal deformation monitoring, little is known about boundary detection using interferograms. The proposed method conducted Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) correction to the interferograms based on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model offered by Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS). Moreover, this study proposed a suggestion to identify points in the interferograms at which the deformation changes smoothly that could be determined as the far-field boundary. Here we used a pair of Sentinel-1A images to investigate the deformation boundary associated with the 2017 Iran Sangsefid earthquake as an example. It was experimentally shown that the proposed method provided an inspiring scheme for boundary detection based on InSAR interferograms.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HAB) is one of the most serious marine disasters, which not only reduce fishery production, deteriorates the marine environment, affects coastal tourist industry, but also cause human poison. The satellite remote sensing technology has the characteristics of large-scale, synchronized, low cost and rapid monitoring, it is become an important method for HAB observation. In this paper, we describe the HAB monitoring system based on remote sensing data which developed by the Second Institute of Oceanography, China. The system can achieve the whole procedure automatically from the satellite remote data acquirement and satellite image process, products generation, and it can automatically identify the HAB region using the spectral reflectance and inherent optical properties derived from remote sensing data. Currently, the National monitoring department has adopted this system for the operational monitoring of HAB in the East China Sea.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports the phenological response of forest vegetation to climate change (changes in temperature and precipitation) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series images from 2000 to 2015. The phenological parameters of forest vegetation in the Funiu Mountains during this period were determined from the temperature and precipitation data using the Savitzky-Golay filter method, dynamic threshold method, Mann-Kendall trend test, the Theil-Sen estimator, ANUSPLIN interpolation and correlation analyses. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The start of the growing season (SOS) of the forest vegetation mainly concentrated in day of year (DOY) 105-120, the end of the growing season (EOS) concentrated in DOY 285-315, and the growing season length (GSL) ranged between 165 and 195 days. There is an evident correlation between forest phenology and altitude. With increasing altitude, the SOS, EOS and GSL presented a significant delayed, advanced and shortening trend, respectively. (2) Both SOS and EOS of the forest vegetation displayed the delayed trend, the delayed pixels accounted for 76.57% and 83.81% of the total, respectively. The GSL of the forest vegetation was lengthened, and the lengthened pixels accounted for 61.21% of the total. The change in GSL was mainly caused by the decrease in spring temperature in the region. (3) The SOS of the forest vegetation was significantly partially correlated with the monthly average temperature in March, with most correlations being negative; that is, the delay in SOS was mainly attributed to the temperature decrease in March. The EOS was significantly partially correlated with precipitation in September, with most correlations being positive; that is, the EOS was clearly delayed with increasing precipitation in September. The GSL of the forest vegetation was influenced by both temperature and precipitation throughout the growing season. For most regions, GSL was most closely related to the monthly average temperature and precipitation in August.

AB  - Due to the very fragmentation of cultivated land in Guangdong Province, there are few studies on the cultivated land multiple cropping index (MCI), which can not meet the needs of agricultural production and policy. Therefore, this paper selects the 2015 paddy field data of Guangdong Province and uses the 16-day synthetic MODIS-EVI data from 2014 to 2016, Savitzky-Golay and Asymmetric Gaussian methods are used to reconstruct multi-temporal remote sensing data, and quadratic difference algorithm is used to extract the paddy field MCF. A comparative analysis of the two methods shows that the Asymmetric Gaussian function fitting is more suitable for a single season. The Savitzky-Golay filtering is more sensitive, and there are many pseudo-peaks in the fitted curve, resulting in a large extraction result compared with verification data. The twice Savitzky-Golay filtering further smooths the curve and removes a large number of false peaks, which is more suitable for the vegetation characteristics of paddy fields in Guangdong Province; The paddy field planting area is highly correlated with the rice planting area, but there are rice-peanut, rice-sweet potato and rice-sweet sugarcane planting patterns in the paddy field. In addition, the classification accuracy of paddy fields is one of the main influencing factors, so it is difficult to extract rice planting area accurately; During 2014-2016, the paddy field in Guangdong Province is dominated by double cropping system. The area of single cropping system is increased and then decreased, and the area of the double cropping system is reduced and then increased. The fallow paddy fields are mainly distributed around the construction land, especially in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

AB  - Sentinel-2 data has become an important tool for current and future earth observation due to its high quality, free availability and world-wide coverage. However, some of the spectral bands are sensed at reduced resolution due to design considerations and sensor hardware limitations. So in this paper we present a super-resolution method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer all the 20m spectral bands in the highest available resolution. This is accomplished by using an improved residual network and meanwhile we propose a channel attention mechanism to adaptively rescale the characteristics of the channels by considering the interdependencies among the channels. The proposed solution compares against several alternative methods according to different quality indexes. Our network provides the best results and a compelling visual effect on the sentinel-2 images.

AB  - Siziwang banner desert steppe is a typical arid inland region, which is also one of the most ecologically vulnerable regions in the Inner Mongolia plateau. In this article, the Siziwang banner is taken as a typical case, for studying the spatiotemporal dynamic of NPP in desert steppe based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model from 2003 to 2017, and analyzing the response of grassland NPP to the change of key climate factor, including temperature and precipitation. The results indicate that, 1) in terms of time, the grassland NPP in Siziwang banner desert steppe decreases first and then rises, while in terms of space, it decreases from south to north. 2) the NPP is more sensitive to precipitation with average partial correlation coefficient of 64.74%, which is higher than that of temperature. 3) the average of lagged time for NPP responding to temperature is 1.78 months and the average of lagged time for NPP responding to precipitation is 3.17 months. Precipitation at the early stage of vegetation growing season is particularly important for the growth of grassland vegetation in desert steppe.

AB  - The snow cover in the spring melting period is of great significance for hydrological and meteorological forecasting. Regional snowcover area (SCA) is the basic parameters of hydrological model. In recent years, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used in wet snow detection and SCA estimation during the spring melting period for its effectiveness. The absorption of electromagnetic waves by wet snow significantly reduces the SAR backscatter signal, which makes it possible to distinguish between wet snow and dry snow (or no snow). However, in forest areas, the sensitivity of traditional algorithms to detect snow changes is decreased due to the significant change of forest canopy transmittance with time and weather conditions. Based on the measured data of the forest area in northeastern China and the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data, the influence of forest canopy on the C-band backscattering coefficient of SCA is analyzed, and an adaptive SCA estimation algorithm based on the forest backscatter model is introduced in this paper. The backscattering coefficient attenuation caused by the forest canopy can be predicted by the algorithm and the SCA estimation for the corresponding region will be corrected. The results show that the snow cover characteristic is accurately estimated and the SCA of forests in northeastern China is significantly smaller than that of the open area, while the SCA of coniferous forest areas is generally smaller than broadleaf forests areas in the early stage of snowmelt period.

AB  - Active microwave remote sensing is one of the important methods to monitor snow cover and retrieve snow parameters such as snow water equivalent (SWE), snow particle size and snow density. SWE provides useful information for hydrological, climatic and meteorological applications. Retrieving SWE from active microwave remote sensing data has attracted widespread attention in the academic community. This paper took Nongan County, Jilin Province, China as the study area, and selected two scenes of Sentinel-1 interference wide-mode (IW) SAR images to retrieve the SWE in the shallow dry snow area in winter. A mathematical expression that defines the relationship between the backscattering coefficient ratio and the thermal resistance calculated from the measured snow data was established. By using the relationship between the measured thermal resistance and the measured SWE, the value of SWE in the study area can be retrieved by the backscattering coefficient ratio. The result shows that the method used in this paper has high precision (MAE=0.198cm, RMSE=0.24cm). It is feasible to use the C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data to retrieve SWE.

TI  - An Improved Jitter Detection Method Based on Parallax Observation of Multispectral Sensors for Gaofen-1 02/03/04 Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites, the first civilian high resolution optical operational constellation in China, have Earth observation capabilities with panchromatic/multispectral imaging at 2/8 m resolution. Satellite jitter, the fluctuation of satellite points, has a negative influence on the geometric quality of high-resolution optical satellite imagery. This paper presents an improved jitter detection method based on parallax observation of multispectral sensors for Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites, which can eliminate the effect of the relative internal error induced by lens distortion, and accurately estimate the parameters of satellite jitter. The relative internal error is estimated by polynomial modelling and removed from the original parallax image generated by pixel-to-pixel image matching between two bands of images. The accurate relative time-varying error and absolute distortion caused by satellite jitter could be estimated by using the sine function. Three datasets of multispectral images captured by Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites were used to conduct the experiments. The results show that the relative system errors in both the across- and along-track directions can be modelled with a quadratic polynomial, and satellite jitter with a frequency of 1.1-1.2 Hz in the across-track direction was detected for the first time. The amplitude of the jitter differed in the three datasets. The largest amplitude, from satellite 04, is 1.3 pixels. The smallest amplitude, from satellite 02, is 0.077 pixels. The reliability and accuracy of the detection results were verified by using two groups of band combinations and ortho-images with a 1 m resolution. The comparison results show that the detection accuracy is improved by approximately 30% using the proposed method.

AB  - The article provides information about the level of species diversity, biological and ecological composition, the dynamic of the vegetation productivity of a green planting in the city of Abakan (the steppe zone). The inventory of the flora revealed 288 species of higher vascular plants from 59 families and 183 genera. The basis of flora is the angiosperms, including 57 families (96.6 %), 179 genera (97.8 %), 282 species (97.9 %). The leading positions belong to the families Asteraceae (11.8 %), Poaceae and Rosaceae (10.8 %), Fabaceae (7.3 %). The most important genera in the flora were boreal ones - Carex, Artemisia (2.8 %), Potentilla (1.7 %). The ecological analysis showed the predominance of mesophytes (45.5 %). Perennial plants with clustered fleshy roots and short-rhizomatous ones (21.5 %) were a main biomorph. The analysis of the primary production of urban vegetation according to Terra MODIS data from 2000 to 2018 was carried out. The highest seasonal growth rates observed in 2001 and 2007, and the lowest ones were in 2004 and 2008. The average annual growth rates were 115 +/- 9 % for May, 107 +/- 5 % for June, 107 +/- 5 % for July, 119 +/- 14 % for July, and 120 +/- 11 % for August. The positive trend in the productivity of urban vegetation was established using the series criteria.

AB  - The sociocultural backdrop of international students coming to a foreign country from different cultural and social environments plays a key role in shaping their attitude towards learning. The article explores and compares the motivational drives of international students from the Arab countries and India, which underlie their attitude to academic activities and academic progress. We used the method of systematic literature review, a questionnaire survey, comparative, quantitative, and qualitative analyses to obtain data on the value systems, traditions, and worldview of international students, which will make it possible for educators to appreciate the cultural contexts these students are embedded in. Social and cultural awareness of different aspects of the students' value systems will enable teachers in host countries to contribute effectively to international student integration into the educational process.

CP  - 25th SPIE Conference on Algorithms, Technologies, and Applications for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imagery

AB  - Combining multiple satellite remote sensing sources provides a far richer, more frequent view of the earth than that of any single source; the challenge is in distilling these petabytes of heterogeneous sensor imagery into meaningful characterizations of the imaged areas. To meet this challenge requires effective algorithms for combining heterogeneous data to identify subtle but important changes among the intrinsic data variation. The major obstacle to using heterogeneous satellite data to monitor anomalous changes across time is this: subtle but real changes on the ground can be overwhelmed by artifacts that are simply due to the change in modality. Here, we implement a joint-distribution framework for anomalous change detection that can effectively "normalize" for these changes in modality, and does not require any phenomenological resampling of the pixel signal. This flexibility enables the use of satellite imagery from different sensor platforms and modalities. We use multi-year construction of the Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park (in Inglewood, CA) as our testbed, and exploit synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and multispectral imagery from both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. We explore results for anomalous change detection between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 over time, and also show results for anomalous change detection between Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.

AB  - Oil spills, whether those come from tanker ships or offshore platforms, might potentially be disastrous for the environment as well as for the society both socially and economically. Generally, oil spills are spreading quite easily for hundreds of nautical miles at the sea damaging large areas and causing serious ecological disasters. Numerous accidents such as the Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska in 1989, the Prestige oil spill at the coast of Galicia, Spain in 2002 or the Deepwater Horizon platform oil spill accident in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico have unfortunately demonstrated the dangerousness of an oil accident. Remote sensing constitutes an effective solution in oil mapping and monitoring. Specifically, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites have already proved their effectiveness in the specific research field. Oil identification and mapping constitutes a key point of the oil prevention research since is an essential step for the quantification of the oil volume and thereafter the development of a spread model. As case study of the specific work it was selected the Agia Zoni II oil spill, which resulted from the wreck of the Agia Zoni II tanker on September 10th, 2017. This work focuses on the best possible in terms of accuracy mapping of the Agia Zoni II oil spill using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The mapping was based on the application of three different processing approaches: a) using the oil spill tool, provided by SNAP software, b) using a semi-automatic methodology and c) by applying a sort of classification in Sentinel-1 images. The approaches were compared and evaluated regarding the quality (reliability) of the final product and the required processing time. The validation of the results of the oil spill mapping using different approaches implemented by the digitization of the affected areas utilizing Sentinel-2 data in ArcGIS environment.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the real extent of soil that is degraded by erosion represent important information for the purposes of conservation policy. However, this type of data is rarely available for large areas. A remote-sensing-based method for identifying of eroded areas at the regional scale has been tested using a combination of time series of free access Sentinel-2 image data, airborne orthoimages and ground-truth data. The unsupervised classification ISODATA of the Sentinel-2A images has been performed. The minimum distance method has been applied for the assignment of unsupervised classes to four erosion classes using the ground-truth data. The automatic classification of eroded soils achieved an overall accuracy of 55.2% for three distinguished classes. An accumulated class has been eliminated as no unsupervised classes were assigned to this erosion class. A simplified classification of two classes (strongly eroded and other soils) reached an accuracy of 80.9%. The overall accuracy of the simplified classification increased to 86.9% after the visual refinement using orthoimages. This study shows the potential of the tested approach to produce valuable data on actual soil degradation by erosion. The limitations of the method are related to the soil cover variability, masking effect of clouds, vegetation or litter and the spectral separability of individual classes.

TI  - From Social to Anthropological Discourse in Gorky: Hypotheses and Rebuttals
T2  - RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors of this article propose and defend the hypothesis that the provincial-born Maxim Gorky, when illustrating his worldview in his polemical and artistic works, served as the bearer of mental characteristics and complexes inherent only and exclusively to the Russian people. The hypothesis in question serves as the basis for a rebuttal to the traditional understanding of Gorky's social engagement as a writer, including his work as a playwright. Gorky's anthropology, as a set of sociopsychological and moral personality traits, gender and mental characteristics, as well as a corpus of many dozens of human characters, represents a powerful stratum of national traditions and cultural experience. However, in their cultural-anthropological detailing, these properties are familiar and understood around the world: fear of the lack of love, the need for understanding, acute female-male conflicts. The writer's lively voice rectifies otherwise banal and oversimplified concepts about man.

TI  - Trace elements and isotope data of the Um Garayat gold deposit, Wadi Allaqi district, Egypt
T2  - MINERALIUM DEPOSITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Trace element composition of sulfides and O, C, Sr and S isotopic data are assessed to constrain the evolution and potential fluid and metal sources of the Um Garayat gold deposit. Ore microscopy and BSE investigations of quartz veins show blocky arsenopyrite and pyrite replaced in part by pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and gersdorffite. Free-milling gold occurs commonly in close association with the late sulfides, and along fractures in pyrite. On the other hand, recrystallized pyrite is disseminated in host metavolcaniclastic/metasedimentary rocks that commonly contain carbonaceous material. In situ LA-ICP-MS analysis of sulfides shows the recrystallized pyrite enriched in most trace elements, while blocky pyrite contains only some traces of arsenic. Detected concentrations of gold (up to 17ppm) were only reported in arsenopyrite disseminated in quartz veins. The S-34 values of blocky pyrite and pyrrhotite in quartz veins define a narrow range (1.6 to 3.7 parts per thousand), suggesting a homogenous sulfur source which is consistent with the dominantly mafic host rocks. The recrystallized pyrite has a distinctive sulfur isotope composition (S-34 -9.3 to -10.6 parts per thousand), which is rather comparable to diagenetic sulfides. Hydrothermal carbonate in quartz veins and wallrock have nearly constant values of O-18 (10.5 to 11.9 parts per thousand) and C-13 (-4.2 to -5.5 parts per thousand). Based on constraints from mineral assemblages and chlorite thermometry, data of six samples indicate that carbonate precipitation occurred at similar to 280 degrees C from a homogenous hydrothermal fluid with O-18(H2O) 4.4 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand and C-13 =3.7 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand. Strontium isotope values of two samples (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7024 and 0.7025) are similar to the initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of island arc metabasalts (similar to 710Ma) in the South Eastern Desert. The generally homogenous sulfur, C, O, Sr isotope data are suggestive of metamorphogenic fluids, likely produced from dominantly mafic volcanic rocks at the greenschist-amphibolite facies transition.

AB  - Time series satellite data in the visible, near-infrared (VNIR) and radar wavelengths provide useful information for urban green land cover changes monitoring through derived biogeophysical parameters (leaf area index, canopy cover, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, chlorophyll content, net primary production, canopy water stress, etc.). In order to assess urban green spatio-temporal changes due to extreme climatic or anthropogenic pressure was applied fusion technique to time-series multispectral and multitemporal satellite imagery (Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, Sentinel 1/ 2 and MODIS Terra/Aqua data) for Bucharest metropolitan area in Romania, over 2000-2017 period. To evaluate the degree of climate and anthropogenic impacts on urban green environment of the investigated test site, have been considered several land cover classifications, correlations with meteorological parameters at local and regional scale and some city climate modeling scenarios. So urban green vegetation has a nonlinear response to extreme climate events in different seasons and vegetation land covers.

AB  - In order to quantify the effect of urbanization and land cover changes on urban surface albedo change and radiative forcing impact on urban thermal environment MODIS land surface albedo (LSA) and land surface temperature (LST) products were used to investigate the magnitude of extreme climate and anthropogenic pressures. The main goal of this study was to develop an effective remote sensing-based methodological approach to investigate the possible occurrence and associated causes of gradual surface albedo trends in metropolitan area of Bucharest during 2000-2018 period. During summer time and heat waves periods urban land surface broadband albedo is a critical variable affecting Bucharest city climate. Analysis of time series MODIS Terra/Aqua data revealed the strong inverse relationship between LSA and LST during summer time in city area with negative impact on urban thermal environment. Broadband albedo, which measures urban surface properties depends also on the atmospheric conditions. In this study, were analyzed also the interannual variations in Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHI), derived from MODIS LST data and their relationships with vegetation urban indices NDVI/EVI, climate variability and urbanization. These findings stress the dependence of urban thermal environment of urban biogeophysical variables such as land surface albedo, urban density and morphology, surface properties, vegetation, bodies of water, industrial sites, transportation systems and infrastructures.

AB  - The main problem for seismic precursors recognition is to extract useful information associated with tectonic activities and to eliminate the effects of non-tectonic factors. Pre-earthquake spatio-temporal developed geophysical, geodetically, and geochemical anomalies are controlled by various factors like as earthquake moment magnitude and its focal depth, geological setting, topography, land covers as well as climate and atmospheric conditions. In this paper, changes before and after some moderate Vrancea earthquakes in the crustal dynamics as well as in the land and atmospheric parameters (surface air temperature- AT and land surface temperature LST anomalies, have been investigated on the basis of time-series geospatial (NOAA AVHRR and MODIS Terra/Aqua) and field data analysis for 2010-2018 period. Ground surface deformations have been detected through analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) radar satellite Sentinel 1 and high quality in-situ GPS monitoring data. The detected changes show strong evidence of coupling between lithosphere-land surface-atmosphere-ionosphere associated with the Vrancea's earthquakes For some analyzed earthquakes, starting with ten days up to one week prior to a moderate earthquake a transient thermal infrared rise appeared in AT (2-10 degrees C) and LST (20-30 degrees K) higher than the normal values, function of the magnitude and focal depth, which disappeared after the main shock. Ground vertical surface displacements presented on interferometric deformation map are in the range of 4 cm for uplifts and subsidence. The joint analysis of geospatial, geophysical, and geological information is revealing new insights for Vrancea zone seismicity understanding.

AB  - This paper investigated the influences of urban growth on thermal environment in relationship with other biophysical variables for Bucharest and Timisoara cities in Romania. Satellite remote sensing provides a cost-effective and time-saving methodology for spatio-temporal analyses of land surface temperature (Ts) distribution and urban thermal environment monitoring. Time series satellite remote sensing data from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI, MODIS Terra/Aqua and NOAA AVHRR were used to assess urban vegetation land cover-temperature interactions over period between 2000 and 2018 years. Vegetation abundances and percent impervious surfaces were derived by means of linear spectral mixture model, and a method for effectively enhancing impervious surface has been developed to accurately examine the urban growth. For this purpose, a set of meteorological and climatic data recorded in synoptic stations were used. The land surface temperature (Ts), a key parameter for urban thermal characteristics analysis, was also analyzed in relation with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) at city level. Based on these parameters, the urban growth, and urban heat island effect (UHI) and the relationships of Ts to other biophysical parameters have been analyzed. Results show that the city area ratio of impervious surface in both towns Bucharest and Timisoara increased significantly during investigated period, the intensity of urban heat island and heat wave events being most significant. The correlation analyses revealed that, at the pixel-scale, Ts possessed a strong positive correlation with percent impervious surfaces and negative correlation with vegetation abundances at the regional scale, respectively.

AB  - The earth crust suffers a variety of geophysical changes, which produce presignals of impending earthquakes. The coupling model lithosphere-surfacesphere-atmosphere-ionosphere provides a comprehensive mechanism to explain key involved geophysical processes. Space-time anomalies of several seismic precursors detected in multitemporal and multiresolution satellite data or in situ monitoring of radon gas emitted from soil near the ground air weeks to days in the Vrancea epicentral area can be associated with the strain stress changes that occurred before the occurrence of moderate and strong earthquakes. This paper investigated seismic precursors during 2012-2017 period over Vrancea seismogenic region in Romania through analysis of NOAA AVHRR and MODIS Terra/Aqua Thermal Infrared data of key geophysical parameters (Land Surface Temperature -LST, and Air Temperature AT) and atmospheric radon concentration recorded at Plostina seismic station in Vrancea zone and Bucharest using solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD) CR-39 radon monitors before some moderate earthquakes. Multi-parameter data have been computed based on multi-year background data for anomalies detection. Results indicate significant transient variations in observed parameters before the main events. Space-time anomalies of several seismic precursors detected in time series satellite data or in situ monitoring of radon gas emitted from soil near the ground air weeks to days in the Vrancea epicentral area can be associated with the strain stress changes that occurred before the occurrence of moderate and strong earthquakes. This research is valuable for identifying earthquake presignals in earthquake prone areas.

AB  - This paper investigated urban growth and green land cover decrease impacts on Bucharest metropolitan climate. Time series of Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, MODIS Terra/Aqua and NOAA AVHRR thermal infrared data as well as in-situ meteorological data have been used to assess urban land cover-air and land surface temperature interactions over 2000-2018 period. The air (Ta) and land surface temperature (Ts), key parameters for urban climate study were analyzed in relation with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface latent heat flux (SLHF) at city level. Based on these parameters, the urban growth, Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and the relationships of Ts to other biogeophysical parameters have been investigated. Correlation analysis revealed that, at the pixel-scale, Ta and Ts possessed a strong positive correlation with percent impervious surfaces and negative correlation with vegetation abundances at the regional scale, respectively. Was also analyzed UHI phenomenon during extreme heat waves events. Our results suggest that the most intense UHI occurs in day-time in the summer period during heat waves periods. Satellite data in synergy with insitu data revealed a clear land surface temperature contrast between the central, median and peripheral zones of Bucharest metropolitan zone in Romania. The analysis shows that different urban/periurban zones and landscapes bring diurnally and seasonally different contributions to the local and regional thermal environment. Urban land cover was the most important contributor to increases in regional Ts. Vegetation had a clear cooling effect as the normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) increased during summer periods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Remote sensing has been increasingly used in monitoring and analyzing agricultural activities. Crop identification based on analysis of individual pixel response, without considering neighboring pixels, may lead to poor results. In this paper, we investigate the use of superpixels generated by the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to delineate homogeneous regions in images to help crop identification. The proposed classification strategy consists of combining pixel-level classification probabilities, estimated using the pixel spectral response, with pooled probability values of the pixels located inside superpixels. Weighting both probability contributions produce a hybrid classification. We test this idea to map the interim-harvest of corn and cotton in an agricultural area in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, characterized by the presence of large farms. For this, we use a cloudfree multispectral image captured by the wide-field imaging camera onboard the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 4 (CBERS-4), that acquires four bands in the visible and near-infrared with a pixel spatial resolution of 64 m/pixel. The two main crops in our study area where identified with an overall accuracy of about 85%. Encouraging results suggest that the proposed method may be used as part of a remote sensing-based crop identification system.

TI  - A Survey of Big Data Analytics for Smart Forestry
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable forestry data can be obtained by means of continuous monitoring of forests using advanced technologies, which provides a major opportunity for the development of smart forestry. However, with the improvement of the precision and acquisition speed of data, the traditional data analysis, and storage technology cannot meet the performance requirements of current applications. Forestry big data has brought a new solution to the difficulties encountered in the course of forestry development, which refers to the application of big data technology to forestry data processing. In this paper, we summarize the research and work of the big data in smart forestry in recent years. First, we review the history of the emergence and development of forestry big data, and then briefly summarize the opportunities brought to the forestry by big data technology. One of the most important tasks of forestry big data is to organize the massive data reasonably and effectively and to calculate fast. Therefore, we propose a five-layer architecture model of forestry big data and summarize the related work of data storage, query, analysis, and application. Finally, the challenges of forestry big data are analyzed, and the trend of future development has prospected from three aspects.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of synthetic aperture radar technology, the application of SAR image data in landslide hazard information extraction has received attention and achieved some results. In this paper, the grayscale texture information features of SAR images after landslide disasters are combined with the expectation maximization algorithm to extract landslide information. The optimal threshold is calculated using the expectation maximization algorithm, and the image is divided into a landslide area and a non-landslide area. In this paper, the method is applied to Radarsat-2 SAR data in Yingxiu area after Wenchuan earthquake to obtain the distribution of landslide results. The method is also applied to other areas of the image for landslide extraction, and the correctness of the results is judged by comparing with the field measurement data and optical image analysis. Due to the particularity of the landslide, the method still needs further improvement in accuracy. The extraction results need further research in verification, so the method is not very good at present. Improvement needs further improvement.

AB  - The abstract should appear at the top of the left-. The main objective of this study is to analyze the potential use of L-band radar data for the estimation of soil moisture in agricultural tropical areas. Simultaneously to several radar acquisitions made between June and October 2018, using ALOS2-PALSAR sensor over the Berambadi site (south of India), ground measurements of soil roughness, soil water content, LAI were recorded. The sensitivity of the ALOS-2 measurements to variations in soil moisture, which has been reported in several scientific publications, is confirmed in this study, even for dense crops. The radar signals are simulated using different types of backscattering models (physical and semi-empirical) over bare soil and vegetation cover for different types of crops (tumeric, etc). WCM model parameterized with LAI for vegetation contribution allows a good estimation of soil moisture for tumeric.

T2  - HISTORISCHES JAHRBUCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The foreign currency trials of members of religious orders and Catholic priests in 1935-36 constituted a concerted 'action' by the SS Sicherheitsdienst (SD) under Reinhard Heydrich against elites of the Catholic Church, as proved by files made aceessible since the fall of the Berlin Wall. A special state prosecutor's office in Berlin controlled by Heydrich pressured judges to sentence the accused, whether innocent or guilty, to lengthy prison terms or at least hefty fines. Yet the SD's aim of a 'parallel judiciary' rooted in the Nazi worldview was only partially realized because there were still judges who respected and applied positive law. In that sense, the foreign currency trials evince a tension that is constitutive for a 'dual state' (Ernst Fraenkel), between a 'normative state' and a 'prerogative state,' although the latter became increasingly more powerful.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with ethical considerations accompanying the reorganization of urbanonyms in the context of de-communization. It is focused on several issues, in particular concerning the justification of changes in the names of streets and squares, as well as the treatment of onyms as carriers of values that could serve the authority and its propagation. Attention was also paid to the participation of the local community in removing unwanted communist symbols. Based on the observations made, it was established that the violation of ethical norms concerns: disregarding the opinions of local communities, especially residents of a given street, regarding the change of name and the use of its privileged position by the authority, the imposition of a particular worldview and value system, and the use of untrue arguments.

T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study analyzes data of ship-based observations on 45 stations performed aboard the R/VAkademik M.A. Lavrentyev on cruise 33 May 7-18, 2004, in the northwestern part of the Sea of Japan (35-44 degrees N, 130-137 degrees E). The following in situ data were used: CTD-data, assimilation number, concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon compounds) and chlorophyll a (Chl a). Satellite data on Chl a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient at a wavelength of 490 nm, primary production (PP), and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) available from the Climate Change Initiative Ocean Colour (CCI-OC) and Ocean Productivity databases were also used for the same stations. The Chl a concentration in the first optical layer estimated from the results of ship-based measurements, was on average 0.55 +/- 0.58 mg/m(3), but the satellite-derived estimates were almost twice as high (0.95 +/- 0.36 mg/m(3)). Ship assessments of PP were 1870 +/- 900 mgC m(-2) day(-1); the value obtained using satellite data was 1.5 times smaller: 1226 +/- 432 mgC m(-2) day(-1). Vertical Chl a profiles showed that the largest amount of Chl a was concentrated in the 20-45 m layer. Measurements of the assimilation number showed that most production occurs within the 0-55 m layer in the south of the study area and within the 0-30 m layer in the north. The weak correlation between ship- and satellite-derived Chl a and PP values can be explained by low accuracy of satellite-derived estimates.

T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Topographic correction over the mountainous region is an essential preprocessing step for landuse/landcover extraction from earth observation (EO) satellite data. Until the time of this paper writing, there has not been any publication regarding topographic correction on LAPAN-A3 multispectral data. Topographic correction mainly grouped into two categories: band ratio and illumination modeling which required ancillary digital elevation model (DEM). This paper aims to evaluate three different DEM sources used for topographic correction on LAPAN-A3. These DEMs are Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), ALOS World 3D (AW3D), and nation-wide DEMNAS. The topographic corrections were performed over a subset of forested mountainous region in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Minnaert correction algorithm was used in all three DEMs and evaluate the results. Performance evaluation was based on visual assessment, as well as spectral homogeneity of the pixel value before and after correction. The spectral homogeneity was calculated based on coefficient variation changes before and after correction. The initial results showed that SRTM produced the best visual appearance, while AW3D 30 performed the best in terms of highest reduction in coefficient variation.

TI  - PROBLEMS AND METHODS OF MODERN ETHNOPOETICS
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the main stages of formation of ethnopoetics as an area of scientific investigation, the role of ethnological research in the field of cultural philosophy devoted to the problems of the Russian national character, the Russian world outlook, and the national worldview. The problem of "literary transplantation" (D. Likhachev) is examined on the material of P. Katenin's controversy with Zhukovsky about the Russian version of the genre of ballad. The article reveals the adaptive mechanisms in the sphere of the Russian culture inheritance (as a target domain) of some ideological and aesthetic complexes borrowed from the West. Drawing on the works by V.A. Zakharov, the author defines the term "ethnopoetics", which emphasizes the organic connection of two principles at once, one of which boils down to the basic ethnocultural categories (in our case, the axiological foundations of the national spiritual and religious traditions), and the other operates its own philological categories directly leading into the sphere of historical and ontological poetics. The author demonstrates the essential parameters and boundaries of the modern field of ethnopoetics and its links with internal subdivisions (imagology, religious philology) and related disciplines (regional studies, geopoetics, etc.).The ethnological aspects of ethnopoetics are considered on the example of the works of two Russian writers, who interpreted the symbolic space of Russia in different ways, comparing it either with the image of the vast steppe (N. Gogol), or with the image of huge, full-flowing rivers (D. Mamin-Sibiryak), but at the same time directly linking it with the heroic character of the Russian people, and the depth and immensity of the Russian soul. In terms of national typology, the article defines the systemic categorial foundations of ethnoconfessional characterization of Russian classical literature: collegiality, Easter traditions, Christocentrism, aesthetics of foolishness and hesychasm, Slavic phenomenon of giving and sympathy for the poor, faith in miracles, and belief in the soteriological vertical (or idea of spiritual salvation). The author reveals the writer's attitude to imagological images and stereotypes on the example of the fragments of the novel "War and Peace" by L. Tolstoy and the essay " The Languor of the Spirit" by N. Leskov. The article argues that the reception and representation of the images of the "other" (first of all, a representative of the German nation) in the works of these authors acquires an axiological coloring, turning into an imagological reflection on the essence of the Russian national character.

AB  - The year 2019 marks the 100th anniversary of the 3Â·1 independence movement. Accordingly, We have seen many articles and titles published, focusing on the 3Â·1 Independence Movement. This paper is also a study of the 3Â·1 Independence Movement, specially focusing on the Jeonbuk province.Specifically, This paper examines the movement from the viewpoint of ‘ACTS theological Synoptic Movement.’ First, the 3Â·1 independence movement in Jeonbuk area was deeply rooted in Christian faith. This can be seen in the behavior and life of 3Â·1independence movement leaders like Park Yeon Se, Im Yong-shin, and Moon Yonggi, etc.They did hold the Christian faith and truth. And their Christian faith is was faithfully expressed in the Jeonbuk area. In this sense, The 3Â·1 independence movement in Jeonbuk area was a great faith movement and this coincides with the Central Truth of Christianity in ‘ACTS Theological Synoptic Movement.’ Second, the 3Â·1 independence movement in Jeonbuk area was formed around the mission schools in that area. The missionaries of the schools taught the Bible to students and they could have learned the Christian faith and developed the Christian worldview. Slowly but surely they learned the importance of the nation and become aware of the nationalism based on the Christian faith. The people who attended and 3Â·1 independence movement in Jeonbuk area showed their theological basis and this coincides with the Sound Theology Movement in ‘ACTS Theological Synoptic Movement.’ Third, the viewpoint of True Believer Nurturing Movement in ‘ACTS Theological Synoptic Movement,’ The Jeonbuk area 3Â·1 Independence movement allowed people to see who was raised by True Believer Nurturing in the longevity scene.Fourth, the 3Â·1 independence movement was formed within various religious backgrounds. There were various protestant believers like Presbyterians and Salvation Army. Protestant christians were the leading force and the Chondo-kyo believers also cooperated more than other religious groups. Fifth, the 3Â·1 independence movement became a turning point to the qualitative and quantitative restoration of the church. Christian schools and churches played a leading role in the 3Â·1 independence movement in Jeonbuk area. These schools were Yeongmyung and Melbondin Girls school in Gunsan and Shinheung and Gyeonjeon Girls school in Jeonju which were affiliated with the mission station of the Presbyterian Church in the United States in Jeonbuk.The 3Â·1 Independence Movement movement demonstrated by The teachers and students in mission schools showed the importance of Bible- centered faith education. This coincides with ‘Church Renewal Movement’ in ‘ACTS Theological Synoptic Movement.’ In conclusion, the 3Â·1 independence movement led by Christian members in Jeon buk area was a great faith movement that revealed the core values of the ‘ACTS Theological Synoptic Movement.’

AB  - Made by folding paper, Sinwi(神位) contains thoughts that humans have conceived about the sacred world for a long time and is simple as it is easy to get paper anywhere. This study focused on two representative cases of paper-folding, Jibang(紙榜) and Jiui(紙衣, paper clothes), to investigate the religious life and culture of Koreans who have communicated with the sacred world.Jibang(紙榜) is Sinwi(神位) centering on text, while Jiui(紙衣) is Sinwi(神位) focusing on shapes expressed with clothes. The two are made with paper by ‘folding,’ which is the next level of ‘cutting,’ and have significance in holding specific historic records.Jibang(紙榜), as the most sacred one among paper goods, let you infer the basic form of paper-folding. Going beyond attaching paper to a board, it is made by folding into a shape where Sinju(神主) and Gamsil(龕室) are combined to reflect the worldview and the view of life and death given to Sinju(神主) and Gamsil(龕室). Made by folding, Jibang(紙榜) is considered to have been developed since the 14th century and has been actively practiced in today’s private houses and temples, gaining attention as Korean unique Sinwi(神位).As a symbolic Sinwi(神位) made by folding paper into traditional Korean pants-outfit for men, Jiui(紙衣) was used at Gwanyok(灌浴) of Suryukjae(水陸 齋) from early times. In China that spread Suryukjae(水陸齋), cloth or paper is used to make actual clothes for Gwanyok(灌浴). On the other hand, Korea has used symbolic Jiui(紙衣) made by folding paper since the14th century. Since each country has its own characteristics of patterns of transmission, while China has made Jiui(紙衣) like actual clothes, Korea has used exteriorized Jiui(紙衣).

M3  - Data study
AB  - We evaluated duodenal tissues of B6C3F1 mice exposed to either Cr(VI) (180ppm in drinking water), captan (a12000ppm in diet), or folpet (a16000ppm in diet) for 28 days. TempO-Seq technology was used to measure the sentinel geneset, S1500+, representing ~3000 toxicology-relevant genes. Global exposure-induced transcriptional responses were similar between agents (all Pearson correlation coefficients a0.61). Focusing on responses at doses of captan and folpet that correlate most closely with effects of Cr(VI), a gene-level comparison identified that 126/546 (23%) differentially expressed genes were altered in the same direction across all three agents. Pathway-level comparisons identified 25 up-regulated pathways commonly modulated between Cr(VI), captan, and folpet. Commonly altered genes and pathways were related to cellular metabolism, stress, immune response, and cell proliferation. No up-regulated pathways relevant to genotoxicity were associated with responses to any agent. Overall design: Examination of ~3000 genes by targeted sequencing in duodenal tissue from mice from 6 treatment groups.

M3  - Data study
AB  - The integrity and ecological sustainability of marine ecosystems are under increasing threats mainly due to long-term consequences of climate change, habitat degradation and human impact. Marine mammal species are top predators and have long life spans. Often, they need to cope with exposure to a variable combination of environmental stressors (e.g. xenobiotic pollutants) and pathogens. Therefore, marine mammals can be considered prime sentinel species of aquatic ecosystem health.The microbiota composition of each animal species is shaped by the interactions with the immune system, according to the animal physiology, diet and social habits, environmental context, among others, and has been related with either health or disease statuses of the host. Understanding host-microbe interactions in cetaceans may contribute to the identification of compromised populations, microbial markers of disease and ultimately to scientifically based population management decisions.In the present study, the oral microbiome of the 3 small cetacean species most commonly found stranded (D. delphis, S. coeruleoalba and P. phocoena) in the Iberian Atlantic coast was sequenced in order to identify discriminatory microbial fingerprints according to the animal species, age class, ecology of the animal, or cause of death. Systematic studies on marine mammal health and disease are crucial to support conservation and management actions, particularly when considering that some species of cetaceans are severely declining in Iberian Atlantic waters.

AB  - Liquid biopsy of plasma is a simple and non-invasive technology that holds great promise in biomedical research. It is based on the analysis of nucleic acid-based biomarkers with predictive potential. In the present work, we have combined this concept with the FTA technology for sentinel mussels. We found that hemocytes collected from liquid biopsies can be readily fixed on FTA cards and used for long-term metagenomic analysis of bacterial profiles of mussels. This liquid biopsy-based approach should thus facilitate biobanking activities and development of omics-based biomarkers in mussels to assess the quality of marine ecosystems.

AB  - Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) is a well-characterized autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal disease caused by mutations in lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST). Feline CHS was first noted in a lineage of Persian cats, and as in mice, the sentinel presentation was hypopigmentation. The clinical characterization of the feline model for CHS examined neutrophil and platelet functions and auditory and ocular pigmentation abnormalities. To identify the causative mutation for CHS segregating within a feline research colony, a fibroblast cell line derived from an affected individual was whole genome sequenced.

TI  - MULTIPLE SCN5A ENHANCERS MODULATE CARDIAC GENE EXPRESSION AND QT INTERVAL VARIATION
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have suggested that sequence variation in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) modulate common disease risk and trait variation. However, identification of the majority of these causal variants and their mechanism of action have remained significant challenges. We used reporter assays for all common variants at the QT interval associated SCN5A GWAS locus with the goal of identifying causal variants for the association. A target region of ~500kb containing SCN5A was defined based on recombination hotspots (rate10cM/Mb; estimated from HapMap) flanking the 5 independent QT interval GWAS hits. Within this region, all common variants (minor allele frequency 5%), from the 1000 Genomes European ancestry populations, in moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD; r20.3) with any of the 5 sentinel hits, were selected for analyses. Of a total 121 variants selected, 112 variants in 104 amplicons passed primer design (amplicon size 256-617bp; median 397bp), with both alleles of 106 variants successfully cloned along with flanking sequences into 98 amplicons upstream of a minimal promoter-driven firefly luciferase gene in pGL4.23. Cardiomyocyte cells, AC16 (human) and HL1 (mouse), were transfected with test constructs and Renilla luciferase vector (for transfection normalization) in triplicate; luciferase assays were performed 24h later. All cloning and reporter assays were performed in 96- and 24-well plates. In reporter assays across the two cell lines, compared to empty vector, 37 amplicons showed enhancer activity (z-score99 %tile), with a concordance rate of ~70%. Of these 37 enhancer CREs, 9 overlapped open chromatin regions (DNase-seq peaks) observed in adult human heart tissue, largest among all human tissues evaluated by the RoadMap Epigenomics project. Of these 37 enhancer CREs, 12 showed allelic difference in reporter activity (P

TI  - Lake or river: environment shapes the ecological adaptation at the level of gene expression in two populations of the freshwater bivalve Diplodon chilensis
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Climate change and human impact strongly alter the conditions in fresh water habitats in the Patagonian Andes. We performed in-situ transcriptomics of the freshwater mussel Diplodon chilensis, using Illumina to understand its ecological niche adaptation. This aims at further establishing the use of Diplodon as sentinel organism in environmental change studies. Differential gene expression patterns of 265 identifiable genes across seasonal samples from Paimun lake and Chimehuin river (Northern Patagonia, Argentina) indicated adaptations to different habitats in lake and river to have stronger effects on gene regulation than seasonal change. Seasonal difference in gene regulation were higher in river than in lake bivalves (84 vs. 38 sequences), with strongest effects in the summer reproductive season. Three major categories of differentially expressed genes included growth, metabolic pathway, and immune system/parasite defense genes. Whereas genes upregulated in deep layer lake bivalves support survival under critical conditions of hypoxic episodes, seasonal food availability, and parasite defense, river bivalves invest more strongly into vital ecological processes and display marked seasonal reproduction and growth. The alternative mitochondrial oxidase (AOX) was differentially expressed between sites whereas cytochrome oxidase activity was uniform, pointing at the importance of hypoxia and ecological tolerance in these abundant freshwater mussels. Based on our approach with a minimal number of individuals (three) per site and season, we perceive in situ transcriptomics as the preferred way over hypothesis driven qPCR with preselected genes, to analyze ecological adaptation and stress response in natural mussel populations.

TI  - Population genomics of American pika climate adaptation using RADseq
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - The ecological effects of climate change have been shown in most major taxonomic groups; however, the evolutionary consequences are less well-documented. Adaptation to new climatic conditions offers a potential long-term mechanism for species to maintain viability in rapidly changing environments, but mammalian examples remain scarce. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) has been impacted by recent climate-associated extirpations and range-wide reductions in population sizes, establishing it as a sentinel mammalian species for climate change. To investigate evidence for local adaptation and reconstruct patterns of genomic diversity and gene flow across rapidly changing environments, we used a space-for-time design and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to genotype American pikas along two steep elevational gradients at 30,966 SNPs and employed independent outlier detection methods that scanned for genotype-environment associations. We identified 338 outlier SNPs detected by two separate analyses and/or replicated in both transects, several of which were annotated to genes involved in metabolic function and oxygen transport. Additionally, we found evidence of directional gene flow primarily downslope from high-elevation populations, along with reduced gene flow at outlier loci. If this trend continues, elevational range contractions in American pikas will likely be from local extirpation rather than upward movement of low-elevation individuals; this, in turn, could limit the potential for adaptation within this landscape. These findings are of particular relevance for future conservation and management of American pikas and other elevationally-restricted, thermally-sensitive species.

TI  - Dragotcytosis: Elucidation of the Mechanism for Cryptococcus neoformans Macrophage-to-Macrophage Transfer
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic yeast capable of a unique and intriguing form of cell-to-cell transfer between macrophage cells. The mechanism for cell-to-cell transfer is not understood. Here we imaged macrophages with CellTracker Green CMFDA-labeled cytosol to ascertain whether cytosol was shared between donor and acceptor macrophages. Analysis of several transfer events detected no transfer of cytosol from donor to acceptor macrophages. However, blocking Fc and complement receptors resulted in a major diminution of cell-to-cell transfer events. The timing cell-to-cell transfer (11.17 min) closely approximated the sum of phagocytosis (4.18 min) and exocytosis (6.71 min) times. We propose that macrophage cell-to-cell transfer represents a non-lytic exocytosis event followed by phagocytosis into a macrophage that is in close proximity and name this process Dragotcytosis (Dragot is a Greek surname meaning a~Sentinela) as it represents sharing of a microbe between two sentinel cells of the innate immune system. Microarrays were used to assess whether incubation of Bone Marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with receptor blocking antibodies had an effect on their transcriptional profiles. Overall design: BMDMs incubated with or without the Fc receptor blocking antibody were processed in triplicate for each condition.

AB  - Ramie is an important industrial fiber crop, and the fiber yield and its related traits are the most valuable traits in ramie production. However, the genetic basis for these traits is still poorly understood. Herein, a high-density genetic map with 1085 markers spanning 2,118.8 cM was constructed using a population derived from two parents, cultivated ramie Zhongsizhu 1 (ZSZ1) and its wild progenitor B. nivea var. tenacissima (BNT). The fiber yield (FY) and its four related traitsastem diameter (SD) and length (SL), stem bark weight (BW) and thickness (BT)awere performed for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, resulting in eight, six, six, three, and ten QTLs for SD, SL, BW, BD and FY traits, respectively. These 33 QTLs were mapped into 11 genomic regions, thus forming 11 QTL clusters; there were 11 QTLs identified their beneficial alleles from the wild species BNT. Interestingly, all QTLs in Cluster 8 and Cluster 10 displayed overdominance, indicating that these two regions were likely heterotic loci. In addition, there were five fiber yield-related genes identified to undergo positive selection in previous study, and they were found to locate into the genomic region near to the QTLs of this study. The genetic dissection for FY and its related traits improved our understanding to the genetic basis of these traits, as well to their domestication in ramie. The identification of many QTLs and the discovery of beneficial alleles from wild species provided a basis for the improvement of yield traits in ramie breeding. Overall design: The clean reads from the transcriptome of 111 F2 families and two parents were aligned to the ramie genome, then to identify SNPs and develop genetic map.

AB  - King Gojong and Queen Minbi of Joseon built the Guan Yu shrine Bukmyo in Myeongnyun-dong, Seoul in 1883. In 1887, he erected Bukmyomyojeongbi (Stele of the Northern Shrine: referred to as Bukmyobi hereinafter), which was inscribed with text delineating the purpose for and process of the creation of Bukmyo. Interestingly, this inscription says that King Gojong and Queen Minbi built Bukmyo after dreaming about Guan Yu, and believed that thanks to his spirit, the Joseon royal family was able to avoid harm during the Im-O Military Revolt in 1882 and the Gapsin Coup in 1884.This study will first reveal that King Gojong had a conservative and unrealistic worldview through an analysis of his Confucian philosophy, which is represented in the inscription and form of Bukmyobi. Second, this study will examine how King Gojong and Queen Minbi’s perception of the Japanese invasion of Korea, the Im-O Military Revolt and the Gapsin Coup was linked to their superstitions about Guan Yu. Third, it will investigate how King Gojong’s sense of his own royal dignity was expressed in the Bukmyobi, and consider the datedness and vacuousness of this perspective on himself. The significance of this study is that it is the first to examine the roots of King Gojong and Queen Minbi’s conservative disposition, as seen in Bukmyobi, and the relationship between their dream about Guan Yu and the Im-O Military Revolt and the Gapsin Coup.King Gojong and Queen Minbi’s consciousness of Confucianism and Guan Yu was not arrived at independently, and was uncritical and highly superstitious. Their perspective played a negative role in their decisions about and responses to the political situation of the late Joseon Dynasty. What King Gojong wished for by worshipping Guan Yu in a variety of ways, including the creation of Bukmyo and Bukmyobi, was the emergence of a savior like Guan Yu. Unfortunately, the salvation that King Gojong longed for was not for the benefit of Joseon as a nation in the modern sense nor that of the people of Joseon, but only for that of the royal family of Joseon. In addition, the entity which King Gojong worshipped as a representative figure of loyalty to the crown was not the actual person Guan Yu as recorded in The Records of the Three Kingdoms, but a semi-fictional character depicted in the novelization of that text by Mao Zhonggang, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

AB  - This paper attempts to clarify the significance of Warburg's image theory, focusing on two concepts: bewegtes Beiwerk(‘accessories in motion’) and Pathosformel(‘Pathosformular’). His image theory focuses on the function of visual image as energy carrier. There are dynamic elements in the visual image that move the viewer's passion without being reduced to semantic meanings. Warburg elucidates this characteristic of the image through psychological and mental relations of human to the world in the process of cultural development. Images are located between the mythological attitudes to the external world and the scientific/technological worldview which captured the being according to the causality. With the concept 'bewegtes Beiwerk' this study explores the polarity of images that work in image production and appreciation. Pathos formula is an image of a intense physical movement stimulated by furious passion. This image of suspended movement works by stimulating inner body of the viewer. This effect is enhanced by the 'energy reversal', where the ancient Pathos formula reappears in the Renaissance religious paintings.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness and limitations of emotional - centered empirical approach to Christian counseling. As the research method, I adopted qualitative case study method based on single counseling case and used case studies tailored to short-term counseling forms as analysis data. In this study, an effort was made to check how effective a particular intervention strategy called empirical technique is in achieving the purpose of Christian counseling, how it can fit into the Christian worldview, and how the core concepts such as the Holy Spirit ministry can be realized. As a result, the intervention strategy of emotional experience turned out to increase the congruence between the conceptive and empirical aspects of the client's self-awareness and contact, helping to alleviate symptoms as well as spiritual growth. The spontaneity of the client and the utilization of resources actively arise, and the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the here and now experience can be observed. But this research has limitations in that it is not free from the subjectivity of our personal experience, that it can not implement the counseling process starting with the central theme of the Bible, and that it does not allow us to deal fully with the essential parts of human beings.

AB  - The synoptic structural characteristics associated with heavy snowfall (Bukgangneung: 31.3 cm) that occurred in the Yeongdong area on 20 January 2017 was investigated using surface and upper-level weather charts, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data, radiosonde data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product. The cold dome and warm trough of approximately 500 hPa appeared with tropopause folding. As a result, cold and dry air penetrated into the middle and upper levels. At this time, the enhanced cyclonic potential vorticity caused strong baroclinicity, resulting in the sudden development of low pressure at the surface.Under the synoptic structure, localized heavy snowfall occurred in the Yeongdong area within a short time. These results can be confirmed from the vertical analysis of radiosonde data and the characteristics of the MODIS cloud product.

AB  - During the Japanese colonial period, in 1930s, a musical scene was formed and a social organization of professional musicians were formed. This chapter distinguished ‘non-musical’ from ‘musical,’ and set a certain musical value. The principle of creation and maintenance of such a band played a similar role in the literary circle. In particular, newspapers and magazines have addressed various events that constitute the music industry of the colonial Joseon dynasty, examined the current status of musicians, suggested points of reflection for the development of the music industry, and suggested that modern media through networking. I realized the logic of forming and maintaining a musical band while selecting ‘music’ and ‘not music.’ Over time, these bands were differentiated based on various criteria such as their academic background, taste, personal interests, and worldview. In early 1930s, the so-called ‘female music scene’ was one of them. The term ‘female music scene,’ which was formed and used at the time, was a sign of female artists who are going to be gradually performing.As time went on, the contents of the ‘female musicians’ and ‘female music scene’ gradually increased in the commentary area of ​​the music world. This means that the New Home(新家庭) And in February 1934 issue of New Home(新家庭), the “Total Evaluation of Womans Music,” and was used in the context of introducing and discussing female musicians in newspapers and magazines.In this study, I think that the formation and cause of female music scene are in the modern school education at Ewha Womans College, modern media such as newspaper and magazine. Modern media formed and spread the discourse and planned and imagined a chapter. School education was a system that realizes modern education. Therefore, the formation of female music scene is related to ① the influences of women’s literature in literary circles in early 1930s, ② the graduation of Ewha Womans College established in 1925, and the advancement of society. In addition, I asked the question, “Who made female music scene?” and discussed ③ The principle behind the composition of the female music scene is the discursive role of newspapers and magazines and the resulting community of imagination.

AB  - While the intellectual group Hakchikang has been recognized as a leading liberal force in previous studies, this article shows that some concepts of the ‘individual’ in 1910s’ Hakchikang lies within the ethnic organism associated with the theory of ‘Nationalism’(國粹論). Unlike the intellectuals of the late Joseon Dynasty, such as Yu Gil-joon and Park Young-hyo, their notion of the ‘individual’ prominently denied ‘Natural Right’ and ‘Du Contrat Social ou Principes du Droit Politiquethe’. Instead of dismantling the stereotypic social organic worldview of the Neo-Confucianism kinship-state network and forming a new world view based on the individual perception of the molecular ‘individual’, it shows that the combination of the existing concept of social organism and the concept of the individual was mainstream. Meanwhile there was a case where the western recognition of nominalism was introduced through the individual premise of social evolution theory. Though only a small number expressed it explicitly, it also became an occasion for the spread of individual awareness.

AB  - There have been three trends in the study of the view of humanity in Daesoon Thought: insider theology, outsider theology, and religious studies. This article is intended to interpret the view of humanity in Daesoon Thought from the perspective of Mircea Eliade’s New Humanism. We find similarities between Daesoon Thought and Eliade’s New Humanism. Daesoon Thought deals with the complexities of life as being labyrinth-like and puts Jeungsan’s view of humanity at the center of a Daesoon worldview. Jeungsan examines the existential problems which humans face in the Former World, and gives the religious remedies of Haewonsangsaeng (the resolution of grievances for mutual beneficence) and Boeunsangsaeng (the grateful reciprocation of favors for mutual beneficence) to transform humanity’s worldview for usage in the Later World. Jeungsan suggests a way of peace instead of the revolution of Donghak. Through the Reordering Works of Heaven and Earth, Jeungsan changes the mutual contention of the Former World into the mutual beneficence of the Later World. The cosmology of Daesoon Thought recovers the relationship between divine beings and human beings in the three realms, and proposes a system of ethics that promotes virtue and reproves vices and human-centericism. In conclusion, the view of humanity in Daesoon Thought is an unapologetic view of homo-religiosus from within a new humanism.

AB  - This paper is concerned with visual trackers for vision-based landing of delivery drones. To date most delivery drones have depended on GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) like GPS (Global Positioning System) for landing. However, we believe that for security reasons the drone operator should make sure the landing spot is clear by watching the streaming video from the drone and point the final landing spot in the image. In this study assuming an operational concept in which the operator points the landing spot on the drone video as the drone approaches the landing place, a comparison study of three visual trackers (MOSSE, KCF, DSST) is described. Especially, considering a distinctive property that the landing mark size increases dramatically as a drone draws near the landing place and real-time requirement of visual tracker, we propose how to adjust parameters of the visual trackers. For the size of tracking window is fixed in MOSSE and KCF filters, the time spent for filtering is almost constant as drone approaches the landing mark. However, in case of DSST, as the maximum tracking window size parameter changes from 480 pixels to 60 pixels, the filtering speed becomes almost eight times faster. When the maximum tracking window size parameter is 120 pixels, good performance is shown in terms of tracking and filtering time. Video data obtained from flying a commercial drone are utilized for a performance evaluation and comparison study, and methods to apply the results to delivery drones are proposed.

AB  - Land cover map best reflects land surface phenomena and change so it is used in various research. However, the land cover maps provided by the Ministry of Environment have limitation in terms of ac- curacy and temporal resolution. This study proposes the possibility of deep learning based alternative land cover classification method for shortening the renewal cycle of land cover maps through automation and development of a land cover classification that is suitable for Korea. Land cover classification is conducted using Convolutional neural network, which is the deep learning architecture specialized in image analysis. In order to confirm the heterogeneity of the land cover according to region even though the same land cover type, land cover classification of Korea was experimented using the model trained by EuroSAT land cover data composed of Europe region’s land cover data. Using Sentinel-2 satellite images the training and test data are constructed for land cover classification of Korea. The convolutional neural network model trained by the data constructed in this study showed better performance with high accuracy(98.28%) than the model trained by EuroSAT data. In addition, The learning speed and accuracy(99.66%) of the convolutional neural network model was improved by using ImageNet pre-trained parameters and it showed the possibility of using ImageNet parameters in land cover classification of Korea. We hope that this study will prompt the research on land cover classification using convolutional neural network which has not been illuminated in Korea.

AB  - Detection of mesoscale oceanic eddies using satellite data can utilize various ocean parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a pigment concentration in phytoplankton, and sea level altimetry measurements. Observation methods vary for each satellite dataset, as it is obtained using different temporal and spatial resolution, and optimized data processing. Different detection results can be derived for the same oceanic eddies; therefore, fundamental research on eddy detection using satellite data is required. In this study, we used ocean color satellite data, sea level altimetry data, and infrared SST data to detect mesoscale eddies in the East Sea and compared results from different detection methods. The sea surface current field derived from the consecutive ocean color chlorophyll-a concentration images using the maximum cross correlation coefficient and the geostrophic current field obtained from the sea level altimetry data were used to detect the mesoscale eddies in the East Sea. In order to compare the eddy detection from satellite data, the results were divided into three cases as follows: 1) the eddy was detected in both the ocean color and altimeter images simultaneously; 2) the eddy was detected from ocean color and SST images, but no eddy was detected in the altimeter data; 3) the eddy was not detected in ocean color image, while the altimeter data detected the eddy. Through these three cases, we described the difficulties with satellite altimetry data and the limitations of ocean color and infrared SST data for eddy detection. It was also emphasized that study on eddy detection and related

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to understanding the richness of Yonam's thoughts by examining Yonam's Taoist ideology in Yonam Park Ji-won's representative works, 『Hojil』 and 『Heaengjeon』. First, the relationship with Doga in the Yeonam literature was examined. Yeonam has reached a rich and understanding of Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu since childhood. In particular, Yonam actively attracted Taoist ideology as a way of overcoming the differential worldview. He used the symbol of shit as a tool to overthrow discrimination. Yeonam overthrew the differential worldview or suggested a new human view by utilizing the dung, shit, and brick of the eldest son. Yeonam overthrew the differential worldview or suggested a new human view by utilizing the dung, shit, and brick of the eldest son.Yeonam found no good reason to overcome the discrimination of existence in the worldview of studying abroad. Thus, he attempted to overcome the discriminatory worldview in the Taoist worldview. Based on this, I examined how the fictional worldview of Yeonam is revealed in his novel. In 「Hojil(호질)」, I  examined the relationship between ‘balchongjiyu(발총지유)’ and 「geohyeob(거협)」, 「docheog(도척)」. Yeonam showed the behavior of ‘balchongjiyu(발총지유)’ in detail through Buggwagseonsaeng(북곽선생). The chapter of 『Chuang-tzu』 , 「geohyeob(거협)」, 「docheog(도척)」, tells us to criticize the statutes and ethics of  Confucian, to give up hypocrisy and to live according to nature. The theme of 「Hojil」 also says that humans and nature should go for a peaceful and simple life. In other words, 「Hojil」 is a work that satirizes human desire and hypocrisy through the tiger, the symbol of nature. Yeonam had a critical mind on the hypocrisy and flattery of the Confucian scholars, human desire and brutality, and brought out the Taoist ideology to expose human falsehood.In 「Hesheonjeon」, we looked at the Taoist statues on the desert island. The island of Hezeun was a space that denied Confucian knowledge and courtesy systems. This was connected with the idea of ​​Tao that aims for ignorance and nothing. Also, the uninhabited island resembles Lao-tzu's small country-a small people and Chuang-tzu’s ‘Jidukjise(至德之世)’. Thus, virtue that Hesseng said was closer to the Taoism than to the Confucianism. The traces of the Taoist thought  in Yeonam's novels tell us how great the influence of Taoist thoughts on the intellectuals of the late Joseon Dynasty.

AB  - The 2015 Urban Extents from VIIRS and MODIS for the Continental U.S. Using Machine Learning Methods data set models urban settlements in the Continental United States (CONUS) as of 2015. When applied to the combination of daytime spectral and nighttime lights satellite data, the machine learning methods achieved high accuracy at an intermediate-resolution of 500 meters at large spatial scales. The input data for these models were two types of satellite imagery: Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Light (NTL) data from the Day/Night Band (DNB), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) corrected daytime Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Although several machine learning methods were evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Neural Network (NN), and the Ensemble of RF, GBM, and NN (ESB), the highest accuracy results were achieved with NN, and those results were used to delineate the urban extents in this data set.

AB  - This study has the purpose of promotion to social integration ​​by seeking a rational solution when cultural (religious) norms conflict with actual legal norms. The main factors that impede social integration in Korean society are regionalism, generational conflicts, and ideological confrontations. In the future, religious conflicts can be surfaced in Korea as well.In recent European Court judgments, the belief expression of an individual or a group has been appeared in a way that causes conflict with the social or public order. From the viewpoint of minority protection, it is appropriate to strongly protect the religious expression act as much as possible, but the social integration function through the harmonious interpretation of norms may be undermined if the existing order is forced to judge pro such protection before it matures to accommodate such content.In order for social integration to coexist in all, it is necessary to resolve these conflict points legally and present social standards. However, in order to make such judgments, there should be a sufficient understanding of the other's culture, and judgments based on such considerations will provide a basis for enabling the formation of consensus instead of conflict of cultural values ​​or worldview.When judging religious matters in a legal way, it is desirable that theological considerations be combined. For the social acceptance and limitations of religion, the establishment of legal standards through theological examination is a very important task in light of the sharing of information and the spread of universal standards due to the dramatic increase in the speed of mutual exchange between the countries. When the legal standards that have passed these theological considerations are established, it is predictable to distinguish among the freedom of religion, the freedom of general action, the freedom of expression. The examination of basic right can proceed more precisely.Considering the growth rate of multicultural households in Korea, if the public law scholars are interested in these fields and have accumulated their research results in advance, we can minimize the social confusion that Europe is experiencing recently.

AB  - Charles Taylor argues that individuals consider themselves as moral beings, and that they require a highest good or universal principle in order to act upon that morality. Building on this thesis, this paper examines Pak Ǔnsik’s loss of ethical direction and the implications of its consequence. Pak Ǔnsik was a marginal figure in the worldview of Sinocentrism(中華主義), and in order to highlight the significance of his loss of Sinocentrism as the universal principle, this paper compares him to Liang Qichao, a figure at the center of Sinocentrism.The first half of the paper discusses what it means for Pak and Liang to lose Sinocentrism as a universalism and the source of highest good. In the latter half, the paper argues that while Liang Qichao oscillated between nationalism and culturalism to maintain Sinocentrism even when it was not a universalism, Pak Ǔnsik was forced to search for a new universal principle due to his position as an outsider who could only join the order of Sinocentrism when it operated as a universalism.

AB  - The research was carried out in two installments. The second is the main paper analyzing writers' works, after publishing "Korean Modern Novels Through the Acceptance of East Asian Traditional Ideas and Evolutionary Theory: Focused on Lee In-jik and the prose of Yang Kun-shik and Lee Kwang-soo in the 1910s." Few writers have been as committed to the anti-Bongan spirit as Lee In-jik in the new novel era. These are the assessments that many commentators have come up with so far. In the period of the Patriotic Enlightenment (1905-19909), when Shin So-sul was born, Joseon was on the verge of collapse into a colony. Indeed, the wave of foreign powers and imperialism has already begun to break through the nation's walls. This is why we are curious about the fact that Lee In-jik's work had a miserable half-dozen pieces, but no anti-foreign and anti-imperialist works. For him, Ban Bong-gun's arrows were all concentrated on the ruling class of the time. This was indeed for the entire Joseon Dynasty. The arrow towards Joseon continued into the work and emerged as a desire to find a way to become a colonial empire. This is the reality of the half-dozen of the posts. This is not to create a new name that conforms to the real meaning, but to the Rhee In-jik, who established a "feeling" social evolution theory on the site, endorsed and followed the path of Japanese colonialism.Lee Hae-jo tried to build a new name by facing up to the realities of the day. This was not the unconditional destruction of existing names like Rhee In-jik, but rather a combination of social evolution and traditional names that made the era of the Lee Hae-jo era. Faced with the reality of the disintegration of the oil-based worldview, he attempted to recreate tradition and Western knowledge (scientific thinking) in the process, rediscovering "ethics" and "morality" and using it as a complement to prevent the gap between tradition and Western knowledge. The effort can be summed up as a vigorous self-interest, traditional ethics, and the practice of cultivation. Lee Hae-jo's works contain "vicious self" and "the desire to create a nation." The word "people" does not exist anywhere in the prose or work. If Rhee In-jik tried to separate the nation and individuals into a medium, Lee Hae-jo sought to harmonize the two. This enabled Lee Hae-jo's ideas to gain sight of both "liberal communalism" and "communal liberalism." The first place for Yang Kun-shik's literature was Buddhism. The fact that he was able to take a step back and take a critical stance on the modern "quarter point" when everyone was excited by the aspirations of evolution and progress can be attributed to the Buddhist spirit. Yang Geon-sik saw Buddhism itself as "great literature." He stressed, "Civilization should at least be the person who read the books of life after being considered a thinker." The reference to Buddhism itself as a great literature implies more than literary rhetoric. With this in mind, the meaning of both the two-faced prose and the work's "moment" is not a simple matter to interpret. Some view this as a contradiction between the principles of evolution and the principles of Buddhism for quite some time after Yang Geon-sik entered Buddhism, and view it as a conflict of ideas and real life, or "I" and "I," but it is necessary to reconsider that Yang Kun-sik was deeply skeptical about social evolution and modernity. Not directly addressing the contradictions between evolutionism and Buddhist thought, but to Yang Geon-sik, the modern era itself has already come to him as "moment" and "impaired" and aimed at "spiritual life" as a way to overcome it.Lee Kwang-soo's way of living at the same time as Yang Kun-shik was different. Unlike Yang Geon-sik, who had a meeting with modern times, Lee Kwang-soo was a "modern worshipper" who wanted to actively accept the private and material systems provided by modern times. The attitude of Lee Kwang-soo, who actively embraced the misleading theory of evolution, or social evolution, can be seen from the same line. Through his second study, Lee began to show completely different ideological coordinates than he did when he studied abroad in the first. From September 22, 1916 in Daegu to October 19, 1918, he published 12 articles in the novel Daily News, including "Unanimity" and "Inventurer," which was completed on October 19, 1918, which is deeply imbued with the social evolution theory that almost everyone is prepared for civilization and barbarism. During his second study, Lee Kwang-soo saw the world with his eyes based on the Japanese theory of social evolution. Lee's antipathy to the tradition was beyond imagination. It is a particularly distinctive point from a two-sided diet.Lee Kwang-soo's important period in literature, "The Wandering" in the 1910s, along with other short stories, "To My Little Friend" and "Yoon Kwang-ho," all came home from his first study in 1910, and quit his Osan School teaching career and Osan School, and went on to Shanghai, Samwi (Bladystock) and Ta-Beran in 1913-1918. It can be said that it contains some autobiographical elements. Through this period, Lee internalized the theory of social evolution and made it his philosophical foundation. Nevertheless, Lee Kwang-soo's inner work, which he saw through these works, showed signs of continuing wandering, turning a blind eye to existing beliefs, and a desperate impulse to commit suicide. This was also the result of following the path of Japanese up-and-coming and liberalism based on the theory of social evolution Lee Kwang-soo, who completely broke the tradition, was a mental old man who lost his way back to recovery.

AB  - By focusing on the years between 1895 and 1911 – namely, from the end of the Sino-Japanese War to the end of the Qing dynasty – this paper aims to challenge scholarly opinions that understand late Qing China as a period of transition from tradition to modernity or, more specifically, from a traditional tianxia and culturalist worldview to a Western-imported nationalist worldview. This study investigates the complicated relationship between traditional and modern ideas by looking closely at the worldview of Zhang Binglin, a representative anti-Manchu and pro-Han revolutionary, in comparison with that of Liang Qichao, a representative late Qing reformer. First, the paper examines Liang Qichao’s Western-influenced ideas and his view of the Qing dynasty to examine the ways in which his worldview was linked to the tianxia and culturalist worldview of Chinese tradition. Then, the paper considers Zhang Binglin’s tradition-oriented view of the Manchus and the West. By focusing in particular on his anti-Manchu political stance, his support for traditional Han Chinese values, and his way of coping with Western threats, the paper analyzes how Zhang Binglin’s worldview was connected to culturalism.

AB  - Where does the dance come from? Where does the dance of life come from? Is it an inner passion? Is it external training? Nietzsche said, in order to produce a dancing star, we must have chaos in ourselves.  The dance of life comes from the recognition of fate. Nietzsche said, amor fati  is my deepest inner nature. Nietzsche believed that it was his destiny to destroy the values that people believed to be true. He was overwhelmed by his fate. Nevertheless, he loved the fate and accepted the fate.  Those who have discovered their fate recognize how incidental events are linked to their destiny. This paper explores what Nietzsche's concept of amor fati is through Nietzsche's text, and through the film “Clouds of Sils Maria” I will show how the eternal return and amor fati are related. Thus, I want to show that Nietzsche's eternal recurring thought is not just a view of nature, but a worldview of those who accept the amor fati.

AB  - This paper identifies how “treasure,” the main motif in tales involving treasure, can be defined in terms of discourse. In addition, this paper analyzes the role of treasure in structuralizing the discourse meaning. We also examine how the basic consciousness and worldview of the discourse community, which has led the lives of people for many years, are combined with treasure and turned into stories. First, I confirm that the list of various semantic category systems extracted from the in-depth layers of the tales involving treasure can be a discourse of treasure if they relate to a value judgment. In the tales, the definitions of treasure are reinterpreted using various discourses or ideologies based on political, economic, social, and religious value judgments. These can be transformed and reproduced to create new meanings of treasure discourse. On the surface layer of the tales, I considered how a tentative semantic framework that might be associated with any discourse would form a consistent narrative structure. The tale is transformed into the manipulation of the subject in which the object intends to obtain its target value. Depending on the result of the manipulation and transformation between these subject-objects, the tale is divided into two story diagrams: the “targeted acquisition program” to obtain the value of the treasure and the “destination program” to lose the value of the treasure. A complex story diagram is then created to combine the basic schematics to prepare dramatically for the acquisition and loss of the treasure.

AB  - Recently, due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources and the regulation of CO2 emissions, attention and demand for solar power generation are increasing. The solar power generation has begun to be applied to small-scale power generation, and recently, large- scale power plants have been built and sold to utility companies or power demand has been supplied to cities. In addition, facilities for microgrid for energy self-reliance through renewable energy such as solar power, wind power, and tidal power are being constructed and studied in places where electricity supply is difficult, such as island or inland countryside. The solar power generation is advantageous in that it has no pollution, is easy to maintain, and has a long life. However, the power generation depends on the weather, the installation site is limited, and the initial investment cost and the power generation cost are high. Particularly, since it depends on the weather condition, the generation amount is very intermittent and it is difficult to adjust the power generation amount, and it is difficult to establish a power generation plan in advance. Therefore, high accuracy solar power generation forecasting is essential to reduce the uncertainty of solar power generation and to improve the economical efficiency of solar power generation. Existing solar power generation forecasting has been conducted to predict power generation using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and neural network. However, in this paper, we forecast the solar power generation using the meteorological satellite data from 2011 to 2017 and forecasting method using the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which is one of the deep running algorithms. And the feasibility of the proposed method was verified using the meteorological satellite data in 2018. For the forecasting program, we programmed using Python, which is specialized for deep running.

AB  - This study examines Iryon’s historical focus on the wondrous and strange to rethink its implications. By acknowleding the legendary as historical fact, Iryon’s mention of the “wondrous and strange” (神異, sini) in the foreword of “Record of Strange Happenings” in Memorabilia confers historical legitimacy to these wondrous and strange events.The previous literature on Iryon’s historical view has mainly discussed it from a historical or Buddhist perspective, but this study examines the Cho Sin and Tangun legends from a psychological and/or rite of passage structure, focusing on the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms’ worldview of the intersection of myth and history.Aside from the foreword and conclusion, this study is organized into four chapters, with the second chapter questions the implications of the “wondrous and strange” in national history. The third chapter analyzes Cho Sin’s dream and how it coincided with reality from the viewpoint of Jungian psychology. The fourth chapter analyzes Tangun’s birth as part of the joining of the heavenly and earthly realms as a rite of passage. The final fifth chapter discusses the content of the second to fourth chapters and examines the implications of the “wondrous and strange” at the intersection of history and myth.As History of the Three Kingdoms was a treatment of national history based on Confucian rationalism and ethics by Confucian scholars of the time, Iryon ineviatbly included the wondrous and strange in his history to compensate for this historical bias. This can be compared to how Jung understood the unconscious realm of dreams as a counterpoint to the ego’s conscious biases.Iryon historicized the irrational wondrous and strange in his national history, and the process of combining Cho Sin’s irrational dream with reality in Cho’s biography mixes the dual concepts of the wondrous and strange versus Confucianism, and dream versus reality, to create a new history in a rite of passage structure. This process of ‘creating new values’ is also demonstrated in the symbolic joining of dual opposites such as heaven and earth, or male and female, in the Tangun myth.The aforementioned process acts as an intersection of myth and history, where the wondrous and strange becomes a new impetus for advocating a new history. Thus the wondrous and strange is not a concept standing in opposition to rationality, but a device that overcomes the logic of rationality by joining with it.

AB  - At the center of artificial intelligence(AI) in the 4th industrial age, there is a singularity oriented point. Singularity is the point at which humans and robots become. This is the direction in which humans become mechanized and machines become members of human existence. 4D printing is said to be able to regenerate broken parts of a person’s body by introducing medical technology. This is expected to be a possible printing technology even for human organs. Singularity represents different visual differences according to perspective. The world view is divided into theism and materialism. If materialism thinks that machines are the same as human beings, then theism considers human beings to be machine and other discriminative beings. In other words, it acknowledges the existence of the soul, and man regards it as a spiritual being.Humans are different from animals. Man was created in the image of God. God breathed life into man. And God communicates with humans through it. Materialism does not acknowledge the existence of the soul, and considers that the human mind, reason, and human sin come only from the material of the brain. Thus, the materialistic worldview does not approach spiritually about human sin and salvation. But theistic worldview approaches spiritually the problem of human sin and salvation that the material world can not afford. Practical theology of the Christian faith focuses on the creation of God, the sin and corruption of man, the salvation through the cross of Jesus Christ, and the content of the Gospel of Jesus Christ coming again in the End.Practical theological thinking can give answers and hope to the confusion of human existence identity in singularity that mankind experiences. Human blood is the source of life. The human body with blood is with the soul. Blood’s own life is important to human beings. Blood is life. The life is special with a soul. But it is different from animal blood. By possessing souls with blood, humans become spiritual beings and gain the possibility to communicate with God. And the soul of the spiritual being is the answer to the question of the essential sin of the being, kerygma which contains the hope of Jesus Christ’s salvation, divine desire not to live in the absence of God, Through this, the soul can carry out the practical faith life of the Christian faith against or corresponding to singularity.

AB  - This article seeks to explore what a more fundamental approach Christian colleges and universities should take in order to fulfill their missional tasks. One cannot argue that Christian mission colleges and universities have accomplished their missions only by offering chapel classes and Christianity-introducing classes that are required of their students to take for credit. Christian colleges and universities should be enabled to evangelize their students and teach them Christian values and virtues, and eventually Christian worldviews through academic training. One of the ways they can achieve their missional responsibility is to open and teach a class that will clearly engrave Christian values and virtues on their students. They need to make sure that the prospective class deals with a subject that is relevant to every student whether or not he/she is a Christian. This article suggests that educating the importance of the integrity of creation is helpful for accomplishing the missional  tasks of Christian colleges and universities.The central thesis of this essay is that teaching “the integrity of creation” will strengthen the mission of Christian colleges as they strive to engrave Christian values and virtues on their students. To this end, the present essay proposes a green movement project for a Christian university as a means of fulfilling its dual task of achieving educational excellency and conserving Christian identity. Emerging as a global issue since the 1970s, the green movement has become a useful topic for the teaching of Christian worldview and value, because it offers a variety of resources for nurturing Christians’ royal and priestly responsibility for cultivating and keeping the Earth(Gen 1:26-28; 2:15). With this concern in mind, Section 2 of the present essay makes a brief survey of the history of the green movement, while Section 3 discusses what place the preservation of creation and the green movement occupies in the Christian faith. Section 4 argues that the preservation of creation and the green movement is a sort of Missio Dei for the entire creatures. Section 5 examines the Christian response to the ecological crisis, especially the WCC’s participations in the green movement. A survey of the history of WCC’s long involvement with the preservation of the integrity of creation will provide Christian colleges and universities with plentiful insights as they will try to design a class on preservation of the integrity of creation. Finally, section 6 presents a theological guideline for a Christian university’s participation in the green movement. Finally, the present essay proposes several practical guidelines for a Christian university’s participation in the green movement.

The text file, CMAQv5.3_Benchmark_2Week_Input.file.list.txt, provides a list of all of the files in the .tar.gz file. This Google Drive folder also contains a "2Day" version of this files which includes inputs for July 1-2, 2016. While the 2 week test case is recommended for testing and benchmarking, the "2Day" version is smaller and faster to download. CMAQv5.3.1 Inputs CMAQv5.3.1 comes with new input and output benchmark data for July 2016 over the Southeast US. The input datasets are identical to those released with v5.3 but additional files are now included in the .tar.gz files that will allow users to test the WRFv4.1.1-CMAQv5.3 coupled model on the Southeast benchmark domain. As a result, there is no need for users who have already downloaded the v5.3 Southeast benchmark input data to download the v5.3.1 files unless they are planning to run the coupled model. The Southeast benchmark output data for v5.3.1 is slightly different from what was released with v5.3 as described in the CMAQv5.3.1 Release Notes FAQ. CMAQv5.3.2 Inputs CMAQv5.3.2 comes with new input and output benchmark data for 2 days, July 1-2, 2016, over the Southeast US. The input datasets for these two days are identical to those released with v5.3.1 except for the addition of a grid mask file for the United States: GRIDMASK_STATES_12SE1.nc. As a result, there is no need for users who have already downloaded the v5.3.1 Southeast benchmark input data to download the v5.3.2 files unless they need the grid mask file for running the new ISAM test case or to test out emissions scaling with DESID. The Southeast benchmark output data for v5.3.2 is slightly different from what was released with v5.3 as described in the CMAQv5.3.2 Release Notes FAQ. CMAQv5.3.3 Inputs For CMAQv5.3.3 there is no new input benchmark data. Users can use the benchmark input released with v5.3.2 (or v5.3, or v5.3.1) for testing their CMAQv5.3.3 and CMAQv5.3.3-ISAM builds.

AB  - In Christian university chapels where Christian worldviews must be delivered indirectly, one way to approach the students–majority of them non-Christian- is through coaching. Sermons in Christian university chapels must take a different approach from those in regular churches. Instead of unilaterally declaring Christian doctrine, letting the listeners come to realizations on their own by way of narrative coaching using Christian symbols may be more effective. Narrative coaching does not overly focus on specific issues presented by the coachee. Rather, its aim is to support one’s identity transformation, change of perspective, and the existential search for the meaning of life. For the young adults searching for meaning and identity in a world of rampant uncertainties and accelerating competition, chapel sermons that take the narrative coaching approach may help cultivate a positive stance on life and give them a new sense of identity as they realize that they live in the universal divine grace. Sermons that take the narrative coaching approach can serve as turning points in the students’ search for meaning.

AB  - We test a method for calculating the colour of the sea, as measured on the traditional Forel-Ule (FU) scale, from satellite remote sensing measurements of reflectance. Forel-Ule colour scale numbers are calculated from 46 in situ radiometer profiles in the Mozambique channel and Irish Sea and compared to direct measurements of water colour made with the FU scale. There is generally good agreement (R-2 = 0.79, RMS difference = 2.7) between observed and calculated values over the range FU2 (blue)-FU18 (greenish brown). The method is applied to map the colour, on the FU scale, of the Irish Sea using 242 in situ radiometer measurements. MODIS satellite data is used to calculate the long-term (2003-2014) average and seasonal variation of sea colour. The colour of the Irish Sea, from both in situ and satellite radiometry, shows patterns which are consistent with the known distribution and seasonal variation of suspended particles. A Forel-Ule colour scale map of western European waters shows that the most coloured waters are found in north-west European seas which are coloured by suspended sedi-ments rather than phytoplankton blooms.

TI  - Perceived Changes in Ecosystem Services in the Panchase Mountain Ecological Region, Nepal
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) are increasingly recognized as a means to facilitate adaption to environmental change. However, the provisions of ES are likely to be impacted by changes in climate and/or changes in land use. In developing countries, where people are typically dependent on these services for their livelihoods, these impacts are of concern; however, very little is known about the changes in provisioning of ES over time. In this study, we assess the perceived changes on ES in the Panchase Mountain Ecological Region of western Nepal. The study area accommodates three distinct ecoregions, ranging from lowland to upland ecosystems and communities. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to collect information on how ES may have changed in the landscape over time. This approach was supported by transect walks, field observations, and secondary sources of information, such as climatic and remote sensing data. Perceived changes on ES in the study region include reduced availability of water, reduced food production, degradation of forest ecosystems, and changes in species compositions. These changes are thought to have impacted other ES, and, in turn, local livelihoods. Management actions that can help local communities foster ES are recommended.

TI  - Molecular characterization of an outbreak of enterovirus-associated meningitis in Mossel Bay, South Africa, December 2015-January 2016
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHuman enteroviruses (HEVs) are common causal agents of aseptic meningitis in young children. Laboratory and syndromic surveillance during December 2015 and January 2016 noted an unusually high number of paediatric aseptic meningitis cases at a hospital in Mossel Bay, Western Cape Province, South Africa. HEV was detected in clinical samples, prompting an outbreak investigation.MethodsEpidemiological investigations were conducted to ascertain possible linkage between cases. Amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR and VP1 regions was undertaken to determine the HEV serotype associated with the outbreak as well as other cases of aseptic meningitis in the area in the preceding 6weeks.ResultsOver the 2-month period, 63 CSF samples were available for testing. A total of 43 outbreak cases (68.3%) were observed, and the 26 (60.5%) that could be typed were coxsackie virus A9 (CVA9). Children attending three creche facilities were epidemiologically linked, accounting for 60.5% (26/43) of the CVA9 cases. The majority of patients were under 10years of age (55/63, 87.3%) and there was a male predominance (66%). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5'UTR and VP1 regions identified 2 lineages of CVA9 co-circulating during the outbreak, although the VP1 capsid protein sequence was identical as all nucleotide differences were synonymous. There was a unique isoleucine at position 64 and all outbreak viruses had a valine to threonine change in the hypervariable BC loop of VP1. Other HEV types circulating in the preceding period were echovirus 30 (n=4), echovirus 5 (n=3) and 1 each of echovirus 6, echovirus 9 and echovirus 15.ConclusionCVA9 was identified as the pathogen responsible for the large outbreak of aseptic meningitis, with 2 distinct co-circulating lineages.

TI  - Potential use of hyperspectral data to classify forest tree species
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRemote sensing techniques and data are becoming increasingly popular in forest management, e.g. for change detection and health condition analysis. Tree species recognition is a fundamental issue in taking forest inventories, especially in carbon budget modelling. Hyperspectral imagery provides an accurate classification results for large areas based on a relatively small amount of training data.ResultsA hyperspectral image of a forest stand in north-eastern Poland taken using an AISA (Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Application) Eagle camera was transformed to extract the most valuable spectral differences and was classified into seven tree types (birch, European beech, oak, hornbeam, European larch, Scots pine, and Norway spruce) using nine classification algorithms. The highest overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 90.3% and 0.9 respectively using three minimum noise fraction bands and maximum likelihood classifier.ConclusionsHyperspectral imaging of forests can be used to classify major forest tree species with a good degree of accuracy. It is time-efficient and user-friendly; however, the data and software required means that this approach is still expensive at present.

TI  - Primordial fluctuations of scale factor in closed Universe in Einstein-Cartan gravity
T2  - MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, described by the minisuperspace Lagrangian with the scale factor as a generalized coordinate. We show that the energy of a closed Universe is zero. We apply the uncertainty principle to this Lagrangian and propose that the quantum uncertainty of the scale factor causes the primordial fluctuations of the matter density. We use the dynamics of the early Universe in the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity with spin and torsion, which eliminates the big-bang singularity and replaces it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle production in highly curved spacetime generates a finite period of cosmic inflation that is consistent with the Planck satellite data. From the inflated primordial fluctuations we determine the magnitude of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, as a function of the numbers of the thermal degrees of freedom of elementary particles and the particle production coefficient which is the only unknown parameter.

TI  - Earlier Seasonal Onset of Intense Mesoscale Convective Systems in the Congo Basin Since 1999
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) produce some of the most intense rainfall on the planet, and their response to climate variability and change is rather uncertain. Under global warming, increased water vapor is expected to intensify the most extreme rain events and enhance flood frequency. However, MCS dynamics are also sensitive to other atmospheric variables, most notably, wind shear. Here we build on a recent study showing strong MCS intensification in the African Sahel, and examine evidence of similar trends elsewhere in tropical Africa. Using satellite data, we find a remarkable increase post-1999 in intense MCS frequency over the Congo Basin during the month of February. This earlier onset of the spring rainy season has been accompanied by strong increases in the February meridional temperature gradient and associated wind shear. This supports the hypothesis that contrasts in warming across the continent can drive important decadal-scale trends in storm intensity.Plain Language Summary Understanding how storms will change in a warming world is a major scientific challenge and one that has important impacts on society. Changes in the amount of atmospheric water vapor is considered to be the major driver for historical and future trends in intense storms. Here we examine how the intensity of storms over equatorial Africa has evolved since the early 1980s. Building on a previous landmark study over the semiarid Sahel region of North Africa, we identify that substantial storm intensification has taken place over the tropical forests of the Congo Basin, in February, marking the start of the first rainy season. The number of intense storms in that month has jumped by more than 100% since 1999, coinciding with a warming of 2 degrees C in the more arid parts of North-Eastern Africa. Episodes of high temperatures over Sudan change the winds and moisture over the Congo Basin, and these factors favor more explosive storms. This provides additional evidence that African storms are sensitive to changes in temperature gradients across the continent and not just atmospheric humidity. These gradients are expected to increase with climate change, likely raising the frequency of flood events.

TI  - Time-series approach for mapping mountain pine beetle infestation extent and severity in the US Central Rocky Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe mountain pine beetle (MPB) epidemics can degrade ecosystem services and socioeconomic assets. Mapping outbreak progression provides tools to mitigate damages and analyze MPB attack processes. Current time-series methods for mapping disturbance focus on extent rather than severity. Infestation severity, defined by within-pixel percentage, is more robust for answering a variety of ecologic questions. We develop a time-series regression approach to map infestation severity from 2005 to 2015 in the U.S. Central Rocky Mountains. Covariates include spectral data from all available dates of Landsat imagery, topographic data, and US Forest Service aerial detection survey (ADS) polygons. We collect model reference data by interpreting National Agricultural Imagery Program images. Validation against a randomly selected subset of the data results in no statistical difference between predicted and observed severity. The mean absolute deviation is 7.7% with a root-mean-square error of 9.9%. Average (maximum) severity increased from 9.4% (49.7%) in 2005 to 17.6% (58.8%) in 2015. Our raster maps identify widespread, lower severity infestation absent from the ADS. Our maps can improve mitigation efforts by allowing managers to: address low-severity infestations before they intensify, monitor intensifying infestations within previously identified outbreak extents, and combine infestation severity with other forest metrics.

TI  - Integrating camera imagery, crowdsourcing, and deep learning to improve high-frequency automated monitoring of snow at continental-to-global scales
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is important for local to global climate and surface hydrology, but spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the extent of snow cover make accurate, fine-scale mapping and monitoring of snow an enormous challenge. We took 184,453 daily near-surface images acquired by 133 automated cameras and processed them using crowdsourcing and deep learning to determine whether snow was present or absent in each image. We found that the crowdsourced data had an accuracy of 99.1% when compared with expert evaluation of the same imagery. We then used the image classification to train a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning, with accuracies of 92% to 98%, depending on the image set and training method. The majority of neural network errors were due to snow that was present not being detected. We used the results of the neural networks to validate the presence or absence of snow inferred from the MODIS satellite sensor and obtained similar results to those from other validation studies. This method of using automated sensors, crowdsourcing, and deep learning in combination produced an accurate high temporal dataset of snow presence across a continent. It holds broad potential for real-time large-scale acquisition and processing of ecological and environmental data in support of monitoring, management, and research objectives.

TI  - Mapping foliar <i>N</i> in miombo woodlands using sentinel-2 derived chlorophyll and structural indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote estimation of foliar nitrogen (N) is key in mapping and monitoring ecosystem health globally. Hyperspectral remote estimation of foliar N has mainly been via its relationship with chlorophyll content. However, the application of broadband remote sensing in foliar N estimation has been receiving increasing attention. The broadband estimation of N provides opportunities for landscape level estimation of N due to the wider spatial coverage. To this end, several studies have tested the potential applications of broadband sensors in estimating N. These were mainly focused on the near-infrared region. Our study was carried out in miombo woodlands, one of the most extensive woodland types in southern Africa. A bootstrapped random forest regression technique, in the R environment, was used for testing for significance in differences in accuracies of chlorophyll and structural indices when estimating foliar N. Our results showed a significant difference between the root mean square error of prediction obtained when chlorophyll indices (mean = 0.52%) and structural indices (mean = 0.57%) are used for predicting foliar N. We conclude that the chlorophyll indices predict foliar N significantly better than structural indices. This finding is significant in the estimation of foliar N at the landscape level.

TI  - Host-feeding patterns of <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes in Iran
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDifferent mosquito-borne pathogens are circulating in Iran including Sindbis virus, West Nile virus, filarioid worms and malaria parasites. However, the local transmission cycles of these pathogenic agents are poorly understood, especially because ecological data on vector species are scarce and there is limited knowledge about the host range; this understanding could help to direct species-specific vector control measurements or to prioritize research.MethodsIn the summers of 2015 and 2016, blood-fed mosquitoes were collected at 13 trapping sites on the coast of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran and at an additional trapping site in western Iran. Mosquitoes were generally collected with either a Biogents Sentinel trap or a Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey trap installed outside. A handheld aspirator was used at the trapping site in western Iran, in addition to a few samplings around the other trapping sites. On average, eight trapping periods were conducted per trapping site. The sources of blood meals were identified using a DNA barcoding approach targeting the cytochrome b or 16S rRNA gene fragment.ResultsThe source of blood meals for 580 blood-fed mosquito specimens of 20 different taxa were determined, resulting in the identification of 13 different host species (9 mammals including humans, 3 birds and 1 reptile), whereby no mixed blood meals were detected. Five mosquito species represented more than 85.8% of all collected blood-fed specimens: Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (305 specimens, 55.7% of all mosquito specimens), Cx. theileri (60, 10.9%), Cx. sitiens (51, 9.3%), Cx. perexiguus (29, 5.3%) and Anopheles superpictus (25, 4.6%). The most commonly detected hosts of the four most abundant mosquito species were humans (Homo sapiens; 224 mosquito specimens, 40.9% of all mosquito specimens), cattle (Bos taurus; 171, 31.2%) and ducks (Anas spp.; 75, 13.7%). These four mosquito species had similar host-feeding patterns. The only exceptions were a relatively high proportion of birds for Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens (23.2% of detected blood meal sources) and a high proportion of non-human mammals for Cx. theileri (73.4%). Trapping month, surrounding area, or trapping method had no statistically significant impact on the observed host-feeding patterns of Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens.ConclusionsDue to the diverse and overlapping host-feeding patterns, several mosquito species must be considered as potential enzootic and bridge vectors for diverse mosquito-borne pathogens in Iran. Most species can potentially transmit pathogens between mammals as well as between mammals and birds, which might be the result of a similar host selection or a high dependence on the host availability.

TI  - Estimating Regional Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Directly From Satellite Top-Of-Atmosphere Reflectance Using Deep Belief Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Almost all remote sensing atmospheric PM2.5 estimation methods need satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, which are often retrieved from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance via an atmospheric radiative transfer model. Then, is it possible to estimate ground-level PM2.5 directly from satellite TOA reflectance without a physical model? In this study, this challenging work was achieved based on a machine learning model. Specifically, we established the relationship between PM2.5, satellite TOA reflectance, observation angles, and meteorological factors in a deep learning architecture (denoted as Ref-PM modeling). This relationship was trained with station PM2.5 measurements, and then the PM2.5 values of those locations without stations could be retrieved. Taking the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration as a case study, the results demonstrate that, compared with AOD-PM modeling, the Ref-PM modeling obtains a competitive performance, with sample-based cross-validated R-2 and root-mean-square error values of 0.87 and 9.89g/m(3), respectively. Also, the TOA-reflectance-derived PM2.5 has a finer resolution and a larger spatial coverage than the AOD-derived PM2.5. This work provides an alternative technique to estimate ground-level PM2.5, and may have the potential to promote the application in atmospheric environmental monitoring.

TI  - Modeling wetland aboveground biomass in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve using machine learning algorithms and Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimation of wetland aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential aspect in evaluating the health and conservation of this valuable ecosystem. We combine AGB field measurements and remote sensing data to establish a suitable model for estimating wetland AGB in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve (PLNNR), which is included in the Ramsar Convention's List of Wetlands of International Importance. All field sampling points cover four dominant vegetation communities (Carex cinerascen, Phalaris arundinacea, Artemisia selengensis, and Miscanthus sacchariflorus) in the PLNNR. Wetland AGB is retrieved from the Landsat-8 OLI image. To improve the accuracy of wetland AGB estimation, we compare the performances of three machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression (SVR), with linear regression (LR) in estimating the AGB in the PLNNR. Results are as follows: (1) the RF model with a root-mean-square error of 0.25 kg m(-2) performs better than BPNN (0.29 kg m(-2)), SVR (0.27 kg m(-2)), and LR (0.31 kg m(-2)) in our testing dataset, and AGB density in the PLNNR is between 0 and 1.973 kg m(-2). (2) The four most important features for AGB modeling are near-infrared, short-wave infrared 1 band, enhanced vegetation index, and red band. Our study presents an effective and operational RF model that estimates wetland AGB from Landsat data, providing a scientific basis for floodplain wetland carbon accounting and possible future studies, such as the linkage between wetland AGB and the great water level fluctuations.

TI  - Mesoscale model compatible IRS-P6 AWiFS-derived land use/land cover of Indian region
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale models, in general, are run using the US Geological Survey (USGS) 25-category land use/ land cover (LU/LC) data available at different spatial resolutions. The USGS data over the Indian region suffers from two types of errors, viz. misclassification of LU/LC data and non-availability of up-to-date satellite-based LU/LC data. To improve the accuracy and capture interannual changes better, the LU/LC data generated by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) using IRS-P6 AWiFS with 56 m basic resolution have been scaled to 5, 2 min and 30 sec resolution which is available at yearly intervals. In the next step, the Indian region of USGS data was replaced with IRS-P6 AWiFS-derived data and made compatible to MM5 and WRF mesoscale models. Thus the resultant product is a global USGS LU/LC data with the Indian region replaced by the information originally derived from AWiFS 56 m resolution imagery, for the years 2004-05 to 2012-13 (nine cycles). This communication describes the required LU/LC data format for MM5 and WRF models and the methodology adopted for compatible product generation. In addition, accuracy of AWiFS-derived LU/LC data converted to 30 sec resolution has also been determined. The present effort will provide the necessary reference for the atmospheric modelling community to address the Indian satellite based model compatible LU/LC data product. These data products are currently available on Bhuvan, the NRSC/ISRO geospatial portal.

T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. Diagnosis ofaxillary lymph node involvement, frequently by axillary ultrasonography (AUS), is an important step in patients withprimary breast cancer, while the gold standard pathological examination is only applicable during surgery. Thus,we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of AUS in detection of lymph node involvement. Methods: A total of 56patients with primary breast cancer, who were candidate of mastectomy were included in this study. A single radiologistperformed pre-operative axillary sonography for all the patients and reported the results in a checklist. The resultswere then compared with intra-operative pathological results of lymph node dissection to evaluate the sensitivity,specificity, positive and negative predictive values of AUS in detection of the disease. Result: The results showed thatpre-operative AUS had a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 84.6%, positive predictive value of 82.6%, and negativepredictive value of 66.6%. Correlation between axillary lymph node characteristics revealed that the absence of fattyhilum, cortical thickness, and loss of ovality of the lymph nodes were the most specific factors in detection of lymphnodes involvement. Conclusion: AUS has a low sensitivity and cannot determine the presence of micro-metastasesand suspicious lymph nodes accurately in early stages of the disease, and it seems that defining new parameters mayhelp for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the axillary lymph node sonography. Apparently, pathologicalexamination remains the gold standard diagnostic method.

TI  - A semi-analyticalmodel for estimating total suspended matter in highly turbid waters
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is related to water quality. High TSM concentrations limit underwater light availability, thus affecting the primary productivity of aquatic ecosystems. Accurate estimation of TSM concentrations in various waters with remote sensing technology is particularly challenging, as the concentrations and optical properties vary greatly among different waters. In this research, a semi-analytical model was established for Hangzhou Bay and Lake Taihu for estimating TSM concentration. The model construction proceeded in two steps. 1) Two indices of the model were calculated by deriving absorption and backscattering coefficients of suspended matter (a(p)(lambda) and b(bp)(lambda) from the reflectance signal using a semi-analytical method. 2) The two indices were then weighted to derive TSM. The performance of the proposed model was tested using in situ reflectance and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data. The derived TSM based on in situ reflectance and GOCI images both corresponded well with the in situ TSM with low mean relative error (32%, 41%), root mean square error (20.1 mg/L, 43.1 mg/L), and normalized root mean square error (33%. 55%). The model was further used for the slightly turbid Xin'anjiang Reservoir to demonstrate its applicability to derive a(p)(lambda) and b(b)(p)(lambda) in other water types. The results indicated that the form R-rs(-1)(lambda(1)) - R-rs(-1)(lambda(2)) could minimize the effect of CDOM absorption in deriving a(p)(lambda) from the total absorption. The model exploited the different relationships between TSM concentration and multiband reflectance, thus improving the performance and application range in deriving TSM.

AB  - The tasks of artificial intelligence (AI) in tumor histopathology include image segmentation and classification. Currently, the specific contents including lymph node metastasis, pathological classification, grade and prognostic evaluation of malignant diseases, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer, have been studied by AI. Evaluation of sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer has been the most mature application of AI technology, whose level can be analogous to the excellent pathologists. In the future, with the close cooperation of pathologists and engineers, the research of AI will be focus on improving the technology of simple and repetitive clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis, such as the diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer from biopsy frozen section and the judgment of incisal margin. Ultimately, AI will help us to precisely diagnose the tumor.

TI  - Improvement of forest canopy height estimation model by combining Geoscience Laser Altimetry System full waveform and multispectral remote sensing data over sloping terrain
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology can provide accurate data for the vertical structure of a forest. Such data are fundamental for the study of aboveground biomass in the global carbon cycle. Most studies to date have used Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) waveforms and terrain parameters as raw data in creating forest canopy height estimation models. Whether other parameters can be introduced to improve the accuracy of these models remain to be studied. In this study, we introduce parameters for forest texture to augment the topographic index model. Texture parameters were combined with field observations of canopy height to increase the accuracy of canopy height estimates over sloping terrain in the Lushuihe Forest District, a typical forest in the Changbai Mountains, Jilin Province, China. The study area consists mainly of broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, and mixed forest. Fifty-five sample plots covering different terrain reliefs and forest types were selected. The study areas were divided into high and low relief areas (i.e., hills and plains) using four different terrain relief thresholds (5, 10, 15, and 20 m) to select the best partition value. The results showed that the most accurate estimate of canopy height was given by the improved model using a 20-m threshold. Compared with the baseline topographic index model, R-2 for leave-one-out cross-validation between the estimates given by the improved model and observed data increased from 0.777 to 0.952 and RMSE decreased from 2.90 to 1.35 m. The increased accuracy of canopy height estimates is due to the correction of GLAS waveform parameters by introducing texture parameters to incorporate changes in canopy structure because of forest aging and different forest types.

TI  - <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> Prevents <i>Clostridium difficile</i> Infection in a Mouse Model by Restoring Gut Barrier and Microbiome Regulation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clostridium difficile is currently the leading cause of nosocomial infection. Antibiotics remain the first-line therapy for C. difficile-associated diseases (CDAD), despite the risks of resistance promotion and further gut microbiota perturbation. Notably, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis was reported to be significantly decreased in CDAD patients. This study aimed to clarify the prophylactic effects of B. fragilis strain ZY-312 in a mouse model of C. difficile infection (CDI). The CDI mouse model was successfully created using C. difficile strain VPI 10463 spores, as confirmed by lethal diarrhea (12.5% survival rate), serious gut barrier disruption, and microbiota disruption. CDI model mice prophylactically treated with B. fragilis exhibited significantly higher survival rates (100% in low dosage group, 87.5% in high dosage group) and improved clinical manifestations. Histopathological analysis of colon and cecum tissue samples revealed an intact gut barrier with strong ZO-1 and Muc-2 expression. The bacterial diversity and relative abundance of gut microbiota were significantly improved. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila was positively correlated with B. fragilis treatment. In vitro experiments showed that B. fragilis inhibited C. difficile adherence, and attenuated the decrease in CDI-induced transepithelial electrical resistance, ZO-1 and MUC-2 loss, and apoptosis, suggesting that B. fragilis protected against CDI possibly by resisting pathogen colonization and improving gut barrier integrity and functions. In summary, B. fragilis exerted protective effects on a CDI mouse model by modulating gut microbiota and alleviating barrier destruction, thereby relieving epithelial stress and pathogenic colitis triggered by C. difficile. This study provides an alternative preventative measure for CDI and lays the foundations for further investigations of the relationships among opportunistic pathogens, commensal microbiota, and the gut barrier.

TI  - Integration of SAR Data Into Monitoring of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun Eruption, Iceland: Contribution of the Icelandic Volcanoes Supersite and the FutureVolc Projects
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report how data from satellite and aerial synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations were integrated into monitoring of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption in the Bargarbunga volcanic system, the largest effusive eruption in Iceland since the 178-384 Laki eruption. A lava field formed in one of the most remote areas in Iceland, after the propagation of a similar to 50 km-long dyke beneath the Vatnajokullice cap, where the Bargarbunga caldera is located. Due to the 6 month duration of the eruption, mainly in wintertime, daily monitoring was particularly challenging. During the eruption, the European volcanological project FutureVolc was ongoing, allowing collaboration of many European experts on volcano monitoring activities. Icelandic volcanoes are also a permanent Supersite within the Geohazard Supersites and Natural Laboratories (GSNL) initiative, with support from the Committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS) in the form of a large collection of SAR images. SAR data were acquired by Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellites and complemented by aerial SAR images. The large set of SAR satellite data significantly contributed to the daily monitoring during the unrest at Bargarbunga caldera, the Holuhraun eruption and the year following the eruption. Detection of surface changes using both SAR amplitude and phase information was conducted throughout the whole duration of the volcano-tectonic event, and in the following months, to quantify and track the evolution of volcanic processes at Holuhraun and geothermal activity at Bargarbunga volcano. Combination of SAR data with other data sets, e.g., satellite optical images and geodetic Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, was essential for the evaluation of the volcanic hazard in the whole area. International collaboration within the FutureVolc project formed the basis for successful analyses and interpretation of the large SAR data set. Information was provided at Scientific Advisory Board meetings of the Icelandic Civil Protection and used in decision-making, as well as for supporting field-deployment and air-based surveys.

TI  - Satellite-based estimate of the variability of warm cloud properties associated with aerosol and meteorological conditions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) is examined using 10 years of data from the MODIS/Terra (morning orbit) and MODIS/Aqua (afternoon orbit) satellites. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud properties retrieved from both sensors are used to explore in a statistical sense the morning-to-afternoon variation of cloud properties in conditions with low and high AOD, over both land and ocean. The results show that the interaction between aerosol particles and clouds is more complex and of greater uncertainty over land than over ocean. The variation in d(Cloud_X), defined as the mean change in cloud property Cloud_X between the morning and afternoon overpasses in high-AOD conditions minus that in low-AOD conditions, is different over land and ocean. This applies to cloud droplet effective radius (CDR), cloud fraction (CF) and cloud top pressure (CTP), but not to cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud liquid water path (CWP). Both COT and CWP increase over land and ocean after the time step, irrespective of the AOD. However, the initial AOD conditions can affect the amplitude of variation of COT and CWP. The effects of initial cloud fraction and meteorological conditions on the change in CF under lowand high-AOD conditions after the 3 h time step over land are also explored. Two cases are considered: (1) when the cloud cover increases and (2) when the cloud cover decreases. For both cases, we find that almost all values of d(CF) are positive, indicating that the variations of CF are larger in high AOD than that in low AOD after the 3 h time step. The results also show that a large increase in cloud fraction occurs when scenes experience large AOD and stronger upward motion of air parcels. Furthermore, the increase rate of cloud cover is larger for high AOD with increasing relative humidity (RH) when RH is larger than 20 %. We also find that a smaller increase in cloud fraction occurs when scenes experience larger AOD and larger initial cloud cover. Overall, the analysis of the diurnal variation of cloud properties provides a better understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction over land and ocean.

TI  - Remote sensing quantifies widespread abundance of permafrost region disturbances across the Arctic and Subarctic
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Local observations indicate that climate change and shifting disturbance regimes are causing permafrost degradation. However, the occurrence and distribution of permafrost region disturbances (PRDs) remain poorly resolved across the Arctic and Subarctic. Here we quantify the abundance and distribution of three primary PRDs using time-series analysis of 30-m resolution Landsat imagery from 1999 to 2014. Our dataset spans four continental-scale transects in North America and Eurasia, covering similar to 10% of the permafrost region. Lake area loss (-1.45%) dominated the study domain with enhanced losses occurring at the boundary between discontinuous and continuous permafrost regions. Fires were the most extensive PRD across boreal regions (6.59%), but in tundra regions (0.63%) limited to Alaska. Retrogressive thaw slumps were abundant but highly localized (< 10(-5)%). Our analysis synergizes the global-scale importance of PRDs. The findings highlight the need to include PRDs in next-generation land surface models to project the permafrost carbon feedback.

TI  - Estimation of sea ice parameters from sea ice model with assimilated ice concentration and SST
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-category numerical sea ice model CICE was used along with data assimilation to derive sea ice parameters in the region of Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea. The assimilation of ice concentration was performed using the data derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E and AMSR2). The model uses a mixed-layer slab ocean parameterization to compute the sea surface temperature (SST) and thereby to compute the freezing and melting potential of ice. The data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR-only optimum interpolation analysis) were used to assimilate SST. The modelled ice parameters including concentration, ice thickness, free-board and keel depth were compared with parameters estimated from remote-sensing data. The ice thickness estimated from the model was compared with the measurements derived from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity - Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis (SMOS-MIRAS). The model freeboard estimates were compared with the freeboard measurements derived from CryoSat2. The ice concentration, thickness and freeboard estimates from the model assimilated with both ice concentration and SST were found to be within the uncertainty in the observation except during March. The model-estimated draft was compared with the measurements from an upward-looking sonar (ULS) deployed in the Labrador Sea (near Makkovik Bank). The difference between modelled draft and ULS measurements estimated from the model was found to be within 10 cm. The keel depth measurements from the ULS instruments were compared to the estimates from the model to retrieve a relationship between the ridge height and keel depth.

TI  - Assessing SMAP Soil Moisture Scaling and Retrieval in the Carman (Canada) Study Site
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, NASA launched the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. Data from this satellite are being exploited to improve forecasting of extreme weather events and delivery of disaster response. International core validation sites (CVSs) have been contributing in situ soil moisture data to validate and calibrate SMAP soil moisture products. Overall the soil moisture retrieval errors have exceeded SMAP's mission requirement (errors below 0.04 m(3) m(-3)), with the exception of some sites of annual cropland as present at the Carman (Canada) CVS. In 2016, a SMAP validation experiment was conducted at the Canadian site in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB) in an attempt to understand the differences between the SMAP soil moisture retrievals and the permanent in situ network observations. The research presented here analyzed the performance of this network in representing soil moisture within a SMAP pixel and tested five upscaling approaches. Comparisons between the permanent network and SMAPVEX16-MB measurements (from temporary stations and field measures) confirmed agreement among these three sources of soil moisture measures. The SMAP soil moisture values were compared with in situ soil moisture upscaled from the four tested approaches as well as soil moisture estimated by the NOAH Land Surface Model (LSM). There were similar discrepancies when analyzing all methods (RMSE 0.072-0.074 m(3) m(-3) for the four upscaling methods; 0.076 m(3) m(-3) for the LSM approach), yielding no reduction in the soil moisture RMSE for this site. The SMAP team will continue to investigate other factors that may be contributing to errors above 0.04 m(3) m(-3) at these annually cropped CVSs.

TI  - Epidemic surveillance in a low resource setting: lessons from an evaluation of the Solomon Islands syndromic surveillance system, 2017
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSolomon Islands is one of the least developed countries in the world. Recognising that timely detection of outbreaks is needed to enable early and effective response to disease outbreaks, the Solomon Islands government introduced a simple syndromic surveillance system in 2011. We conducted the first evaluation of the system and the first exploration of a national experience within the broader multi-country Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System to determine if it is meeting its objectives and to identify opportunities for improvement.MethodsWe used a multi-method approach involving retrospective data collection and statistical analysis, modelling, qualitative research and observational methods.ResultsWe found that the system was well accepted, highly relied upon and designed to account for contextual limitations. We found the syndromic algorithm used to identify outbreaks was moderately sensitive, detecting 11.8% (IQR: 6.3-25.0%), 21.3% (IQR: 10.3-36.8%), 27.5% (IQR: 12.8-52.3%) and 40.5% (IQR: 13.5-65.7%) of outbreaks that caused small, moderate, large and very large increases in case presentations to health facilities, respectively. The false alert rate was 10.8% (IQR: 4.8-24.5%). Rural coverage of the system was poor. Limited workforce, surveillance resourcing and other upstream' health system factors constrained performance.ConclusionsThe system has made a significant contribution to public health security in Solomon Islands, but remains insufficiently sensitive to detect small-moderate sized outbreaks and hence should not be relied upon as a stand-alone surveillance strategy. Rather, the system should sit within a complementary suite of early warning surveillance activities including event-based, in-patient- and laboratory-based surveillance methods. Future investments need to find a balance between actions to address the technical and systems issues that constrain performance while maintaining simplicity and hence sustainability.

TI  - Analysis of particle size distribution and scattering characteristics of water cloud in condensation and coalescence growth
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Study of scattering characteristics of water cloud is of great significance for weather forecasting, meteorological disaster warning, weather modification and research of radiation transmission in the lower atmosphere. In this paper, particle size distribution and scattering characteristics of water cloud in condensation and coalescence growth are studied by numerical simulation. The particle size distribution model of water cloud in the condensation growth and coalescence growth are established respectively. The dynamic process of the particle size distribution of water cloud in the condensation growth, the coalescence growth and the condensation-coalescence combination growth are analyzed. Then the scattering characteristics of water cloud in the droplet growth are studied with the Mie theory. The results show that with the condensation growing the full width at half maximum of particle size distribution, the effective radius and mode radius of water cloud increase continuously. The effective radius increases in the coalescence growth process and there are multiple peaks in the particle size distribution in the coalescence growth anaphase. The average growth rate of the effective radius of cloud droplets is 8 nm/s in the condensation-coalescence combination growth. The extinction coefficient and scattering coefficient of water cloud increase linearly with time increasing during the condensation growth or the coalescence growth. In the condensation-coalescence combination growth, the extinction coefficient and scattering coefficient increase exponentially with time increasing except at a wavelength of 3.2 mm; the asymmetric factors at the wavelengths of 1.064, 2.2, 3.7, 12 and 22 mu m tend to be stable, while the asymmetric factor at the wavelength of 3.2 mm remains the same basically. Meanwhile, the lidar ratio at each of the wavelengths of 1.064 mu m and 2.2 mu m fluctuates near 20 sr, and that at the wavelength of 3.7 mu m fluctuates greatly. In the growth process of cloud droplet, the single scattering albedo of water cloud decreases gradually at each of the wavelengths of 1.064, 2.2 and 3.7 mu m, while it increases gradually at each of the wavelengths of 12, 22, 200 and 3.2 mm The absolute value of Angstrom exponent decreases gradually, which means that the wavelength-dependence of extinction coefficient decreases with cloud droplet growing. These research results reveal the change law of particle size distribution and the scattering characteristics of water cloud in condensation and coalescence growth. The results provide important reference for forecasting weather, studying earth-atmosphere radiation balance and correcting remote sensing data.

TI  - Strategy for assessment of disaster risk using typhoon hazards modeling based on chlorophyll-a content of seawater
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - With deterioration of the global climate situation, the frequency and uncertainty of typhoons are the major causes of their hazards in tropical coastal regions, both in terms of loss of life and economic damage. Heavy rainfall triggers massive landslides and devastating flash floods, which can entail tremendous damage. In typhoon-affected areas, the key issue is to estimate the disaster zone and to help ships avoid disaster areas in the sea. Existing studies on typhoon disasters are mainly based on the overall wind assessment or the route prediction of the typhoon, with less attention to the detailed impact in different regions along the route. We propose in this paper a new framework to assess regional disaster risk based on chlorophyll-a concentration inversion in seawater. To calculate the concentration of chlorophyll-a, we analyze Landsat-8 satellite images in typhoon weather and normal weather in the same area. The experiments on realistic samples show that our approach has major potential to improve safety via assessing the impact of a typhoon in different regions based on the level of chlorophyll-a concentration.

TI  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type II detection by Naive Bayes Classifier: An example of patient classification for a rare disease using electronic medical records from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying patients with rare diseases associated with common symptoms is challenging. Hunter syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis type II is a progressive rare disease caused by a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate 2-sulphatase. It is inherited in an X-linked manner resulting in males being significantly affected. Expression in females varies with the majority being unaffected although symptoms may emerge over time. We developed a Naive Bayes classification (NBC) algorithm utilizing the clinical diagnosis and symptoms of patients contained within their de-identified and unstructured electronic medical records (EMR) extracted by the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). To do so, we created a training dataset using published results in the scientific literature and from all MPS II symptoms and applied the training dataset and its independent features to compute the conditional posterior probabilities of having MPS II disease as a categorical dependent variable for 506497 male patients. The classifier identified 125 patients with the highest likelihood for having the disease and 18 features were selected to be necessary for forecasting. Next, a Recursive Backward Feature Elimination algorithm was employed, for optimal input features of the NBC model, using a k-fold Cross-Validation with 3 replicates. The accuracy of the final model was estimated by the Validation Set Approach technique and the bootstrap resampling. We also investigated that whether the NBC is as accurate as three other Bayesian networks. The Naive Bayes Classifier appears to be an efficient algorithm in assisting physicians with the diagnosis of Hunter syndrome allowing optimal patient management.

TI  - Estimating severity of influenza epidemics from severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in intensive care units
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWhile influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance is well-organized at primary care level in Europe, few data are available on more severe cases. With retrospective data from intensive care units (ICU) we aim to fill this current knowledge gap. Using multiple parameters proposed by the World Health Organization we estimate the burden of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the ICU and how this varies between influenza epidemics.MethodsWe analyzed weekly ICU admissions in the Netherlands (2007-2016) from the National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) quality registry (100% coverage of adult ICUs in 2016; population size 14 million) to calculate SARI incidence, SARI peak levels, ICU SARI mortality, SARI mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score, and the ICU SARI/ILI ratio. These parameters were calculated both yearly and per separate influenza epidemic (defined epidemic weeks). A SARI syndrome was defined as admission diagnosis being any of six pneumonia or pulmonary sepsis codes in the APACHE IV prognostic model. Influenza epidemic periods were retrieved from primary care sentinel influenza surveillance data.ResultsAnnually, an average of 13% of medical admissions to adult ICUs were for a SARI but varied widely between weeks (minimum 5% to maximum 25% per week). Admissions for bacterial pneumonia (59%) and pulmonary sepsis (25%) contributed most to ICU SARI. Between the eight different influenza epidemics under study, the value of each of the severity parameters varied. Per parameter the minimum and maximum of those eight values were as follows: ICU SARI incidence 558-2400 cumulated admissions nationwide, rate 0.40-1.71/10,000 inhabitants; average APACHE score 71-78; ICU SARI mortality 13-20%; ICU SARI/ILI ratio 8-17 cases per 1000 expected medically attended ILI in primary care); peak-incidence 101-188 ICU SARI admissions in highest-incidence week, rate 0.07-0.13/10,000 population).ConclusionsIn the ICU there is great variation between the yearly influenza epidemic periods in terms of different influenza severity parameters. The parameters also complement each other by reflecting different aspects of severity. Prospective syndromic ICU SARI surveillance, as proposed by the World Health Organization, thereby would provide insight into the severity of ongoing influenza epidemics, which differ from season to season.

TI  - "Sentinel lymph node imaging with sequential SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction - a pilot study"
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn current best practise, curatively intended treatment for oesophageal cancer usually consists of neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) or perioperative chemotherapy, and oesophagectomy. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) has the potential to identify patients without lymph node metastases and thus improve the staging accuracy and influence treatment. The impact of neoadjuvant treatment on the lymphatic drainage of oesophageal cancers and subsequently the SLNB procedure in this tumour type has previously not been well studied.PurposeTo evaluate changes in lymphatic drainage patterns of the tumour in patients with cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) using Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) hybrid SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy before and after nCRT.MethodsPatients with clinical stage T2-T3, any N-stage, M0 cancer of the oesophagus or GOJ underwent endoscopically guided peri-/intratumoral injection of radio-colloid followed by hybrid SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy prior to, and once again following, nCRT. SPECT/CT images were evaluated to number and location of SLNs and compared between the two examinations.ResultsTen patients were included in this pilot trial. SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy was performed in twenty procedures. The same Sentinel Lymph Node station before and after nCRT was observed in one single patient. In two patients, no SLN was detected before nCRT. In three patients no SLN was detected following nCRT. In four patients, the SLN stations were not the same station at baseline compared to follow-up examination.ConclusionsThe reproducibility SLN detection in patients with cancer of the oesophagus/GOJ following nCRT was very poor. nCRT appears to alter lymphatic drainage patterns and thus may affect detection of SLNs and potentially also the accuracy of an SLNB in these patients. On the basis of these initial results, we abort further patient recruitment in our institution.Trial registrationAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

TI  - Recent Advances in Data Logging for Intertidal Ecology
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Temperature is among the most ubiquitous determinants of organism growth, survival, and reproduction. Accurate recordings and predictions of how the temperatures of plants and animals vary in time and space are therefore critical to forecasting the likely impacts of global climate change. Intertidal zones have long served as a model ecosystem for examining the role of environmental stress on patterns of species distributions, and are emerging as models for understanding the ecological impacts of climate change. Intertidal environments are among the most physically demanding habitats on the planet, and excursions in body temperature of ectotherms can exceed 25 degrees C over the course of a few hours. It is now well-known that the body temperatures of intertidal organisms can deviate significantly from the temperature of the surrounding air and substrate due to the influence of solar radiation, and that their size, color, morphology, and material properties markedly influence their temperatures. While many intertidal organisms are slow moving or almost entirely sessile, for others, behavior can play a significant role in driving vulnerability to temperature extremes. We explore datalogging methods used in intertidal zones and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each. We show how measurements made in situ reveal patterns of thermal stress that otherwise would be undetectable using more remotely-sensed data. Additionally, we explore the idea that the relevant "grain size" of the physical environment, and thus the spatial scale that must be measured, is a function of (1) the size of the organism relative to local refugia; (2) an organism's ability to sense and to some degree predict near-term environmental conditions; and (3) an animal's movement speed and directionality toward refugia. Similarly, relevant temporal scales depend on the size, behavior, and physiological response of the organism. While miniaturization of dataloggers has significantly improved, several significant limitations still exist, many of which relate to difficulties in recording behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions. We discuss recent innovations in monitoring and modeling intertidal temperatures, and the important role that they have played in bridging ecological and physiological studies of ongoing impacts of climate change.

TI  - Effectiveness of HPV vaccination against high grade cervical lesions in Japan
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of HPV vaccine against HSIL+ (pathologically diagnosed CIN2+) in the first cohort in Japan was investigated in 22,743 women aged 20 to 29 years (parts of national cervical cancer screening program of FY [fiscal year] 2015, the Japan Cancer Society). Vaccinated women had a statistically significant 69% lower risk of HSIL+ as compared to the unvaccinated women; the crude relative risk estimate was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.11-0.83; p-value = 0.013) by normal approximation and 0.31 (95% Cl: 0.08-0.80; p-value = 0.009) by the exact Poisson regression. The effect of age was not significant (chisq = 7.7 (df = 9), p-value = 0.569) and the estimate of relative risk remained essentially intact after adjustment for age. This study brings scientific evidence on the effectiveness of HPV vaccine on development of cervical high grade lesions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sero-prevalence of rubella among pregnant women in India, 2017
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We conducted a sero-survey among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of six hospitals which also function as sentinel sites for CRS surveillance, to estimate the prevalence of IgG antibodies against rubella.Methods: We systematically sampled 1800 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics and tested their sera for IgG antibodies against rubella. We classified sera as seropositive (titre >= 10 IU/ml), sero-negative (titre <8 IU/ml) or indeterminate (titre 8-9.9 lU/mL) per manufacturer's instructions. In a sub-sample, we estimated the titers of IgG antibodies against rubella. IgG titer of >= 10 IU/mL was considered protective.Results: Of 1800 sera tested, 1502 (83.4%) were seropositive and 24 (1.3%) were indeterminate and 274 (15.2%) were sero-negative. Rubella sero-positivity did not differ by age group, educational status or place of residence. Three hundred and eighty three (87.8%) of the 436 sera had IgG concentrations >= 10 IU/mL.Conclusion: The results of the serosurvey indicate high levels of rubella sero-positivity in pregnant women. High sero-prevalence in the absence of routine childhood immunization indicates continued transmission of rubella virus in cities where sentinel sites are located. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - SENTINEL LYMPH NODE- A CAPTAIN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDSquamous cell carcinoma represents about 2-3% of all malignant neoplasms & 47% of those arising in Head & Neck area. Incidence of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma is increasing especially in young people. The status of lymph node involvement holds prime importance in the prognosis and therapy of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). The risk of neck metastasis depends on the site, size, grading and depth of infiltration of tumour. Neck dissection is the only surgical option for pathologic staging of neck in patients with OSCC. However, often a minimally invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy may be adequate. Sentinel Node biopsy is a novel useful technique alternative to neck dissection in the management of OSCC. Sentinel lymph node offers accurate staging with minimal morbidity. Selective excision, meticulous histopathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes play a very important role in preserving the surgical approach to a N0 carcinoma. Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node in staging and treatment of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma in a Tertiary cancer care center.MATERIALS & METHODSIn diagnosed cases of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, sentinel lymph node excision was done prior to planned radical neck dissection, to study its role in staging of OSCC. Localization of sentinel lymph nodes done by using methylene blue dye and their histopathological examination was done by following step serial sectioning to detect lymph nodal micro metastasis for appropriate staging and management.RESULTS20 cases with diagnosis of Well Differentiated Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma were taken for study. Number of sentinel lymph nodes varied from one to five. Out of 20 cases, sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 16 cases. In those 16 cases, 6 cases were positive for metastasis on routine histopathological evaluation. The remaining 10 cases which were negative for metastasis, were later subjected to step serial sectioning. After which 1 case turned out to be positive.CONCLUSIONCenters practicing sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma should have meticulous histopathological workup on the entire lymph node by using step serial sectioning and there by detect micro metastasis and isolated tumour cells if any, to avoid unnecessary radical neck dissection and postoperative morbidity associated with it.

TI  - Improved relative radiometric normalization method of remote sensing images for change detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative radiometric normalization (RRN) of remotely sensed images is often a pre-processing step during time series analysis and change detection. Conventional RRN methods may lessen the radiation difference of changed pixels in images during the RRN process, thus reducing the accuracy of change detection. To solve this problem, we propose a relative radiometric correction method based on wavelet transform and iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD). A wavelet transform is applied to separate high and low frequency components of both the target image and reference image. The high frequency components remain unprocessed to preserve high frequency information. We use the IR-MAD algorithm to normalize the low frequency component of the target image. A reverse wavelet transform reconstructs the radiometrically normalized image. We tested the proposed method with traditional histogram matching, mean variance, the original IR-MAD method, and a method combining wavelet transform and low-pass filtering, and change detection was conducted to evaluate the RRN quality. The experiments show that the proposed method can not only effectively eliminate the overall radiation difference between images but also enable higher accuracy of change detection. (C) The Authors.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents some results of the Black Sea ecosystem dynamics during about twenty years (1998-2016), based on numerical simulations with the assimilation of remote-sensing data. The 3D model of the lower trophic level marine ecosystem is a one-way, off-line coupled with circulation model. It describes processes in the layer from the sea surface to 200 m depth and includes 15 state variables. The ecosystem model assimilates the satellite measurements which are the maps of the surface chlorophyll concentration fields reconstructed based on the remote-sensing data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS, satellite OrbView) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, satellites Aqua and Terra) using the regional optical model of the Black Sea. The assimilation technique is based on optimal interpolation and nudging procedure. The results of the simulation were validated using the Black Sea Oceanographic Database, which contains the direct measurements of chlorophyll, nitrates, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in seawater. Comparison of the simulation data with measurements showed that the simulated fields satisfactorily reproduce seasonal variability and vertical distribution. In addition to in situ measurements, the obtained surface chlorophyll distributions were also compared with the satellite data. The simulation results allowed analysing the inter-annual and seasonal variability of the main parameters of the Black Sea pelagic ecosystem. Evolution of the plankton biomass in the upper 50 m layer shows a negative linear trend, which is followed by reduction of the nitrates content in this layer.

TI  - Niche modeling for the genus <i>Pogona</i> (Squamata: Agamidae) in Australia: predicting past (late Quaternary) and future (2070) areas of suitable habitat
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: As the climate warms, many species of reptiles are at risk of habitat loss and ultimately extinction. Locations of suitable habitat in the past, present, and future were modeled for several lizard species using MaxEnt, incorporating climatic variables related to temperature and precipitation. In this study, we predict where there is currently suitable habitat for the genus Pogona and potential shifts in habitat suitability in the past and future.Methods: Georeferenced occurrence records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, climate variables (describing temperature and precipitation) were obtained from WorldClim, and a vegetation index was obtained from AVHRR satellite data. Matching climate variables were downloaded for three different past time periods (mid-Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, and Last Interglacial) and two different future projections representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5). MaxEnt produced accuracy metrics, response curves, and probability surfaces. For each species, parameters were adjusted for the best possible output that was biologically informative.Results: Model results predicted that in the past, there was little suitable habitat for P. henrylawsoni and P. microlepidota within the areas of their current range. Past areas of suitable habitat for P. barbata were predicted to be similar to the current prediction. Pogona minor and P. nullarbor were predicted to have had a more expansive range of suitable habitat in the past, which has reduced over time. P. vitticeps was predicted to have less suitable habitat in the past when examining the region of their known occurrence; however, there was predicted growth in suitable habitat in Western Australia. Both 2070 models predict a similar distribution of habitat; however, the model produced using the 2070 RCP 8.5 climate change projection showed a larger change, both in areas of suitable habitat gain and loss. In the future, P. henrylawsoni and P. microlepidota might gain suitable habitat, while the other four species could possibly suffer habitat loss.Discussion: Based on the model results, P. henrylawsoni and P. microlepidota had minimal areas of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum, possibly due to changes in tolerance or data/model limitations, especially since genetic analyses for these species suggest a much earlier emergence. The predicted late Quaternary habitat results for all species of Pogona are conservative and should be compared to the fossil record which is not possible at the moment due to the current inability to identify fossil Pogona to the species level. P. nullarbor and P. vitticeps future models predict substantial habitat loss. P. nullarbor could potentially be considered vulnerable in the present since it already has a restricted range, and a conservation plan may need to be considered.

TI  - Machine learning-based retrieval of benthic reflectance and <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> seagrass extent using a semi-analytical inversion of Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the epoch of the human-induced climate change, seagrasses can mitigate the resulting negative impacts due to their carbon sequestration ability. The endemic and dominant in the Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica seagrass contains the largest stocks of organic carbon among all seagrass species, yet it undergoes a significant regression in its extent. Therefore, suitable quantitative assessment of its extent and optically shallow environment are required to allow good conservation and management practices. Here, we parameterise a semi-analytical inversion model which employs above-surface remote sensing reflectance of Sentinel-2A to derive water column and bottom properties in the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece (eastern Mediterranean). In the model, the diffuse attenuation coefficients are expressed as functions of absorption and backscattering coefficients. We apply a comprehensive pre-processing workflow which includes atmospheric correction using C2RCC (Case 2 Regional CoastColour) neural network, resampling of the lower spatial resolution Sentinel-2A bands to 10m/pixel, as well as empirical derivation of water bathymetry and machine learning-based classification of the resulting bottom properties using the Support Vector Machines. SVM-based classification of benthic reflectance reveals similar to 300 ha of P. oceanica seagrass between 2 and 16 m of depth, and yields very high producer and user accuracies of 95.3% and 99.5%, respectively. Sources of errors and uncertainties are discussed. All in all, recent advances in Earth Observation in terms of optical satellite technology, cloud computing and machine learning algorithms have created the perfect storm which could aid high spatio-temporal, large-scale seagrass habitat mapping and monitoring, allowing for its integration to the Analysis Ready Data era and ultimately enabling more efficient management and conservation in the epoch of climate change.

TI  - Characteristics of the polynya in the Vistula Lagoon of the Baltic Sea by remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of a polynya, a water opening in the ice field, that is attributed to a single inlet - the navigable Strait of Baltiysk of the Vistula Lagoon of the Baltic Sea - were studied by using satellite images received in 2011-2017. The polynya's average transversal and longitudinal dimensions were about 3 and 4 km respectively. Its area varied from 0.3 to 38 km(2) with an average of 11 km(2). The polynya area, in general, responded to a tendency of the 5-day average air temperature to increase or decrease and not to its more short-term variations. It was supposed that the marine water inflow in the lagoon determined the existence of the inlet polynya, but not a change of its size during the ice season. The polynya dynamics reflected the multiplicative effect of air temperature, marine water inflow and wind, and probably the surface waves coming from the sea through the lagoon inlet.

TI  - Validation of SOAR VIIRS Over-Water Aerosol Retrievals and Context Within the Global Satellite Aerosol Data Record
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study validates aerosol properties retrieved using a Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm applied to Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements, from Version 1 of the VIIRS Deep Blue data set. SOAR is the over-water complement to the over-land Deep Blue algorithm and has two processing paths: globally, 95% of pixels are processed with the full retrieval algorithm, while the 5% of pixels in shallow or turbid (mostly coastal) waters are processed with a backup algorithm. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data are used to validate and compare the midvisible (550nm) aerosol optical depth (AOD), angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), and fine mode fraction of AOD at 550nm (FMF). AOD uncertainty is shown to be approximately (0.03 + 10%) for the full and (0.03 + 15%) for the backup algorithms, with a small positive median bias around 0.02. When AOD is below about 0.2, the AE and FMF have small negative offsets from AERONET around -0.15 and -0.04, respectively. For higher AOD, AE is less offset and the magnitudes of differences versus AERONET are about 0.2 and 0.14, respectively. Aerosol-type classifications provided by SOAR are found to be reasonable, matching optical-based classifications from AERONET over 80% of the time. Spatial and temporal patterns of AOD and AE are also compared with those of other contemporary over-water satellite aerosol data sets; dependent on region, the satellite data sets show varying levels of consistency, with SOAR broadly in-family, and the largest discrepancies in regions with persistent heavy cloud cover.Plain Language Summary Aerosols are small particles in the atmosphere like desert dust, volcanic ash, smoke, industrial haze, and sea spray. Understanding them is important for applications such as hazard avoidance, air quality and human health, and climate studies. Satellite instruments provide an important tool to study aerosol loading over the world. However, individual satellites do not last forever and newer satellites often have improved capabilities compared to older ones. This paper evaluates an extension of an algorithm, originally designed to monitor aerosols from an older satellite instrument, to a new satellite instrument called Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite. The evaluation is performed by comparing to ground truth data which are part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's global Aerosol Robotic Network, as well as to other satellite-based aerosol data sets from different spaceborne instruments.

TI  - Assessment of satellite- and reanalysis-based evapotranspiration products with two blending approaches over the complex landscapes and climates of Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous evapotranspiration (ET) products with different spatio-temporal resolutions at continental and global scales have been developed by utilizing commonly available satellite imagery and ground-based observations. However, the developed ET products present large uncertainties that limit their operational hydro-meteorological applications, specifically in water limited regions where water consumption is competing. This study presents the uncertainties among four widely available ET (GLDAS, GLEAM, MOD16, and MERRA) products and then assesses the performance of two blending approaches (Maximize R and simple Taylor skill's score; STS)) for generating a fused ET product using combinations of the above ET datasets in a dry continent (Australia) during the period of 2005-2014. The accuracy for all four ET products compared with Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L) ET dataset demonstrated large uncertainties across seven different land cover classifications and four different climate zones, with a coefficient of correlation (R) ranging between 0.1-0.85. GLEAM and GLDAS showed better agreement (R similar to 0.8) over forest and cropland areas, respectively, while better performance of all products was noted in tropical regions compared with other climate zones in the region. Similarly, implementation of the two blending approaches to generate merged ET products revealed an overall higher contribution (> 25%) from GLEAM followed by the GLDAS, while that of MOD16 was lowest (< 20%) over various climatic zones as well as all of Australia. The accuracy assessment of the two merged ET products exhibited relatively better performance by reducing the Bias toward 0 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2-0.4 mm/8day with an index of agreement (IOA) > 0.8 compared with individual ET products under all climatic and land cover conditions. These statistical indicators explained the relatively large differences among the spatial distributions of fused ET and those of individual products. Among the two blending approaches, the STS method produced more reliable results compared to the accuracy of fused ET generated by the Maximize R method. This reason for this was the discrepancy in the number of datasets used to derive each merging method. The STS method allows combining all given datasets by providing their corresponding weights, whereas the Maximize R method employed the weights only based on the two best of the given products. Overall, the assessments made in the current study provide comprehensive insights on the quality and integration of four globally available ET products to benefit regional water users and the hydro-meteorological community on the basis of major landscape and climatic conditions over long time scales.

TI  - Modulation of mitochondrial functions by xenobiotic-induced microRNA: From environmental sentinel organisms to mammals
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Mitochondria play a crucial role in energetic metabolism, signaling pathways, and overall cell viability. They are in the first line in facing cellular energy requirements in stress conditions, such as in response to xenobiotic exposure. Recently, a novel regulatory key role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in important signaling pathways in mitochondria has been proposed. Consequently, alteration in miRNAs expression by xenobiotics could outcome into mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species overexpression, and liberation of apoptosis or necrosis activating proteins. The aim of this review is to show the highlights about mitochondria-associated miRNAs in cellular processes exposed to xenobiotic stress in different cell types involved in detoxification processes or sensitive to environmental hazards in marine sentinel organisms and mammals.

TI  - Impact of agricultural water-saving practices on regional evapotranspiration: The role of groundwater in sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid areas
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the water budget process and is characterized by complex spatiotemporal changes, especially in irrigated agricultural areas. The impact of various hydrological processes and human activities on ET is still a meaty theme to study and investigate. A typical agricultural irrigation district with shallow groundwater and arid climate conditions was selected as the case study area in this work. The impact of the supplied irrigation water, shallow groundwater, crop planting pattern, and weather conditions on regional ET was determined after the regional ET was estimated by a Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land (SEBAL) model with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroratiometer (MODIS) data. The results show that the regional ET in Hetao kept declining in the past 15 years. The positive correlation between the water input (water diversion and precipitation) and ET indicated that reduced water diversion controls the declining ET, also causing the drop of groundwater level. Due to capillary forces and root uptake, the shallow groundwater tended to move upward to support the crop water consumption because the soil suffered from a water deficit. Furthermore, we quantified the contribution of shallow groundwater to regional ET and found that the water supplied from shallow groundwater increased from 5% to 15% during the period of water-saving irrigation. However, the long-term decrease of irrigation water supply and groundwater level caused a soil water deficit over the crop growth period, and the variation of crop planting pattern reduced ET as well. Therefore, groundwater plays an important role in sustainable agricultural development in arid and semiarid areas and the contribution of shallow groundwater to regional water consumption cannot be neglected.

TI  - New neural network cloud mask algorithm based on radiative transfer simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection and screening constitute critically important first steps required to derive many satellite data products. Traditional threshold-based cloud mask algorithms require a complicated design process and fine tuning for each sensor, and they have difficulties over areas partially covered with snow/ice. Exploiting advances in machine learning techniques and radiative transfer modeling of coupled environmental systems, we have developed a new, threshold-free cloud mask algorithm based on a neural network classifier driven by extensive radiative transfer simulations. Statistical validation results obtained by using collocated CALIOP and MODIS data show that its performance is consistent over different ecosystems and significantly better than the MODIS Cloud Mask (MOD35 C6) during the winter seasons over snow-covered areas in the mid-latitudes. Simulations using a reduced number of satellite channels also show satisfactory results, indicating its flexibility to be configured for different sensors. Compared to threshold-based methods and previous machine -learning approaches, this new cloud mask (i) does not rely on thresholds, (ii) needs fewer satellite channels, (iii) has superior performance during winter seasons in mid-latitude areas, and (iv) can easily be applied to different sensors.

TI  - The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data set
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project is a NASA initiative aiming to produce a Virtual Constellation (VC) of surface reflectance (SR) data acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, respectively. The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 in MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km(2) and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015.The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCDO9CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 MT and Sentinel 2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.

TI  - Post-disturbance recovery of forest carbon in a temperate forest landscape under climate change
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances alter composition, structure, and functioning of forest ecosystems, and their legacies persist for decades to centuries. We investigated how temperate forest landscapes may recover their carbon (C) after severe wind and bark beetle disturbance, while being exposed to climate change. We used the forest landscape and disturbance model iLand to quantify (i) the recovery times of the total ecosystem C, (ii) the effect of climate change on C recovery, and (iii) the differential factors contributing to C recovery. We reconstructed a recent disturbance episode (2008-2016) based on Landsat satellite imagery, which affected 39% of the forest area in the 16,000 ha study landscape. We subsequently simulated forest recovery under a continuation of business-as usual management until 2100.Our results indicated that the recovery of the pre-disturbance C stocks (C payback time) was reached 17 years after the end of the disturbance episode. The C stocks of a theoretical undisturbed development trajectory were reached 30 years after the disturbance episode (C sequestration parity). Drier and warmer climates delayed simulated C recovery. Without the fertilizing effect of CO2, C payback times were delayed by 5-9 years, while C parity was not reached within the 21st century. Recovery was accelerated by an enhanced C uptake compared to undisturbed conditions (disturbance legacy sink effect) that persisted for 35 years after the disturbance episode.Future climate could have negative impacts on forest recovery and thus further amplify climate change through C loss from ecosystems, but the effect is strongly contingent on the magnitude and persistence of alleviating CO2 effects. Our modelling study highlights the need to consider both negative and positive effects of disturbance (i.e., C loss immediately after an event vs. enhanced C uptake of the recovering forest) in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of disturbance effects on the forest C cycle.

TI  - Changes in the landscape pattern of the La Mesa Watershed - The last ecological frontier of Metro Manila, Philippines
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The La Mesa Watershed (LMW) is considered as the 'lungs' and the last ecological frontier of the Philippines' National Capital Region, Metro Manila. It is among the many watersheds in the country that suffered from severe deforestation in the past. Nevertheless, over the past few decades, reforestation programs for the LMW have also been initiated. The spatiotemporal monitoring of landscape pattern (composition and configuration) is needed to inform policy and support forward-looking management planning toward landscape sustainability. However, the changes in the landscape pattern of the LMW, including the extent of forest cover loss and gain over the past decades, have not been quantified; hence, this study. We used remote sensing data (Landsat) to classify the land use/land cover of the LMW in 1988, 2002 and 2016. We subsequently used spatial metrics to quantify the changes in the landscape pattern of the watershed. We found that between 1988 and 2002, a period that largely preceded the start of the LMW's major rehabilitation (c. 1999), the watershed had a net forest cover loss of 259 ha. From 2002 to 2016, it had a net forest cover gain of 557 ha. The detected increase in forest cover was supported by the percent tree cover change analysis results based on MODIS data. The deforestation of the LMW resulted in landscape fragmentation as indicated by the decrease in the area of forest and mean forest patch size, and the increase in forest patch density, etc. Forest restoration activities have helped improve the watershed's landscape connectivity as signified by the increase in the area of forest and mean forest patch size, and the decrease in forest patch density, etc. The results also revealed that rapid urbanization has been a major factor driving landscape changes around the LMW, and this requires proactive, forward-looking management planning. Overall, the LMW's case presents some valuable learning experience and insights regarding public-private partnerships toward watershed and forest-related rehabilitation initiatives. On a national scale, the Philippine government has embarked on a massive national greening program. The findings of this study suggest that such efforts could lead to the enhancement of denuded forest areas, if done properly.

TI  - The impacts of land conversion and management measures on the grassland net primary productivity over the Loess Plateau, Northern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 1990s, the Chinese government began implementation of a series of national-scale restoration programs to combat environmental degradation. As one of most important arid and semiarid regions of China, the Loess Plateau has attracted attention related to the effectiveness of these initiatives. The present study analyzed land use and cover change (LUCC) of the grassland in the Loess Plateau and the consequent change in net primary productivity (NPP) based on a consecutive land use data derived from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative land cover maps and the CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model driven by MODIS-NDVI data. The contributions of climate variation and human activities (including land conversion and management measures) to these changes were also quantitatively differentiated. The results indicated that the area of the Loess Plateau grassland experienced a net increase of 0.43 x 10(4) km(2) over the study period. The total NPP of the Loess Plateau grassland increased by 11,325.13 Gg C.yr(-1), of which the human activities and climate variation were responsible for 78.45% and 21.55%, respectively. The land conversion reduced the grassland NPP by 308.60 Gg C.yr(-1), whereas management measures increased theNPP by 9197.97 Gg C.yr(-1) in the otherwise unmodified grassland. Overall, ecological restoration programs have effectively increased grassland NPP in the Loess Plateau. However, human activities played both positive and negative impacts in this process.

TI  - Migrant pool model of dispersal explains strong connectivity of <i>Avicennia officinalis</i> within Sundarban mangrove areas: Effect of fragmentation and replantation
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of mangrove trees to reproduce and disperse in highly dynamic tidal environments is reflected in the contemporary genetic diversity and structure of their populations. Resilience and establishment may occur through either local recruitment (propagule pool model) or over longer distances with mixed origins (migrant pool model), thereby affecting the connectivity between natural populations. Anthropogenic activities such as encroachment and fragmentation or from mitigating reforestation could cause strategy switches and thus the connectivity and genetic structure of populations. In this study, we considered Avicennia officinalis, a dominant component of the Sundarban mangrove forest in Bangladesh to estimate dispersal dynamics over various distances within estuaries. A total of 423 individuals of A. officinalis, distributed over thirteen sites in the Sundarbans were sampled at both large and fine-scaled spatial level, the latter for comparison of natural and dense with fragmented sites. Up to 62 alleles showed a comparable level of allele diversity and gene diversities at both juvenile and adult life stages, assuming overall high levels of outcrossing. Significant inbreeding levels and high kinship values were solely observed at a reforested A. officinalis site. Genetic variables revealed high levels of connectivity between sites at close vicinity, with only a weak structure over larger geographic distances, between natural core Sundarban and coastal edge populations. Kinship coefficients were mostly low though significant up to several kilometers along estuarine branches, thereby suggesting propagule dispersal beyond each site. A fine-scaled analysis of kinship levels estimated for fragmented and natural forest plots along both sides of a river revealed that fragmentation induced higher kinship levels over 25-50 m distance, whereas dense natural populations were composed of less related individuals at shortest distances. A. officinalis populations might stay resilient through a mixture of unrelated propagules, clearly adhering a migrant pool model in natural sites and propagule pool model in fragmented sites. A poor gene diversity of planted trees might jeopardize the sustainability of mangrove plantation practices. Furthermore, high levels of diversity and connectivity indicated that the core Sundarban populations are a relevant source of germplasm in afforestation programmes.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of optical and thermal information to quantify G(s) and ET in the frame of the Penman-Monteith model. We evaluated the three remote sensing data-based retrievals of daily G(s) and ET using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and eddy covariance measurements at three sites in the North China Plain. The G(s) models were established on the basis of (1) single vegetation index (VI), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), (2) temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), and (3) combination of VI and TVDI. The results demonstrated that the combination of NDVI and theoretical TVDI achieved the best accuracy of quantifying G(s) and ET. The single VI-based model also performed well. The empirical TVDI-based model failed to estimate G(s) and ET since there existed significant uncertainties in the calculation of the dry and wet edge. In contrast, the theoretical TVDI with an apparent seasonal pattern was of more value to acquire G(s) and ET due to its explicit physical mechanism. From this study, the combination of VI and TVDI, as well as single VI, were recommended to build alternative approaches to acquiring ET. These G(s) models highly rely on remote sensing data and thus show promising potential in regional-scale application.

TI  - Discharge estimation in high-mountain regions with improved methods using multisource remote sensing: A case study of the Upper Brahmaputra River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge is an important variable in the water cycle that is related to water supply, irrigation, and flood forecasting. However, gauging stations are extremely limited across most high-mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the Asia's water towers. Remote sensing, in combination with partial in situ discharge measurements, bridges the gap in monitoring river discharge over ungauged and poorly gauged basins. Of great importance for the successful retrieval of river discharge using remote sensing are river width (water surface area) and water level (water surface elevation), but it is challenging to retrieve accurate discharge values for high-mountain regions because of narrow river channels, complex terrain, and limited observations from a single satellite platform. Here, we used 1237 high-spatial-resolution images (Landsat series and Sentinel 1/2) to derive water surface areas with the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and satellite altimetry (Jason-2/3 and Satellite with Argos and AltiKa (SARAL/Altika)) to derive water levels for the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) in the TP where the river width is typically less than 400 m. Using three power function equations, discharge was estimated for cross-sections around the four gauging stations in the UBR with triangular cross-sections outperforming their trapezoidal counterparts. It was also found that the equation combining both river width and water level produced the best discharge estimates whereas the other two equations (requiring either river width or water level as the input data) were complementary and could be used to extend the time series of discharge estimates. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values for the discharge estimates range from 0.68 to 0.98 during the study period 2000-2017. The proposed method is feasible to estimate discharge in the UBR and potentially other high-mountain rivers globally.

TI  - Environment and anthropogenic impacts as main drivers of plant assemblages in forest mountain landscapes of Southern Patagonia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of natural areas generated multiple trade-offs, and changes in the plant assemblages was identified as one of the most critical ones. In this context, understanding the drivers of change of exotic plant diversity is critically important for biodiversity conservation and land planning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relationships between environmental gradients in mountain landscapes and anthropogenic impacts related to human uses as drivers for plant assemblages (native and exotic species) in Southern Patagonian forests. The study was located in the Andorra Valley basin (12,934 ha) in the southern Tierra del Fuego Island (Argentina), where mountain landscape units (land-cover and land-use) were identified according to their vegetation types (forests and open-lands), elevational effects ( < 400 and > 400 m.a.s.l.) and anthropogenic impacts derived from economic activities (harvesting and cattle grazing). Classification was based on Landsat 8 011 images with fieldwork samplings, relevating a total of 101 landscape units. In each unit, forest structure and floristic surveys (dicots, monocots, pteridophytas and bryophytes) were conducted. Data were evaluated using ANOVAs and multivariate analyses (cluster, detrended and canonical correspondence analysis). A total of 104 plant species were surveyed (88% natives and 12% exotics), where managed deciduous forests (Nothofagus pumilio) had the highest values of exotic species occurrence frequency (20%). Multivariate analyses showed that environmental gradients and anthropogenic impacts highly affected the distribution of exotic species. Native species had higher cover values at upper elevations, while exotic plants had a higher cover at lower elevations, where the N-S aspects were strongly correlated with plant preferences for shaded/lighted aspects. The occurrence of exotic species can be specifically related to human activities (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera and Rumex acetosella with cattle grazing; and Poa nemoralis, Ranunculus repent and Stellaria media with harvesting), however one of them (P. trivialis) was related with unharvested forests. We conclude that environmental gradients and anthropogenic impacts define the plant assemblages at landscape level, and they also influence the occurrence of the exotic species, where the main driver was the harvesting. We propose that land-sharing conservation strategy in these mountain landscapes could be the better approach towards sustainability ensuring the preservation of the land-cover and the land-use at the low and upper elevations.

TI  - Integrating cloud-based workflows in continental-scale cropland extent classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on cropland spatial distribution is required for global-scale assessments and agricultural land use policies. Cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide unprecedented opportunities for large-scale classifications of Landsat data. We developed a novel method to fuse pixel-based random forest classification of continental-scale Landsat data on GEE and an object-based segmentation approach known as recursive hierarchical segmentation (RHSeg). Using our fusion method, we produced a continental -scale cropland extent map for North America at 30 m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2010. The total cropland area for North America was estimated at 275.18 million hectares (Mha). The overall accuracies of the map are > 90% across the continent. This map also compares well with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data layer (CDL), Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) annual crop inventory (ACI), and the Mexican government agency Servicio de Informacion Agroalimentaria y Pesquera (SIAP)'s agricultural boundaries. Furthermore, our map compared well with sub-country statistics including state-wise and county-wise cropland statistics in regression models resulting in R-2 > 0.84. This key contribution paves the way for more detailed products such as crop intensity, crop type, and crop irrigation, and provides a method for creating high-resolution cropland extent maps for other countries where spatial information about croplands are not as prevalent.

TI  - Estimating canola phenology using synthetic aperture radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prolonged periods of wet soil conditions, when present during critical crop development stages, can significantly elevate the risk of some crop diseases. Wet soils in fields of flowering canola are a concern with respect to the development of sclerotinia as this pathogen feeds on the petals of the canola flower. As such, determining if canola is in bloom during periods of high moisture is important in deciding whether to take action to mitigate this disease. In this paper, RADARSAT-2 quad polarization and TerraSAR-X dual polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used with a novel dynamic filtering framework to estimate canola growth stages. In this process, a new crop growth stage indicator was developed and SAR polarimetric parameters sensitive to changes in phenology were identified. Model development used multi-year SAR satellite and field data for one site in Manitoba, Canada. The crop growth estimator was then tested on unseen data from three sites, one in each of Canada's Prairie provinces. This independent validation established that the growth estimator was able to accurately determine canola growth stage and date of flowering with high accuracy. Correlation coefficients (r-values) between observed and estimated phenology ranged from 0.91 to 0.96. Given that this method performed well on test data from other sites and years, this approach could be widely adopted for monitoring the development of canola over extended regions.

TI  - Temporal evolution of the magmatic system at Tungurahua Volcano, Ecuador, detected by geodetic observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the pathway and timescale of magma ascent can be responsible for variations in eruptive style during long-lived eruptions, but are only documented at a small number of well-instrumented systems. Here we integrate PS-InSAR from high resolution TerraSAR-X radar imagery with continuous GPS data from 4 sites at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador. Our results show long-term uplift between 2011 and 2014 associated with a continuously inflating prolate spheroid reservoir at a depth of similar to 10 km beneath the summit. Comparisons with eruptive flux, taking compressibility into account, suggest that during this time period slightly over half the magma supplied to the system was erupted. The observations span three distinct phases of eruption and in 2012-2013, an increase in eruptive activity was accompanied by uplift on the volcano's western flank. Similar episodes have previously been observed during large Vulcanian eruptions and we attribute them to intrusions into an area of mechanical weakness. A localised patch of subsidence mid-way up the Tungurahua's western flank is co-located with a swarm of shallow long-period seismicity and may represent a potential site for a development of a lateral vent. This study demonstrates that satellite geodetic techniques are capable of characterising the geodetic signature of transitions in eruptive style during long-lived andesitic eruptions even where deformation is low magnitude and measurements are challenging.

TI  - Large area cropland extent mapping with Landsat data and a generalized classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date cropland maps play an important role in the study of food security. Traditional mapping of croplands using medium resolution (10-100m) remote sensing imagery involving a "one-time, one-place" approach requires significant computing and labor resources. Although high mapping accuracies can be achieved using this approach, it is tedious and expensive to collect reference information to train the classifiers at each location and to apply over large areas, such as a continent. Moreover, large area cropland mapping presents additional challenges including a wide range of agricultural management practices, climatic conditions, and crop types. To overcome these challenges, here we report on a generalized image classifier to map cropland extent, which builds a classification model using training data from one location and time period, applied to other times and locations without the need for additional training data. The study was demonstrated across eight agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa using Landsat data acquired between 2009 and 2011. To reduce between-scene variability associated with image availability and cloud cover, input data were reduced to salient temporal statistics derived from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) combined with topographic variables. The generalized classifier was then tested across three levels of generalization: 1. individual - where training data were extracted from and applied to the same Landsat footprint; 2. AEZ where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints within an AEZ and applied to any other Landsat footprint in the same AEZ; and 3. regional where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints in the whole study area and applied to any other Landsat footprint inside the study area. Results showed that the generalized classifier is successful in identifying and mapping croplands with comparable success across all three levels of generalization with minimal cost: average loss in accuracy (as measured by overall accuracy) from the individual level (average overall accuracy of 80 +/- 5%) to regional level (average overall accuracy of 74 +/- 10%) is between 2 and 10% depending on the location. Results also show that generalization is not sensitive to the choice of the classification algorithm the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model performs equally well compared to many popular machine learning algorithms found in the literature. This work suggests the generalization/signature extension framework has a great potential for rapid identification and mapping of croplands with reasonable accuracies over large areas using only easily computed vegetation indices with very little user input and ground information requirement.

TI  - SMAP soil moisture improves global evapotranspiration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understand water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth system. Satellite-driven ET models provide global estimates, but many of the ET algorithms have been designed independently of soil moisture observations. As water for ET is sourced from the soil, incorporating soil moisture into global remote sensing algorithms of ET should, in theory, improve performance, especially in water-limited regions. This paper presents an update to the widely-used Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET algorithm to incorporate spatially explicit daily surface soil moisture control on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration. The updated algorithm is evaluated using 14 AmeriFlux eddy covariance towers co-located with COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) soil moisture observations. The new PT-JPL(SM) model shows reduced errors and increased explanation of variance, with the greatest improvements in water-limited regions. Soil moisture incorporation into soil evaporation improves ET estimates by reducing bias and RMSE by 29.9% and 22.7% respectively, while soil moisture incorporation into transpiration improves ET estimates by reducing bias by 30.2%, RMSE by 16.9%. We apply the algorithm globally using soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP). These new global estimates of ET show reduced error at finer spatial resolutions and provide a rich dataset to evaluate land surface and climate models, vegetation response to changes in water availability and environmental conditions, and anthropogenic perturbations to the water cycle.

TI  - Very-low altitude parasitic radar distributed on small satellites
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an original approach for a radar-based distributed system. The novel mission concept foresees a formation of very low altitude parasitic small satellites capturing the signal transmitted by existing LEO SARs in C and X bands. Both orbital analysis and radar performance estimation are performed. In order to increase the number of potential illuminators and achieve limited lifetimes, the receiver is supposed to be in a very LEO (altitudes between 300 and 350 km), below the transmitters that generally orbit around 500-800 km. The analysis of the orbital elements reveals that the loss of the initial configuration is mostly due to variations of RAAN. A reference scenario is thus considered with COSMO-SkyMed as transmitter and a small satellite as receiver. The latter is the reference unit of the receiving cluster that forms the sparse passive antenna. Simulation results show the initial patterns are lost in a few days unless some design strategies are used to preserve the desired acquisition geometry over long times. Furthermore, the analysis focuses on the piece of relative trajectory with the receiver in the proximity of the transmitter when the signal acquisition becomes possible. The impact of acquisition geometry on imaging performance is evaluated and spatial resolutions of 6 m (along the range) and 14 m (along the azimuth) are estimated as the best achievable values. The coverage potential of the radar is then computed in terms of areas acquired with good imaging capabilities, strongly limited to guarantee a near-rectangular shape of the pixels. Finally, power considerations as a function of receiving antenna area are carried out. Results show that good SNR value are achieved by a total antenna area of 10 m(2), which can be usefully split over a ten of platforms. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring and validating spatially and temporally continuous daily evaporation and transpiration at river basin scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational estimation of spatio-temporal continuously daily evapotranspiration (ET), and the components evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), at river basin scale is very useful for developing sustainable water resource strategies, particularly in regions of limited water supplies. In this study, multi-year all-weather daily ET, E and T were estimated using MODIS-based (Dual Temperature Difference) DTD model under different land covers in the Heihe river basin in China, with a total area of approximately 143 x 10(3) km(2). The remotely sensed ET was validated using ground measurements from large aperture scintillometer systems, with a source area of several kilometers, over grassland, cropland and riparian shrub-forest land cover. The results showed that the remotely sensed ET produced mean absolute percent differences (MAPD) of around 20% with the ground measurements during the growing season under clear sky conditions, but the model performance deteriorated for cloudy days. However, the daily ET product gave reasonable estimates for croplands with an MAPD value of about 20% and the estimates of T/ET and E/ET in good agreement with ground measurements. The DTD model also significantly outperformed other remote sensing-based models being applied globally. Based on these results the DTD model is considered reliable for monitoring crop water use and stress and to develop efficient irrigation strategies.

TI  - Characterizing 32 years of shrub cover dynamics in southern Portugal using annual Landsat composites and machine learning regression modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat archive presents a unique source for mapping and monitoring of shrublands. Still, efficient and accurate mapping approaches are needed that provide shrub cover fraction estimates over space and time. The spectral signal of shrubs is composed of green vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation as well as varying fractions of soil, grass, and shadow, which makes a direct mapping of fraction cover challenging. In this study, we mapped 32 years of shrub cover fractions from annual Landsat best observation composites covering a rockrose (genus Cistus) ecosystem in the Baixo Alentejo region of southern Portugal. Fraction mapping was based on a multi-year support vector regression model trained with synthetically mixed data from a multi-annual image spectral library. Resulting fractions maps were validated using reference information derived from high-resolution satellite imagery available for 10 out of 32 years. Fraction maps reproduced the spatial-temporal patterns of shrub cover in the study region very well, with an average mean absolute error over all validation years of 13.7%. For individual validation years, mean absolute errors ranged from 7.7% to 17.1%. Our consistent modeling framework led to a reliable annual shrub cover fraction time-series, which allowed identifying areas of stable shrub cover and areas with different types and intensities of change. Such long-term shrub cover fraction monitoring is of great value for land use assessments and contributes to a thorough understanding and management of Earth's arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

TI  - Developing and applying a multi-purpose land cover validation dataset for Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of global land cover products has accelerated significantly over the past decade thanks to the availability of higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data and increased computation capabilities. The quality of these products should be assessed according to internationally promoted requirements e.g., by the Committee on Earth Observation Systems-Working Group on Calibration and Validation (CEOS-WGCV) and updated accuracy should be provided with new releases (Stage-4 validation). Providing updated accuracies for the yearly maps would require considerable effort for collecting validation datasets. To save time and effort on data collection, validation datasets should be designed to suit multiple map assessments and should be easily adjustable for a timely validation of new releases of land cover products. This study introduces a validation dataset aimed to facilitate multi-purpose assessments and its applicability is demonstrated in three different assessments focusing on validating discrete and fractional land cover maps, map comparison and user-oriented map assessments. The validation dataset is generated primarily to validate the newly released 100 m spatial resolution land cover product from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS-LC100). The validation dataset includes 3617 sample sites in Africa based on stratified sampling. Each site corresponds to an area of 100 m x 100 m. Within site, reference land cover information was collected at 100 subpixels of 10 m x 10 m allowing the land cover information to be suitable for different resolution and legends. Firstly, using this dataset, we validated both the discrete and fractional land cover layers of the CGLS-LC100 product. The CGLS-LC100 discrete map was found to have an overall accuracy of 74.6 +/- 2.1% (at 95% confidence level) for the African continent. Fraction cover products were found to have mean absolute errors of 9.3, 8.8, 16.2, and 6.5% for trees, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation and bare ground, respectively. Secondly, for user-oriented map assessment, we assessed the accuracy of the CGLS-LC100 map from four user groups' perspectives (forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and climate modelling). Overall accuracies for these perspectives vary between 73.7% +/- 2.1% and 93.5% +/- 0.9%, depending on the land cover classes of interest. Thirdly, for map comparison, we assessed the accuracy of the Globeland30-2010 map at 30 m spatial resolution. Using the subpixel level validation data, we derived 15,252 sample pixels at 30 m spatial resolution. Based on these sample pixels, the overall accuracy of the Globeland30-2010 map was found to be 66.6 +/- 2.4% for Africa. The three assessments exemplify the applicability of multi-purpose validation datasets which are recommended to increase map validation efficiency and consistency. Assessments of subsequent yearly maps can be conducted by augmenting or updating the dataset with sample sites in identified change areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - We present a direct broadcast (DB) rapid response burned area mapping algorithm for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data that combines products driven by the spectral signal of fire-affected areas from both emissive and reflective spectral bands. The algorithm processes VIIRS infrared M-bands (750 m) using spectral ratios of the top of atmosphere reflectance from a single satellite scene to identify pixels exhibiting surface properties consistent with burn scars. Next, this collection of candidate burn scar pixels is screened using a contextual filter based on VIIRS I-band (375 m) active fire detections (AFD) which removes erroneously classified pixels and provides burn scar detections (BSD). The AFD and BSD are then resampled to a 375 m grid and reported jointly as VIIRS burned area (VBA). The accuracy of the VBA was assessed for 390 wildfires (11-114,500 ha in size) in the western United States. The spatial accuracy was assessed by comparison with a validation dataset of Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) burned area and incident fire perimeter polygons. The VBA temporal accuracy was evaluated using a time series of daily fire perimeter polygons derived from high resolution airborne infrared imagery. The algorithm's burned area mapping accuracy is 59%. The algorithm detected 60% of burned area on the initial day of burning and 73% within 24 h.

TI  - Effect of biomass burning on black carbon (BC) in South Asia and Tibetan Plateau: The analysis of WRF-Chem modeling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this study is to evaluate the impact of biomass burning (BB) from South Asia and Southeast Asia on the glaciers over the Tibetan Plateau. The seasonality and long-termtrend of biomass fires measured by Terra and Aqua satellite data from 2010 to 2016 are used in this study. The analysis shows that the biomass burnings were widely dispersed in the continental of Indian and Southeast Asia and existed a strong seasonal variation. The biomass burnings in winter (January) were relatively weak and scattered and were significantly enhanced in spring (April). The highest biomass burnings located in two regions. One was along the foothill of Himalayas, where is a dense population area, and the second located in Southeast Asia. Because these two high biomass burning regions are close to the Tibetan Plateau, they could have important effects on the BC deposition over the glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau. In order to study the effect of BB emissions on the deposition over the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau, a regional chemical model (WRF-Chem; Weather Research and Forecasting Chemical model) was applied to simulate the BC distributions and the transport from BB emission regions to the glaciers in Tibetan Plateau. The result shows that in winter (January), due to the relatively weak BB emissions, the effect of BB emissions on BC concentrations was not significant. The BC concentrations resulted from BB emissions ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 mu g/m(3), with high concentrations distributed along the foothill of Himalayas and the southeastern Asia region. Due to the relative low BC concentrations, there was insignificant effect of BB emissions on the deposition over the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau in winter. However, the BB emissionswere highest in spring (April), producing high BC concentrations. For example, along the Himalayas Mountain and in the southeastern Asia region, The BC concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 6.0 mu g/m(3). In addition to the high BC concentrations, there were also west and south prevailing winds in these regions. As a result, the BC particles were transported to the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau, causing significant deposition of BC particles on the snow surface of the glaciers. This study suggests that the biomass burning emissions have important effects on the BC deposition over the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau, and the contaminations of glaciers could have significant impact on the melting of snow in the Tibetan Plateau, causing some severe environmental problems, such as the water resources.

TI  - Trends in evapotranspiration and their responses to climate change and vegetation greening over the upper reaches of the Yellow River Basin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study comprehensively analyzed long-term (1960-2014) variations of potential and actual evapotranspiration (ET) and quantified their inter-annual and seasonal sensitivity and attribution to climate and vegetation growth changes in the upper reaches of the Yellow River Basin (UYRB). Satellite-derived vegetation greenness and in situ measured hydrometeorological datasets were used. Average annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) showed significant decreasing trend (p < 0.05) by 0.32 mm year(-1) over the past 55 years. Results obtained from recovered stationary series and sensitivity analyses showed that reduction of wind speed was the major driving force for decreasing trends in annual and seasonal ET0. Water budget-derived actual evapotranspiration (ETa) increased dramatically during the study period, whereas potential evapotranspiration (ETp) calculated from Penman equation and pan evaporation (ETpan) decreased significantly, suggesting the existence of evaporation paradox over the UYRB. ETa and ETp or ETpan exhibited complementary behavior, while the complementary relationship was asymmetric. During the period 1982-2014, vegetation greening occurred in most areas (65.6%) of the UYRB and was mediated by elevation. Interestingly, non-uniform climate warming imposed opposite impacts on vegetation growth, namely inter-annual and seasonal NDVI was stimulated by daytime temperature but suppressed by nighttime temperature. Furthermore, the positive impacts imposed by daytime temperature on NDVI was much larger in spring than in autumn and summer. Large-scale coherent vegetation greening would be the primary factor affecting inter-annual ETa in comparison with climate factors. These results help in deep understanding the hydrological response to climate change in cold mountain regions.

TI  - Contribution of leaf specular reflection to canopy reflectance under black soil case using stochastic radiative transfer model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous canopy radiative transfer models have been proposed based on the assumption of "ideal bi-Lambertian leaves" with the aim of simplifying the interactions between photons and vegetation canopies. This assumption may cause discrepancy between the simulated and measured canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Few studies have been devoted to evaluate the impacts of such assumption on simulation of canopy BRF at a high-to-medium spatial resolution (similar to 30 m). This paper focuses on quantifying the contribution of leaf specular reflection on the estimation of canopy BRF under a black soil case using one of the most efficient radiative transfer models, the stochastic radiative transfer model. Analyses of field and satellite data collected over the boreal Hyytiala forest in Finland show that leaf specular reflection may lead to errors of up to 33.1% at 550 nm and 32.8% at 650 nm in terms of relative root mean square error. The results suggest that, in order to minimize these errors, leaf specular reflection should be accounted for in modeling BRF.

TI  - Urban surface water body detection with suppressed built-up noise based on water indices from Sentinel-2 MSI imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water spectral indices can enhance the difference between water bodies and background features. Thus, they have been widely used to extract and map surface water bodies based on multispectral satellite imagery. The urban scene is very heterogeneous since the surface is composed of a vast diversity of man-made objects, often of mixed distribution. Urban surface water mapping faces an extreme overestimation phenomenon because certain types of objects such as shadow, dark roads and some artificial features may return similar values to water bodies after an index computation. This study proposes a noise-prediction strategy to eliminate such misclassified nonwater areas in an automated way. Constrained energy minimization (CEM), a typical sparse target detection algorithm that does not need any background information, is utilized to draw the possible distribution of noise based on prior noise samples. The initial noise samples are automatically extracted by calculating the difference between two water indices widely accepted in urban scenes, namely, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and the automated water extraction index (AWEI). Recently freely available Sentinel-2 multi spectral satellite imagery, with high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) and high repeated global coverage (every 5 days), was adopted, considering its potential on urban land cover mapping. Compared with the AWEI based approach, the results show that the proposed noise-prediction approach obtained an improved overall accuracy (increased Kappa coefficient by 0.07 on average), dramatically enhanced user accuracy (by 12.47% on average) with reduced noise, and simultaneously slightly decreased producer accuracy (by -1.19% on average). That is, the proposed method possesses an improvement of the misclassification of nonwater bodies to water bodies and a suppression of the missing of water body extraction at the same time. Finally, the comparative results, with the varying water index segmentation thresholds (-0.2 to 0.3) and an automatic Otsu threshold, indicate the robustness to the threshold of the proposed approach.

TI  - Prediction of drought-induced reduction of agricultural productivity in Chile from MODIS, rainfall estimates, and climate oscillation indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000-2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a 17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times. The mean R-cv(2) values for OLR were 0.95, 0.83, 0.68, 0.56, 0.46 and 0.37, against 0.96, 0.84, 0.65, 0.54, 0.46 and 0.38 for DL, for one, two, three, four, five, and six months lead time, respectively. Given the wide range of climates and vegetation types covered within the study area, we expect that the presented models can contribute to an improved early warning system for agricultural drought in different geographical settings around the globe.

TI  - Sources of uncertainty in gross primary productivity simulated by light use efficiency models: Model structure, parameters, input data, and spatial resolution
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) is essential for understanding ecosystem function and global carbon cycling. However, there is still substantial uncertainty in the magnitude, spatial distribution, and temporal dynamics of GPP. Using light use efficiency (LUE) models, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty in GPP estimation resulting from various sources: model structure, model parameters, input data, and spatial resolution. We first evaluated the influences of model structures, namely the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), water scalar (W-S), and temperature scalar (T-S), on site-level GPP estimates. We then used the Sobol' sensitivity analysis to quantify the relative contributions of model input variables to the uncertainty in GPP. In addition, we used different land cover and meteorological datasets to examine the effects of input data and spatial resolution on the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of GPP. We found that the model structures affected not only model performance but also model parameters in a manner that differed with vegetation type and region. Thus, proper model structures and rigorous model parameterization and calibration should be adopted in GPP modeling. The Sobol' sensitivity analysis showed that the meteorological drivers including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and daily minimum temperature (TMIN) had larger contribution to the uncertainty in simulated GPP than did the surface reflectance-based indices including enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). At the regional scale, different land cover datasets had the largest impacts on GPP simulations, especially in heterogeneous areas, followed by the scale effects from different spatial resolutions; changing meteorological datasets had the smallest effects. Therefore, more accurate and finer-resolution land cover maps and meteorological datasets are essential for more accurate GPP estimates. Our findings have implications for improving our understanding of the full uncertainty in carbon flux estimates and reducing the uncertainty in carbon cycle simulations.

TI  - Rotavirus is the leading cause of hospitalizations for severe acute gastroenteritis among Afghan children &lt;5 years old
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is estimated to cause approximately five thousand deaths annually among Afghan children under 5 years old. Because laboratory confirmation of rotavirus is not routinely performed in clinical settings, assessing the precise burden of disease attributable to severe rotavirus gastroenteritis typically requires active surveillance efforts. This study describes the current burden of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus gastroenteritis among Afghan children using surveillance data collected from 2013 to 2015.Methods: Rotavirus surveillance was conducted from January 2013 through December 2015 at two of the largest hospitals in the country, Indira Gandhi Children Hospital in Kabul and Herat Regional Hospital. Children between 1 and 60 months of age who were admitted to these hospitals for diarrhea were consented and enrolled. Information on age, gender, and seasonality were collected. Stool specimens were collected and tested by enzyme immunoassay for the presence of rotavirus at the central public health laboratory in Afghanistan.Results: Overall, 1,413 of 2,737 (52%) of hospitalized children under five years old with diarrhea were rotavirus cases. The overwhelming majority of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children younger than two years of age (93%) while 42% of all rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children between 6 and 11 months of age. Rotavirus transmission occurred year-round.Conclusions: Rotavirus is a major cause of severe acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in young Afghan children, responsible for over half of diarrheal hospitalizations in this population. The Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health has prioritized reducing child mortality by 2020 and is actively working towards the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Afghan children. These data will be instrumental in understanding the potential impact upon child health that may be achieved through the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Afghanistan. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Phenology of <i>Trichodesmium </i>spp. blooms in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, from the ESA-MERIS 10-year mission
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trichodesmium, a filamentous bloom-forming marine cyanobacterium, plays a key role in the biogeochemistry of oligotrophic ocean regions because of the ability to fix nitrogen. Naturally occurring in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the contribution of Trichodesmium to the nutrient budget may be of the same order as that entering the system via catchment runoff. However, the cyclicity of Trichodesmium in the GBR is poorly understood and sparsely documented because of the lack of sufficient observations. This study provides the first systematic analysis of Trichodesmium spatial and temporal occurrences in the GBR over the decade-long MERIS ocean color mission (2002-2012). Trichodesmium surface expressions were detected using the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) applied to MERIS satellite imagery of the GBR lagoonal waters. The MCI performed well (76%), albeit tested on a limited set of images (N = 25) coincident with field measurements. A north (Cape York) to south (Fitzroy) increase in the extent, frequency and timing of the surface expressions characterized the GBR, with surface expressions extending over several hundreds of kilometers. The two southernmost subregions Mackay and Fitzroy accounted for the most (70%) bloom events. The bloom timing of Trichodesmium varied from May in the north to November in the south, with wet season conditions less favorable to Trichodesmium aggregations. MODIS-Aqua Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets, wind speed and field measurements of nutrient concentrations were used in combination with MCI positive instances to assess the blooms' driving factors. Low wind speed (<6 m.s(-1)) and SST > 24 degrees C were associated with the largest surface aggregations. Generalized additive models (GAM) indicated an increase in bloom occurrences over the 10-year period with seasonal bloom patterns regionally distinct. Interannual variability in SST partially (14%) explained bloom occurrences, and other drivers, such as the subregion and the nutrient budget, likely regulate Trichodesmium surface aggregations in the GBR.

TI  - Molecular characterization of rotavirus diarrhea among children aged under five years in the Philippines, 2013-2015
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the availability of new and existing rotavirus vaccines, credible and reliable data on burden of rotavirus-associated disease are needed to enable evidence-based decision making regarding the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. The national rotavirus surveillance program in the Philippines, a sentinel-based surveillance, was established in 2012 to determine the proportion of laboratory confirmed rotavirus cases among children under five years with acute gastroenteritis and to describe the geographic distribution and molecular epidemiology of rotavirus in the country. During 2013 to 2015, rotavirus infection was the cause of acute gastroenteritis among children under five years admitted to hospitals or evaluated in emergency rooms, constituting more than one-third of gastroenteritis hospitalizations at the sentinel site hospitals. The predominant genotype observed was G1P[8]. Although a rotavirus surveillance network has been established, findings suggest the need to strengthen the network in the country and to continue monitoring prevalent rotavirus strains to help identify the possible emergence of new strains.

TI  - Ecosystem responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> using airborne remote sensing at Mammoth Mountain, California
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an exploratory study examining the use of airborne remote-sensing observations to detect ecological responses to elevated CO2 emissions from active volcanic systems. To evaluate these ecosystem responses, existing spectroscopic, thermal, and lidar data acquired over forest ecosystems on Mammoth Mountain volcano, California, were exploited, along with in situ measurements of persistent volcanic soil CO2 fluxes. The elevated CO2 response was used to statistically model ecosystem structure, composition, and function, evaluated via data products including biomass, plant foliar traits and vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration (ET). Using regression ensemble models, we found that soil CO2 flux was a significant predictor for ecological variables, including canopy greenness (normalized vegetation difference index, NDVI), canopy nitrogen, ET, and biomass. With increasing CO2, we found a decrease in ET and an increase in canopy nitrogen, both consistent with theory, suggesting more water-and nutrient-use-efficient canopies. However, we also observed a decrease in NDVI with increasing CO2 (a mean NDVI of 0.27 at 200 g m(-2) d(-1) CO2 reduced to a mean NDVI of 0.10 at 800 g m(-2) d(-1) CO2). This is inconsistent with theory though consistent with increased efficiency of fewer leaves. We found a decrease in above-ground biomass with increasing CO2, also inconsistent with theory, but we did also find a decrease in biomass variance, pointing to a long-term homogenization of structure with elevated CO2. Additionally, the relationships between ecological variables changed with elevated CO2, suggesting a shift in coupling/decoupling among ecosystem structure, composition, and function synergies. For example, ET and biomass were significantly correlated for areas without elevated CO2 flux but decoupled with elevated CO2 flux. This study demonstrates that (a) volcanic systems show great potential as a means to study the properties of ecosystems and their responses to elevated CO2 emissions and (b) these ecosystem responses are measurable using a suite of airborne remotely sensed data.

TI  - Observations on the epidemiology of rotavirus infection among hospitalized children younger than 5 years in 2 Ukrainian hospitals, 2007-2015
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acute gastroenteritis remains a burden among children under 5 years of age. Ukraine joined the World Health Organization's Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network in 2006, with a goal of providing accurate rotavirus burden data to aid policy makers in planning for rotavirus vaccine introduction. This analysis describes rotavirus epidemiology among Ukrainian children enrolled in Kyiv and Odesa, two large Ukrainian cities.Methods: Children 0-59 months of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis at 2 sentinel sites in Kyiv and Odesa were enrolled into the active, prospective surveillance program. In Odesa, the surveillance period was during 2007-2015 and in Kyiv, it was during 2011-2015. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as 3 or more episodes of diarrhea per day during a 24 h period, with symptom duration before hospitalization not exceeding 7 days. Guardians of enrolled children completed a questionnaire including demographic, clinical and treatment information. Each child provided a stool specimen within 2 days of hospitalization. Stools were tested for rotavirus using ProSpecrm Rotavirus Kit (Oxoid Ltd., Great Britain), and positive specimens were genotyped. Descriptive data are reported, as well as comparison of demographic, clinical and treatment data among rotavirus positive and negative children.Results: During July 2007-June 2015, 12,350 children were enrolled in the surveillance programs and had stool specimens collected and tested for rotavirus. Overall, rotavirus infection was diagnosed in 5412/12350 (44%) of children, 929/1734 (54%) of those in Kyiv and 4483/10616 (42%) in Odesa. Rotavirus infections peaked during the winter months. Children with rotavirus acute gastroenteritis displayed more severe clinical symptoms than those without rotavirus. Predominant genotypes identified included G1 P[8], G2P[4], G3 P[8], G4 P[8] and G9 P[8].Conclusion: Active surveillance of acute gastroenteritis in hospitalized children younger 5 years in two large Ukrainian cities reveals a significant burden of rotavirus infection. These data provide scientific justification for incorporating rotavirus vaccines into the Ukrainian national immunization schedule. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Epidemiology of acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus in sentinel surveillance sites of Vietnam, 2012-2015
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A prospective, multicentre study was conducted in four sentinel surveillance hospitals to assess the trend and epidemiology of acute diarrhea caused by Rotavirus in Vietnam. During the period 2012-2015, a total 8,889 children under 5 years of age were enrolled in the surveillance, and 8689 stool samples were collected. Of these cases, Rotavirus was most common pathogen 46.7% (4054 cases); in which 26.6% (1117) rotavirus-positive stool samples were evaluated to identify genotypes. The proportion of rotavirus positive specimens decreased annually from 54.7% in 2012 to 36.6% in 2015. Rotavirus was detected year-round, but most rotavirus gastroenteritis cases (77.1%) occurred between December and May, corresponding to the rotavirus seasonality. It is found that the peaks varied by regions. Rotavirus positivities varied between the youngest and oldest age, but children 6-11 months old (38.8%) and 12-23 months old (38.4%) counted for most cases. A significant higher number of diarrhea within 24 hours (83 times, 95%CI: 8.1-8.4 times) and higher proportion of severe dehydration (12.9%) in Rotavirus positive group than that in Rotavirus negative group (7.7 times, 95%CI: 7.6-7.9 times; and 9.7%, respectively). A downtrend of prevalence of G1P[8] was observed from 82% in 2013 to 15% in 2015. However, G2P[4] was found in 5% of samples in 2012, 9% in 2013, 36% in 2014, and 28% in 2015. Rotavirus infection is the most important cause of acute diarrhea among hospitalized children in Vietnam, and a rotavirus vaccination program for children may significantly reduce this disease.

TI  - Sentinel hospital-based surveillance for norovirus infection in children with gastroenteritis between 2015 and 2016 in Italy
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Noroviruses are one of the leading causes of gastro-enteric diseases worldwide in all age groups. Novel epidemic noroviruses with GII.P16 polymerase and GII.2 or GII.4 capsid type have emerged worldwide in late 2015 and in 2016. We performed a molecular epidemiological study of the noroviruses circulating in Italy to investigate the emergence of new norovirus strains. Sentinel hospital-based surveillance, in three different Italian regions, revealed increased prevalence of norovirus infection in children (<15 years) in 2016 (14.4% versus 9.8% in 2015) and the emergence of GII.P16 strains in late 2016, which accounted for 23.0% of norovirus infections. The majority of the strains with a GII.P16 polymerase showed a GII.2 capsid genotype (79.5%). Also, a marked circulation of strains with a GII.17 capsid (14.0%) was observed, chiefly in early 2016. The emergence and global spread of non-GII.4 noroviruses pose challenges for the development of vaccine strategies.

TI  - Effect of spring grass fires on vegetation patterns and soil quality in abandoned agricultural lands at local and landscape scales in Central European Russia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Abandonment of agricultural land is often happening all over the world and widespread in Russia. Such lands are subject to successional changes in vegetation and it seems necessary to provide effective methods for a sustainable ecosystem management of those lands. However, factors which determine successional processes, especially fires, have not been studied in detail. The aim of this article is to reveal how spring grass fires affect the abandoned arable lands in the study area at the landscape and local scales.Methods: A region of 265.5 km(2) located in the south of Moscow was studied. At the landscape scale, we analyzed the spatial characteristics of the area in relation with a 30-year history of spring fire events extracted from the Landsat archive, and climatic data. Logistic regression was used. At the local scale, we sampled soil and vegetation at two sites and in three biotopes at each site: mature forest and two neighboring biotopes affected and unaffected by fire. Plant species diversity, soil quality, and relationship between soil and vegetation were assessed by ANOVA, v test, NMDS, and dbRDA.Results: Abandoned lands covered 39% of the study area and not less than 72% of these were affected by grass fires, happening mainly between 1998 and 2014. Man causes the ignition of the field layer accidentally, but the area over which the fire spreads is determined by climatic factors and the presence of flammable material (dry grass and litter) for burning. High March temperatures and low precipitation values in April increase the inflammability of dry grasses which are abundant on the former fields. As a result, burnt areas are steadily expanding in abandoned lands where trees are scarce. On abandoned lands that were either affected or unaffected by fires, two different plant communities developed, respectively: grassy vegetation mainly dominated by Calamagrostis epigeios and young forest of pioneer trees with high crown coverage. Practically all soil variables were statistically different in three biotopes at the research sites. Plant species composition was best explained by six soil variables: P2O5, C/N, pH, K, SOC, and N values.Conclusions: We showed the key role of grass fires in the formation of differences in soil and vegetation during the successional recovery of abandoned lands at the local and landscape scales.

TI  - Using CALIOP to estimate cloud-field base height and its uncertainty: the Cloud Base Altitude Spatial Extrapolator (CBASE) algorithm and datasety
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique is presented that uses attenuated backscatter profiles from the CALIOP satellite lidar to estimate cloud base heights of lower-troposphere liquid clouds (cloud base height below approximately 3 km). Even when clouds are thick enough to attenuate the lidar beam (optical thickness tau greater than or similar to 5), the technique provides cloud base heights by treating the cloud base height of nearby thinner clouds as representative of the surrounding cloud field. Using ground-based ceilometer data, uncertainty estimates for the cloud base height product at retrieval resolution are derived as a function of various properties of the CALIOP lidar profiles. Evaluation of the predicted cloud base heights and their predicted uncertainty using a second statistically independent ceilometer dataset shows that cloud base heights and uncertainties are biased by less than 10 %. Geographic distributions of cloud base height and its uncertainty are presented. In some regions, the uncertainty is found to be substantially smaller than the 480 m uncertainty assumed in the A-Train surface downwelling longwave estimate, potentially permitting the most uncertain of the radiative fluxes in the climate system to be better constrained.

TI  - Rotavirus gastroenteritis surveillance in Azerbaijan, 2011-2016
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Rotavirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and mortality among children worldwide but data describing rotavirus disease in Azerbaijan are lacking. This analysis describes the rotavirus disease burden in Baku, the largest city in Azerbaijan.Methods: We conducted active, prospective, sentinel hospital surveillance with laboratory confirmation for rotavirus among children under 5 years of age hospitalized at a large pediatric hospital in Baku during 2011-2016. Children with bloody diarrhea, or prior use of antibiotics or intravenous fluids were excluded. The guardians of enrolled children completed a questionnaire documenting clinical and demographic information. A stool specimen was collected from each enrolled child. We report the number and proportion of rotavirus positive hospitalizations during the surveillance period and a clinical description of rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative children.Results: From July 2011 through June 2016, 3139 children <5 years of age were enrolled into the surveillance system. Of these, 523 (17%) were positive for rotavirus, varying from 13% to 21% by surveillance year, with a median of 16% over the surveillance period. Increase in rotavirus detections occurred during December-May. Most rotavirus infections (303/523; 58%) occurred in children aged 6-23 months.Conclusion: Rotavirus is responsible for approximately 16% of annual hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age in Baku. This is lower than regional estimates. Exclusion of children with a history of antibiotic use or intravenous fluids may be accounting for this lower prevalence, and expansion of surveillance to include these groups could provide a more comprehensive picture of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in Baku.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance for rotavirus in children <5 years of age admitted for Diarrheal illness to Yangon Children's Hospital, Myanmar, 2009-2014
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children <5 years of age in Myanmar. The purpose of this analysis is to report from the sentinel surveillance system for rota virus gastroenteritis (RVGE), which collects information on the epidemiology and circulating genotypes to assess the disease burden and support vaccine introduction in Myanmar.Methods: Prospective, active surveillance for RVGE-associated hospitalizations was conducted during 2009-2014 at Yangon Children's Hospital. Stool samples collected from children <5 years of age admitted for AGE were screened for rotavirus antigen by ELISA (ProSpecT (TM) Rotavirus, OXOID-UK). G and P genotyping was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results: Overall, 1860/3724 (49.9%) of stool samples tested positive for rotavirus, ranging from 42-56% of hospitalized AGE cases each year. RVGE was predominant in the 6-11 months age group 889/1860 (47.8%) as compared with 12-23 months 633/1860 (34.0%), 0-5 months 226/1860 (12.2 %) and 24-59 months 112/1860 (6.0%). RVGE occurred in a seasonal cycle with peak occurrence in the cold and dry months (November to February), accounting for 65.3% (1151/1763) among enrolled AGE cases. Vomiting (84.1% Vs 67.9%; P < .01), fever (84.5% Vs 75.6%; P < .01) and dehydration (78% Vs 69%; P < .01) were more frequently observed in RVGE than non-RVGE.Genotyping revealed that G1P[8] was predominant from January to June 2009, G12P[8] was predominant throughout 2009-2012 which was replaced in 2012-2013 by G2P[4] and changed again to G1P[8] in 2013-2014 and G9B[8] in late 2014.Conclusions: Rotavirus is accounting for approximately half of AGE-associated hospitalizations among children <5 years of age in Myanmar. There is immense diversity of rotavirus strains similar to that reported previously for other countries in the region. Information gained from this surveillance system highlights consideration of rotavirus vaccine introduction into this target population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rotavirus hospitalizations among children <5 years of age-Tajikistan, 2013-2014
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In January 2015, Tajikistan introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization program. Our objective was to estimate pre-vaccine burden of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations in children <5 years of age in Tajikistan.Methods: During January 2013-December 2014, active surveillance for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) associated hospitalizations in children <5 years of age was conducted by sentinel surveillance site staff. Patients' demographic and clinical data were summarized and a stool sample was collected. An Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay was used for diagnosis of rotavirus infection and subset of the specimens was sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping.Results: Of 2860 eligible children enrolled and tested, 1207 (42%) were positive for rotavirus. An increase in the number and proportion of rotavirus cases attributed to rotavirus season, with positivity rates >40%, was annually observed during June-September.The median age of rotavirus patients was 9 months and 939/1207 (78%) rotavirus patients were aged 623 months. Most (1097/1203; 91%) rotavirus patients were treated with intravenous fluids. GIP[8] was the predominant genotype during both years of surveillance, accounting for 133/222 (60%) of genotyped cases.Conclusion: Rotavirus is a major cause of hospitalization due to severe AGE in children <5 years of age in Tajikistan, accounting for >40% of cases. Continued, enhanced rotavirus surveillance may allow documentation of changes in rotavirus disease burden following vaccine introduction and assessment of vaccine effectiveness.

TI  - Rotavirus infection among hospitalized children under five years of age with acute watery diarrhea in Sri Lanka
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute watery diarrhoea among children and is vaccine preventable. The aim of this hospital-based sentinel surveillance was to study the prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections and to describe rotavirus genotype distribution patterns among children under five years of age hospitalized for acute watery diarrhea during the period of 2009-2016.Methods: Prospective, sentinel hospital-based surveillance was conducted in Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) from 2009 to 2016. Stool samples of children admitted with acute watery diarrhea were tested by rotavirus antigen detection 'ProSpecT' Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) at Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Colombo. Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus were further analyzed at the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) participating in the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network (GRSN) to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Results: Of the 6090 children with diarrhea admitted, 1801 (29.5%) had stools taken and tested. In years with at least 11 months of data (2010 and 2013) rotavirus was detected in 36.5% (228/624) of specimens. Genotype GIP[8] was the most common genotype detected throughout the surveillance period (30.1%; 123/408) with G2P [8], G9P[8] and G3P[8] also detected.Conclusions: Rotavirus is a common cause of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations in Sri Lanka. National introduction of rotavirus vaccine could reduce the burden of pediatric diarrhea. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using a coupled dynamic factor - random forest analysis (DFRFA) to reveal drivers of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the semi-arid regions of southern Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the drivers of large-scale vegetation change is critical to managing land-scapes and key to predicting how projected climate and land use changes will affect regional vegetation patterns. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the role, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the key environmental and socioeconomic factors driving vegetation change in a southern African savanna. This research was conducted across the Kwando, Okavango and Zambezi catchments of southern Africa (Angola, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia) and explored vegetation cover change across the region from 2001-2010. A novel coupled analysis was applied to model the dynamic biophysical factors then to determine the discrete / social drivers of spatial heterogeneity on vegetation. Previous research applied Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA), a multivariate times series dimension reduction technique, to ten years of monthly remotely sensed vegetation data (MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), and a suite of time-series (monthly) environmental covariates: precipitation, mean, minimum and maximum air temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, fire and potential evapotranspiration. This initial research was performed at a regional scale to develop meso-scale models explaining mean regional NDVI patterns. The regional DFA predictions were compared to the fine-scale MODIS time series using Kendall's Tau and Sen's Slope to identify pixels where the DFA model we had developed, under or over predicted NDVI. Once identified, a Random Forest (RF) analysis using a series of static social and physical variables was applied to explain these remaining areas of under- and over- prediction to fully explore the drivers of heterogeneity in this savanna system. The RF analysis revealed the importance of protected areas, elevation, soil type, locations of higher population, roads, and settlements, in explaining fine scale differences in vegetation biomass. While the previously applied DFA generated a model of environmental variables driving NDVI, the RF work developed here highlighted human influences dominating that signal. The combined DFRFA model approach explains almost 90% of the variance in NDVI across this landscape from 2001-2010. Our methodology presents a unique coupling of dynamic and static factor analyses, yielding novel insights into savanna heterogeneity, and providing a tool of great potential for researchers and managers alike.

TI  - Rotavirus diarrhoea hospitalizations among children under 5 years of age in Nigeria, 2011-2016
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The high burden of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is well documented among children under 5 years of age, with the majority of mortality occurring in developing countries. Nigeria ranked second worldwide in the number of rotavirus deaths in 2013. As Nigeria plans to introduce rotavirus vaccine soon, a pre-vaccine documentation of rotavirus disease burden is necessary to determine vaccine impact.Methods: Routine rotavirus surveillance was conducted during 2011-2016 in 3 sentinel sites in Nigeria using the standard WHO protocol. Children under 5 years of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were enrolled and demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected. A stool sample was subsequently obtained and tested for human rotavirus antigen using the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: 2694 children with acute gastroenteritis were enrolled during January 2011 to December 2016; of these, 1242 (46%) tested positive for rotavirus. Among the rotavirus positive cases, 66% and 94% were younger than 12 months and 24 months respectively. Marked peaks in rotavirus positivity were seen in January of each year. Vomiting, and use of oral and intravenous fluids occurred more often in rotavirus positive cases as compared to rotavirus negative cases.Conclusion: The high prevalence of rotavirus disease highlights the need for urgent introduction of rota virus vaccine in Nigeria. Additionally, this study provides pre-vaccine introduction disease-burden data that will serve as a baseline for rotavirus vaccine impact-assessment once vaccine has been introduced in the national immunization program.

TI  - Complex and Cascading Triggering of Submarine Landslides and Turbidity Currents at Volcanic Islands Revealed From Integration of High-Resolution Onshore and Offshore Surveys
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged flanks of volcanic islands are prone to hazards including submarine landslides that may trigger damaging tsunamis and sediment-laden seafloor flows (called "turbidity currents"). These hazards can break seafloor infrastructure which is critical for global communications and energy transmission. Small Island Developing States are particularly vulnerable to these hazards due to their remote and isolated nature, small size, high population densities, and weak economies. Despite their vulnerability, few detailed offshore surveys exist for such islands, resulting in a geohazard "blindspot," particularly in the South Pacific. Understanding how these hazards are triggered is important; however, pin-pointing specific triggers is challenging as most studies have been unable to link continuously between onshore and offshore environments, and focus primarily on large-scale eruptions with sudden production of massive volumes of sediment. We address these issues by integrating the first detailed (2 x 2 m) bathymetry data acquired from Tanna Island, Vanuatu with a combination of terrestrial remote sensing data, onshore and offshore sediment sampling, and documented historical events. Mount Yasur on Tanna has experienced low-magnitude Strombolian activity for at least the last 600 years. We find clear evidence for submarine landslides and turbidity currents, yet none of the identified triggers are related to major volcanic eruptions, in contrast to conclusions from several previous studies. Instead we find that cascades of non-volcanic events (including outburst floods with discharges of > 1,000 m(3)/s, and tropical cyclones), that may be separated by decades, are more important for preconditioning and triggering of landslides and turbidity currents in oversupplied sedimentary regimes such as at Tanna. We conclude with a general model for how submarine landslides and turbidity currents are triggered at volcanic and other heavily eroding mountainous islands. Our model highlights the often-ignored importance of outburst floods, non-linear responses to land-use and climatic changes, and the complex interactions between a range of coastal and tectonic processes that may overshadow volcanic regimes.

TI  - Enhancing the Fast Radiative Transfer Model for FengYun-4 GIIRS by Using Local Training Profiles
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the successful launch of FengYun-4A (FY-4A), the first satellite in a new Chinese geostationary weather satellite series (FY-4 series), which carries a high spectral resolution infrared (IR) sounder called GIIRS (Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder), and vertical atmospheric profiles can be obtained frequently at the regional scale. A fast radiative transfer model is a key component for quantitative applications of GIIRS radiance measurements, including deriving soundings in near real time for situation awareness and radiance assimilation in numerical weather prediction models. The weighted least squares method on enhancing the accuracy of RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) for GIIRS is developed. Besides, currently, fast radiative transfer models for IR sensors are based on global training profiles, since GIIRS is targeted for regional observations; it is beneficial for local weather related applications using local training profiles, which better represent the characteristics of that weather regime. A local training profile data set has been developed for GIIRS using the RTTOV approach, comparisons with line-by-line radiative transfer model indicate that weighted least squares method provides better accuracy (smaller root-mean-square error) in the brightness temperature simulation for the middlewave band of GIIRS than the ordinary least squares method, and the local training profiles have further remarkable improvements on brightness temperature simulation over the global training profiles, especially for GIIRS longwave band. The methods can be applied to RTTOV development for other IR sensors onboard the geostationary satellites.

TI  - Short-Term Outcomes of Concussions in Major League Baseball: A Historical Cohort Study of Return to Play, Performance, Longevity, and Financial Impact
T2  - ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The short-term outcomes of concussions within Major League Baseball (MLB) warrant further consideration beyond a medical standpoint given that performance, career, and financial data remain unknown. The perception of this injury directly affects decision making from the perspective of both player and franchise. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of concussion on MLB players by (1) establishing return-to-play (RTP) time after concussion; (2) comparing the career length and performance of players with concussion versus those who took nonmedical leave; and (3) analyzing player financial impact after concussion. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Contracts, transactions, injury reports, and performance statistics from 2005 to 2017 were analyzed by comparing matched players who sustained a concussion versus those who took nonmedical leave. Of the 4186 eligible MLB players, 145 sustained concussions resulting in the activation of concussion protocol and 538 took nonmedical leave. RTP time was recorded. Career length was analyzed in reference to an experience-based stratification of full seasons remaining after the concussion. Changes in player performance and salary before and after concussion were compared with the same parameters for players who took nonmedical leave. Results: The mean RTP time was 26 days (95% CI, 20-32 days) for athletes with concussion and 8 days (95% CI, 6-10 days) for those who took nonmedical leave. Athletes with concussion had a mean of 2.8 full seasons remaining, whereas athletes who took nonmedical leave had 3.1 seasons remaining (P = .493). The probability of playing in the MLB after concussion compared with the nonmedical leave pool was not significantly lower (P = .534, log-rank test; hazard ratio, 1.108). Postconcussion performance decreased significantly in position players, including a lower batting average and decreased on-base percentage in the players with concussion compared with those returning from nonmedical leave. Players who sustained a concussion lost a mean of US$654,990 annually compared with players who took nonmedical leave. Conclusion: This study of the short-term outcomes after concussion in limited-contact MLB athletes demonstrates that concussions may not decrease career spans but may result in decreased performance in addition to financial loss when compared with matched controls who took nonmedical leave. In sports such as baseball that are not subject to repetitive head trauma, career spans may not decrease after a single concussive event. However, sentinel concussions have deleterious short-term effects on performance and compensation among MLB players.

TI  - Culture-free genotyping of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> revealed distinct strains at different anatomical sites in a quarter of patients, the Netherlands, 2012 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Genotyping of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is essential for surveillance to monitor NG transmission and dissemination of resistant strains. Current genotyping methods rely on bacterial culture which frequently fails. Aim: Our aim was to develop a culture-free genotyping method that is compatible with the widely used N. gonorrhoeaemulti-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) database, which facilitates genotyping of NG detected at separate anatomical sites in individual patients. Methods: Specific primers for both PCR targets porB and tbpB were designed and technically validated by assessing the analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity with 32 nongonoccocal Neisseria species, and concordance with NG-MAST. Clinical application was assessed on 205 paired samples from concurrent NG infections at different anatomical sites of 98 patients (81 men who have sex with men and 17 women) visiting our sexually transmitted infections clinic. Results: Typing could be consistently performed on samples with a PCR quantification cycle (Cq) value<35. Furthermore, the method showed no cross-reactivity and was concordant with NG-MAST. Culture-free NG-MAST improved the typing rate from 62% (59/95) for cultured samples to 94% (89/95) compared with culture-dependent NG-MAST. Paired samples of 80 of 98 patients were genotyped, revealing distinct NG strains in separate anatomical sites in 25% (20/80) of the patients. Conclusions: This NG-specific genotyping method can improve NG surveillance as it facilitates genotyping of non-culturable and extra-genital samples. Furthermore, 25% of patients were infected with multiple NG strains, which is missed in current culture-dependent surveillance. Including non-culturable and concurrent NG infections in surveillance informs actions on dissemination of multidrug-resistant NG strains.

TI  - Use of the Normalized Difference Road Landside Index (NDRLI)-based method for the quick delineation of road-induced landslides
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognition and classification of road-related landslides are a critical requirement in pre- and post-disaster hazard analysis. They are primarily done through field mapping or manual image interpretation from commercial satellites images. This paper developed a Normalized Difference Road Landside Index (NDRLI)-based method to delineate road-induced landslides and enhance their presence in remotely sensed digital imagery based on free Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) sources. The NDRLI-based method includes NDRLI, Shape Index of Spectral Curve (SISC), and other optimizing steps such as deleting shadow and slope <20 degrees area to recognise landslides. The test results show that the NDRLI-based method is effective in extracting road-induced landslide information, although the Kappa coefficient should be further improved.

TI  - Best Practices for Elevation-Based Assessments of Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Exposure
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevation data are critical for assessments of sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal flooding exposure. Previous research has demonstrated that the quality of data used in elevation-based assessments must be well understood and applied to properly model potential impacts. The cumulative vertical uncertainty of the input elevation data substantially controls the minimum increments of SLR and the minimum planning horizons that can be effectively used in assessments. For regional, continental, or global assessments, several digital elevation models (DEMs) are available for the required topographic information to project potential impacts of increased coastal water levels, whether a simple inundation model is used or a more complex process-based or probabilistic model is employed. When properly characterized, the vertical accuracy of the DEM can be used to report assessment results with the uncertainty stated in terms of a specific confidence level or likelihood category. An accuracy evaluation has been conducted of global DEMs to quantify their inherent vertical uncertainty to demonstrate how accuracy information should be considered when planning and implementing a SLR or coastal flooding assessment. The evaluation approach includes comparison of the DEMs with high-accuracy geodetic control points as the independent reference data over a variety of coastal relief settings. The global DEMs evaluated include SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, TanDEM-X, NASADEM, and MERIT. High-resolution, high-accuracy DEM sources, such as airborne lidar and stereo imagery, are also included to give context to the results from the global DEMs. The accuracy characterization results show that current global DEMs are not adequate for high confidence mapping of exposure to fine increments (<1 m) of SLR or with shorter planning horizons (<100 years) and thus they should not be used for such mapping, but they are suitable for general delineation of low elevation coastal zones. In addition to the best practice of rigorous accounting for vertical uncertainty, other recommended procedures are presented for delineation of different types of impact areas (marine and groundwater inundation) and use of regional relative SLR scenarios. The requirement remains for a freely available, highaccuracy, high-resolution global elevation model that supports quantitative SLR and coastal inundation assessments at high confidence levels.

AB  - To remove the impacts of polarization interference on satellite-to-ground high-speed data transmission systems, the major factors that affect polarization interference are concluded, the deteriorations of bit error rate (BER) of different modulation systems and channel coding modes are simulated, and the parallel adaptive filtering technology is presented to resolve the high symbol-rate signal transmission polarization interference. It has been verified by experiments that the effects of this method is remarkable. In the situation of QPSK system, 500MSPS symbol rate and 10dB polarization isolation, the BER performance can be improved 4.5dB by using this method.

TI  - Above-ground biomass estimates based on active and passive microwave sensor imagery in low-biomass savanna ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many studies exist on the estimation and monitoring of above-ground biomass (AGB) of forest ecosystems by methods of remote sensing, very little research has been carried out for ecosystems of low primary production, such as grasslands, steppes, or savannas. Our study intends to approach this gap and investigates the correlation between space-borne radar information and AGB at the scale of 10 tons per hectare and below. Additionally, we introduce the integration of passive brightness temperature as an additional covariate for biomass estimation, based on the hypothesis that it contains information complementary to microwave backscatter of the active sensors. Our findings show that large-scale estimates of AGB can be conducted for grasslands and savannas at high accuracy (R-2 up to 0.52). Additionally, we found that the integration of passive radar can increase the quality of AGB estimates in terms of explained variance for selected cases. We hope that these indications are a starting point for more integrated approaches toward biomass estimations based on Earth observation methods. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Unsettling antibiosis: how might interdisciplinary researchers generate a feeling for the microbiome and to what effect?
T2  - PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decades of active public health messaging about the dangers of pathogenic microbes has led to a Western society dominated by an antibiotic worldview; however recent scientific and social interest in the microbiome suggests an emerging counter-current of more probiotic sentiments. Such stirrings are supported by cultural curiosity around the 'hygiene hypothesis', or the idea it is possible to be 'too clean' and a certain amount of microbial exposure is essential for health. These trends resonate with the ways in which scientists too have adopted a more 'ecological' perspective on the microbiome. Advances in sequencing technologies and decreasing costs have allowed researchers to more rapidly explore the abundance and diversity of microbial life. This paper seeks to expand on such probiotic tendencies by proposing an interdisciplinary methodology researchers might use to generate more-than-antibiotic relations between lay participants and their domestic microbiome. The paper draws on findings from an ESRC-funded study, Good Germs, Bad Germs: Mapping microbial life in the kitchen (grant number ES/N006968/1), which sought to: (i) explore human-microbe relations in the domestic kitchen; and (ii) make scientific techniques for visualising the domestic microbiome available to non-expert publics through a form of 'participatory metagenomics'. We examine how scientific knowledge and techniques are enroled into lay practices of making microbes sensible; how these intersect with, reinforce or disrupt previous feelings for microorganisms; and how new ways of relating with microbial others emerge. In reflecting on these findings we draw on work in animal geographies, environmental humanities and the social science of the microbiome. We examine how cultural, emotional and embodied responses to nonhuman others-their ability to affect 'us' humans-have implications for the ways in which public health authorities, researchers and 'lay' publics alike seek to engage with and govern nonhuman life. We argue that understanding and potentially generating different modes of relating to microbes-a feeling for the microbiome-offers opportunities for reconfiguring microbiopolitics and intervening into the ways in which publics respond to perceived microbial opportunities and threats.

TI  - Using modelled discharge to develop satellite-based river gauging: a case study for the Amazon Basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge measurements have proven invaluable to monitor the global water cycle, assess flood risk, and guide water resource management. However, there is a delay, and ongoing decline, in the availability of gauging data and stations are highly unevenly distributed globally. While not a substitute for river discharge measurement, remote sensing is a cost-effective technology to acquire information on river dynamics in situations where ground-based measurements are unavailable. The general approach has been to relate satellite observation to discharge measured in situ, which prevents its use for ungauged rivers. Alternatively, hydrological models are now available that can be used to estimate river discharge globally. While subject to greater errors and biases than measurements, model estimates of river discharge do expand the options for applying satellite-based discharge monitoring in ungauged rivers. Our aim was to test whether satellite gauging reaches (SGRs), similar to virtual stations in satellite altimetry, can be constructed based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical or Global Flood Detection System (GFDS) passive microwave derived surface water extent fraction and simulated discharge from the World-Wide Water (W3) model version 2. We designed and tested two methods to develop SGRs across the Amazon Basin and found that the optimal grid cell selection method performed best for relating MODIS and GFDS water extent to simulated discharge. The number of potential river reaches to develop SGRs increases from upstream to downstream reaches as rivers widen. MODIS SGRs are feasible for more river reaches than GFDS SGRs due to its higher spatial resolution. However, where they could be constructed, GFDS SGRs predicted discharge more accurately as observations were less affected by cloud and vegetation. We conclude that SGRs are suitable for automated large-scale application and offer a possibility to predict river discharge variations from satellite observations alone, for both gauged and ungauged rivers.

TI  - Comparison of satellite-based estimates of aboveground biomass in coppice oak forests using parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric modeling methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of forest biomass are essential for several purposes, ranging from carbon accounting and ecological applications to sustainable forest management. There are, however, critical steps for mapping aboveground forest biomass (AGB) based on optical satellite data with an acceptable degree of accuracy, such as selecting the proper statistical modeling method and deriving spectral information from imagery, at known field locations. We compare nine modeling techniques including parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric methods for remotely estimating AGB based on various spectral variables derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We conduct this research in Zagros oak forests on two sites under different human disturbance levels: an undegraded (UD) forest site and a highly degraded (HD) forest site. Based on cross-validation statistics, the UD site exhibited better results than the HD site. Support vector machine (SVM) and Cubist regression (CR) were more precise in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), though these approaches also result in more biased estimates compared to the other methods. Our findings reveal that if the degree of under-or over-estimation is not problematic, then SVM and CR are good modeling options (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 31.5% of the mean, and MAE = 3.93 ton/ha), otherwise, the other modeling methods such as linear model, k-nearest neighbor, boosted regression trees, generalized additive model, and random forest may be better choices. Overall, our work indicates that the use of freely available Landsat 8 OLI and proper statistical modeling methods is a time-and cost-effective approach for accurate AGB estimates in Zagros oak forests.

TI  - A fusion-based neural network methodology for monthly reservoir inflow prediction using MODIS products
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A model fusion approach was developed based on five artificial neural networks (ANNs) and MODIS products. Static and dynamic ANNs - the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one and two hidden layers, general regression neural network (GRNN), radial basis function (RBF) and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) - were used to predict the monthly reservoir inflow in Mollasadra Dam, Fars Province, Iran. Leaf area index and snow cover from MODIS, and rainfall and runoff data were used to identify eight different combinations to train the models. Statistical error indices and the Borda count method were used to verify and rank the identified combinations. The best results for individual ANNs were combined with MODIS products in a fusion model. The results show that using MODIS products increased the accuracy of predictions, with the MLP with two hidden layers giving the best performance. Also, the fusion model was found to be superior to the best individual ANNs.

AB  - Agricultural abandonment is widespread and growing in many regions worldwide, often because of agricultural intensification on productive lands, conservation policies, or the spatial decoupling of agricultural production from consumption. Abandonment has major environmental and social impacts, which differ starkly depending on the geographical context, as does its potential to serve as a land reservoir for recultivation. Understanding determinants of abandonment patterns, and especially how their influence varies across broad geographic extents, is therefore important. Using a pan-European map of agricultural abandonment derived from MODIS NDVI time series between 2001 and 2012, we quantified the importance of farm management, climatic, environmental, and socio-economic variables in explaining abandonment patterns. We chose a machine learning modelling framework that accounts for spatial variation in the relationship between abandonment and its determinants. We predicted abandonment probability as well as determinant coefficients for the entire study area and summarised them for regions under selected EU support schemes. Our results highlight that agricultural abandonment was mainly explained by climate conditions suboptimal for agriculture (i.e., low/high growing degrees days). Determinants related to farm management (smaller field size, lower yields) and socio-economic conditions (high unemployment, negative migration balance) also contributed to describing agricultural abandonment patterns in Europe. Several determinants influenced abandonment in strongly non-linear ways and we found substantial spatial non-stationarity effects, although abandonment patterns were equally well-explained by predictors specified with spatially constant and varying effects. Predicted abandonment probability was similar inside and outside EU support or conservation zones, whereas observed MODIS-based abandonment was generally higher outside these zones, suggesting that schemes such as Natura 2000 or High Nature Value Farmland likely influence abandonment patterns. Our work highlights the potential value of spatial boosting for gaining insights into land-use change processes and their outcomes, which should increase the ability of such models to inform contextspecific, regionalised decision making.

TI  - The Stellar Orbital Structure in Axisymmetric Galaxy Models with Supermassive Black Hole Binaries
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been well established that particular centrophilic orbital families in non-spherical galaxies can, in principle, drive a black hole binary to shrink its orbit through three-body scattering until the black holes are close enough to strongly emit gravitational waves. Most of these studies rely on the orbital analysis of a static supermassive black hole (SMBH)-embedded galaxy potential to support this view; it is not clear, however, how these orbits transform as the second SMBH enters the center. So our understanding of which orbits actually interact with an SMBH binary is not ironclad. Here, we analyze two flattened galaxy models, one with a single SMBH and one with a binary, to determine which orbits actually do interact with the SMBH binary and how they compare with the set predicted in single SMBH-embedded models. We find close correspondence between the centrophilic orbits predicted to interact with the binary and those that are actually scattered by the binary, in terms of energy and L-z distribution, where L-z is the z component of a stellar particle's angular momentum. Of minor note: because of the larger mass, the binary SMBH has a larger radius of influence than in the single SMBH model, which allows the binary to draw from a larger reservoir of orbits to scatter. Of the prediction particles and scattered particles, nearly half have chaotic orbits, 40% have f(x):f(y) = 1:1 orbits and 10% have other resonant orbits.

TI  - Seasonal patterns of canopy photosynthesis captured by remotely sensed sun-induced fluorescence and vegetation indexes in mid-to-high latitude forests: A cross-platform comparison
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterized by the noticeable seasonal patterns of canopy photosynthesis, mid-to-high latitude forests are sensitive to climate change and crucial for understanding the global carbon cycle. To monitor the seasonal cycle of the canopy photosynthesis from space, several remotely sensed indexes, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) have been implemented within the past decades. Recently, satellite-derived sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential of providing retrievals that are more related to photosynthesis process. However, the potentials of different canopy measurements have not been thoroughly assessed in the context of recent advances of new satellites and proposals of improved indexes. At 15 forested sites, we present a cross-platform intercomparison of one emerging remote sensing based index of phenology index (PI) and two SIF datasets against the conventional indexes such as NDVI, EVI, and LAI to capture the seasonal cycles of canopy photosynthesis. NDVI, EVI, LAI, and PI were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements, while SIF were evaluated from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations. Results indicated that GOME-2 SIF was highly correlated with gross primary production (GPP) and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation during the growing seasons. The SIF-GPP relationship can generally be considered linear at the 16-day scale. Key phenological metrics such as start of the seasons and end of the seasons captured by SIF from GOME-2 and OCO-2 matched closely with photosynthesis phenology as inferred by GPP. However, the applications of OCO-2 SIF for phenological studies may be limited only for a small range of sites ( at site-level) due to a limited spatial sampling. Among the MODIS estimations, PI and NDVI provided most reliable predictions of start of growing seasons, while no indexes accurately captured the end of growing seasons. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A novel index for assessment of riparian strip efficiency in agricultural landscapes using high spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian strips are used worldwide to protect riverbanks and water quality in agricultural zones because of their numerous environmental benefits. A metric called Riparian Strip Quality Index, which is based on the percentage area of riparian vegetation, is used to evaluate their ecological condition. This index measures the potential capacity of riparian strips to filter sediments, retain pollutants, and provide shelter for terrestrial and aquatic species. This research aims to improve this metric by integrating the ability of riparian strips to intercept surface runoff, which is the major cause of water pollution and erosion in productive areas. In Canada and the Nordic countries, rapid surface drainage from snow melt and spring rains is often practiced to avoid production delays and losses. This reduces the efficiency of riparian buffer strips by promoting soil erosion due to concentrated runoff. A new proposed metric called Riparian Strip Efficiency Index (RSEI), incorporates not only land cover information, but topographic and hydrologic variables to model the intensity and spatial distribution of runoff streamflow, and the capability of riparian strips to retain sediments and pollutants. The research is performed over the La Chevrotiere River Basin in the Portneuf municipality in Quebec (Canada) using hydrological modeling, land cover and topographic data extracted from very high spatial resolution World View-2 imagery as a unique source of inputs. The results show that RSEI provides a better characterization of the ecosystem services of riparian strips in terms of pollutants filtration and prevention of soil erosion in agricultural areas. RSEI will allow a better management of agricultural practices such as drainage and land leveling. Further, it will provide to land managers information to monitor environmental changes and to prioritize intervention areas, which ultimately targets to ensure optimal allocation of private or public funds toward the most inefficient and threatened riparian strips.

TI  - Power laws and critical fragmentation in global forests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The replacement of forest areas with human-dominated landscapes usually leads to fragmentation, altering the structure and function of the forest. Here we studied the dynamics of forest patch sizes at a global level, examining signals of a critical transition from an unfragmented to a fragmented state, using the MODIS vegetation continuous field. We defined wide regions of connected forest across continents and big islands, and combined five criteria, including the distribution of patch sizes and the fluctuations of the largest patch over the last sixteen years, to evaluate the closeness of each region to a fragmentation threshold. Regions with the highest deforestation rates-South America, Southeast Asia, Africa-all met these criteria and may thus be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This implies that if current forest loss rates are maintained, wide continental areas could suddenly fragment, triggering extensive species loss and degradation of ecosystems services.

TI  - Natural geological seepage of hydrocarbon gas in the Appalachian Basin and Midwest USA in relation to shale tectonic fracturing and past industrial hydrocarbon production
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological hydrocarbon gas seepage is a major global source of atmospheric methane, ethane and propane as greenhouse gases and photochemical pollutants. Natural gas seepage is generally related to faults and associated fracture intensification domains that provide conduits for natural gas from reservoir rocks to migrate upward and enter the atmosphere. In this study, we compare the case of intense gas seepage stemming directly from source rocks, mostly organic-rich fractured black shales in western New York State (NYS) versus areas with rare seepage in the more southern regions of the Appalachian Basin and the Midwest USA. In addition to thermogenic methane, western NYS shale gas seeps emit ethane and propane with C2+3 gas concentrations reaching up to 35 vol%. Fractures in NYS developed, reactivated and maintained permeability for gas as a result of Quaternary glaciation and post-glacial basin uplift. In contrast, the Appalachian regions farther south and the southern Midwest regions experienced less glacial loading and unloading than in NYS, resulting in less recent natural fracturing, as witnessed by the rarity of seepage on surface outcrops and in caves overlying gas-bearing shales and coals. The historical literature suggests that early western NYS drilling and production of oil and gas diminished shale gas pressure and resulted in declining gas seepage rates. Our survey documented 12 active western NYS natural gas seeps, whereas >32 seeps have been reported or documented since the 17th century. Preliminary tests showed that SCIAMACHY satellite data did not detect atmospheric methane anomalies over western NYS seeps. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contiguous United States wildland fire emission estimates during 2003-2015
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - Wildfires are a major source of air pollutants in the United States. Wildfire smoke can trigger severe pollution episodes with substantial impacts on public health. In addition to acute episodes, wildfires can have a marginal effect on air quality at significant distances from the source, presenting significant challenges to air regulators' efforts to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Improved emission estimates are needed to quantify the contribution of wildfires to air pollution and thereby inform decision-making activities related to the control and regulation of anthropogenic air pollution sources.To address the need of air regulators and land managers for improved wildfire emission estimates, we developed the Missoula Fire Lab Emission Inventory (MFLEI), a retrospective, daily wildfire emission inventory for the contiguous United States (CONUS). MFLEI was produced using multiple datasets of fire activity and burned area, a newly developed wildland fuels map and an updated emission factor database. Daily burned area is based on a combination of Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area and active fire detection products, incident fire perimeters, and a spatial wildfire occurrence database. The fuel type classification map is a merger of a national forest type map, produced by the USDA Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program and the Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC), with a shrub and grassland vegetation map developed by the USFS Missoula Forestry Sciences Laboratory. Forest fuel loading is from a fuel classification developed from a large set (> 26 000 sites) of FIA surface fuel measurements. Herbaceous fuel loading is estimated using site-specific parameters with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from MODIS. Shrub fuel loading is quantified by applying numerous allometric equations linking stand structure and composition to biomass and fuels, with the structure and composition data derived from geospatial data layers of the LANDFIRE project. MFLEI provides estimates of CONUS daily wildfire burned area, fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions at a 250 m x 250 m resolution for 2003-2015. A spatially aggregated emission product (10 km x 10 km, 1 day) with uncertainty estimates is included to provide a representation of emission uncertainties at a spatial scale pertinent to air quality modeling. MFLEI will be updated, with recent years, as the MTBS burned area product becomes available.

TI  - Calculation of Geostationary Satellites' Nominal Fixed Grid and Its Application in FY-4A Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculation of nominal fixed grid, aimed to project a given area of the earth to the nominal image, is a key technique for navigation and registration of geostationary satellites. In view of the existing nominal fixed grid definitions from coordination group for meteorological satellites (CGMS) specification and geostationary operational environmental satellite-R series (GOES-R) user's guide, whose representatives arc FY-4A, Himawari-8, MTG, Electro-I, satellites and GOES-R satellite, respectively, the formulas of CGMS and GOES-R nominal fixed grid calculation arc deduced in detail, and the difference and relationship between CGMS and GOES-R nominal grids arc summarized. Both nominal fixed grids arc defined in satellite body Cartesian coordinate system. Furthermore, the detailed transforming process from nominal image of CGMS specification to the corresponding nominal image of GOES-R definition is presented using FY-4A observations. The results demonstrate that the nominal images defined by the two aforementioned methods can be converted to each other. Besides, by comparing the scanning and stepping angles of FY-4A advanced geosynchronous radiation imager to the responding angles of GOES-R fixed grid, the differences arc 10(-16) mu rad and 10(-17) mu rad magnitude, respectively, which reveals that GOES-R fixed grid is defined from the point view of opto-mechanical design of advanced base imager. Considering that the foreign satellites, except GOES-R, all use CGMS fixed grid to calculate the nominal image, for end-user's convenience, FY-4A nominal fixed grid will adopt the internationally accepted standard projection defined in CGMS LRIT/HRIT global specification.

TI  - Three-wavelength cavity-enhanced albedometer for measuring wavelength-dependent optical properties and single-scattering albedo of aerosols
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral dependence of aerosol light absorption (alpha(abs)) and single-scattering albedo-[omega, defined as the ratio of the scattering (alpha(scat)) and extinction coefficients (alpha(ext) = alpha(abs) + alpha(scat))]-has proven effective in classifying dominant aerosol types. It is also helpful in understanding aerosol sources, transformation, climate and environmental effects, testing aerosol models. and improving the retrieval accuracy of satellite and remote sensing data. Despite the significant progress that has been made with measurement of light absorption and omega, many of the reported instruments either operate at a fixed wavelength or can only measure a single optical parameter. Quantitative multi-parameter wavelength-dependent measurement re mains a challenge. In this work. a three-wavelength cavity-enhanced albedometer was developed. The albedometer can measure multiple optical parameters, alpha(ext), alpha(scat), alpha(abs) and omega, at lambda = 365, 532, and 660 nm, in real time. The instrument's performance was evaluated using four different type laboratory generated aerosols, including polystyrene latex spheres (PSL, non-absorbing); ammonium sulfate (AS, non-absorbing); suwannee river fulvic acid (SRFA, slightly absorbing; a proxy for light absorbing organic aerosol); and nigrosin (strongly absorbing).

TI  - Identification of the disturbance and trajectory types in mining areas using multitemporal remote sensing images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface coal mining disturbances affect the local ecology, human populations and environmental quality. Thus, much public attention has been focused on mining issues and the need for monitoring of environmental disturbances in mining areas. An automatedmethod for identifyingmining disturbances, and for characterizing recovery of vegetative cover on disturbed areas using multitemporal Landsat imagery is described. The method analyzes normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to identify sample pointswithmultitemporal spectral characteristics ("trajectories") that indicate the presence of environmental disturbances caused bymining. A typical disturbance template of mining areas is created by analyzing NDVI trajectories of disturbed points and used to describe NDVI multitemporal patterns before, during, and following disturbances. Themultitemporal sequences of disturbed sample points are dynamically matchedwith the typical disturbance template to obtain information including the disturbance year, trajectory type, and the nature of vegetation recovery. The method requires manual analysis of randomly selected sample points from within the study area to calculate several thresholds; once those thresholds are determined, the method's application can be automated. We applied the method to a stack of 26 Landsat images over a 32-year period, 1984 to 2015, for mining areas of Martin County KY and Logan County WV in eastern USA. When comparedwith the samples determined by direct interpretation, the method identified mining disturbances with 97% accuracy, the disturbance year with 90% accuracy, and disturbance-recovery trajectory type with 90% accuracy.

TI  - Analysis of landscape evolution in a vulnerable coastal area under natural and human pressure
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - To preserve integrity and functioning of coastal ecosystems services, monitoring and protection actions have to be realized on an ecosystem perspective and consider an integrated observing approach. We implemented a multidisciplinary study, based on remote sensing and geophysical techniques, landscape ecology tools, and geospatial data analysis for monitoring a coastal area (Basilicata Ionian coast) with a high concentration of forest ecosystems services: five Natura 2000 protected sites, intensive agriculture, and touristic infrastructures. The analysis of landscape evolution performed within five protected sites over about 30 years (1985-2013) shows the presence of different processes acting along the investigated coast. Where coniferous forests were involved in marked fragmentation processes geophysical measurements highlighted saltwater infiltrations in superficial layers. Since severe shoreline changes interested the investigated littoral, erosional processes could have increased the saltwater intrusion phenomena favoring the forest degradation and limiting its recovery after fires. Touristic activities do not seem to alter the forest evolution except for very localized segments. The implemented study suggests that the integration of remote sensing and in situ information coupled with landscape ecology perception can be a suitable support tool for planning and management activities in coastal areas (e.g. ecological interventions, and earthen block or barrage construction).

TI  - Magnetospheric access for solar protons during the January 2005 SEP event
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The early phase of the extraordinary solar energetic particle 20 January, 2005 event having the highest peak flux of any SEP in the past 50 years of protons with energies > 100 MeV is studied. Solar energetic particles (> 16 MeV) entry to the Earth's magnetosphere on January 20, 2005 under northward interplanetary magnetic field conditions is considered based on multi-satellite data analysis and magnetic field simulation. Solar wind parameters and interplanetary magnetic field data, as well as calculations in terms of the A2000 magnetospheric magnetic field model were used to specify conditions in the Earth's environment corresponding to solar proton event. It was shown that during the early phase of the event energetic particle penetration into the magnetosphere took place in the regions on the magnetopause where the magnetospheric and interplanetary magnetic field vectors are parallel. Complex analysis of the experimental data on particle fluxes in the interplanetary medium (data from ACE spacecraft) and on low-altitude (POES) and geosynchronous (GOES) orbits inside the Earth's magnetosphere show two regions on the magnetopause responsible for particle access to the magnetosphere: the near equatorial day-side region and open field lines window at the high-latitude magnetospheric boundary. Calculations in terms of A2000 magnetospheric magnetic field model and comparison with SuperDARN images support the link between high-latitude solar energetic particle precipitations and the region at the magnetopause where the magnetospheric field is coupled with northward IMF, allowing solar particles entrance into the magnetosphere and access to the northern polar cap.

TI  - Current Imaging Techniques for Lymph Node Staging in Prostate Cancer: A Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Lymph node metastases (LNM) represent a proven prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, metastatic free survival and overall survival in prostate cancer (PCa). Although pelvic node dissection remains the gold standard for the detection of LNM, novel imaging techniques are entering clinical practice, in the effort to improve LNM detection and spare unnecessary surgeries. Aim of the current review is to describe such imaging techniques and explore their advantages and limitations.Evidence Acquisition: The National Library of Medicine Database was searched for relevant articles published between January 2013 and August 2018. A wide search was performed including the combination of following words: "Prostate" and "Cancer" and "staging" and "Lymph Node" and "imaging" and ("MRI" or " PET"). The initial list of selected papers was enriched by individual suggestions of the authors of the present review.Evidence Synthesis: DWI-MRI in detection of lymph node invasion has a sensitivity and specificity of 41 and 94%, respectively. For SPIO MRI using ferumoxtran-10, the sensitivity for detection of LNMwith short axis diameter of 5-10mmis reported at 96.4%, compared to 28.5% with MRI alone. PSMA PET/CT is growing exponentially, both in the initial detection of LNM and for BCR evaluation. Fluciclovine PET could improve detection of subcentimetric pathologic lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node techniques remain experimental and not validated in the field of PCa.Conclusions: Molecular imaging, particularly PSMA ligand PET imaging, present interesting diagnostic accuracy in LN diagnosis even in subcentimetric LN. DWI-MRI yields good results in LN involvement evaluation and the use of contrast agent such SPIO may improve the detection rate. The SLN technique is limited to experimental protocols and for intermediate or high-risk PCa. Prospective trials are awaited to evaluate the true clinical impact of these imaging techniques on PCa oncologic outcomes.

TI  - Synergy of wind wave model simulations and satellite observations during extreme events
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the quality of wave data provided by the new Sentinel-3A satellite is evaluated and the sensitivity of the wave model to wind forcing is tested. We focus on coastal areas, where altimeter data are of lower quality and wave modelling is more complex than for the open ocean. In the first part of the study, the sensitivity of the wave model to wind forcing is evaluated using data with different temporal and spatial resolution, such as ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analysis and short-range forecasts, German Weather Service (DWD) forecasts and regional atmospheric model simulations (coastDat). Numerical simulations show that the wave model forced using the ERA5 reanalyses and that forced using the ECMWF operational analysis/forecast demonstrate the best capability over the whole study period, as well as during extreme events. To further estimate the variance of the significant wave height of ensemble members for different wind forcings, especially during extreme events, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is performed. In the second part of the study, the satellite data of Sentinel-3A, Jason-2 and CryoSat-2 are assessed in comparison with in situ measurements and spectral wave model (WAM) simulations. Inter-comparisons between remote sensing and in situ observations demonstrate that the overall quality of the former is good over the North Sea and Baltic Sea throughout the study period, although the significant wave heights estimated based on satellite data tend to be greater than the in situ measurements by 7 to 26 cm. The quality of all satellite data near the coastal area decreases; however, within 10 km off the coast, Sentinel-3A performs better than the other two satellites. Analyses in which data from satellite tracks are separated in terms of onshore and offshore flights have been carried out. No substantial differences are found when comparing the statistics for onshore and offshore flights. Moreover, no substantial differences are found between satellite tracks under various metocean conditions. Furthermore, the satellite data quality does not depend on the wind direction relative to the flight direction. Thus, the quality of the data obtained by the new Sentinel-3A satellite over coastal areas is improved compared to that of older satellites.

TI  - The 2016 Mw 6.5 Nura earthquake in the Trans Alai range, northern Pamir: Possible rupture on a back-thrust fault constrained by Sentinel-1A radar interferometry
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On June 26, 2016 an Mw 6.5 earthquake occurred in the Trans-Alai Range, about 37 km west of a 2008 Mw 6.7 earthquake, both near the town of Nura, China. We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images from Sentinel-1A to image coseismic surface displacements from the most recent Nura earthquake. We invert the interferograms for both fault geometry and slip distribution. We find that the InSAR data can be described by either a steeply north-dipping fault or shallowly south-dipping fault, although only when slip on the south dipping fault is constrained to be blind. The InSAR misfit for the north-dipping fault plane is slightly lower, and the north-dipping fault better describes the gradient of deformation in the near-field. We prefer the north dipping fault geometry (similar to 67 degrees dip and 266 degrees strike) as the source for the 2016 Nura earthquake, not only due to the better fit to the InSAR, but the resulting coseismic slip model is more consistent with the focal mechanism solutions and regional seismogenic thickness; however, it is important to reiterate that the InSAR data cannot uniquely determine which model is the definitive representation of the Nura earthquake. The maximum inferred coseismic slip is about 0.75 m at similar to 14 km depth beneath the Trans Alai range, with the largest slip in the depth range of about 8-20 km. Slip does not reach the surface, and is dominated by thrust displacement with a right lateral strike-slip component. The geodetic moment of our preferred slip model is 6.61 x 10(18) N.m, equivalent to Mw 6.5. The surface projection of our preferred fault is to the south of the Pamir Frontal Thrust (PFT), and we argue it is a back-thrust of the listric PFT, suggesting that the Trans Alai range is a 'pop-up' structure.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Ethiopia: Implementation experiences and lessons learned
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global threat. High levels of AMR to commonly used antibiotics have been reported in East Africa. A situation analysis of AMR in Ethiopia also indicated high resistance levels. To prevent and contain AMR, Ethiopia established a national surveillance network.Objectives: This article describes the steps taken to prioritise AMR and establish the National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System in Ethiopia, as well as present the challenges and lessons learned through implementation.Methods: In April 2017, Ethiopia had developed and approved the National AMR Surveillance Plan for laboratory-based AMR surveillance. The World Health Organization recommendations and Ethiopias's current microbiology capacity were used to prioritise organisms for reporting. The surveillance system is comprised of a network linking the national reference laboratory with surveillance sentinel sites. Roll-out of the AMR surveillance network occurred in three phases in order to ensure successful implementation.Results: Electronic capture and transmission of data, supply chain for the microbiology laboratory and communication problems were challenges observed after implementation started. Support from Ethiopian Public Health Institute focal persons for data entry, regular scheduled communication establishment and procurement of supplies by the American Society for Microbiology were some of the measures taken to address the challenges.Conclusion: Ethiopia has demonstrated that setting up AMR surveillance in lower resource settings is possible with strong leadership and stakeholder engagement.

TI  - Estimating lake ice thickness in Central Ontario
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are a key geographical feature in Canada and have an impact on the regional climate. In the winter, they are important for recreational activities such as snowmobiling and ice fishing and act as part of an important supply route for northern communities. The ability to accurately report lake ice characteristics such as thickness is vital, however, it is underreported in Canada and there is a lack of lake ice thickness records for temperate latitude areas such as Central Ontario. Here, we evaluate the application of previously developed temperature models and RADARSAT-2 for estimating lake ice thickness in Central Ontario and provide insight into the regions long term ice thickness variability. The ALS Environmental Science Shallow Water Ice Profiler (SWIP) was used for validation of both temperature and radar-based models. Results indicate that the traditional approach that uses temperatures to predict ice thickness during ice growth has low RMSE values of 2.3 cm and correlations of greater than 0.9. For ice decay, similar low RMSE values of 2.1 cm and high correlations of 0.97 were found. Using RADARSAT-2 to estimate ice thickness results in R-2 values of 0.6 (p < 0.01) but high RMSE values of 11.7 cm. Uncertainty in the RADARSAT-2 approach may be linked to unexplored questions about scattering mechanisms and the interaction of radar signal with mid-latitude lake ice. The application of optimized temperature models to a long-term temperature record revealed a thinning of ice cover by 0.81 cm per decade.

T2  - Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To obtain HIV incidence among injection drug users (IDU) and female sex workers (FSW) in Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan Province during 2009-2017. Methods: We recruited drug users and female sex workers from all sentinel surveillance sites across Dehong Prefecture during 2009-2017. A total of 10 480 IDU and 18 126 FSW in Dehong Prefecture were recruited by fingerprint technique. Data about drug uses, commercial sexual behavior, sociodemographic characteristics was collected by structured questionnaire. HIV-positive patients who were long-term infected or with CD4(+) T cell count was ≤200 were not included for further HIV incidence testing. Also, those who self-identified as on antiretroviral treatment (ART) or AIDS cases were also excluded. A total of 841 and 157 plasma specimens from IDU and FSW that met the inclusion criterion were finally included, respectively. Limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay(LAg-Avidity EIA) were performed to calculate the HIV incidence among these two sub-populations. Results: A total of 3 444 IDU were HIV-positive, among which 884 (25.7%) were Burmese with age of (30.4±7.7), and 2 560 were Chinese with age of (36.6±7.3). Among 228 HIV-positive FSW, 109 (47.8%) were Burmese with age of (27.1±6.3), 119 (52.5%) were Chinese with age of (29.9±11.1). For IDU, the estimated HIV incidence among Burmese in 2009-2010, 2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2017 was 4.20% (95%CI: -0.55%-8.95%), 7.75% (95%CI: 2.95%-12.55%), 11.79% (95%CI: 5.38%-18.20%), 10.30% (95%CI: 5.67%-14.94%), respectively, while Chinese were 3.11% (95%CI: 1.59%-4.64%), 0.03% (95%CI: -0.03%-0.08%), 1.55% (95%CI: 0.54%-2.57%), 0.58% (95%CI: -0.06%-1.04%), respectively. In 2009-2011, 2012-2014, 2015-2017, estimated HIV incidence among Burmese FSW was 0.22% (95%CI: -0.21%-0.64%), 1.24%(95%CI: 0.15%-2.32%), 0.55%(95%CI: 0.01%-1.08%). Whereas, estimated HIV incidence among Chinese FSW was 0.62% (95%CI: 0.25%-0.98%), 0.11% (95%CI: -0.04%-0.26%), 0.22% (95%CI: 0-0.44%). Conclusion: HIV incidences among Chinese IDU and FSW are on the downward trend, while Burmese IDU and FSW seem to be gaining momentum.

TI  - Estimation of paddy rice leaf area index using machine learning methods based on hyperspectral data from multi-year experiments
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of three machine learning methods (support vector regression, random forests and artificial neural network) for estimating the LAI of paddy rice was evaluated in this study. Traditional univariate regression models involving narrowband NDVI with optimized band combinations as well as linear multivariate calibration partial least squares regression models were also evaluated for comparison. A four year field-collected dataset was used to test the robustness of LAI estimation models against temporal variation. The partial least squares regression and three machine learning methods were built on the raw hyperspectral reflectance and the first derivative separately. Two different rules were used to determine the models' key parameters. The results showed that the combination of the red edge and NIR bands (766 nm and 830 nm) as well as the combination of SWIR bands (1114 nm and 1190 nm) were optimal for producing the narrowband NDVI. The models built on the first derivative spectra yielded more accurate results than the corresponding models built on the raw spectra. Properly selected model parameters resulted in comparable accuracy and robustness with the empirical optimal parameter and significantly reduced the model complexity. The machine learning methods were more accurate and robust than the VI methods and partial least squares regression. When validating the calibrated models against the standalone validation dataset, the VI method yielded a validation RMSE value of 1.17 for NDVI(766,830) and 1.01 for NDVI(1114,1190), while the best models for the partial least squares, support vector machine and artificial neural network methods yielded validation RMSE values of 0.84, 0.82, 0.67 and 0.84, respectively. The RF models built on the first derivative spectra with mtry = 10 showed the highest potential for estimating the LAI of paddy rice.

TI  - Photoelectric Synergetic Responsive Slippery Surfaces Based on Tailored Anisotropic Films Generated by Interfacial Directional Freezing
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart responsive slippery surfaces are highly desirable for their potential applications in many fields. Although slippery surfaces that respond to a single external stimulus are reported, challenges in fabricating synergetic responsive anisotropic slippery surfaces remain due to limitations in the preparation of the underlying anisotropic substrate. Here, photoelectric synergetic responsive slippery surfaces are fabricated based on anisotropic porous films that are tailored by using an interfacial directional freezing technique using a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)/[6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) binary system. The anisotropic surface structure of P3HT/PCBM films is facilely tailored by simply tuning the freezing speed, the P3HT/PCBM mass ratio, and the total concentration of solution. A detailed formation mechanism is proposed and elucidated. Moreover, anisotropic slippery surfaces demonstrate remarkable photoelectric synergetic behavior, which is used for the photoelectric synergetic control of droplet sliding and interfacial sentinel oxidative degradation. The in-depth understanding of the formation mechanism of the anisotropic porous film may enable the interfacial directional freezing method to be extended to the design of other multifunctional anisotropic surfaces. This work will provide a theoretical basis for the design of new types of smart slippery surfaces, which are potentially useful in microfluidics, lab-on-chips, photoelectric displays, interfacial microreactors, and other related fields.

TI  - Egg Parasitoids of <i>Dalbulus maidis </i>(Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) Within Maize Agroecosystems and in the Edge Zones of Maize Fields, and on Maize Varieties During the Wet Season in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about Dalbulus maidis (DeLong) egg parasitoids within maize fields, in the edge zones that surround these fields, and the parasitism on D. maidis eggs oviposited on different maize varieties. The objectives of the present study were first to understand which egg parasitoid species attack D. maidis eggs within maize fields and in the surrounding edge zones, and second, to compare parasitism on two maize varieties (land race Ancho-pozolero and hybridTigre-Asgrow) during the maize-growing wet season. We used maize plants with sentinel eggs to attract the egg parasitoids in two consecutive wet seasons, in 2016 and 2016. In 2016, Anagrus sp. (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) and Paracentrobia sp. (Hymenoptera:Trichogrammatidae) parasitized D. maidis eggs within the maize field and on its edges. However, much more parasitism was seen within the maize agroecosystem than in the maize edge zones. In 2016, two Mymaridae species, Anagrus columbi Perkins and Anagrus sp, and two Trichogrammatidae genera, Pseudoligosita sp. and Paracentrobia sp., attacked the D. maidis eggs laid on maize hybrids but not those oviposited on the maize land race. Our findings indicate that parasitism of corn leafhopper eggs differs with agroecosystem location and maize varieties.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A growing number of studies observe associations between the amount of green space around a mother's home and positive birth outcomes; however, the robustness of this association and potential pathways of action remain unclear.Objectives: To examine associations between mother's residential green space and term birth weight within the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study and examine specific hypothesized pathways.Methods: We examined 2510 births located in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Toronto Canada. Green space was estimatedaround mother's residences during pregnancyusingLandsat 30 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We examined hypothesized pathways of: (1) reduction of environmental exposure; (2) built environment features promoting physical activity; (3) psychosocial conditions; and (4) psychological influences. Linear regression was used to assess associations between green space and term birth weight adjusting first for a comprehensive set of confounding factors and then incrementally for pathway variables.Results: Fully adjusted models showed non-statistically significant increases in term birth weight with increasing green space. For example, a 0.1 increase in NDVI within 500 m was associated with a 21.5 g (95% CI -4.6, 47.7) increase in term birth weight. Associations varied by city and were most robust for high-density locations. For the two largest cities (Vancouver and Toronto), we observed an increase in birth weight of 41.2 g (95% CI 7.8, 74.6) for a 0.1 increase in NDVI within 500 m. We did not observe substantial reductions in the green space effect on birth weight when adjusting for pathway variables.Conclusion: Our results highlight the need to further characterize the interactions between green space, urban density and climate related factors as well as the pathways linking residential green space to birth outcomes.

TI  - Tailored axillary surgery with or without axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer (TAXIS): study protocol for a multicenter, randomized phase-III trial
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Complete lymph node removal through conventional axillary dissection (ALND) has been standard treatment for breast cancer patients for almost a century. In the 1990s, however, and in parallel with the advent of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure, ALND came under increasing scrutiny due to its association with significant patient morbidity. Several studies have since provided evidence to suggest omission of ALND, often in favor of axillary radiation, in selected clinically node-negative, SLN-positive patients, thus supporting the current trend in clinical practice. Clinically node-positive patients, by contrast, continue to undergo ALND in many cases, if only for the lack of studies re-assessing the indication for ALND in these patients. Hence, there is a need for a clinical trial to evaluate the optimal treatment for clinically node-positive breast cancer patients in terms of surgery and radiotherapy. The TAXIS trial is designed to fill this gap by examining in particular the value of tailored axillary surgery (TAS), a new technique for selectively removing positive lymph nodes.Methods: In this international, multicenter, phase-III, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial (RCT), including 34 study sites from four different countries, we plan to randomize 1500 patients to either receive TAS followed by ALND and regional nodal irradiation excluding the dissected axilla, or receive TAS followed by regional nodal irradiation including the full axilla. All patients undergo adjuvant whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery and chest-wall irradiation after mastectomy. The main objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that treatment with TAS and axillary radiotherapy is non-inferior to ALND in terms of disease-free survival of clinically node-positive breast cancer patients in the era of effective systemic therapy and extended regional nodal irradiation. The trial was activated on 31 July 2018 and the first patient was randomized on 7 August 2018.Discussion: Designed to test the hypothesis that TAS is non-inferior to ALND in terms of curing patients and preventing recurrences, yet is significantly superior in reducing patient morbidity, this trial may establish a new worldwide treatment standard in breast cancer surgery. If found to be non-inferior to standard treatment, TAS may significantly contribute to reduce morbidity in breast cancer patients by avoiding surgical overtreatment.

TI  - Pre-launch calibration results of the TROPOMI payload on-board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite was successfully launched on 13 October 2017, carrying the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) as its single payload. TROPOMI is the next-generation atmospheric sounding instrument, continuing the successes of GOME, SCIA-MACHY, OMI, and OMPS, with higher spatial resolution, improved sensitivity, and extended wavelength range. The instrument contains four spectrometers, divided over two modules sharing a common telescope, measuring the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared reflectance of the Earth. The imaging system enables daily global coverage using a push-broom configuration, with a spatial resolution as low as 7 x 3.5 km(2) in nadir from a Sun-synchronous orbit at 824 km and an Equator crossing time of 13:30 local solar time.This article reports the pre-launch calibration status of the TROPOMI payload as derived from the on-ground calibration effort. Stringent requirements are imposed on the quality of on-ground calibration in order to match the high sensitivity of the instrument.A new methodology has been employed during the analysis of the obtained calibration measurements to ensure the consistency and validity of the calibration. This was achieved by using the production-grade Level 0 to 1b data processor in a closed-loop validation set-up. Using this approach the consistency between the calibration and the L1b product, as well as confidence in the obtained calibration result, could be established.This article introduces this novel calibration approach and describes all relevant calibrated instrument properties as they were derived before launch of the mission. For most of the relevant properties compliance with the calibration requirements could be established, including the knowledge of the instrument spectral and spatial response functions. Partial compliance was established for the straylight correction; especially the out-of-spectral-band correction for the near-infrared channel needs future validation. The absolute radiometric calibration of the radiance and irradiance responsivity is compliant with the high-level mission requirements, but not with the stricter calibration requirements as the available on-ground validation shows. The relative radiometric calibration of the Sun port was non-compliant. The non-compliant subjects will be addressed during the in-flight commissioning phase in the first 6 months following launch.

TI  - Composition and Vertical Stratification of Phlebotomine Sand Fly Fauna and the Molecular Detection of <i>Leishmania</i> in Forested Areas in Rondonia State Municipalities, Western Amazon, Brazil
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined sand fly diversity and the natural infection of sand flies by Leishmania in three localities in Rondonia State: Santo Antonio and Sao Vicente farm, which are anthropized environments, and the Jamari FLONA, which has not been anthropized. Sand flies were collected in canopies and at ground level using CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel CO2 traps. Female sand flies were grouped into pools that were subjected to DNA extraction and the samples were subjected to PCR to detect and identify Leishmania. A total of 6696 specimens were examined and 52 species were identified. Abundance was greater in canopies than at ground level (n = 5657 and n = 1039, respectively); however, fauna composition was more diverse at ground level. A total of 4870 specimens were collected using CDC light traps and 1826 specimens were collected using BG-Sentinel traps. The presence of Leishmania DNA was detected in 12 pools, and Leishmania species profiles were identified in three of these pools: one pool of Psychodopygus amazonensis and one pool of Psychodopygus chagasi infected with Le. (Vi.) braziliensis, and one pool of Psychodopygus davisi infected with Le. (Le.) amazonensis. Sand flies are sensitive to environmental modification and species diversity is greater in regions that have experienced less anthropization. Although the annual infection rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis is high in Rondonia State, the role that sand flies play in the leishmaniasis transmission cycle remains poorly understood. The high abundance of Ps. davisi and Trichophoromyia auraensis and the presence in these species of natural infection by Leishmania spp. suggest that these species are acting as vectors of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Rondonia.

TI  - Stably high azithromycin resistance and decreasing ceftriaxone susceptibility in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in 25 European countries, 2016
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP) performs annual sentinel surveillance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae susceptibility to therapeutically relevant antimicrobials across the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). We present the Euro-GASP results from 2016 (25 countries), linked to patient epidemiological data, and compared with data from previous years.MethodsAgar dilution and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) gradient strip methodologies were used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility (using EUCAST breakpoints) of 2660N. gonorrhoeae isolates from 25 countries across the EU/EEA. Significance of differences compared with Euro-GASP results in previous years was analysed using Z-tests.ResultsNo isolates with resistance to ceftriaxone (MIC >0.125mg/L) were detected in 2016 (one in 2015). However, the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MICs from 0.03mg/L to 0.125mg/L) increased significantly (p=0.01) from 2015 to 2016. There were 14 (0.5%) isolates with ceftriaxone MICs 0.125mg/L (on the resistance breakpoint), of which one isolate was resistant to azithromycin and four showed intermediate susceptibility to azithromycin. Cefixime resistance was detected in 2.1% of isolates in 2016 compared with 1.7% in 2015 (p=0.26) and azithromycin resistance in 7.5% in 2016 compared with 7.1% in 2015 (p=0.74). Seven (0.3%) isolates from five countries displayed high-level azithromycin resistance (MIC256mg/L) in 2016 compared with five (0.2%) isolates in 2015. Resistance rate to ciprofloxacin was 46.5% compared with 49.4% in 2015 (p=0.06). No isolates were resistant to spectinomycin and the MICs of gentamicin remained stable compared with previous years.ConclusionsOverall AMR rates in gonococci in EU/EEA remained stable from 2015 to 2016. However, the ceftriaxone MIC distribution shifted away from the most susceptible (0.016mg/L) and the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone increased significantly. This development is of concern as current European gonorrhoea management guideline recommends ceftriaxone 500mg plus azithromycin 2g as first-line therapy. With azithromycin resistance at 7.5%, the increasing ceftriaxone MICs might soon threaten the effectiveness of this therapeutic regimen and requires close monitoring.

TI  - An analysis of SPECT/CT non-visualization of sentinel lymph nodes in renal tumors
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after intratumoral injection of Tc-99m labeled nanocolloid and imaging with scintigraphy and SPECT/CT in renal tumors is feasible. However, sentinel lymph node (SN) non-detection rate with scintigraphy and SPECT/CT is high. The aim of the study was to determine factors affecting non-visualization (NV) of SN imaging in renal tumors. Seventy-eight patients with cT1-3 renal tumors received intratumoral injection of 225MBq Tc-99m-labeled nanocolloid 1day before (partial) nephrectomy. Radiotracer injection was followed by anterioposterior and lateral scintigraphy in combination with SPECT/CT 20min and 2-4h after. Surgical treatment of the tumor with sentinel lymph node biopsy by aid of -probe and-camera was performed the next day. Scintigraphy and SPECT/CT images were evaluated and patient, tumor, and procedure characteristics were collected for 73 eligible patients used in uni- and multivariable analysis of a potential association with NV.ResultsA total of 80 (mean 1.1, IQR 0-2, max 6) sentinel lymph nodes in 46 patients were detected with scintigraphy and SPECT/CT. Preoperative visualization rate and intraoperative detection rate was 63% [95% CI 50-73%] and 61% [95% CI 49-72%], respectively. In uni- and multivariable analysis, the only factor associated with non-visualization was age, showing higher odds of non-visualization with higher age.ConclusionOur study demonstrated that non-visualization of SNs in renal tumors is relatively high and is associated with patient age. Furthermore, kidneys and also its tumors are highly vascularized which may cause a wash-out effect that could be identified with decreased kidney-liver ratios. However, in our data, the effect was statistically inconclusive. Further studies are needed to improve visualization and standardize the procedure of SLNB in renal tumors. The percentage of NV limits the use of SLNB for research and clinical purposes in renal cancer.

TI  - The fear of terrorism and shift in cosmopolitan values
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how international tourists' cosmopolitan values change due to the restraining fear of terrorism, and how this change affects their worldview, destination perception and travel preferences. Design/methodology/approach In-depth interviews were conducted with international travellers from all five continents to pinpoint the universal shifts in cosmopolitan values, specifically regarding risk perception in the face of terrorism. Findings Tourists' personal values are changing due to the increased risk of terrorism (or the perception of it), which prompts international travellers to act less on their desire for stimulation and more for their need for security when travelling. Just as any change in values tends to be relatively permanent, this value shift might have long-term consequences for the entire tourism industry. Research limitations/implications Terrorism risk perception and its retraining effect regarding willingness to travel were established to be significant and universal. However, this study suggests that the strength of the travellers' cosmopolitan orientation influences the extent terrorism risk is acted upon. Results indicate that the higher the travellers' cosmopolitan conviction is, the less significantly they seem to be affected by the fear of terrorism. Practical implications The study offers cues on how managers and policy makers can enhance destination image that keeps up with the current realities of global tourism in the face of terrorism, and highlights a promising market segment, strongly cosmopolitan travellers who are less concerned with potential travel risks and react less negatively in troubled times. Originality/value Most of the previous studies considered tourists' cosmopolitanism as a stable orientation rather than a context-specific state. This study addresses this gap by exploring how resilient the tourists' cosmopolitan desire for openness and freedom is under the risk perception of terrorism, and what effect the fear of terrorism has on their travel habits.

TI  - Novel tools for the surveillance and control of dengue: findings by the dengueTools research consortium
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Dengue fever persists as a major global disease burden, and may increase as a consequence of climate change. Along with other measures, research actions to improve diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and predictive models are highly relevant. The European Commission funded the DengueTools consortium to lead a major initiative in these areas, and this review synthesises the outputs and findings of this work conducted from 2011 to 2016.Research areas: DengueTools organised its work into three research areas, namely [1] Early warning and surveillance systems; [2] Strategies to prevent dengue in children; and [3] Predictive models for the global spread of dengue.Research area 1 focused on case-studies undertaken in Sri Lanka, including developing laboratory-based sentinel surveillance, evaluating economic impact, identifying drivers of transmission intensity, evaluating outbreak prediction capacity and developing diagnostic capacity. Research area 2 addressed preventing dengue transmission in school children, with case-studies undertaken in Thailand. Insecticide-treated school uniforms represented an intriguing potential approach, with some encouraging results, but which were overshadowed by a lack of persistence of insecticide on the uniforms with repeated washing. Research area 3 evaluated potential global spread of dengue, particularly into dengue-naive areas such as Europe. The role of international travel, changing boundaries of vectors, developing models of vectorial capacity under different climate change scenarios and strategies for vector control in outbreaks was all evaluated.Concluding remarks: DengueTools was able to make significant advances in methods for understanding and controlling dengue transmission in a range of settings. These will have implications for public health agendas to counteract dengue, including vaccination programmes.Outlook: Towards the end of the DengueTools project, Zika virus emerged as an unexpected epidemic in the central and southern America. Given the similarities between the dengue and Zika viruses, with vectors in common, some of the DengueTools thinking translated readily into the Zika situation.

TI  - Characterizing hydrothermal alteration zones in Hamama area in the central Eastern Desert of Egypt by remotely sensed data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques provide meaningful information to mineral exploration by identifying the hydrothermally altered minerals and the fracture/fault systems. In this article, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were processed to detect the hydrothermal alteration zones in Hamama area in the central part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Band ratios and principal component analyses successfully revealed the extent and the geometry of the hydrothermal alteration zones that trend in an NE-SW direction. Matching pixel spectrum derived from Minimum Noise Fraction, Pixel Purity Index, and n-dimensional visualization with reference spectra allowed characterizing key hydrothermal alteration minerals, including chlorite, kaolinite-smectite, muscovite, and haematite, in a successive alteration pattern. Field investigations and X-Ray Diffraction analysis validated the results revealed by ASTER data. In addition, the present prospects of significant gold and massive sulphide mineralizations are consistent with the detected hydrothermal alteration zone.

TI  - Characterization of the spatial variability of surface topography and moisture content and its influence on potato crop yield
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing the cause of the spatial variability of crop (Solanum tuberosum L.) yield is of a great importance to farmers who plan to apply precision agriculture techniques. Therefore, a study on two centre pivot irrigated potato fields in Saudi Arabia was conducted to detect and assess the spatial dependencies among three variables (surface topography, moisture content, and potato yield) and to examine the influence of surface topography and moisture on the potato yield. In addition to surface elevation data in the form of digital elevation model, cloud-free satellite images of Landsat-8 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were acquired throughout the study period. Samples of potato yield were collected 2 days prior to the harvest time and upscaled into yield maps using the interpolation technique in ArcGIS software program. Soil field capacity (F-C) and permanent wilting point (PWP) were determined for the study area and utilized to generate moisture content maps using thermal inertia method. The study employed the bivariate Moran's Index (Moran's I) and the Bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation in order to measure the strength of the spatial autocorrelation and to quantify the spatial dependency between each two of the acquired variables. The interpretation of the mapped topography, cumulative moisture, and yield revealed a substantial agreement along the spatial distribution of the high moisture and yield values with the adverse value of the surface elevation. Results of the spatial autocorrelation indicated that the spatial patterns of moisture-yield over the two study fields were strongly associated with high-high clustering level covering an area of 42% of field 68-S and 39% of field 44-S, while topography-yield patterns over field 68-S and 44-S covered only 25% and 22% of the areas, respectively, with a confidence level of 0.01 for all patterns at both fields.

TI  - Daily evapotranspiration at sub-kilometre spatial resolution by combining observations from geostationary and polar-orbit satellites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimates based on remote sensing are constrained by the spatial and temporal resolution of spaceborne observations. Therefore, the choice to be made is whether modelling at high temporal resolution with geostationary satellites at the cost of the spatial detail, or spatially detailed instantaneous modelling at overpass-time with polar-orbit satellites. This study aimed at exploiting the strength of both modelling approaches and derive daily ET estimates with cell size 1.0 km. The study was conducted in four sites with different land cover arrangements and catalogued as wetlands. The methodological approach was based on the algorithm behind the operational ET product of the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF) initiative. The examined period comprised the end of the Spot-Vegetation (Spot-V) mission and the first year of Proba-V operational modus. Two aspects were investigated: 1. The adequacy of combining observations from geostationary and Spot-V and Proba-V satellite missions for obtaining the target product; and, 2. The intercompatibility of ET estimates based on Spot-V and Proba-V so that continuous series over the operational period of both missions could be built. The comparison of simulated ET with in situ measured fluxes (eddy covariance) showed that the introduction of more spatial detail through polar-satellite observations resulted in the reduction of bias and root-mean-square error in ET estimates, as compared with estimations where Earth observation data were taken from geostationary satellites only. Moreover, the signals derived from Spot-V and Proba-V exhibited similarity during the period of operational overlap; especially in non-cultivated surfaces. This suggests that continuity objective of these two missions can be exploited in the estimation of ET time series.

TI  - MODIS satellite data evaluation for sand and dust storm monitoring in Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of wind-blown desert sand and dust are a major concern of environmental and climate study due to their global extent. This article investigates the sand and dust storms detection in Saudi Arabia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, both from Terra and Aqua satellite systems for the years 2002-2011. Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI) is applied for the detection of sand and dust storms whilst MODIS band 31 is applied to discriminate atmospheric sand and dust from that present on the ground. In addition, the data from Meteosat satellite, AERONET station, and meteorological stations are used to validate NDDI-based sand and dust storm events. The results of the study show that NDDI can successfully identify and differentiate sand and dust storms from clouds whilst MODIS band 31 can discriminate aerial and surface sand and dust over Saudi Arabia. The results also show that the multi-source data, that is MODIS, Meteosat, AERONET, and meteorological stations, can be very valuable for tracking sand and dust storm events. As no such attempt in the past has been made in Saudi Arabia, it is envisaged that the results of this study will be helpful in planning remote-sensing data for the climate change study in the region.

TI  - The development of spectral indices for detecting built-up land areas and their relationship with land-surface temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different spectral indices were provided for the classification of built-up lands using satellite images, but the importance of the blue band in the classification, fusion, and image enhancement prior to the calculation of spectral indices has received less attention so far. This study introduces a new index based on blue band and run it along with six other spectral indices. The method of study is as follows, after the selection of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images, the initial pre-processing was done on the images and in the second stage, the enhancement and the fusion were performed. In the third stage, the built-up lands were classified using spectral indices. Otsu's thresholding method was used on all indices to separate built-up and non-built-up lands. To assess the accuracy, 3500 reference points were used. The results showed that when fusion and image enhancement were performed, overall accuracy (OA) increased by 3% to 6.71% for Landsat 7 images, and 2.14% to 6.71% for Landsat 8 images. The results also showed that after fusion and image enhancement, the visible blue band and first shortwave infrared index (VbSWIR1-BI) with an OA of 92.88% (Landsat 7) and 91.68% (Landsat 8) indicate the highest OA. The percentage of built-up lands changes according to spectral indices ranges from 6.38% to 25 .76% and the largest and lowest amount of built-up land on the basis of the VbSWIR1-BI index belonging to districts 12 and 22, respectively.

TI  - Combining high spatial resolution multi-temporal satellite data with leaf-on LiDAR to enhance tree species discrimination at the crown level
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-standing goal of discriminating tree species at the crown-level from high spatial resolution imagery remains challenging. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether combining (a) high spatial resolution multi-temporal images from different phenological periods (spring, summer and autumn), and (b) leaf-on LiDAR height and intensity data can enhance the ability to discriminate the species of individual tree crowns of red oak (Quercus rubra), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and black cherry (Prunus serotina) in the Fernow Experimental Forest, West Virginia, USA. We used RandomForest models to measure a loss of classification accuracy caused by iteratively removing from the classification one or more groups from six groups of variables: spectral reflectance from all multispectral bands in the (1) spring, (2) summer, and (3) autumn images, (4) vegetation indices derived from the three multispectral datasets, (5) canopy height and intensity from the LiDAR imagery, and (6) texture related variables from the panchromatic and LiDAR datasets. We also used ANOVA and decision tree analyses to elucidate how the multispectral and LiDAR datasets combine to help discriminate tree species based on their unique phenological, spectral, textural, and crown architectural traits. From these results, we conclude that combing high spatial resolution multi-temporal satellite data with LiDAR datasets can enhance the ability to discriminate tree species at the crown level.

TI  - Estimation of land subsidence in deltaic areas through differential SAR interferometry: the Po River Delta case study (Northeast Italy)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River deltas are very complex environments vulnerable to flooding. Most of the world's deltas are facing the immediate threat of land subsidence that jeopardizes the safety of millions of people worldwide. In Italy, the Po River Delta (PRD) (Northeast Italy) is an area historically affected by high rate of subsidence due to natural and anthropic factors. Even if the subsidence rates remarkably reduced during the last three decades, this process continues to be alarming in particular in low-lying sectors and along the coastline, where the loss of elevation, combined with the sea-level rise, increases the risk related to flooding. In this study, we monitored the subsidence affecting the entire PRD area with advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (A-DInSAR) techniques applied to three C-band SAR data sets acquired by the European Remote Sensing satellites, Environmental Satellite, and Sentinel-1A satellite in the last 25 years (from 1992 to 2017). The results of the interferometric processing, consisting of both mean velocity and displacement time series along the satellite line of sight, validated by comparison with levelling and global positioning system measurements, show increasing subsidence moving from the inland to the coastline, with maximum deformation velocities, for the most recent data, in the order of -30 mm year(-1). In particular, many embankments near the coastal area are affected by high values of subsidence, which increase the flooding hazard of the entire deltaic territory. This work shows the importance of adopting A-DInSAR techniques to update the knowledge of the extent and rates of deformation of subsiding areas in low-lying territories such as river deltas. The outputs of such monitoring can be of primary importance for the future protection of the territory and the flooding risk mitigation.

TI  - New algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in the Spanish waters of the Western Mediterranean Sea from multiplatform imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utility of global and regional algorithms for retrieving surface chlorophyll-a values from satellite images of MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard Aqua and Terra Satellites, SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor), MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) is tested in a wide region of the Western Mediterranean Sea, the Spanish Mediterranean. The comparison between chlorophyll-a concentration obtained from samples collected and satellite concentrations calculated with global and regional algorithms for this area demonstrates that satellites overestimate the surface chlorophyll-a. In this work, a set of new algorithms, namely SMED (Spanish MEDiterranean algorithms), are proposed to improve the estimations of surface chlorophyll-a in our study area. The SMED set of algorithms employs the linear function to fit the standard Maximum Band Ratios (MBR) to the in situ surface chlorophyll-a concentration (in logarithmic scale). The implementation of the SMED algorithms is simple, and the accuracy is as good as more complex algorithms like OC5 (5 band algorithms tuned for European Atlantic and tested successfully in the Mediterranean Sea). The improvement of SMED algorithms is important respect to MedOC (built based in data of the Mediterranean Sea) for all sensors, ranging 17%-37% in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2). In the case of OC algorithms (standard global algorithms currently operative for most ocean colour sensors), SMED also improves the estimates in 11%-22%, except in 4% for MERIS. Additionally, when comparing satellite estimates with in situ chlorophyll-a in log-log scale, SMED achieved the best correspondence, even with respect to OC5. During the calibration procedure MERIS remote sensing reflectances (RRS) showed a higher sensitivity to the presence of mineral aerosols, and therefore it is strongly recommended to include the value of Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) in the algorithms for chlorophyll in the region under study. A regional algorithm for VIIRS ocean colour sensor is also proposed based on a matchup database built from spatially and temporary distributed SMED chlorophyll-a values of MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS RRS. Our analysis suggests that SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS based SMED algorithms can support generating a multiplatform time series in the region.

TI  - An interval number distance- and ranking-based method for remotely sensed image fuzzy clustering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuzzy c-means clustering is an important non-supervised classification method for remote-sensing images and is based on type-1 fuzzy set theory. Type-1 fuzzy sets use singleton values to express the membership grade; therefore, such sets cannot describe the uncertainty of the membership grade. Interval type-2 fuzzy c-means (IT2FCM) clustering and relevant methods are based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Real vectors are used to describe the clustering centres, and the average values of the upper and lower membership grades are used to determine the classification of each pixel. Thus, the width information for interval clustering centres and interval membership grades are ignored. The main contribution of this article is to propose an improved IT2FCM* algorithm by adopting interval number distance (IND) and ranking methods, which use the width information of interval clustering centres and interval membership grades, thus distinguishing this method from existing fuzzy clustering methods. Three different IND definitions are tested, and the distance definition proposed by Li shows the best performance. The second contribution of this work is that two fuzzy cluster validity indices, FS- and XB-, are improved using the IND. Three types of multi/hyperspectral remote-sensing data sets are used to test this algorithm, and the experimental results show that the IT2FCM* algorithm based on the IND proposed by Li performs better than the IT2FCM algorithm using four cluster validity indices, the confusion matrix, and the kappa coefficient (kappa). Additionally, the improved FS- index has more indicative ability than the original FS- index.

TI  - Feature clustering and ranking for selecting stable features from high dimensional remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High dimensional remote sensing data sets typically contain redundancy amongst the features. Traditional approaches to feature selection are prone to instability and selection of sub-optimal features in these circumstances. They can also be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with very large remote sensing data sets. This article presents an efficient, deterministic feature ranking method that is robust to redundancy. Affinity propagation is used to group correlated features into clusters. A relevance criterion is evaluated for each feature. Clusters are then ranked based on the median of the relevance values of their constituent features. The most relevant individual features can then be selected automatically from the best clusters. Other criteria, such as computation time or measurement cost, can optionally be considered interactively when making this selection. The proposed feature selection method is compared to competing filter approach methods on a number of remote sensing data sets containing feature redundancy. Mutual information and naive Bayes relevance criteria were evaluated in conjunction with the feature selection methods. Using the proposed method it was shown that the stability of selected features improved under different data samplings, while similar or better classification accuracies were achieved compared to competing methods.

TI  - Describing prairie C4 plant species area coverage using hyperspectral reflectance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - C3 and C4 photosynthesis pathways represent fundamental differences in vegetation characteristics and physiology. Spectral reflectance collected on the ground and from satellite successfully described the fraction of C4 species coverage in the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Reserve (LTER) which supports a grassland made up of mixtures of C3 and C4 plants. Plant species area coverage was measured within the LTER and also at study sites of the First International Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment (FIFE) in 1987. Ground-measured visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral reflectances were collected in FIFE and from a 2015 Hyperion spectrometer image from the Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) successfully described C4 cover fraction from the FIFE ground VNIR reflectances (R-2 = 0.75). Convolving the bands to 10-nm Hyperion spectral bands decreased the accuracy of the retrievals (R-2 = 0.43). PLSR applied to Hyperion reflectances extracted for the LTER watersheds was also successful describing C4 cover fraction for the VNIR Hyperion bands (R-2 = 0.89), but showed little improvement when the shortwave infrared bands were included (R-2 = 0.92). The coefficients from the FIFE data convolved to VNIR Hyperion bands are similar to the coefficients derived from the Hyperion data, suggesting this approach works over a range of conditions and spatial scales.

TI  - Coastal wetland classification with multiseasonal high-spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of wetland distribution is required for wetland conservation, management, and restoration, but remains a challenge due to the complexity of wetland landscapes. This research employed four seasons of multispectral images from Gaofen-1 satellite to map wetland land-cover distribution in Hangzhou bay coastal wetland (245 km(2)) in China. Maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), random forest (RF), and the expert-based approach were examined based on spectral, spatial, and phenological features. The results showed that land-cover classification accuracies of 83.9% using RF and 90.3% using the expert-based approach were obtained, and they had higher accuracy than MLC, which had an overall accuracy of only 63.3%. The high classification accuracy for nine land-cover classes using the expert-based approach indicated the important role of expert knowledge from the phenological features in improving wetland classification accuracy. As high spatial resolution satellite images become more easily obtainable, effective use of temporal information of different sensor data will be valuable for detailed land-cover classification with higher accuracy. The approach to establish expert rules from multitemporal images provides a new way to improve land-cover classification in different terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Dynamic estimating of wetland vegetation cover based on linear spectral mixture and time phase transformation models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, remote sensing is being used to monitor vegetation degradation in areas of concern. In recent years, drought and water shortages have caused significant degradation of the wetland vegetation in Zhalong Wetland of Heilongjiang province, China. This paper employed middle- and high-resolution Landsat images to construct a Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis of the wetland, with the end member extraction verified by feasibility analysis and with vegetation cover data extracted over nearly 30 years. By considering the problem of poor timing with middle- and high-resolution images, this paper proposes a phase-transform method that combines the time advantage of moderate-resolution spectroradiometer images with the spatial advantage of high-resolution Landsat imagery. Based on an intensity analysis model, the temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation cover in the study area were analyzed using a time scale and the level of vegetation cover. The results show that (1) from 1985 to 2015, the vegetation cover showed an overall tendency to degrade, and (2) vegetation cover was extracted based on the phase transformation and linear spectral mixture models with an accuracy of 0.8628, which is higher than that of traditional remote sensing methods. Improving the prediction accuracy in vegetation transfer is of great theoretical value in relation to global climate change.

TI  - Mapping daily leaf area index at 30 m resolution over a meadow steppe area by fusing Landsat, Sentinel-2A and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key vegetation canopy structure parameter and is closely associated with vegetation photosynthesis, transpiration, and energy balance. Developing a landscape-scale LAI dataset with a high temporal resolution (daily) is essential for capturing rapidly changing vegetation structure at field scales and supporting regional biophysical modeling efforts. In this study, two daily 30 m LAI time series from 2014 to 2016 over a meadow steppe site in northern China were generated using a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) combined with an LAI retrieval radiative transfer model (PROSAIL). Gap-filled Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A surface reflectance (SR) images were used to generate fine-resolution LAI maps with the PROSAIL look-up table method. Two daily 500 m moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product-the existing MCD15A3H LAI product and one was generated from the MCD43A4 SR product and the PROSAIL model, were used to provide temporally continuous LAI variations. The STARFM model was then used to fuse the fine-resolution LAI maps with the two 500 m LAI products separately to generate two daily 30 m LAI time series. Both results were assessed for three types of pasture (mowed pasture, grazing pasture, and fenced pasture) using ground measurements from 2014-2015. The results showed that the PROSAIL-generated LAI maps all exhibited a high accuracy, and the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) for the Landsat 7 LAI and Landsat 8 LAI compared to the ground-measured LAI were 0.33 and 0.28 respectively. The Landsat LAI maps also showed good agreement and similar spatial patterns with the Sentinel-2A LAI with mean differences between +/- 0.5. The MCD43A4_PROSPECT LAI product exhibited similar seasonal variability to the ground measurements and to the Landsat and Sentinel-2A LAIs, and these data are also smoother and contain fewer noisy points than the gap-filled MCD15A3H LAI product. Compared to the ground measurements, the daily 30 m LAI time series fused from the fine-resolution LAI maps and PROSPECT generated MODIS LAI product demonstrated better performance with an RMSE of 0.44 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.34, which is an improvement from the LAI time series fused from the fine-resolution LAI maps and the existing MCD15A3H LAI product (RMSE of 0.56 and MAE of 0.42). The latter dataset also exhibited abnormal temporal fluctuations, which may have been caused by the interpolation method. The results also demonstrated the very good performance of the STARFM model in grazing and mowed pasture with homogeneous surfaces compared to fenced pasture with smaller patch sizes. The Sentinel-2A data offers increased landscape vegetation observation frequency and provides temporal information about canopy changes that occur between Landsat overpass dates. The scheme developed in this study can be used as a reference for regional vegetation dynamic studies and can be applied to larger areas to improve grassland modeling efforts.

AB  - Unlike the United States, where human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been available for decades, China recently approved its first HPV vaccines. Setting up a baseline comparison between these two countries, this study examines the influence of message framing, motivational orientation, cultural worldview, knowledge, and gender on young adults' intentions to get vaccinated. Compared to the U.S. participants, Chinese participants perceived HPV as a more severe risk and were more willing to get the vaccine. However, they were also more skeptical about vaccine safety. Inconsistencies with previous research emerged regarding the moderating effects of motivational orientation and cultural worldview. Findings from this study offer important implications for HPV vaccine promotion in China.

TI  - Satellite characterization of drought over cultivated areas in Central America
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of drought on crop production have been a prevailing challenge confronting farmers in Central America. Information on drought associated with cropping areas is deemed vital for officials to evaluate issues of crop production losses and food insecurity in the region. This study aimed to develop an approach for agricultural drought assessment in Central America, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-surface temperature (LST) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data during December 2000 to December 2016. The data processing comprised three steps: (1) LST and EVI reconstruction using random forest, (2) drought delineation using the temperature vegetation dryness index (derived from LST and EVI), and (3) error verification. The reconstructed results of LST and EVI data verified with the cloud-free reference data indicated coefficient of determination (R-2) values higher than 0.84, while the root mean square error values achieved for LST and EVI were smaller than 1.5 degrees C and 0.07, respectively. The spatially aggregated results of drought delineation compared with the soil moisture active passive data showed that the correlation coefficient (r) values obtained for the apante season (December-March) were between -0.4 and -0.8, while the values for the primera (April-August) and postrera (September-November) seasons were in ranges of 0 to -0.7 and -0.1 to -0.6, respectively. The larger area of very dry moisture condition was especially observed for the 2002 and 2014 primera seasons. Eventually, the probability of drought occurrence calculated every 8 days over a 16 years period was spatially aggregated with the cropping areas at the municipality level for crop management purposes in the region.

TI  - A new Landsat 8 cloud discrimination algorithm using thresholding tests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we propose a Cloud Discrimination Algorithm for Landsat 8 (CDAL8) to improve a high-frequency automatic land change detection system developed at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan for large-scale satellite image analysis. Although the land change detection system can process several kinds of satellite remote sensing data, improvements are needed to enable practical applications using Landsat 8 data. Cloud discrimination is a necessary pre-processing step for land cover change detection. Currently, most of the prediction errors on land change detection are caused by the false cloud discrimination results as a pre-processing step. Therefore, we introduce an improved cloud discrimination algorithm (CDAL8) in this study to improve the overall performance of our land change detection system. The algorithm was developed based on a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud mask algorithm and Cloud and Aerosol Unbiased Decision Intellectual Algorithm (CLAUDIA). CDAL8 is distinct in that it switches judgment tests and their thresholds using a threshold brightness temperature and uses separate features in cloud judgment and clear-sky judgment. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm, we compared it with the Automated Cloud-Cover Assessment algorithm (ACCA) and Function of Mask (Fmask) version 3.3 using US Geological Survey Landsat 8 cloud cover assessment validation data, which contain 96 cloud masks. Our proposed cloud discrimination algorithm (CDAL8) have promising results with an accuracy of 88.1%, which was greater than that of the ACCA (82.5%) and Fmask (84.6%). Furthermore, we also confirmed that the average accuracy of CDAL8 was approximately 91.2% when low solar elevation scenes were removed.

TI  - Improved surface soil moisture anomalies from Fengyun-3B over the Jiangxi province of the People's Republic of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a data-driven modification scheme for a commonly used soil moisture retrieval algorithm by introducing a vegetation density-related single scattering albedo based on in situ and Fengyun-3B passive microwave observations. The Jiangxi province in China's mainland is one of the most challenging regions for soil moisture retrievals due to its complex topography, open water, and vegetation conditions. However, it has a very dense in situ soil moisture observation network which makes it a suitable test-bed to examine the performance of the modification scheme. The development of this new scheme consists of two steps. In a first step, the model is initialized using the most recently developed algorithm configuration. In the second step, these initial outcomes are used as input to determine the vegetation density related single scattering albedo which is solely based on observational data and used as the final algorithm configuration over our study area. We start by comparing the two most recent algorithm configurations against the in situ soil moisture network and demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of correlations coefficient for the most recent version. Then, the observational data- driven modification scheme was proposed and evaluated against the in situ soil moisture network with further improvements after its implementation. We furthermore applied the vegetation density-based scattering albedo in soil moisture retrievals over all grid cells in Jiangxi, and found that soil moisture data with the newly developed configuration significantly improved (up to 30%) compared to the preceding algorithm configurations. The two existing algorithm configurations were also evaluated over all grid cells and all results indicate consistent improvements between the successive algorithm versions.

TI  - Quantifying urban growth in 10 post-Soviet cities using Landsat data and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most irreversible anthropogenic forms of land use. Unplanned and rapid urban growth can result in environmental degradation, sprawl, and unsustainable production and consumption practices. The unique challenges facing the post-Soviet countries throughout the transition period highlight the critical need for a quantitative assessment of urban dynamics. Total of 32 Level-1 precision terrain corrected (L1T) Landsat scenes with 30 m resolution and auxiliary population and economic data were utilized to quantify the urban expansion dynamics in 10 cities across nine post-Soviet republics. Land cover was classified by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm with overall accuracies ranging from 87% to 97% for 29 classification maps over three time steps. The initial time step was the year 1989 +/- 2, the middle time step was the year 2000 +/- 2, and the final time step was the year 2015 +/- 2. The results demonstrated several spatial and temporal urban expansion patterns across the post-Soviet region. The urban land area in several cities increased significantly over the study period. The average annual urban expansion rate was 1.6 +/- 0.7 % per year for 10 cities over the study period and the average area of land converted to new urban environment was 227 +/- 224 km(2) with a corresponding average per cent increase of 54.5 +/- 26.7%. Furthermore, the results demonstrated significant decrease in overall population densities across the 10 cities with an average decrease of -26.9 +/- 14.8% over the study period. The urban expansion rates considerably outpaced the urban population growth rates in all 10 cities during the last quarter of a century, indicating more expansive urban growth patterns.

TI  - Mapping alteration mineral zones and lithological units in Antarctic regions using spectral bands of ASTER remote sensing data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping is one of the primary tasks of remote sensing. Remote sensing applications are especially useful when extreme environmental conditions inhibit direct survey such as in Antarctica. In this investigation, a satellite-based remote sensing approach was used for mapping alteration mineral zones and lithological units using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data in the Oscar II coast area, north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula. Specialized band ratios and band combinations were developed using visible and near infrared, shortwave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared spectral bands of ASTER for detecting alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units in Antarctic environments. Constrained Energy Minimization, Orthogonal Subspace Projection and Adaptive Coherence Estimator algorithms were tested to ASTER SWIR bands for detecting sub-pixels' abundance of spectral features related to muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite. Results indicate valuable applicability of ASTER data for Antarctic geological mapping.

TI  - Aboveground forest biomass derived using multiple dates of WorldView-2 stereo-imagery: quantifying the improvement in estimation accuracy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of two date satellite-derived image-based point clouds (IPCs) to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB). The data sets used include panchromatic WorldView-2 stereo-imagery with 0.46 m spatial resolution representing 2014 and 2016 and a detailed digital elevation model derived from airborne laser scanning data. Altogether, 332 field sample plots with an area of 256 m(2) were used for model development and validation. Predictors describing forest height, density, and variation in height were extracted from the IPC 2014 and 2016 and used in k-nearest neighbour imputation models developed with sample plot data for predicting AGB. AGB predictions for 2014 (AGB(2014)) were projected to 2016 using growth models (AGB(Projected_2016)) and combined with the AGB estimates derived from the 2016 data (AGB(2016)). AGB prediction model developed with 2014 data was also applied to 2016 data (AGB(2016_pred2014)). Based on our results, the change in the 90(th) percentile of height derived from the WorldView-2 IPC was able to characterize forest height growth between 2014 and 2016 with an average growth of 0.9 m. Features describing canopy cover and variation in height derived from the IPC were not as consistent. The AGB(2016) had a bias of -7.5% (-10.6 Mg ha(-1)) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.0% (36.7 Mg ha(-1)) as the respective values for AGB(Projected_2016) were 7.0% (9.9 Mg ha(-1)) and 21.5% (30.8 Mg ha(-1)). AGB(2016_pred2014) had a bias of -19.6% (-27.7 Mg ha(-1)) and RMSE of 33.2% (46.9 Mg ha(-1)). By combining predictions of AGB(2016) and AGB(Projected_2016) at sample plot level as a weighted average, we were able to decrease the bias notably compared to estimates made on any single date. The lowest bias of -0.25% (-0.4 Mg ha(-1)) was obtained when equal weights of 0.5 were given to the AGB(Projected_2016) and AGB(2016) estimates. Respectively, RMSE of 20.9% (29.5 Mg ha(-1)) was obtained using equal weights. Thus, we conclude that combination of two date WorldView-2 stereo-imagery improved the reliability of AGB estimates on sample plots where forest growth was the only change between the two dates.

TI  - Landsat-satellite-based analysis of spatial-temporal dynamics and drivers of CyanoHABs in the plateau Lake Dianchi
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dianchi Lake, located in southwest China's Yungui plateau, is facing severe eutrophication and frequent outbreaks of harmful cyanobacteria blooms (CyanoHABs). It is of great significance to monitor the occurrence and development of CyanoHABs in Dianchi Lake over a long period and analyse the main influences. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus/Operational Land Imager 1986-2016 data, we derived the distribution of the CyanoHABs in Dianchi Lake, and analysed spatial-temporal dynamics of the CyanoHABs by correlation with nutrition, meteorological, and humanities data. The results showed that the first outbreak of CyanoHABs in Dianchi Lake occurred in 1987, which is likely to be influenced by a rapid increase of nutrients in the lake, while the weather conditions also have some impact on the CyanoHABs occurrence. After 1990, the frequency of CyanoHABs is relatively high in the water near Longmen village, Fubao Bay, Hui Bay, and the lake inlet of the Panlong River to the north of Waihai in Dianchi Lake from June to November every year. Moreover, the CyanoHABs increased year by year until 2000. This is closely related to population growth and economic development. Furthermore, a large amount of precipitation and small wind speeds can also promote the occurrence of CyanoHABs. After 2000, the frequency of CyanoHABs decreased, as the large-scale management of water pollution in Dianchi Lake achieved certain effects. The area and frequency of CyanoHABs from 2011 to 2014 are the smallest in the last 20 years, which may be related to the large-scale planting of Eichhornia crassipes in the north of Dianchi Lake.

TI  - An integrated approach for mapping mineral resources in the Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of the Earth from space either by satellites or aircrafts are significant approaches for mineral exploration, because of their capability of revealing hydrothermal alteration minerals and sensing the surface/subsurface fracture/fault zones. A study area that is situated in the Pan-African belt of Egypt is tested for targeting potential area of mineral resources involved the hydrothermal system using satellite imagery combined with aeromagnetic, geochemical and field data. Extracted alteration layers using ASTER data and major structures (fault/fracture zones) from DEM, ALOS/PALSAR and aeromagnetic data were prepared and integrated using Knowledge-driven technique in multicriteria-decision making tools for producing-mineral prospect map. The results revealed five predictive areas of expected mineral occurrences ranging from excellent to very low. Spectral analysis using ASTER data allowed defining the key-hydrothermal minerals which revealed three successive zones of alterations e.g., argillic, phyllic and propylitic. Plausible areas of minerals fitting to the ore body representing the center of the extensive alterations. Field, geochemical, and ore microscopic investigations validated the results of integrated data. Field data revealed that the mineralization zones extend along NNE-SSW thrust trend that later modified by NW-SE, N-S and NE-SW strike slip faults. Hydrothermal processes related to later magmatic stages probably were responsible for destruction and remobilization of the primary minerals of the host metavolcanics. Microscopic examination revealed that Fe-Cu-Zn-Pb sulfide minerals are associated with auriferous quartz veins. Plausible areas of prospective interest for possible mineralization also were characterized using geochemical analysis. This study successfully displays the key role of integration approach for exploring mineral resources in arid regions.

TI  - Quantitative land evaluation based on fuzzy-multi-criteria spatial model for sustainable land-use planning
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating land according to its suitability and soil mapping is an important contribution for agricultural land use planning. Therefore FAO system was used to produce suitability sub classes for horticultural and field crops. Land capability map was produced at a scale of 1:10,000 using soil information according to USDA criteria. All attributed insight analysis were ranked according to them priority and performed with analysis criteria to provide the spatial extent of soil suitability and capability. Also a new dimension was added in the spatial model to determine capability index for soil suitability to different irrigation methods. The overall accuracy of used spatial model is 89% and the validation was carried out through field work. The significance of the created model for mapping is being at a detailed survey level. The landforms were mapped using SRTM combined with sentinel satellite image of the studied area. Accordingly landforms were represented by 33 soil profiles collected in 2015. Another 32 auger profile samples were dug to identify the boundaries among landform units. The capability units were produced in association with geomorphology units. The study shows that 662.4km(2) (33%), 715.9km(2) (35.6%), 85.8km(2) (4.3%), 25.4km(2) (1.3%), 490.6km(2) (24.4%) and 30.0km(2) (1.5%) of the area were categorized in II, III, IV, and V, VI (sand dunes and quarries (and VII (Rock outcrops) land classes respectively. The produced suitability subclasses demonstrates that the land use must be planned for according to identified land capability classes (LCC) to maximize agricultural productivity and sustain the land resources for future generations.

TI  - The development of an overlay model to predict soil salinity risks by using remote sensing and GIS techniques: a case study in soils around Idku Lake, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the major environmental problems facing agricultural lands in arid and semiarid areas of the world because of its detrimental impacts on agricultural production and on the sustainable development of land resources. Hence, predicting soil salinity is essential to avoiding further soil degradation. The present study is intended to develop a model for predicting soil salinity in soils around Idku Lake by using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. This lake is a shallow brackish basin located in the western part of the Nile Delta. For this purpose, Landsat 8-OLI images and shuttle radar topography mission 1Arc-Second Digital Elevation Model data were utilized in this research. A total of 91 surface samples were collected across the study area at a depth between 0 and 30cm and were analyzed via traditional laboratory analysis methods. Five environmental parameters were used in the design of the soil salinity model. A pairwise comparison matrix was used to calculate the factor weight value for each of the layers. A linear regression model was used to plot the relationship between the EC value and raster value of the salinity map derived from the overlay model. According to the results obtained from a pairwise comparison of the factor layers, water table level was the greatest influential factor of soil salinity, followed by landforms. The validation of the model demonstrated a high degree of correlation (R-2=0.72) between the measured EC values and the salinity values derived from the model. Furthermore, this model could be a useful tool for predicting soil salinity with a suitable validation.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify environmental changes during the last 25 years in northern Sinai, Egypt. In the present research, various remote sensing indices were applied to detect environmental changes. To achieve this purpose, two Landsat TM (dated August 1990) and Landsat 8 (dated August 2015) images were used. Using remote sensing and GIS software, the two images were classified into six land use/land cover classes. The results revealed that, for the study duration from 1990 to 2015, the study area underwent an increase in vegetation cover and urban areas of approximately 4.11% and 1.21%, respectively. In addition, the land cover class with the highest salinity and the area enveloped by water bodies decreased by approximately 1.35% and 6.33%, respectively. Furthermore, sand aggregations increased in the eastern region of the entire study area but decreased in the western region. Within the study period, a serious land cover changes has happened due to reclamation and development projects.

T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid development along El-Arish city has required new extensive coastal infrastructures such as El-Arish harbor, and El-Arish power plant. These infrastructures in deep are the main source of changing the shoreline behavior. In this study, assessment of shoreline change during forty-five year period with satellite-derived shoreline was carried out in El-Arish coastal zone using three different modules. Confidence level for the satellite-derived shoreline was defined based on the deviation between simultaneous in situ shoreline measurements and abstracted satellite shoreline. The assessment of the introduced modules shows the importance of exploring shoreline change using image-processing analysis and demonstrates their applicability at similar locations.NDWI module gives an accurate shoreline in El-Arish beach 90% of its error doesn't exceed 25 m. So it was applied to determine the effect of the coastal structures in shoreline.The construction of El Arish harbor and power plant on an active open sea stopped the sediment transport at up drift with maximum rate 9.8 and 2.13 m/yr. respectively and causes erosion problem at down drift which motivate officials to construct protection works to mitigate erosion problems but unfortunately the groins implemented east El-Arish harbor don't stop erosion process although it helps in shoreline fixation.

TI  - Influence of vegetation on the morning land surface temperature in a tropical humid urban area
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization occurring during the last decades has changed the land surface temperature (LST). In this study we analyze the spatial and temporal variation of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) during the mid-morning warming up period in the tropical humid Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (MASS). LandSat imagery is used to describe the characteristics of SUHI and the influence of the urban expansion between year 2000 and 2015. Warmest and coldest areas of MASS are analyzed in the two climatic seasons (wet & dry). The results show an LST amplitude of 16 degrees C in the urbanized areas and an increase of around 0.5 degrees C in the mean SUHI from year 2000 to 2015. Higher SUHI values are observed during the wet season with a mean difference of 1.3 degrees C with the dry season. However, this seasonal anomaly varies between MASS municipalities and is highly influenced by the amount of vegetation. During the wet season, a higher presence of vegetation slows the mid-morning warming up of rural surfaces, and thus, increases the SUHI during this period of the day. This thermal inertia caused by vegetation can have a relevant impact on the pattern of surface heat accumulation and on the resulting urban climate characteristics.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs: Uncertainty in the Detection of Benthic Cover, Depth, and Water Constituents Imposed by Sensor Noise
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are biologically diverse and economically important ecosystems that are on the decline worldwide in response to direct human impacts and climate change. Ocean color remote sensing has proven to be an important tool in coral reef research and monitoring. Remote sensing data quality is driven by factors related to sensor design and environmental variability. This work explored the impact of sensor noise, defined as the signal to noise ratio (SNR), on the detection uncertainty of key coral reef ecological properties (bottom depth, benthic cover, and water quality) in the absence of environmental uncertainties. A radiative transfer model for a shallow reef environment was developed and Monte Carlo methods were employed to identify the range in environmental conditions that are spectrally indistinguishable from true conditions as a function of SNR. The spectrally averaged difference between remotely sensed radiance relative to sensor noise, e, was used to quantify uncertainty in bottom depth, the fraction of benthic cover by coral, algae, and uncolonized sand, and the concentration of water constituents defined as chlorophyll, dissolved organic matter, and suspended calcite particles. Parameter uncertainty was found to increase with sensor noise (decreasing SNR) but the impact was non-linear. The rate of change in uncertainty per incremental change in SNR was greatest for SNR < 500 and increasing SNR further to 1000 resulted in only modest improvements. Parameter uncertainty was complicated by the bottom depth and benthic cover. Benthic cover uncertainty increased with bottom depth, but water constituent uncertainty changed inversely with bottom depth. Furthermore, water constituent uncertainty was impacted by the type of constituent material in relation to the type of benthic cover. Uncertainty associated with chlorophyll concentration and dissolved organic matter increased when the benthic cover was coral and/or benthic algae while uncertainty in the concentration of suspended calcite increased when the benthic cover was uncolonized sand. While the definition of an optimal SNR is subject to user needs, we propose that SNR of approximately 500 (relative to 5% Earth surface reflectance and a clear maritime atmosphere) is a reasonable engineering goal for a future satellite sensor to support research and management activities directed at coral reef ecology and, more generally, shallow aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Decoupling Canopy Structure and Leaf Biochemistry: Testing the Utility of Directional Area Scattering Factor (DASF)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochemical properties retrieved from remote sensing data are crucial sources of information for many applications. However, leaf and canopy scattering processes must be accounted for to reliably estimate information on canopy biochemistry, carbon-cycle processes and energy exchange. A coupled leaf-canopy model based on spectral invariants theory has been proposed, that uses the so-called Directional Area Scattering Factor (DASF) to correct hyperspectral remote sensing data for canopy structural effects. In this study, the reliability of DASF to decouple canopy structure and biochemistry was empirically tested using simulated reflectance spectra modelled using a Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) radiative transfer model. This approach allows all canopy and radiative properties to be specified a priori. Simulations were performed under idealised conditions of directional-hemispherical reflectance, isotropic Lambertian leaf reflectance and transmittance and sufficiently dense (high LAI) canopies with black soil where the impact of canopy background is negligible, and also departures from these conditions. It was shown that both DASF and total canopy scattering could be accurately extracted under idealised conditions using information from both the full 400-2500 nm spectral interval and the 710-790 nm interval alone, even given no prior knowledge of leaf optical properties. Departures from these idealised conditions: varying view geometry, bi-directional reflectance, LAI and soil effects, were tested. We demonstrate that total canopy scattering could be retrieved under conditions of varying view geometry and bi-directional reflectance, but LAI and soil effects were shown to reduce the accuracy with which the scattering can be modelled using the DASF approach. We show that canopy architecture, either homogeneous or heterogeneous 3D arrangements of canopy scattering elements, has important influences over DASF and consequently the accuracy of retrieval of total canopy scattering. Finally, although DASF and total canopy scattering could be retrieved to within 2.4% of the modelled total canopy scattering signal given no prior knowledge of leaf optical properties, spectral invariant parameters were not accurately retrieved from the simulated signal. This has important consequences since these parameters are quite widely used in canopy reflectance modelling and have the potential to help derive new, more accurate canopy biophysical information. Understanding and quantifying the limitations of the DASF approach as we have done here, is an important step in allowing the wider use of these methods for decoupling canopy structure and biochemistry.

TI  - Building Detection in Very High Resolution SAR Images Via Sparse Representation Over Learned Dictionaries
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial resolution of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has significantly increased in the past few years. As a result, very high resolution images are available for interpretation of the urban area. Buildings are one of the most important parts of the urban area. In this paper, we propose a novel method for building detection from SAR images. First, a set of primary detections, using double bounce, layover, and shadow features, are made. These features are extracted using the order statistics constant false alarm rate method and power ratio detector. The detectors parameters are adjusted in such a way that all bright and dark areas are well extracted. Second, the K-singular value decomposition method is used to learn two dictionaries for discrimination of buildings from clutters. The main idea is to utilize recognition techniques in detection algorithms in order to reduce the number of the false alarms. Gray level statistical, textural, and shape features are used to form the dictionaries. In this step, a secondary set of detections are available, and the final detections are made by the fusion of these two sets. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated by two different TerraSAR-X images from a densely built-up area. The results show that the proposed method is an effective way to detect building through single SAR images.

TI  - Cannabis Fear Deconditioning: An Autobiological Marijuana Memoir of a South Asian-Oklahoman Physician-Scientist
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here I take up calls to engage in developing an "ethnobiology of us," in which Western biota-cultural relations are centered. When Western-influenced scholars study extinct and extant cultures of cannabis cultivation, trade, and consumption in celebratory, reverential, or mundane contexts, it is crucial for appropriate self-reflective positionality to appreciate the power, persistence, and remarkable idiosyncrasy of the western socioecological worldview of cannabis. In humancannabis relations, I argue this is essential, as the Western worldview carries profound hegernonic weight, influencing preconceptions of scholars and global societies. A prevailing Western notion is that close contact with cannabis is socially legitimate only for a privileged few and otherwise harshly criminalized and stigmatized. Constructed scarcity and inequitable accessibility of this traditional and widely cultivated species and its products are ubiquitous, including near-total invisibility of wild and cultivated plots.Drawing upon my own memories and reflections navigating multiple cannabis-related cultural frames, spanning from disgust to fear and curiosity to reverence, I will chronicle the cannabis and the various cultural frames in which it was embedded, which I have passively or actively encountered throughout my life, including in my training and practice as a geographer and medical doctor. The thematic arc has been shifting from alienating to allying with cannabis, yet, at the same time, being ever-vigilant of the official marginality of that alliance and related structural violence. To adapt to that social marginalization, I have come to accept various logics that connect cannabis with the body, stretching from spiritual and cosmological, cultural-traditional, and pharmacological-biochemical.

TI  - Machine Learning Regression Techniques for the Silage Maize Yield Prediction Using Time-Series Images of Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - VITO Remote Sensing, Bruges, BELGIUM
AB  - Machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized for the crop monitoring and yield estimation/prediction using remotely sensed data. However, these methods have been investigated less for yield prediction of some crops, such as silage maize, which can be cultivated at various times in different fields of an area. Inconsistency between fields for satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal profiles can lead to some difficulties in yield prediction methods using time series of remotely sensed data. Therefore, this research has investigated silage maize yield prediction based on time series of NDVI dataset derived from Landsat 8 OLI. This paper employed advanced ML techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression, and Gaussian process regression (GPR) approaches and compared their performance with some proposed conventional regression methods. For this purpose, the NDVI values of all silage maize fields were averaged and integrated to produce a two-dimensional dataset for each year. The ML techniques were employed 100 times and their evaluation metrics were used to evaluate their performances and also analyze their stability. Finally, all the results of each ML technique were averaged to produce silage maize yields. The comparisons between the results of these methods indicate that the BRT technique, with the average R value higher than 0.87, outperforms other ones for all years. It was followed by RFR with almost same performance as GPR technique. This research demonstrated that some advanced ML approaches can predict the silage maize yield and they are less sensitive to inconsistency of NDVI time series. The results also showed that RFR was the most stable method to predict the maize yield in 2015, while it was trained using 2013-2014 dataset.

T2  - CONTEMPORARY TRENDS IN GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry provides the foundation for climate-smart agriculture to withstand the extreme weather events. The aim of the present study was to identify the land of Samastipur, Bihar, India for agroforestry, based on GIS modeling concept utilizing various ancillary (soil fertility) and satellite data (DEM, wetness, NDVI and LULC) sets. This was achieved by integrating various thematic layers logically in GIS domain Agroforestry suitability maps were generated for the Samastipur district of Bihar, India which showed 48.22 % as very high suitable, 22.83 % as high suitable, 23.32% as moderate suitable and 5.63% as low suitable. The cross evaluation of agroforestry suitability with LULC categories revealed that the 86.4 % (agriculture) and 30.2% (open area) of land fall into a very high agroforestry suitability category which provides the huge opportunity to harness agroforestry practices if utilized scientifically. Such analysis/results will certainly assist agroforestry policymakers and planner in the state of Bihar, India to implement and extend it to new areas. The potentiality of Remote Sensing and GIS can be exploited in accessing suitable land for agroforestry which will significantly help to rural poor people/farmers in ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods.

TI  - Feasibility Assessment of Spectral Band Adjustment Factor of KOMPSAT-3 for Agriculture Remote Sensing
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the number of multispectral satellites increases, it is expected that it will be possible to acquire and use images for periodically. However, there is a problem of data discrepancy due to different overpass time, period and spatial resolution. In particular, the difference in band bandwidths became different reflectance even for images taken at the same time and affect uncertainty in the analysis of vegetation activity such as vegetation index. The purpose of this study is to estimate the band adjustment factor according to the difference of bandwidth with other multispectral satellites for the application of KOMPSAT-3 satellite in agriculture field. The Spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) were calculated using the hyperspectral satellite images acquired in the desert area. As a result of applying SBAF to the main crop area, the vegetation index showed a high agreement rate of relative percentage difference within 3% except for the Hapcheon area where the zenith angle was 25. For the estimation of SBAF, this study used only one set of images, which did not consider season and solar zenith angle of SBAF variation. Therefore, long-term analysis is necessary to solve SBAF uncertainty in the future.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In agriculture, remote sensing data using earth observation satellites have many advantages over other methods in terms of time, space, and efficiency. This study analyzed the changes of reflectance and vegetation index according to atmospheric correction of images before using satellite images in agriculture. Top OF Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface reflectance through atmospheric correction were calculated to compare the reflectance of each band and Normalized Vegetation difference Index (NDVI). As a result, the NDVI observed from field measurement sensors and satellites showed a higher agreement and correlation than the TOA reflectance calculated from surface reflectance using atmospheric correction. Comparing NDVI before and after atmospheric correction for multi-temporal images, NDVI increased after atmospheric corrected in all images. garlic and onion cultivation area and forest where the vegetation health was high area NDVI increased more 0.1. Because the NIR images are included in the water vapor band, atmospheric correction is greatly affected. Therefore, atmospheric correction is a very important process for NDVI time-series analysis in applying image to agricultural field.

TI  - Paradigm Shifts of the African Worldview: Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Education
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa is the most vulnerable region of the world due to anthropogenic climate change challenges on account of dependence on nature for the sustenance of agriculture as her main source of income, high level of poverty, and low level of literacy. Climate change adaptation involves strategics of adjusting to the negative effects of climate change, while climate change mitigation involves techniques that help to reduce production of greenhouse gases through burning fossil fuels. The African worldview from the frontier of Nigerian epistemological and ontological perspectives as it finds expression in climate change adaptation and mitigation is built on the foundations of its relationship with nature, traditional religion and belief systems, agricultural practices, and some other day-to-day practices. Worldview analysis of the contemporary Nigerian has been conducted and classified into Original African. Westernized African. and Little Here-and-There African. a paradigm existing in Nigerians irrespective of level of Western education. What will be the fate of the younger Nigerian climate scientist in a globalized and technologically competitive world? This question gives rise to further discussion on the principles and application of the theory of Culturo-Techno-Contextual Approach as postulated by Peter A. Okebukola and applied to creating an environment for meaningful learning on climate change adaptation and mitigation for the future generations of Nigerians.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanaged and uncontrolled urbanisation has led to chaotic growth causing extensive fragmentation altering the local land use dynamics and the environment in and around many cities across the globe and has reached crucial thresholds. Quantifying these spatiotemporal urban growth patterns and visualisation is essential to understand the dynamics of urbanization and landscape dynamics. In this study, we use remotely sensed data to understand and visualise the urban growth patterns of Bangalore-Silicon hub of India. It has been stated that population growth and huge investments from the global markets are driving the change in land-use in Bangalore with the influx of population increased by 200% in the last decade. Considering this aspect in this study, Cellular Automata based model with the integration of socioeconomic factors was calibrated using historical urban growth extracted from classified data. This is used to forecast three scenarios of urban growth to 2020 with constraints as per the City Development Plan. Time series analysis of land use change exhibited an extensive outgrowth and urban sprawl in Bangalore: there has been leapfrog development in core regions of the city, whereas the buffer zones had ribbon development and cluster-based development. Urban sprawl was more along the major roads and places with better connectivity. Modelled land use results indicated an increase in the paved surface by 170% in the scenario, as usual, is considered. Because of models highly explicit nature of prediction, it was able to capture both linear and non-linear behaviour and a phase transition that happens in the urban landscape.

TI  - Probability assessment of vegetation vulnerability to drought based on remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the important factors causing vegetation degradation. Determination of areas with vegetation more sensitive to drought can be effective in drought risk management. Considering the ability to describe vegetation conditions, vegetation health index (VHI) was used to determine the probability of vegetation vulnerability to drought and to provide the map of Iran showing sensitive areas to drought. This study tries to express the probability of vegetation vulnerability to drought in four main climatic classes including hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid and semi-humid, and humid in Iran. Temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation condition index (VCI) were calculated using land surface temperature (LST) derived from the MOD11A2 product and normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from MOD13A2 product, MODIS sensor. Combining these two indices, VHI was calculated for late of March, April, May, and June during 2000-2017. VHI was classified into five classes representing the drought intensity. Then, the probability of occurrence (%) of each class was calculated and multiplied with weight of each class, varying from 0 to 40 based on drought intensity. Finally, probability of vegetation vulnerability index (PVVI) was calculated by summing of the values obtained for each class. The results showed that PVVI was higher in arid and hyper-arid areas than that in other areas in the four studied periods. The highest mean values of PVVI in humid as well as semi-arid and semi-humid classes were found in April as 59.87 and 62.4, respectively, while the highest mean values of PVVI in arid and hyper-arid classes were observed in May as 70.98 and 68.13, respectively. In total, our results showed that PVVI is affected by different climatic and topographic conditions, and it suggested that this index be used to determine the probability of vegetation vulnerability.

TI  - Evaluating MODIS Dust-Detection Indices over the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand and dust storm events (SDEs), which result from strong surface winds in arid and semi-arid areas, exhibiting loose dry soil surfaces are detrimental to human health, agricultural land, infrastructure, and transport. The accurate detection of near-surface dust is crucial for quantifying the spatial and temporal occurrence of SDEs globally. The Arabian Peninsula is an important source region for global dust due to the presence of extensive deserts. This paper evaluates the suitability of five different MODIS-based methods for detecting airborne dust over the Arabian Peninsula: (a) Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI); (b) Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) (31-32); (c) BTD (20-31); (d) Middle East Dust Index (MEDI) and (e) Reflective Solar Band (RSB). We derive detection thresholds for each index by comparing observed values for dust-present' versus dust-free' conditions, taking into account various land cover settings and analyzing associated temporal trends. Our results suggest that the BTD (31-32) method and the RSB index are the most suitable indices for detecting dust storms over different land-cover types across the Arabian Peninsula. The NDDI and BTD (20-31) methods have limitations in identifying dust over multiple land-cover types. Furthermore, the MEDI has been found to be unsuitable for detecting dust in the study area across all land-cover types.

TI  - Remote sensing restores predictability of ectotherm body temperature in the world's forests
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Rising global temperatures are predicted to increase ectotherms' body temperatures, benefitting some species but threatening others. Biophysical models predict a key role for shade in buffering these effects, but the difficulty of measuring shade across broad spatial extents limits predictions of ectotherms' thermal futures at the global scale. Here, we extend biophysical models of ectotherm body temperature to include effects of forest canopy shade, via leaf area index, and test whether considering remotely-sensed canopy density improves predictions of body temperature variation in heavily shaded habitats. Location Time period Worldwide. 1990-2010. Major taxa studied Methods Lizards. We test predictions from biophysical ecological theory for how body temperature should vary with microclimate for 269 lizard populations across open, semi-open and closed habitats worldwide. We extend existing biophysical models to incorporate canopy shade effects via leaf area index, test whether body temperature varies with canopy density as predicted by theory, and evaluate the extent to which incorporating canopy density improves model performance in heavily shaded areas. Results Conclusions We find that body temperatures in open habitats, like deserts, vary with air temperature and incident solar radiation as predicted by biophysical equations, but these relationships break down in forests, where body temperatures become unpredictable. Incorporating leaf area index into our models revealed lower body temperatures in more heavily shaded environments, restoring the predictability of body temperature in forests. Although biophysical ecological theory can predict ectotherm body temperature in open habitats, like deserts, these relationships decay in closed forests. Models incorporating remotely-sensed data on canopy density improved predictability of body temperatures in these habitats, providing an avenue to incorporate canopy shade effects into predictions of animals' vulnerability to climate change. These results highlight the thermal threat of changes in canopy structure and loss of forest cover for the world's ectotherms.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the increasing environmental threat of cobalt in the modern era, less is known as its phytotoxicity behavior. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to assess the toxicity effects of cobalt and to understand the associated physio-biochemical response in Brassica napus, an economically important plant crop species. Five-day-old seedlings of four cultivars (Zheda 619, Zheda 622, ZS 758, and ZY 50) were exposed to five different levels of cobalt under hydroponic conditions. Results showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of plant growth, accompanied by notable chlorophyll loss, protein degradation, and accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. Further, Co contents in different plants parts were found to be higher in Zheda 622 than all other cultivars. In all cultivars, the contents of enzymatic activities (SOD, POD, GR, and GSH) were markedly increased following cobalt exposure; by contrast, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities declined with increased cobalt concentration in medium, which was also, echoed by the pattern of enzymes-related mRNA levels. Morphological observations, supported by ultrastructural analysis revealed clear differences in cobalt sensitivity among cultivars, with ZS 758 identified as less sensitive cultivar, and Zheda 622 the most sensitive one. In addition to revealing genotypic differences in cobalt sensitivity in B. napus, findings suggest the mechanisms of cobalt tolerance in this specie could, at least partially, in relation with the ability of plant to sustain the activity of superoxide dismutase and guaicol peroxidase and to maintain glutathione reduced pool through the action of glutathione reductase.

TI  - Insights on the responses of <i>Brassica napus</i> cultivars against the cobalt-stress as revealed by carbon assimilation, anatomical changes and secondary metabolites
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cobalt (Co) is a toxin environmental pollutant, and its elevated concentrations in agricultural soils can negatively impact the crop productivity. In the current study, we evaluated the toxic effects of Co levels (0, 100, 400 mu M) on the hydroponically grown seedlings of four different cultivars of Brassica napus L. cvs. ZS 758, ZY 50, Zheda 619 and Zheda 622. Results showed that lower Co dose (100 mu M) executed significant but less toxic effects as compared to 400 mu M Co among all studied cultivars. Excessive Co (400 mu M) level had significantly declined the plant growth, biomass, chlorophyll contents, nutrients uptake, activities and transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes in leaf and root tissues of all tested cultivars.The decline in physiochemical traits was more prominent in Zheda 622, and ZS 758 performed better under Co toxicity as compared with other cultivars. Co-induced root impairment led to greater ROS and MDA accumulation and inhibit nutrients uptake. Ultimately, the lower translocation to leaves causes damages in carbon assimilation process.These results were confirmed by root staining with nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and damages in leaf mesophyll and root tip cells by electron microscopic analysis. More anatomical damages were noted in Zheda 622 and least in ZS 758. A significant induction of stress-related proteins (HSP90-1 and MT-1) and secondary metabolites (PAL, PPO, and CAD) under higher Co level (400 mu M) indicated the greater plant-defense system against Co-induced oxidative stress and Co-homeostasis that helps in toleraance to Co-phytotoxicity. The comparison of sensitive (Zheda 622) and tolerant (ZS 758) genotypes showed that root tissues were the major target of Co toxicity. Overall, higher Co-accumulation in leaf and root tissues cause cellular toxicity and overall carbon assimilation process. This phytotoxicity was more pronounced in Zheda 622 and least in ZS 758 as compared with other cultivars.

TI  - Automated Geological lineaments mapping for groundwater exploration in the basement complex terrain of Akoko-Edo area, Edo-State Nigeria using remote sensing techniques
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to map geological structures (lineaments) which are indications of sustainable groundwater supply in a hard rock terrain of Akoko-Edo local government area of Edo State, Nigeria. Landsat-OLI imagery, topographical map and geological map of Nigeria were used for this study. The methodology involves subjecting the imagery to preprocessing algorithms, linear/edge enhancement, directional filtering, contrast stretching using ENVI 4.7 software. The lineaments were extracted automatically using PCI Geomatica software while ArcGIS and Rockworks software were used to plot the lineament density map and lineament trend respectively. The result shows the total number and length of lineaments to be 197 and 278.85km respectively. Shorter lineaments constitute about 40% of the total number of lineaments. The lineaments density varies from 0 to 2.40km/sq.km, and areas with 1.32-2.40km/sq.km and 0.82km/sq.km reflect high and moderate degree of rock fracturing which makes these areas suitable target for groundwater exploitation as they possess more lineaments. The lineament trend results showed two prominent trends E-W, N-S and ENE-WSW. Other minor trends are also observed in the study area. These trends validate with results of earlier local studies and with directions of prominent geological structures and features of the study area. The discovery and delineation of the geological structures (lineaments) will serve as direct guides for decision makers to accurately site productive boreholes that will solve the problem of water scarcity in the study area, thereby promoting good developmental policy.

TI  - Estimation of Corn Yield by Assimilating SAR and Optical Time Series Into a Simplified Agro-Meteorological Model: From Diagnostic to Forecast
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of crop yield plays a major role in decision making and management of food supply. This paper aims to estimate corn drymasses and grain yield at field scale using an agro-meteorological model. The SAFY-WB model (simple algorithm for yield model combined with a water balance) is controlled by green area index (GAI) derived from optical satellite images (GAI(opt)), and the GAI derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images (GAI(sar)) acquired over two crop seasons (2015 and 2016) in the south-west of France. Landsat-8 mission provides the optical data. SAR information (sigma(VV)degrees,sigma(VH)degrees, and sigma(VH/VV)degrees) is provided by Sentinel-1A mission through two angular normalized orbits (30 and 132) allowing a repetitiveness from 12 to 6 days. sigma(VH/VV)degrees is successfully used to derive GAI(sar) (R-2 = 0.72, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 10.4%) over the leaf development stages of the crop cycle from a nonlinear function. Others SAR signal (sigma(VV)degrees and sigma(VH)degrees) are too much related to soil moisture changes. At the opposite of GAI(opt), GAI(sar) cannot be used alone in the model to accurately estimate vegetation parameters. Finally, the robustness of the results comes from the combination of GAI derived from SAR and optical data. In this condition, the model is able, thanks to the inclusion of a new "production module," to simulate drymasses and yield (R-2 > 0.75 and rRMSE < 12.75%) with good performances in the diagnostic approach. In the context of forecast, results offer lower performances but stay acceptable, with relative errors inferior to 13.95% (R-2 > 0.69).

TI  - The effect of socio-demographic factors on mental health and addiction high-cost use: a retrospective, population-based study in Saskatchewan
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective A small proportion of the population accounts for the majority of healthcare costs. Mental health and addiction (MHA) patients arc consistently high-cost. We aimed to delineate factors amenable to public health action that may reduce high-cost use among a cohort of MHA clients in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study. Administrative health data from fiscal years (FY) 2009-2015, linked at the individual level, were analyzed (n = 129,932). The outcome of interest was >= 90th percentile of costs for each year under study ('persistent high-cost use'). Descriptive analyses were followed by logistic regression modelling; the latter excluded long-term care residents.Results The average healthcare cost among study cohort members in FY 2009 was similar to $2300; for high-cost users it was similar to $19,000. Individuals with unstable housing and hospitalization(s) had increased risk of persistent high-cost use; both of these effects were more pronounced as comorbidities increased. Patients with schizophrenia, particularly those under 50 years old, had increased probability of persistent high-cost use. The probability of persistent high-cost use decreased with good connection to a primary care provider, this effect was more pronounced as the number of mental health conditions increased.Conclusion Despite constituting only 5% of the study cohort, persistent high-cost MHA clients (n = 6455) accounted for similar to 35% of total costs. Efforts to reduce high-cost use should focus on reduction of multimorbidity, connection to a primary care provider (particularly for those with more than one MHA), young patients with schizophrenia, and adequately addressing housing stability.

TI  - Integrating Facility-Based Surveillance With Healthcare Utilization Surveys to Estimate Enteric Fever Incidence: Methods and Challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cohort studies and facility-based sentinel surveillance are common approaches to characterizing infectious disease burden, but present trade-offs; cohort studies are resource-intensive and may alter disease natural history, while sentinel surveillance underestimates incidence in the population. hybrid surveillance, whereby facility-based surveillance is paired with a community-based healthcare utilization assessment, represents an alternative approach to generating population-based disease incidence estimates with moderate resource investments. Here, we discuss this method in the context of the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) study. We describe how data are collected and utilized to adjust enteric fever incidence for blood culture sensitivity, facility-based enrollment, and healthcare seeking, incorporating uncertainty in these parameters in the uncertainty around incidence estimates. We illustrate how selection of surveillance sites and their coverage may influence precision and bias, and we identify approaches in the study design and analysis to minimize and control for these biases. Rigorously designed hybrid surveillance systems can be an efficient approach to generating population-based incidence estimates for infectious diseases.

TI  - Sleep-Disordered Breathing Is Independently Associated With Increased Aggressiveness of Cutaneous Melanoma A Multicenter Observational Study in 443 Patients
T2  - CHEST
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with a greater incidence and mortality of cancer, although such findings are inconsistent. However, no large studies are currently available to investigate this association in patients with a specific type of cancer. This study seeks to assess potential relationships between SDB severity and aggressiveness markers of cutaneous melanoma.METHODS: Four hundred and forty-three patients with a diagnosis of melanoma underwent a sleep study within 6 months of diagnosis. General demographics were collected, along with melanoma characteristics and polygraphic parameters consisting of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and indices of both continuous and intermittent night-time oxyhemoglobin desaturation (DI4%). An exploration of independent relationships between SDB and various objective melanoma aggressiveness markers (Breslow index, presence of ulceration, presence of regression, mitotic index, stage of severity, damage to the sentinel lymph, and spreading of the melanoma) was performed.RESULTS: Patients in the upper tertiles of AHI or DI4% were 1.94 (95% CI, 1.14-3.32; P = .022) and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.14-3.26; P = .013) times more likely, respectively, to present with aggressive melanoma (Breslow index > 1 mm) than those in the lowest tertiles of these sleep attributes after adjustment for age, sex, tumor location, and BMI. This association was particularly prominent among patients < 56 years of age with Breslow index > 2 mm. The presence of the additional markers of aggressiveness was also associated with higher AHI and DI4% values.CONCLUSIONS: The severity of SDB was independently associated with greater aggressiveness of cutaneous melanoma, particularly among younger patients.

TI  - Novel Surgical Strategies in the Treatment of Gynecological Malignancies
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statementThe main advancement in the surgical treatment of early cervical cancer has been a de-escalation in the radical surgical approach of early stage disease. Similarly, sentinel lymph node detection with cervical tracer injection can be performed alone in microscopic tumors (stage IA) while additional lymphadenectomy is still performed in macroscopic tumors (IB1 and IIA). Parametrial resection has been progressively reduced in tumors less than 2cm, and simple procedures, conservative (trachelectomy) or not (simple hysterectomy), are currently being evaluated in several phase III trials. Since the preliminary results of the LACC (locally advanced cervical cancer) trial, the value of minimally invasive surgery as the standard approach for the treatment of early stage cervical cancer has been questioned and patients should be aware when discussing the approach for radical hysterectomy. While awaiting the results of ongoing clinical trials comparing radiological and surgical staging in locally advanced cervical cancer patients, surgical staging with paraaortic lymphadenectomy remains the standard of care before definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients with negative aortic PET/TDM. Patients undergoing salvage surgeries for isolated pelvic recurrences of cervical cancer benefit from advanced reconstructive techniques as DIEP flaps and continent reconstructive urinary techniques. In selected patients, a minimally invasive approach can be considered. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of endometrial cancer. The major evolution in surgical strategy has occurred in lymph node staging. The standard surgical staging includes pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection to the level of the left renal vein. Sentinel lymph node dissection has been validated as a less morbid alternative of systematic lymphadenectomy, indicated in patients with low and intermediate risk of lymph node involvement. In advanced ovarian cancer, complete cytoreduction is the main objective of surgery. To achieve this goal, upper abdominal complex procedures have been developed. Best survival rates are obtained with primary debulking surgery. Exploratory laparoscopy may be performed before cytoreduction to evaluate resectability and thus avoid unnecessary laparotomy. Although systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy is being questioned in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes undergoing complete primary debulking surgery, this procedure is still recommended. While waiting publication of the GOG 252 trial, IP chemotherapy after complete CRS is under debate. HIPEC after interval debulking surgery in patients undergoing complete cytoreduction is an intriguing new option. Patients within the first recurrence of ovarian cancer, with score AGO-positive, benefit from a second complete cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer survival rates are higher in specialized high-volume centers, and thus cases should be centralized and quality indicators used.

TI  - Noise Filtering in High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Composite Multiresolution Transforms
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution proposes a multiresolution analysis (MRA)-based composite technique for image restoration by noise filtering in satellite images. Multiresolution techniques provide a coarse-fine and scale-invariant decomposition of images for analysis and interpretation. MRA methods effectively handle the noise because of their multiscale feature. This study presents a scheme based on the combination of wavelet-, contourlet- and curvelet-based transforms as effective tool for noise filtering in satellite images. The proposed method is applied to the problem of restoring an image from noisy data and effects of denoising are compared. Several comparison experiments with state-of-the-art noise filtering schemes are conducted. The composite approach of curvelet and wavelet is found to be more effective than the others based on the set of evaluation measures like peak signal-noise ratio, mean-squared error, edge-enhancing index and mean-standard deviation ratio across edges. The results are illustrated using high-resolution satellite data, such as Quickbird and Worldview-2 images. Such high-resolution images are more likely to be noisy due to the short observation time over the target in contrast to images from low-resolution sensors.

TI  - Uncertainty in satellite remote sensing of snow fraction for water resources management
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow fraction is an important component of land surface models and hydrologic models. Information on snow fraction also improves downstream products retrieved from remote sensing: vertical atmosphere profiles, soil moisture, heat fluxes, etc. The uncertainty of the fractional snow cover estimates must be determined, quantified, and reported to consider the suitability of the product for modeling, data assimilation and other applications. The reflectances of snow and non-snow are characterized by a very significant local variability and also by changes from one scene to another. The local snow and non-snow endmembers are approximated by the Normalized Difference Snow Index with a high accuracy. The magnitudes of snow and non-snow Normalized Difference Snow Indexes are scene-specific and calculated on the fly to retrieve snow fraction. The development of the Normalized Difference Snow Index based algorithms to estimate snow fraction including a scene-specific approach taking local snow and non-snow properties into account is considered an optimal way to fractional snow retrieval from moderate resolution optical remote sensing observations. The Landsat reference data are used to estimate the performance of the fractional snow cover algorithms at moderate resolution and to compare the quality of alternative algorithms. The validation results demonstrate that the performance of the algorithms using Normalized Difference Snow Index has advantages. The advantages achieved in snow fraction retrieval lead to improved estimate of snow water equivalent and changes in snow cover state contributing to better modeling of land surface and hydrologic regime. The success of managing water resources on the whole depends on coordinating described investigations with the works of other researchers developing further enhanced models.

TI  - Realization of thought in a language: propositional frame-based organization of single-root word nests and stable word combinations with a single nuclear component in different languages
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research is to reveal the specificity of cognition of the world by a person within the range of such a derivational category as a nest of single-root words and stable phrases with a single core component in multi-structural languages. The authors carry out the approbation of the method of propositional frame-based modeling of single-rooted words and established collocations with a common core component within the frame of "horse" in Russian, Teleut, and Chinese. The lexemes and idioms of mutation semantics are analyzed.The consideration of the propositional-semantic filling of nests within the frame "horse breeding", organizing the derivational space of multi-structural languages, reveals the multidimensional vision of a horse and the associated realities with it. The frame "horse breeding" is implemented within common propositional structures in the nests of the Russian, Chinese and Teleut languages: "subject - action - object"; "tool - action -object"; "place - action -object"; "result action - object". It means that of significance in multi-structural languages within the nesting space are: the person taking care of horses; the place of horses; horse care products; products obtained from a horse. The lexemes with these meanings are presented in all languages studied, that is, they are core lexemes, denoting the realities with which a person having a horse deals on a daily basis. At the same time, the names of horse colts in the Teleut language are within the limits of other nests, despite the fact that the names of animal cubs are typified in this language. Along with zherebyonok (a foal) in dialects, there is a lexeme loshadyonok (a foal) in the Russian language. However, there is no such a word, as konyonok. In contrast to Russian, the naming of a racetrack in Chinese was found within the boundaries of the nest analyzed. The names of horse colors in the Chinese and Teleut languages are fixed within one nest with the core word "horse". In Russian horse names, the colors are noted in other nests. These facts testify to the peculiar categorization of the world in different languages: the core units in the nesting space of some languages may be absent in the nesting spaces of other languages.

TI  - CubeSats Enable High Spatiotemporal Retrievals of Crop-Water Use for Precision Agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) provides a direct accounting of the crop water use. However, the use of satellite data has generally required that a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution is made, i.e., one could obtain low spatial resolution data regularly, or high spatial resolution occasionally. As a consequence, this spatiotemporal trade-off has tended to limit the impact of remote sensing for precision agricultural applications. With the recent emergence of constellations of small CubeSat-based satellite systems, these constraints are rapidly being removed, such that daily 3 m resolution optical data are now a reality for earth observation. Such advances provide an opportunity to develop new earth system monitoring and assessment tools. In this manuscript we evaluate the capacity of CubeSats to advance the estimation of ET via application of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) retrieval model. To take advantage of the high-spatiotemporal resolution afforded by these systems, we have integrated a CubeSat derived leaf area index as a forcing variable into PT-JPL, as well as modified key biophysical model parameters. We evaluate model performance over an irrigated farmland in Saudi Arabia using observations from an eddy covariance tower. Crop water use retrievals were also compared against measured irrigation from an in-line flow meter installed within a center-pivot system. To leverage the high spatial resolution of the CubeSat imagery, PT-JPL retrievals were integrated over the source area of the eddy covariance footprint, to allow an equivalent intercomparison. Apart from offering new precision agricultural insights into farm operations and management, the 3 m resolution ET retrievals were shown to explain 86% of the observed variability and provide a relative RMSE of 32.9% for irrigated maize, comparable to previously reported satellite-based retrievals. An observed underestimation was diagnosed as a possible misrepresentation of the local surface moisture status, highlighting the challenge of high-resolution modeling applications for precision agriculture and informing future research directions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover on Antarctic sea ice persists during most of the year, contributing significantly to the sea ice mass budget due to comprehensive seasonal transition processes within the snowpack as well as at the snow/ice interface. Consequently, snow on sea ice varies not only in depth but also in particular in its physical characteristics such as snow density and stratigraphy. In order to quantify the heterogeneous nature of the Antarctic snowpack on different spatial scales, that is, small (<10m), floe-size (1-2km), and regional (seasonal/perennial ice) scales, we present here a case study of snow analyses in the Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013. The resulting high variability of snow parameters in the basal snow layer reveals the need to distinguish between seasonal and perennial ice regimes, when retrieving, for example, snow depth using satellite microwave radiometry. Considering the full vertical snow column, a more detailed distinction of the perennial sea ice regime into, for example, more ice classes is suggested in order to represent the high variability range. For the internal snowpack variability, however, we identify the grain size variability as the main driver, while snow density variations can be neglected. Moving from regional to floe-size scales, a similar variability range of the studied snow properties is found, suggesting that a large number of snow samples on a few floes is more crucial than covering a large region with fewer floe-scale measurements. The spatiotemporally heterogeneous variability in snow accumulation, redistribution, and metamorphism is, however, too large to upscale the given findings beyond regional scale.Plain Language Summary Snow on sea ice alters the properties of the underlying ice cover as well as associated exchange processes at the interfaces between atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean due to its highly insulative and reflective properties. The snow cover on Antarctic sea ice generally persists throughout the year but undergoes substantial seasonal changes in its internal snowpack properties, as, for example, snow density, grain size, and grain shape. However, the spatial variability of these properties is poorly understood, yet this knowledge is crucial for sea ice mass budget calculations as well as the analysis of satellite remote sensing data. In this case study, we present a comprehensive snow data set covering different spatial scales. Thus, snow was sampled on seasonal and perennial sea ice floes across the Weddell Sea, while one floe was more frequently sampled, respectively. An additional 10-m transect allows to conclude also on small-scale variability. Revealed scale-dependent snow property variability is discussed in the context of assumptions in energy and mass budget calculations as well as in recent retrievals of, for example, sea ice thickness, from satellite remote sensing observations in the ice-covered Southern Ocean.

TI  - Monitoring NDVI Inter-Annual Behavior in Mountain Areas of Mainland Spain (2001-2016)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there exists growing evidence that warming is amplified with elevation resulting in rapid changes in temperature, humidity and water in mountainous areas. The latter might result in considerable damage to forest and agricultural land cover, affecting all the ecosystem services and the socio-economic development that these mountain areas provide. The Mediterranean mountains, moreover, which host a high diversity of natural species, are more vulnerable to global change than other European ecosystems. The protected areas of the mountain ranges of peninsular Spain could help preserve natural resources and landscapes, as well as promote scientific research and the sustainable development of local populations. The temporal statistical trends (2001-2016) of the MODIS13Q1 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) interannual dynamics are analyzed to explore whether the NDVI trends are found uniformly within the mountain ranges of mainland Spain (altitude > 1000 m), as well as in the protected or non-protected mountain areas. Second, to determine if there exists a statistical association between finding an NDVI trend and the specific mountain ranges, protected or unprotected areas are studied. Third, a possible association between cover types in pure pixels using CORINE (Co-ordination of Information on the Environment) land cover cartography is studied and land cover changes between 2000 and 2006 and between 2006 and 2012 are calculated for each mountainous area. Higher areas are observed to have more positive NDVI trends than negative in mountain areas located in mainland Spain during the 2001-2016 period. The growing of vegetation, therefore, was greater than its decrease in the study area. Moreover, differences in the size of the area between growth and depletion of vegetation patterns along the different mountains are found. Notably, more negatives than expected are found, and fewer positives are found than anticipated in the mountains, such as the Cordillera Cantabrica (C.Cant.) or Montes de Murcia y Alicante (M.M.A). Quite the reverse happened in Pirineos (Pir.) and Montes de Cadiz y Malaga (M.C.M.), among others. The statistical association between the trends found and the land cover types is also observed. The differences observed can be explained since the mountain ranges in this study are defined by climate, land cover, human usage and, to a small degree, by land cover changes, but further detailed research is needed to get in-depth detailed conclusions. Conversely, it is found that, in protected mountain areas, a lower NDVI pixels trend than expected (>20%) occurs, whereas it is less than anticipated in unprotected mountain areas. This could be caused by management and the land cover type.

TI  - Generating Observation-Based Snow Depletion Curves for Use in Snow Cover Data Assimilation
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depletion curves (SDC) are functions that are used to show the relationship between snow covered area and snow depth or water equivalent. Previous snow cover data assimilation (DA) studies have used theoretical SDC models as observation operators to map snow depth to snow cover fraction (SCF). In this study, a new approach is introduced that uses snow water equivalent (SWE) observations and satellite-based SCF retrievals to derive SDC relationships for use in an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate snow cover estimates. A histogram analysis is used to bin the SWE observations, which the corresponding SCF observations are then averaged within, helping to constrain the amount of data dispersion across different temporal and regional conditions. Logarithmic functions are linearly regressed with the binned average values, for two U.S. mountainous states: Colorado and Washington. The SDC-based logarithmic functions are used as EnKF observation operators, and the satellite-based SCF estimates are assimilated into a land surface model. Assimilating satellite-based SCF estimates with the observation-based SDC shows a reduction in SWE-related RMSE values compared to the model-based SDC functions. In addition, observation-based SDC functions were derived for different intra-annual and physiographic conditions, and landcover and elevation bands. Lower SWE-based RMSE values are also found with many of these categorical observation-based SDC EnKF experiments. All assimilation experiments perform better than the open-loop runs, except for the Washington region's 2004-2005 snow season, which was a major drought year that was difficult to capture with the ensembles and observations.

TI  - Variability in Eddy Distribution Associated With East India Coastal Current From High-Frequency Radar Observations Along Southeast Coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface current observations from Indian Coastal Ocean Radar Network installed along the Tamil Nadu coast (southeast India) was used to quantify the mesoscale eddies associated with East India Coastal Current (EICC) during 2014-2017. A flow geometry-based eddy detection algorithm has been applied to the daily averaged surface current maps and was able to detect and track mesoscale eddies of variable temporal and spatial scales. A total of 51 (27 cyclonic and 24 anticyclonic) eddy events, which lasted for more than 4days, were identified during this period. Total count of cyclonic eddies exceeded the anticyclonic eddies with a clear seasonal pattern concurrent with the mean flow of EICC. The number of anticyclonic eddies leads in southwest monsoon and spring transition period; however, in fall transition and northeast monsoon period number of cyclonic eddies dominates in line with the poleward and equatorward phase of EICC, respectively. Monthly eddy kinetic energy maps showed a seasonal cycle with highest values in November and April. Monthly maps of the surface current vectors provide the broader picture of the seasonal reversal of currents in February and October and low magnitude offshore flow in the summer monsoon period. The Rossby number distribution along a transect perpendicular to the coast was in the order of O(1) shows the presence of strong submesoscale dynamics in the study domain. A case study of an eddy event conferred significant changes in the biological and physical properties of the coastal ocean derived from satellite data.Plain Language Summary This study covers the quantification of mesoscale eddies associated with East India Coastal Current (EICC) along the Tamil Nadu coast from Indian Coastal Ocean Radar Network. This network is maintained by the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai. A flow geometry-based eddy detection algorithm has been applied to the daily averaged surface current maps and was able to detect and track mesoscale eddies of variable temporal and spatial scales. Total count of cyclonic eddies exceeded the anticyclonic eddies with a clear seasonal pattern concurrent with the mean flow of EICC. The number of anticyclonic eddies leads in southwest monsoon and spring transition period; however, in fall transition and North-East monsoon period number of cyclonic eddies dominates in line with the poleward and equatorward phase of EICC, respectively. Monthly maps of the surface current vectors provide the broader picture of the seasonal reversal of currents in February and October and low magnitude offshore flow in the summer monsoon period. A case study of an eddy event conferred significant changes in the biological and physical properties of the coastal ocean derived from satellite data. This study will aid to identify the potential fishing zone in the vicinity of the radar sites.

TI  - Hydrothermal alterations mapping using Quickbird and Landsat-8 data, a case study from Babbiduyeh, Kerman province, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we focus on investigating the Quickbird and Landsat-8 datasets for mapping hydrothermal and gossans alterations in reconnaissance porphyry copper mineralization in the Babbiduyeh area. This area is situated in the Central Iranian Volcano-sedimentary Complex, where large copper deposits like Sarcheshmeh as well as numerous occurrences of copper exist. The alteration zones are discriminated by implementation of band ratio and principal component analysis on the Quickbird and Landsat-8 datasets. The image processing results are evaluated by field surveys, X-ray diffraction (XRD), microscopic thin section, and spectroscopic studies of field samples as well as the 1:100000 Sarduiyeh and 1:5000 Babbiduyeh geological maps. In addition, the spectral characterizations of the samples are analyzed by visual inspection, and the PIMAView, SAMS, and ViewSpecpro software programs. The combined spectroscopic measurements, XRD analyses, and petrographic studies revealed mineral assemblages typical of the phyllic, phyllic-supergen, propylitic, argillic, and gossan alterations. The results obtained from image processing and analysis of field samples illustrated examples of effects of iron oxides and hydroxides on the surface of phyllic and argillic alterations. Hence, it can be concluded that the areas discriminated in Quickbird as gossans correspond to the phyllic and argillic alteration areas.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A statistical model is suggested for the physical parameters of different cloud types. This model has been developed through a comparison of MODIS thematic data with the results of global cloud field classification using neural network technology. The model is a set of one- and two-parametric distributions that describe fluctuations of physical parameters of different cloud types. The distribution parameters are estimated. The comparative analysis is carried out of the parameters under study for different cloud types. The features of different cloud types are determined. The statistical model developed is compared with similar works in this field and international databases; the results show their good consistency. The statistical model suggested can be regarded as a supplement to already existing cloud field models.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate
CL  - Entebbe, UGANDA
AB  - This study aimed to explore Lake Turkana's ecological reliance on hydrology and to determine the hydrological changes and consequences arising from the major hydropower and irrigation developments in the lake's basin. The major developments on Ethiopia's Omo River are especially significant as this river provides over 80% of the lake's annual freshwater influx and associated nutrients. The cascade of hydropower dams permanently dampens the natural hydrological cycles and lake level variability. The driving force of the flood influx to the lake is curtailed and the pattern of lake currents will adjust. Ultimately 80% of the river inflow to the lake will be regulated. Large volumes of water are required to initially fill the hydropower dam reservoirs. During 2015-16 when the huge Gibe III reservoir was filled, Lake Turkana's water level declined 2 m.The study has shown that large-scale irrigation schemes in the Lower Omo can potentially abstract 50% of the Omo River water, and that this would cause the lake level to shrink permanently to the detriment of the lake ecology. Possible lake level drops of over 15 m are demonstrated. The basin's natural capital is being replaced by large-scale plantation developments. The hydrological changes are drastic and the ecological consequences on Lake Turkana have not been fully understood. Without serious mitigation measures, Lake Turkana is a potential African Aral Sea disaster in the making, emulating what has happened to other great lakes such as Lake Chad.

TI  - Liberia's coastal erosion vulnerability and LULC change analysis: Post-civil war and Ebola epidemic
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In most developing countries, data for coastal change and vulnerability assessment is hard to come by due, e.g., to data inaccessibility or incomplete dataset. In some countries, e.g., Liberia, a country that was ravaged by civil war and Ebola epidemic, such extraneous factors prevent direct observations, i.e., "boots on the ground". This study examines temporal changes in land use/land cover (LULC), coastline changes, and coastal vulnerability to erosion and their effects on Liberia over a period of 29 years (1986-2015). The results from the post-classification change detection analysis using Landsat data (validated by moderate resolution Sentinel-2 product) show that bare land and sediment classes decreased over the entire study period by 5.07% and 0.06%, respectively. Water, vegetation, and residential classes are found to have increased during the 29 years of evaluation by 0.41%, 3.29% and 1.43%, respectively. Vegetation cover during the post-civil war era (2002-2015), however, reduced by about 0.31%. Furthermore, the results for the coastal analysis indicate more erosion during the period 1998-2002, i.e., the post-civil war period. The results also show an increase in residential areas possibly due to population growth, especially in the most populated areas such as Monrovia, the capital city.

TI  - Synergy of sampling techniques and ensemble classifiers for classification of urban environments using full-waveform LiDAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine scale land cover classification of urban environments is important for a variety of applications. LiDAR data has been increasingly used, separately or in conjunction with other remote sensing data, for providing land cover classification due to its high geometric accuracy as well as its additional radiometric information. An important issue in the classification of remote sensing data is the inevitable imbalance of training samples, which usually results in poor classification performance in classes with few samples (minority classes). In this paper, a synergy of sampling techniques in data mining with ensemble classifiers is proposed to address the data imbalance problem in the training datasets. Several sampling strategies, including under-sampling the majority classes, synthetic over-sampling the minority classes, hybrid-sampling, and under-sampling aggregation are examined. The results from two different datasets show superior performance of ensemble classifiers when integrated with sampling techniques. In particular, under-sampling aggregation and hybrid sampling coupled with random forests resulted in 16.7% and 5.5% improvements in the G-mean measure in two experimental datasets examined.

AB  - Heavy metal concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, and Pb were investigated in soft tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis coming from an aquaculture farm in Cala Iris sea of AlHoceima. Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected monthly during the period January to December 2016. The seasonal variations were affected significantly the concentrations of metals (Cd, Fe and Cr) in M. galloprovincialis. The highest heavy metal concentrations were recorded in winter (0.89 mg/kg, 673.2 and 3.330 mg/kg; for Cd, Fe and Cr, respectively) and the lowest values were founded in summer for Cd (0.646 mg/kg), and in autumn for Fe (340.1 mg/kg) and Cr (1.959 mg/kg). A significant effect of seasons on metal concentrations can be attributed to a number of biological and environmental inter-related factors. Data from this study may provide information on the use of M. galloprovincialis as a bioindicator for heavy metals pollution in the Cala Iris Sea.

TI  - Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Data into a Snowpack Model in the High Atlas of Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow melt from the High Atlas is a critical water resource in Morocco. In spite of its importance, monitoring the spatio-temporal evolution of key snow cover properties like the snow water equivalent remains challenging due to the lack of in situ measurements at high elevation. Since 2015, the Sentinel-2 mission provides high spatial resolution images with a 5 day revisit time, which offers new opportunities to characterize snow cover distribution in mountain regions. Here we present a new data assimilation scheme to estimate the state of the snowpack without in situ data. The model was forced using MERRA-2 data and a particle filter was developed to dynamically reduce the biases in temperature and precipitation using Sentinel-2 observations of the snow cover area. The assimilation scheme was implemented using SnowModel, a distributed energy-balance snowpack model and tested in a pilot catchment in the High Atlas. The study period covers 2015-2016 snow season which corresponds to the first operational year of Sentinel-2A, therefore the full revisit capacity was not yet achieved. Yet, we show that the data assimilation led to a better agreement with independent observations of the snow height at an automatic weather station and the snow cover extent from MODIS. The performance of the data assimilation scheme should benefit from the continuous improvements of MERRA-2 reanalysis and the full revisit capacity of Sentinel-2.

AB  - BackgroundThis study investigated the impact of pN1mi disease on the survival of T1 breast cancer patients and examined the clinical usefulness of the online PREDICT tool and updated staging system. MethodsThe node stages of 2344 patients were divided into pN0, pN1mi, and pN1a. Clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Data for 111 micrometastatic diseases were applied to the PREDICT version 2.0 and re-classified using the 8th edition of the cancer staging manual.ResultsUnivariable analyses demonstrated worse disease-free and overall survival rates for patients with node-positive cancer; however, the significance was not maintained in multivariable analyses. Chemotherapy improved outcomes in patients with node-positive and non-luminal A-like subtype cancers. The PREDICT tool demonstrated good performance when estimating the 5-year overall survival for pN1mi disease (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.834). According to the updated staging system, 74% of cases were down-staged to IA, and clearly splitting survival curves were identified.ConclusionpN1mi disease alone did not adversely affect survival outcomes. Biologic and treatment factors determined outcomes in cases of small-volume node micrometastasis. The PREDICT tool or new staging classification could help predict the survival of patients with micrometastatic sentinel nodes.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics and treatment trends of PABC and the survival rate according to the treatment. Methods: In the Korean Breast Cancer Society Registry database, women younger than 50 years and who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1996 to 2015 were included. PABC was defined as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within 1 year after delivery. Results: We examined 411 patients with PABC and 83,381 patients with non-PABC. Over time, the proportions of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy increased, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy administration rates also increased. In the past, the overall survival of patients with PABC was poorer than that of patients with non-PABC, but there was no difference in overall survival rates in more recent years. There was no difference in overall survival rates between patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-2.49; p=0.459), but PABC conferred poorer prognosis than non-PABC in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.27-2.08; p <0.001). Conclusion: There was no difference in the prognosis between patients with PABC and those with non-PABC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The increase in neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to current treatment guidelines is expected to improve the survival rate of patients with PABC.

TI  - Precise Measurements of the Along-track Surface Deformation Related to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes via Ionospheric Correction of Multiple-Aperture SAR Interferograms
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, the foreshocks of M-j 6.5 and 6.4, mainshock of M-j 7.3 besides more than 2,000 aftershocks occurred in succession. Large surface deformation occurred due to this serial earthquakes and three-dimensional measurements of the deformation have been presented for the study of fault structures (Baek, 2017). The 3d measurements retrieved from two ascending pairs (20160211_20160602, 20151119_20160616) and a descending pair (20160307_20160418) acquired from ALOS PALSAR-2. In order to avoid mixing ionospheric error components on along-track surface deformation, the descending multiple-aperture interferogram, which do not contain the deformation of aftershocks after 20160418, was utilized. For these reason, there was a temporal discrepancy of about 2 months in extracting the north-south deformation. In this study, we applied a directional filter based ionospheric correction to ascending multiple-aperture interferograms, in order to reduce this discrepancy and understand more accurate fault movements. As a result of the ionospheric correction, an additional displacement signal was observed nearby fault lines. The root-mean-squared errors compared to GPS were about 9.87, 8.13 cm respectively. These results show improvements of 4.8 and 6.4 times after ionospheric correction. We expected that these along-track measurements would be used to decide more accurate movements of faults related to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake.

TI  - A framework for SAR-optical stereogrammetry over urban areas
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, numerous remote sensing satellites provide a huge volume of diverse earth observation data. As these data show different features regarding resolution, accuracy, coverage, and spectral imaging ability, fusion techniques are required to integrate the different properties of each sensor and produce useful information. For example, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be fused with optical imagery to produce 3D information using stereogrammetric methods. The main focus of this study is to investigate the possibility of applying a stereogrammetry pipeline to very-high-resolution (VHR) SAR-optical image pairs. For this purpose, the applicability of semi-global matching is investigated in this unconventional multi-sensor setting. To support the image matching by reducing the search space and accelerating the identification of correct, reliable matches, the possibility of establishing an epipolarity constraint for VHR SAR-optical image pairs is investigated as well. In addition, it is shown that the absolute geolocation accuracy of VHR optical imagery with respect to VHR SAR imagery such as provided by TerraSAR-X can be improved by a multi-sensor block adjustment formulation based on rational polynomial coefficients. Finally, the feasibility of generating point clouds with a median accuracy of about 2 m is demonstrated and confirms the potential of 3D reconstruction from SAR-optical image pairs over urban areas.

TI  - CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF SATELLITE DATA OF NSIDC, NOAA NESDIS IN DETERMINING THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF ICE ON LAKES
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of formation and rotting of ice on lakes is an integral part of the hydrological cycle of many lakes. The conditions of the ice regime significantly influence the ecological system of lakes. The article includes calculation and analysis of errors in the determination of the spatial ice distribution (spatial resolution of 4-6 km) on Lake Onego, Lake Ladoga, Lake Segozero and Lake Vigozero within the period of 2006-2017 according to National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA NESDIS) data with regard to reliable Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (spatial resolution of 500 m). It was established that within the monitoring period, NSIDC data have the minimum mean values of errors in determining the spatial distribution of ice on lakes (3-10%) compared to NOAA NESDIS data (11-19%) and are also of more practical interest in estimating the ice coverage of lakes. The dependence of the mean value of errors that occur in the determination of the spatial distribution of ice (according to NSIDC, NOAA and NESDIS data) on the actual value of ice coverage (according to MODIS) was revealed. The results show that the NSIDC data allow estimating adequately the phases of the ice regime; however, the formation of a daily time series of ice coverage during freeze-up and break-up phases is possible only with a significant error (mean value of absolute deviations according to MODIS data is up to 35%).

TI  - Satellite and In Situ Observations for Advancing Global Earth Surface Modelling: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, we review the use of satellite-based remote sensing in combination with in situ data to inform Earth surface modelling. This involves verification and optimization methods that can handle both random and systematic errors and result in effective model improvement for both surface monitoring and prediction applications. The reasons for diverse remote sensing data and products include (i) their complementary areal and temporal coverage, (ii) their diverse and covariant information content, and (iii) their ability to complement in situ observations, which are often sparse and only locally representative. To improve our understanding of the complex behavior of the Earth system at the surface and sub-surface, we need large volumes of data from high-resolution modelling and remote sensing, since the Earth surface exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity and discontinuities in space and time. The spatial and temporal variability of the biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and anthroposphere calls for an increased use of Earth observation (EO) data attaining volumes previously considered prohibitive. We review data availability and discuss recent examples where satellite remote sensing is used to infer observable surface quantities directly or indirectly, with particular emphasis on key parameters necessary for weather and climate prediction. Coordinated high-resolution remote-sensing and modelling/assimilation capabilities for the Earth surface are required to support an international application-focused effort.

TI  - Landsat Land Use Classification for Assessing Health Risk from Industrial Air Pollution
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated to what extent risk estimates can be modified by involving in the process readily available space data and well-tested processing methods. We classify Landsat data for these types using the support vector algorithm and small characteristic training sites for each type. The dispersion modeling problem, unlike most classification tasks, is tolerant of unclassified areas. We show that the classification obtained is better than available global maps based on MODIS or Landsat. For a large chemical plant, we perform dispersion modeling and calculate the maximal hourly concentrations and acute risk from the main pollutant. We compare several versions of calculated risk based on the surface parameters assessed from global maps and variants of Landsat classification to show that the latter are twice as accurate as the former (with a 20 and 40% error, respectively). Risk estimates are shown to vary considerably (by 25%) depending on the yearly set of Landsat data used, so that using multi-year data is a must, unless land use changes considerably over the period. Thus, in assessing the hazard from air pollution from any specific plant, which is an obligatory procedure for establishing the plant's sanitary protection zone and obtaining the pollutant emission permit, it is desirable to use Landsat data.

TI  - Terrestrial Laser Scanning to Predict Canopy Area Metrics, Water Storage Capacity, and Throughfall Redistribution in Small Trees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees deliver many ecological services to the urban environment, including reduced runoff generation in storms. Trees intercept rainfall and store part of the water on leaves and branches, reducing the volume and velocity of water that reaches the soil. Moreover, trees modify the spatial distribution of rainwater under the canopy. However, measuring interception parameters is a complex task because it depends on many factors, including environmental conditions (rainfall intensity, wind speed, etc.) and tree characteristics (plant surface area, leaf and branch inclination angle, etc.). In the few last decades, remotely sensed data have been tested for retrieving tree metrics, but the use of this derived data for predicting interception parameters are still being developed. In this study, we measured the minimum water storage capacity (C-min) and throughfall under the canopies of 12 trees belonging to three different species. All trees had their plant surface metrics calculated: plant surface area (PSA), plant area index (PAI), and plant area density (PAD). Trees were scanned with a mobile terrestrial laser scan (TLS) to obtain their individual canopy point clouds. Point clouds were used to calculate canopy metrics (canopy projected area and volume) and TLS-derived surface metrics. Measured surface metrics were then correlated to derived TLS metrics, and the relationship between TLS data and interception parameters was tested. Additionally, TLS data was used in analyses of throughfall distribution on a sub-canopy scale. The significant correlation between the directly measured surface area and TLS-derived metrics validates the use of the remotely sensed data for predicting plant area metrics. Moreover, TLS-derived metrics showed a significant correlation with a water storage capacity parameter (C-min). The present study supports the use of TLS data as a tool for measuring tree metrics and ecosystem services such as C-min; however, more studies to understand how to apply remotely sensed data into ecological analyses in the urban environment must be encouraged.

TI  - AutoCloud plus , a "Universal" Physical and Statistical Model-Based 2D Spatial Topology-Preserving Software for Cloud/Cloud-Shadow Detection in Multi-Sensor Single-Date Earth Observation Multi-Spectral Imagery-Part 1: Systematic ESA EO Level 2 Product Generation at the Ground Segment as Broad Context
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) defines Earth observation (EO) Level 2 information product the stack of: (i) a single-date multi-spectral (MS) image, radiometrically corrected for atmospheric, adjacency and topographic effects, with (ii) its data-derived scene classification map (SCM), whose thematic map legend includes quality layers cloud and cloud-shadow. Never accomplished to date in an operating mode by any EO data provider at the ground segment, systematic ESA EO Level 2 product generation is an inherently ill-posed computer vision (CV) problem (chicken-and-egg dilemma) in the multi-disciplinary domain of cognitive science, encompassing CV as subset-of artificial general intelligence (AI). In such a broad context, the goal of our work is the research and technological development (RTD) of a universal AutoCloud+ software system in operating mode, capable of systematic cloud and cloud-shadow quality layers detection in multi-sensor, multi-temporal and multi-angular EO big data cubes characterized by the five Vs, namely, volume, variety, veracity, velocity and value. For the sake of readability, this paper is divided in two. Part 1 highlights why AutoCloud+ is important in a broad context of systematic ESA EO Level 2 product generation at the ground segment. The main conclusions of Part 1 are both conceptual and pragmatic in the definition of remote sensing best practices, which is the focus of efforts made by intergovernmental organizations such as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). First, the ESA EO Level 2 product definition is recommended for consideration as state-of-the-art EO Analysis Ready Data (ARD) format. Second, systematic multi-sensor ESA EO Level 2 information product generation is regarded as: (a) necessary-but-not-sufficient pre-condition for the yet-unaccomplished dependent problems of semantic content-based image retrieval (SCBIR) and semantics-enabled information/knowledge discovery (SEIKD) in multi-source EO big data cubes, where SCBIR and SEIKD are part-of the GEO-CEOS visionary goal of a yet-unaccomplished Global EO System of Systems (GEOSS). (b) Horizontal policy, the goal of which is background developments, in a seamless chain of innovation needed for a new era of Space Economy 4.0. In the subsequent Part 2 (proposed as Supplementary Materials), the AutoCloud+ software system requirements specification, information/knowledge representation, system design, algorithm, implementation and preliminary experimental results are presented and discussed.

TI  - Retrieving river baseflow from SWOT spaceborne mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of aquifer contribution to river discharge is of primary importance to evaluate the impact of climatic and anthropogenic stresses on the availability of water resources. Several baseflow estimation methods require river discharge measurements, which can be difficult to obtain at high spatio-temporal resolution for large basins. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will provide discharge estimations for large rivers ( > 50-100 m wide) even in ungauged basins. The frequency of these estimations depends mainly on latitude and ranges from zero to more than ten values in the 21-day satellite cycle. This work aims at answering the following question: can baseflow be estimated from SWOT observations during the mission lifetime? An algorithm based on hydrograph separation by Chapman's filter was developed to automatically estimate the baseflow in a river network at regional scale ( > 10 000 km(2)). The algorithm was applied to the Seine river basin (75 000 km(2), France) using the discharge time series simulated at daily time step by a coupled hydrological-hydrogeological model to obtain the reference baseflow estimations. The same algorithm is then forced with discharge time series sampled at SWOT observation frequency. The average baseflow is estimated with good accuracy for all the reaches which are observed at least once per cycle (relative bias less than 8%). The time evolution of baseflow is also rather well retrieved, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient above 0.7 for 96% of the network length. An analysis of the effect of SWOT discharge uncertainties on baseflow estimation shows that bias is the component of discharge error that most contributes to the error on baseflow. Anyway, when the combined effect of SWOT discharge sampling and SWOT discharge uncertainties is considered, the error on baseflow estimates is slightly smaller than that on discharge. This work provides new potential for the SWOT mission in terms of global hydrological analysis and water cycle closure.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the changes of forest cover in the region of Belezma-BATNA in North Algeria, during a period of 31 years (1986 to 2017), based on the use of remote sensing data (diachronic analysis of satellite images Landsat) by calculating indices (NDVI and NDWI). The results revealed significant changes during this period. Regressive changes in vegetation cover, particularly between 2000 and 2017. This degradation is mainly located in the southern and southeastern part of the Belezma forest resulting from several natural and anthropogenic factors. It can be considered that drought is one of the main causes causing the regressive change of forest during this period with other factors that promote this degradation such as overgrazing, fire, phytosanitary problems (caterpillar processionary), etc.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective of Phase I of the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), a multiphase surveillance study characterizing the burden of disease in South Asia, was to inform data collection for prospective surveillance and to capture clinical aspects of disease.Methods. Through a retrospective record review conducted at hospitals in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, we examined laboratory and clinical records to assess the culture positivity rate for Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, age and sex distribution, and antimicrobial susceptability in each country.Results. Of all blood cultures performed in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, 1.5%, 0.43%, 2%, and 1.49%, respectively, were positive for S. Typhi and 0.24%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 0.67%, respectively, were positive for S. Paratyphi. A higher proportion of laboratory-confirmed infections in Bangladesh and Pakistan were aged <= 5 years, while India and Nepal had a higher proportion of participants aged 15-25 years. In all countries, the sex of the majority of participants was male. The majority of isolates in all countries were resistant to fluoroquinolones, with a high proportion also resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.Discussion. Enteric fever remains endemic in South Asia. Data generated by this study can help inform strategies for implementation and evaluation of prevention and control measures.

TI  - Recognizing and Acknowledging Worldview Diversity in the Inclusive Classroom
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the increasing migration into Germany that has taken place in recent years and German efforts to establish an inclusive school system, which enables learners from different religious, ethnic, language and social backgrounds with and without disabilities to participate, religious education has become a key topic for interdisciplinary discourse between theology, philosophy, and pedagogy in German schools. The following questions are of special interest: How can we manage diversity in inclusive classroom settings in general, and specifically: how can we do so with regard to worldview diversity? Does worldview diversity in schools exist, and if so, how can we recognize it in its plurality and complexity? How can we acknowledge different worldviews in the context of a changing inclusive school system? In this article, we would like to present the theoretical foundation, the research setting and the first findings of our ongoing pilot studies of worldview education at an inclusive German school. The experiments are part of a larger project context that is also described. The case study presented in this article, in which innovative language and machine learning technology was used for data analysis, illustrates the potential of inclusive methods and didactic concepts such as Universal Design for Learning, Learning in the Presence of the Other, and Reflexive Inclusion for inclusive worldview education in the context of a religiously pluralized and secularized society.

AB  - This article examines the book culture of the Buryat Buddhists of the Southern Siberia. Based on social archaeographic studies, the article posits a link between local book culture and the stable identity of Buryat Buddhist. Defining Buryat Buddhist identity based on an analysis of different aspects of their worldview, cultural life, and historical past, this article reveals how Buddhist book culture and home life are the most important aspects in the formation of local identity. The analysis confirms that a radical change in the mechanism of the transfer of tradition, social changes, and the economic crisis led to the transformation of the vector of development in the traditional book culture of the Buryats, highlighting that the main priority is not the religious but the ethnic component.

TI  - The Implications of Right-Wing Authoritarianism for Non-Muslims' Aggression toward Muslims in the United States
T2  - ANALYSES OF SOCIAL ISSUES AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, anti-Muslim antipathy dramatically escalated in the United States. We argue that a major contributor to this hostility is endorsement of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) because people high in RWA tend to respond aggressively toward groups that they view as threatening particularly when they perceive that such aggression is supported by authority figures. We posit that Americans high in RWA view Muslims as threatening traditional American norms and perceive that the U.S. government is at war with Islam. Across three studies, we present consistent support for our hypothesis that RWA is associated with endorsing and engaging in hostile behavior toward Muslims. In addition, this hostility is mediated by the perception that Muslims threaten societal norms and that the government is actively at war with Islam (Study 3). The implications for the reduction of aggression toward Muslims and the impact of RWA on hostility toward other outgroups are discussed.

TI  - Optimizing Inpatient Body MRI Utilization: A Granular Look at Trends, Quality, Yield, and Timing
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. We sought to analyze body MRI utilization trends, quality, yield, and timing among inpatients in a tertiary care academic medical center.MATERIALS AND METHODS. By use of billing data from fiscal years (FYs) 2006-2015, the volume of admissions was compared with the total number of inpatient body MRI examinations. MRI examinations per admissions and discharge were adjusted using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services case mix index by FY. Linear regression was used to assess trends. In addition, each inpatient body MRI examination performed in FY 2015 was evaluated and graded on its quality and yield and was judged as to whether it could have been performed on an outpatient basis.RESULTS. There was an increase in the number of inpatient body MRI examinations, from 637 examinations in FY 2006 to 871 examinations in FY 2015 (p = 0.005). By adjusting for case mix, the upward trend for body MRI use persisted (p = 0.012). Regarding quality, 2.3% of all inpatient body MRI examinations were nondiagnostic, 40.4% were limited quality, and 573% were of diagnostic quality. Concerning yield, 20.8% of all examinations had no yield, 5.1% of examinations had no yield but incidental findings, and 74.1% of examinations had a positive yield. Finally, regarding timing, 30.2% of examinations could have been performed as outpatient examinations.CONCLUSION. At our institution, the number of inpatient body MRI examinations has increased significantly over the past 10 years. Many of the examinations, however, are poor quality, often give redundant information, and could be performed in the outpatient setting.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change Analysis using Markov-Based Model for Eleyele Reservoir
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) are important components of the environmental system and changes in it mirror the impacts of human activities on the environment. These impacts needed to be determined in order to get a clear picture of the extent at which different land use practices affect hydrologic regime and water quality. Therefore, this study analyzed the effects of LULC on Eleyele reservoir for a period of 32 years. Landsat images of 1984, 2000 and 2016 covered by path 191 and rows 55 were acquired, a modified version of Aderson scheme of LULC classification was used to stratify the images, while the LULC map was analyzed and projected until year 2032 using IDRISI Selva 17.0 and ERDAS 2013 softwares respectively. Changes that have occurred within the study area were determined using LULC MARKOV. Land Use Land Cover built up area increased from 688.30 ha to 952.68 ha and from 952.68 ha to 2164.5 ha between years 1984 to 2000, and 2000 to 2016 respectively. LULC maps of 2000 and 2016 showed the open water also reduced from 101.6 ha in year 2000 to 61.74 ha in 2016. DEM showed that 8.5%, and 1.9% transitioned to vegetation cover and built up area in 1984 and 2000 respectively. Land Use Land Cover MARKOV chain analysis shows that by projection, the reservoir area will reduce further to 39.08 ha by the year 2032. The study has established that reserved forest zone suffered degradation with a noticeable increase in encroachment on the reservoir. LULC approach can be used to predict the effect of land use on reservoirs. Copyright (C) 2018 Bello et al.

TI  - Monitoring Crop Evapotranspiration and Crop Coefficients over an Almond and Pistachio Orchard Throughout Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In California, water is a perennial concern. As competition for water resources increases due to growth in population, California's tree nut farmers are committed to improving the efficiency of water used for food production. There is an imminent need to have reliable methods that provide information about the temporal and spatial variability of crop water requirements, which allow farmers to make irrigation decisions at field scale. This study focuses on estimating the actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficients of an almond and pistachio orchard located in Central Valley (California) during an entire growing season by combining a simple crop evapotranspiration model with remote sensing data. A dataset of the vegetation index NDVI derived from Landsat-8 was used to facilitate the estimation of the basal crop coefficient (K-cb), or potential crop water use. The soil water evaporation coefficient (K-e) was measured from microlysimeters. The water stress coefficient (K-s) was derived from airborne remotely sensed canopy thermal-based methods, using seasonal regressions between the crop water stress index (CWSI) and stem water potential (Psi(stem)). These regressions were statistically-significant for both crops, indicating clear seasonal differences in pistachios, but not in almonds. In almonds, the estimated maximum K-cb values ranged between 1.05 to 0.90, while for pistachios, it ranged between 0.89 to 0.80. The model indicated a difference of 97 mm in transpiration over the season between both crops. Soil evaporation accounted for an average of 16% and 13% of the total actual evapotranspiration for almonds and pistachios, respectively. Verification of the model-based daily crop evapotranspiration estimates was done using eddy-covariance and surface renewal data collected in the same orchards, yielding an R-2 >= 0.7 and average root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.74 and 0.91 mm center dot day(-1) for almond and pistachio, respectively. It is concluded that the combination of crop evapotranspiration models with remotely-sensed data is helpful for upscaling irrigation information from plant to field scale and thus may be used by farmers for making day-to-day irrigation management decisions.

TI  - Bayesian geostatistical modelling of <i>PM</i><sub>10</sub> and <i>PM</i><sub>2.5</sub> surface level concentrations in Europe using high-resolution satellite-derived products
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality monitoring across Europe is mainly based on in situ ground stations, which are too sparse to accurately assess the exposure effects of air pollution for the entire continent. The demand for precise predictive models that estimate gridded geophysical parameters of ambient air at high spatial resolution has rapidly grown. Here, we investigate the potential of satellite-derived products to improve particulate matter (PM) estimates. Bayesian geostatistical models addressing confounding between the spatial distribution of pollutants and remotely sensed predictors were developed to estimate yearly averages of both, fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) surface PM concentrations, at 1 km(2) spatial resolution over 46 European countries. Model outcomes were compared to geostatistical, geographically weighted and land-use regression formulations. Rigorous model selection identified the Earth observation data which contribute most to pollutants' estimation. Geostatistical models outperformed the predictive ability of the frequently employed land-use regression. The resulting estimates of PM10, and PM2.5, which represent the main air quality indicators for the urban Sustainable Development Goal, indicate that in 2016, 66.2% of the European population was breathing air above the WHO air quality guidelines thresholds. Our estimates are readily available to policy makers and scientists assessing the effects of long-term exposure to pollution on human and ecosystem health.

TI  - Current Intensity Trends in the Labrador and Irminger Seas Based on Satellite Altimetry Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level measurements from an absolute dynamic typography dataset for the period of 1993-2015 were used to study the variability in geostrophic circulation in the Labrador and Irminger seas. Analysis of current intensity trends calculated by geostrophic formulas has shown a weakening in cyclonic circulation observed in these two convection centers. The intensity trends are negative in all the main currents making up the Subpolar Gyre: the Labrador, East Greenland, West Greenland, and Irminger currents. On average, the negative intensity trends in the indicated currents are -0.3 cm s(-1) yr(-1), in individual areas reaching -0.5 cm s(-1) yr(-1), which corresponds to a decrease in current speed of 6.9-11.5 cm/s for the 23-year interval. Weakening of cyclonic circulation is likely predetermined by weakening convection processes and a decrease in the dome-shaped curvature of isopycnal surfaces generated by upwelling of weakly stratified water closer to the surface. This is confirmed by analysis of satellite data: in periods when deep convection weakens, the intensity of cyclonic circulation decreases at the margin of the Labrador and Irminger seas. Simultaneously with weakening currents, an increase in intensity is observed from the outer (with respect to the convection centers) margin of the considered currents, including in coastal zones.

TI  - Comparing Eco-Phytocoenotic and Eco-Floristic Methods of Classification to Estimate Coenotic Diversity and to Map Forest Vegetation
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coenotic diversity of forests of the model region in southwestern Moscow oblast with an area of 51 500 ha has been assessed using data from field studies, remote sensing (Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-8 OLI, and TIRS), and digital terrain models of the landscape. Forest communities are classified using two different methods: eco-phytocoenotic and eco-floristic. We recognize 15 eco-phytocoenotic syntaxa at the level of group associations and 9 eco-floristic syntaxa. The high accuracy of grouping of releves is supported statistically for each classification approach. The quality of classification is evaluated by stepwise discriminant analysis based on the representation and abundance of species. It is higher for eco-floristic syntaxa (87.1%) than for eco-phytocoenotic ones (78.9%). The adjustment of composition and names of syntaxa of eco-phytocoenotic classification ensure the compliance of typological and mapping units. The prediction quality of syntaxa recognized from pixel brightness and topographic variables is 78.6%. The quality of discriminant analysis of recognized syntaxa of the eco-phytocoenotic model show a lower accuracy of mapping model (69.7%). Large-scale maps of forest vegetation for the model region based on both classifications have been developed. It is shown that representations of eco-phytocoenotic units have a higher accuracy, as these units correspond to recent state of plant communities at their actual succession stage. On the other hand, eco-floristic units provide insight into the potential vegetation composition of a habitat. The large number of syntaxa of eco-floristic classification (associations and subassociations) made it possible to trace general patterns of vegetation on largescale maps. This feature could be more informative in medium- and small-scale mapping.

TI  - <i>M</i><SUP>3</SUP>Fusion: A Deep Learning Architecture for Multiscale Multimodal Multitemporal Satellite Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern Earth Observation systems provide remote sensing data at different temporal and spatial resolutions. Among all the available spatial mission, today the Sentinel-2 program supplies high temporal (every five days) and high spatial resolution (HSR) (10 m) images that can be useful to monitor land cover dynamics. On the other hand, very HSR (VHSR) imagery is still essential to figure out land cover mapping characterized by fine spatial patterns. Understanding how to jointly leverage these complementary sources in an efficient way when dealing with land cover mapping is a current challenge in remote sensing. With the aim of providing land cover mapping through the fusion of multi-temporal HSR and VHSR satellite images, we propose a suitable end-to-end deep learning framework, namely M-3 Fusion, which is able to simultaneously leverage the temporal knowledge contained in time series data as well as the fine spatial information available in VHSR images. Experiments carried out on the Reunion Island study area confirm the quality of our proposal considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

TI  - Analysis of land use and cover in the hydrographic basin of the Coco River and its implications on Permanent Preservation Areas as a tool in water resources management
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies focused on the diagnosis of the permanent preservation areas (PPAs) in relation to the attendance of the legislation are important for the management of the water resources. In this way, the present work was aimed at the evaluation of the coverage, land use and conflicts of use in the areas of permanent preservation (PPAs) of watercourses in the Coco River basin, located on the right bank of the Araguaia River basin in the state of Tocantins. To do so, the basin's land cover and use was mapped using images from Landsat 8 (OLI Operational Land Imager) satellite for the year 2015. For the delimitation of the PPAs, the drainage network was manually vectorized in the 1: 5000 scale, using images from the RapidEye satellite. In possession of the hydrography, PPA buffers were created, which obeyed the protection ranges defined by the legislation for each watercourse. Land use conflicts were obtained by overlapping the generated map with the image classification and PPA map. The results of the research indicated that the Coco River basin presents 56.91% of its total area covered by anthropic activities, with a deficit of 32.8% of PPA, with pasture being the dominant use. The Upper Coco River, Ribeirao Piedade and Ribeirao Surubim sub-basins presented the highest percentage of conflict, compared to the other analyzed basins, with 46.03%, 40.1% and 39.35%, respectively. Finally, it was possible to understand, from the study, the distribution of uses throughout the basin, their conflicts and its possible consequences on legally protected areas, can be an effective tool in decision making for investments in conservation actions in the Rio do Coco river basin.

TI  - Beyond the Split between Formal School Identity and Teachers' Personal Worldviews: Towards an Inclusive (Christian) School Identity
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Religious diversity within Dutch schools has greatly increased. We carried out an empirical study to offer insights into how secondary school teachers (try to) relate to the formal Protestant Christian identity of their school, the challenges they experience in relation to their own personal worldview, and the recommendations they have to overcome these challenges. In our qualitative study, we interviewed thirty-two teachers from eight different schools. In selecting the schools, we took into account the diversity of Protestant Christian secondary education in the Netherlands. The teachers teach different subjects in a variety of disciplines (languages, creative arts, sciences, et cetera). For many teachers, their personal worldview does not align neatly with the formal religious identity of the school. As a result, teachers experience challenges in relation to, for example, the act of daily worship and (Christian) celebrations. Teachers also experience tensions regarding the extent to which schools could or should be open towards (religious) others. Teachers' advice, among other recommendations, is to create room for an open exchange of views, opinions, and experiences between teachers and principals. Some teachers recommend that their principal reconsider the formal Christian identity of the school and search for another, more inclusive school identity with which everyone involved can better identify.

TI  - Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The definition of nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) after a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) just included the evaluation of axillary lymph node (ALN) without internal mammary lymph node. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of internal mammary-sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) in patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC. Methods: From November 2011 to 2017, 179 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent operation after NAC were included in this study. All patients received radiotracer injection with modified injection technology. IM-SLNB would be performed on patients with internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IMSLN) visualization. Results: Among the 158 patients with cN+ disease, the rate of nodal pCR was 36.1% (57/158). Among the 179 patients, the visualization rate of IMSLN was 31.8% (57/179) and was 12.3% (7/57) and 87.7% (50/57) among those with cN(0) and cN+ disease, respectively. Furthermore, the detection rate of IMSLN was 31.3% (56/179). The success rate of IM-SLNB was 982% (56/57). The IMSLN metastasis rate was 7.1% (4/56), and all of them were accompanied by ALN metastasis. The number of positive ALNs in patients with IMSLN metastasis was 3, 6, 8, and 9. The pathology nodal stage had been changed from pN(1)/pN(2) to pN(3b). The pathology stage had been changed from IIA/IIIA to IIIC. Conclusion: Patients with visualization of IMSLN should perform IM-SLNB after NAC, especially for patients with cN+ disease, in order to complete lymph nodal staging. IM-SLNB could further improve the definition of nodal pCR and guide the internal mammary node irradiation.

TI  - WHAT THEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION COULD AND COULD NOT BE
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldview of theism proposes an ultimate and global explanation of existence itself. What could such "theological explanation" possibly amount to? I shall consider what is unsatisfactory about a widely accepted answer - namely that existence is to be explained as produced and sustained by a supernatural personal agent of unsurpassably great power and goodness. I will suggest an alternative way in which existence could be open to a genuinely ultimate explanation, namely in terms of its being inherently directed upon a supremely good end or telos and existing just because that telos is concretely realized. On this "euteleological" view, theological explanation, though it may need to be compatible with our best scientific theoretical explanations, operates in a clearly distinct explanatory dimension.

TI  - Assessment of the reliability of supervised classifications of Landsat-7, ASTER, and SPOT-5 multispectral data in rock unit discriminations of Jabal Daf-Wadi Fatima area, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral, multiresolution remotely sensed data were processed to emphasize geological interpretation of Jabal Daf-Wadi Fatima area. The investigated area is situated in the central western part of Saudi Arabia and geologically consists of igneous and metamorphosed rocks overlain by sedimentary sequence belonging to the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Three sets of digital satellite data, Landsat-7 ETM+, ASTER, and SPOT-5, were used in this study. The application of image processing techniques enables to identify and delineate the lithologic units and the structural features of the study area. The results of this study indicate that the confusion matrix of the three maximum likelihood supervised classifications of the three datasets shows that the Landsat ETM+ bands scored the best degree of average and overall accuracy (77 and 78%, respectively). This classification distinguishes most of the rock units for mapping in the investigated area. The supervised classification of ASTER and SPOT bands has lower degrees of accuracy than the classified Landsat data. The supervised classification of SPOT bands has a degree of average and overall accuracy of 66 and 67%, respectively, but it is the best for distinguishing the spectral signatures of the different members of Fatima Formation (lower, middle, and upper members). The statistical analyses of the confusion matrices of classifications and the interpretation of the produced classified thematic maps revealed that the classification accuracy does not necessary depend on the spatial resolution of satellite data. The data of the highest spatial resolution such as SPOT data are also very useful in emphasizing and classifying the rock units of a small outcrop area. The detailed geological map of Jabal Daf-Wadi Fatima area is interpreted in this work from supervised classified images of different resolutions as well as the structure map of this area. This study shows that it is preferable to use the supervised classifications of multiresolution data for rock unit discrimination in detailed field mapping.

TI  - Tundra Trait Team: A database of plant traits spanning the tundra biome
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Motivation The Tundra Trait Team (TTT) database includes field-based measurements of key traits related to plant form and function at multiple sites across the tundra biome. This dataset can be used to address theoretical questions about plant strategy and trade-offs, trait-environment relationships and environmental filtering, and trait variation across spatial scales, to validate satellite data, and to inform Earth system model parameters. Main types of variable contained Spatial location and grain The database contains 91,970 measurements of 18 plant traits. The most frequently measured traits (> 1,000 observations each) include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus content, leaf C:N and N:P, seed mass, and stem specific density. Measurements were collected in tundra habitats in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, including Arctic sites in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia and Siberia, alpine sites in the European Alps, Colorado Rockies, Caucasus, Ural Mountains, Pyrenees, Australian Alps, and Central Otago Mountains (New Zealand), and sub-Antarctic Marion Island. More than 99% of observations are georeferenced. Time period and grain Major taxa and level of measurement All data were collected between 1964 and 2018. A small number of sites have repeated trait measurements at two or more time periods. Trait measurements were made on 978 terrestrial vascular plant species growing in tundra habitats. Most observations are on individuals (86%), while the remainder represent plot or site means or maximums per species. Software format csv file and GitHub repository with data cleaning scripts in R; contribution to TRY plant trait database (www.try-db.org) to be included in the next version release.

TI  - The Transition from Hospital to Home: Protocol for a Longitudinal Study of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
T2  - BRAIN IMPAIRMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in Australia. Evidence shows that multidisciplinary rehabilitation and support in the six months following TBI is important for successful independent living and social re-integration. Despite this, access to services and supports during this period is often limited by environmental, socio-economic, geographic and cultural factors. Australian studies on outcomes after brain injury have reported primarily on non-Indigenous people. This study will investigate key sentinel events during the transition from hospital to home after a TBI in the first longitudinal study with Indigenous Australians.Method: Indigenous Australians admitted to one of three major trauma hospitals in northern Australia with a TBI, and their care givers, will be recruited. Clinical and brain injury risk factor information, along with measures of cognitive function, transition events, mental health and community re-integration will be collected at three time points prior to hospital discharge, and at three and six months post-discharge. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted. Data will be analysed using regression methods for the quantitative component, and situational analysis for the qualitative component. Annual rates of brain injury will be calculated for patients admitted to tertiary hospital facilities in the study region with a diagnosis of TBI.Discussion: Understanding the experience and events which shape the transition period is critical to determining the services and supports that may enhance transition outcomes, and ensure that such services are culturally appropriate and endorsed by Indigenous families and communities.

T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article dwells on the discussion about the role of the Russian language for the integration of the Slavs between two generations of Panslavists: the "patriarch of Russian Slavic studies" and a convinced Slavophile V.I. Lamansky (1825-1902) and a supporter of the "new Slavic worldview", leader of the Serbian "Radical Party" Lubomir Stojanovic (1860-1930), which unfolded in the journal "Slavyanskyy vek" (Vienna, 1900-1904). The analysis of their argumentation makes it possible to understand the transformations that took place in the ideology of Pan-Slavism in the early 20th century, to explain the revival of the interest in the "Slavic idea" at the turn of the century, and to characterize Pan-Slavism as "cultural and economic" phenomenon in the early the 20th century.

TI  - Perspectives on using marine species as bioindicators of plastic pollution
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The ever-increasing level of marine pollution due to plastic debris is a globally recognized threat that needs effective actions of control and mitigation. Using marine organisms as bioindicators of plastic pollution can provide crucial information that would better integrate the spatial and temporal presence of plastic debris in the sea. Given their long and frequent migrations, numerous marine species that ingest plastics can provide information on the presence of plastic debris but only on large spatial and temporal scales, thus making it difficult to identify quantitative correlations of ingested plastics within well-defined spatio-temporal patterns. Given the complex dynamics of plastics in the sea, the biomonitoring of marine plastic debris should rely on the combination of several bioindicator species with different characteristics that complement each other. Other critical aspects include the standardization of sampling protocols, analytical detection methods and metrics to evaluate the effects of ingested plastics in marine species.

AB  - This paper reports the data obtained on the anomalous train of soliton-like internal record-high waves in the Black Sea (h = 16 m). Such a train was detected at a depth of 30 m in October 2015 on the shelf near Gelendzhik with the use of an acoustic Doppler current profiler and a chain of thermistors and by processing of a space radar image obtained from the SENTINEL-1A satellite. The intensive atmospheric front revealed by meteorological data generated such internal waves, which are anomalous for the Black Sea.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Burnt-out Areas and Emissions of Harmful Contaminants Due to Forest and Other Wildfires in Russia
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we summarize the results of the satellite monitoring of various types of wildfires, as well as emissions of carbon-containing the CO and CO2 gases and the fine PM2.5 aerosol into the atmosphere due to wildfires, throughout the Russian Federation and several of its regions in 2005-2017. The methodology and features of the satellite system used for the monitoring are described. An analysis of the overall estimations of the total wildfire areas, areas of burnt-out forests, as well as the volumes of harmful contaminant emissions due to them, is given. It is shown that between 2005 and 2017 the total areas of all types of wildfires in Russia, including forest fires, more than halved due to the measures taken on urgent fire detection and well-timed actions to extinguish them. The burnt-out areas reached a peak of 234700 km(2) in 2006 were minimal (74000 km(2)) in 2013. The largest areas of burnt-out forest were in the Siberian Federal District. Fires spread to a maximum of 53600 km(2) in this region in 2012, while the total burnt-out areas covered 65000 km(2).

TI  - Monitoring Anthropogenic Impact on Some Coastal Water Areas of the Black Sea Using Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of comprehensive monitoring of anthropogenic impact on some coastal water areas of the Black Sea are presented. Multispectral satellite imagery and sea truth hydrooptical and hydroacoustical data acquired aboard research vessels are used as the main information sources. In the course of monitoring, more than 300 multispectral Resurs-P, GeoEye, WorldView, Landsat, Sentinel-2 and other satellite images of water areas near the cities of Sevastopol and Gelendzhik were systematized and analyzed. For processing the multispectral satellite imagery, we use an approach based on the calculation and analysis of distributions of relative variability characteristics of the backscattering signal in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (color indices). The sea truth measurements, which were carried out using a SIPO9 light attenuation index spectral meter and an ADCP acoustic Doppler profilometer, allowed us to detect submerged pollutant plumes and validate the results of satellite data processing. By using the suggested methods, we found and quantified the characteristics of intensive anthropogenic impacts due to submerged outfalls in the coastal waters near Sevastopol and Gelendzhik. Processing the multispectral satellite imagery and sea-truth data revealed several disruptions in the outfall collectors located in these coastal waters.

TI  - Decision tree for mapping of halophyte cover around Ghannouch, Tunisia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environment of Ghannouch in the south-east of Tunisia is characterized by the wide-spread hypersaline soils, typically colonized by halophytes. The study of their distribution is required in order to reveal the extent of salinization and its dynamic. Mapping and monitoring with a remote sensing approach are foreseen as the ways to trace the spatial and temporal dimensions of the phenomenon. The identification of halophyte vegetation can take advantage by analyzing optical remote sensing data. Here, we propose using a decision tree approach applied to European Space Agency Sentinel-2 imagery, for an accurate land cover mapping of Ghannouch district in Gabes governorate. Data pre-processing was carried out using the European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform and the SEN2COR toolboxes. The mapping approach combines the spectral information in several channels of the visible-near-infrared spectrum. The land cover identification was performed following a spectral classification approach, exploiting several optical indices, normalized difference water index, normalized difference vegetation index, and several soil salinity index, in order to elaborate a decision tree algorithm. As a result, for an area of interest of 50 x 50 km(2), at least 68% was classified as halophyte land cover. This mapping exercise represents an important step toward improved halophytes mapping in Tunisia and could be used to monitor the status of other salinity prone regions in the world.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring soil erosion in a watershed in western Algeria
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fergoug watershed is subject to severe water erosion and land degradation that threaten agricultural sustainability for local populations. Soil loss and degradation by water erosion were estimated using the universal soil loss equation (USLE). The spatial distribution of soil losses was determined using the following parameters: the erosivity factor (R), obtained using climatic data from 12 local stations over a period of 41years; the land cover factor (C), obtained using LandSat-TM satellite imagery 7 and 8; the erodibility factor (K), estimated from soil particle size analyses; and the topographic factor (LS), obtained from a digital terrain model. The Fergoug watershed is characterized by complex topography, and the topographic factor reached a value of 14.29. The erodibility factor K ranged from 0.08 to 0.38, and high values were recorded for about 20% of the watershed. The rainfall erosivity factor R ranged between 212.32 and 146.73 from east to west. The plant cover factor varied inter- and intra-annually from 2.24 in May 2000 to 0.06 in May 2015. As a result, soil losses varied from 0.35 to 617.66tons per hectare per year (t/ha/year) in a rainy year, and from 0.27 to 1188.92t/ha/year in a dry year. The combined effects of the slope angle and the vegetation cover were shown to play a major role in soil losses in this area.

TI  - Parasites of the mind. Why cultural theorists need the meme's eye view
T2  - COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Are there any such things as mind parasites ? By analogy with biological parasites, such cultural items are supposed to subvert or harm the interests of their host. The hypothesis of cultural parasitism has appeared in different guises in the burgeoning field of cultural evolution. To unpack the notion of mind parasites, we first clear some conceptual ground around the concept of cultural adaptation and its relation to human agency. We then formulate Millikan's challenge: how can cultural items develop novel purposes of their own, cross- cutting or subverting our own personal purposes ? If this central challenge is not met, talk of cultural 'parasites' or 'selfish memes' remains vacuous. First, we discuss why other attempts to answer Millikan's challenge have failed. In particular, we put to rest the claims of panmemetics, a somewhat sinister worldview according to which human culture is nothing more than a swarm of selfish agents, plotting and scheming behind the scenes. Next, we reject a more reasonable, but still overly permissive approach to mind parasites, which equates them with biologically maladaptive culture. Finally, we present our own answer to Millikan's challenge: certain systems of misbelief can be fruitfully treated as cultural parasites, designed by cultural evolution to subvert the interests of their human hosts. As a proof of concept, we discuss witchcraft beliefs in early modern Europe, and show how the meme's eye view promises to shed new light on a mystery that historians and social scientists have been wrestling with for decades.

TI  - Soil Moisture and Irrigation Mapping in A Semi-Arid Region, Based on the Synergetic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a technique for the mapping of soil moisture and irrigation, at the scale of agricultural fields, based on the synergistic interpretation of multi-temporal optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1). The Kairouan plain, a semi-arid region in central Tunisia (North Africa), was selected as a test area for this study. Firstly, an algorithm for the direct inversion of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was developed for the spatialization of the soil water content between 2015 and 2017. The soil moisture retrieved from these observations was first validated using ground measurements, recorded over 20 reference fields of cereal crops. A second method, based on the use of neural networks, was also used to confirm the initial validation. The results reported here show that the soil moisture products retrieved from remotely sensed data are accurate, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 5% between the two moisture products. In addition, the analysis of soil moisture and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products over cultivated fields, as a function of time, led to the classification of irrigated and rainfed areas on the Kairouan plain, and to the production of irrigation maps at the scale of individual fields. This classification is based on a decision tree approach, using a combination of various statistical indices of soil moisture and NDVI time series. The resulting irrigation maps were validated using reference fields within the study site. The best results were obtained with classifications based on soil moisture indices only, with an accuracy of 77%.

TI  - Dogs (<i>Canis familiaris</i>) as Sentinels for Human Infectious Disease and Application to Canadian Populations: A Systematic Review
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - In a world where climate change, vector expansion, human activity, and pathogen dispersal do not respect boundaries, the human-animal-pathogen interface has become less defined. Consequently, a One Health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from high- and middle-income-economy countries, with 35% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25% from North America, and 11% from the European/Central Asia region. Bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. Only six out of 142 studies described disease in Canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within Indigenous communities, one researched Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbia, and one researched arboviruses in Quebec. Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked. Further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for California serogroup viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis.

TI  - Modeling Urban Encroachment on the Agricultural Land of the Eastern Nile Delta Using Remote Sensing and a GIS-Based Markov Chain Model Kelsee
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, the Nile Delta has played an integral part in Egyptian civilization, as its fertile soils have been cultivated for centuries. The region offers a lush oasis among the expansive arid climate of Northern Africa; however, in recent decades, many anthropogenic changes to the environment have jeopardized Egypt's agricultural productivity. Political instability and lack of sufficient regulations regarding urban growth and encroachment have put agricultural land in the area at risk. Advanced geospatial techniques were used to assess the rate at which urban areas are increasing within the region. A hybrid classification of Landsat satellite imagery for the eastern sector of the Nile Delta, between the years 1988 and 2017, was conducted to map major land-use and land-cover (LULC) classes. The statistical change analysis revealed that urban areas increased by 222.5% over the study period (29 years). Results indicated that urban areas are encroaching mainly on established agricultural lands within the Nile Delta. Most of the change has occurred within the past nine years, where approximately 235.60 km(2 )of the cultivated lands were transitioned to urban. Nonetheless, at the eastern delta flank, which is bordered by desert, analysis indicated that agricultural lands have experienced a considerable growth throughout the study period due to a major desert reclamation effort. Areas most at risk from future urban expansion were identified. A simulation of future urban expansion, using a Markov Chain algorithm, indicated that the extent to which urban area is simulated to grow in the region is 16.67% (277.3 km(2)) and 37.82% (843 km(2)) by the year 2026, and 2050, respectively. The methods used in this study are useful in assessing the rate of urban encroachment on agricultural lands and can be applied to similar at-risk areas in the regions if appropriate site-specific modifications are considered.

T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trophic structure deterioration in continental water bodies (lakes and damps) has been a growing problem during the last years. Numerous factors, either natural or man-made contribute in value increments of various water quality indexes ranging toward eutrophication. Our study had objective to use remote sensing as complementary tool to study the spatial distribution and dynamics of Lake Vichuquen water quality parameters in two seasons of 2016 through the use of two satellite images of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor, with in situ and laboratory data. The Chl-a and Z(SD) parameters were estimated from multiple linear regression models. The results indicate that the trophic state of Lake Vichuquen corresponds to a eutrophic level in summer and mesotrophic in autumn. The laboratory analyzes establish for the summer and autumn season that the Chl-a data oscillate between 14.1 and 5.5 mu g/l and for the Z(SD) between 3.7 and 2.5 m respectively. The increase in the levels of eutrophication of Lake Vichuquen is influenced in the first place by the seasonality and secondly by the different land uses that accelerate this type of processes; such as the plantations of radiata pine and eucalyptus, the agricultural activities and the urban areas surrounding the lake. The mean square error for each variable and each season varied in Chl-a in summer and another year 0.74 and 0.01 mu g/l and Z(SD) 0.16 m respectively.

TI  - How much water is used for irrigation? A new approach exploiting coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of irrigation is essential for ensuring food and water security, and to cope with the scarcity of water resources, which is expected to exacerbate under the pressure of climate change and population increase. Even though irrigation is likely the most important direct human intervention in the hydrological cycle, we have only partial knowledge on the areas of our planet in which irrigation takes place, and almost no information on the amount of water that is applied for irrigation.In this study, we developed a new approach exploiting satellite soil moisture observations for quantifying the amount of water applied for irrigation. Through the inversion of the soil water balance equation, and by using satellite soil moisture products as input, the amount of water entering into the soil, and hence irrigation, is determined. Through synthetic experiments, we first assessed the impact of soil moisture measurement uncertainty and temporal resolution, also as a function of climate, on the accuracy of the method. Second, we applied the proposed approach to currently available coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2). Nine pilot sites in Europe, USA, Australia and Africa were used as case study to test the method in a real-world application.The synthetic experiment showed that the method is able to quantify irrigation, with satisfactory performance from satellite data with retrieval errors lower than similar to 0.04 m(3)/m(3) and revisit times shorter than 3 days. In the case studies based on real satellite data, qualitative assessments (due to missing in situ irrigation observations) showed that over regions in which satellite soil moisture products perform well, and which are characterized by prolonged periods without rainfall, the method shows good results in quantifying irrigation. However, at sites in which rainfall is sustained throughout the year, the proposed method fails in obtaining reliable performances. Similarly, low performances are obtained in areas where satellite products uncertainties are too large, or their spatial resolution is too coarse with respect to the size of the irrigated fields.

TI  - Wildfire Impact on the Main Tree Species of the Near-Yenisei Siberia
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are the major cause of forest death in Siberia, as well as one of the main ecological factors forming biodiversity. Here, we present the impact of surface wildfires on Northern Eurasian boreal ecosystems with the example of the main tree species in the Near-Yenisei Siberia. The wildfire impact in the study area is determined by the mean annual burning rate of 0.20 +/- 0.05%. In the extremely dry summer of 2012, this value increased to 19%. The integral fire radiative power through the season reached 4.1 x 10(5) MW/km(2), whereas the mean annual value did not exceed 0.64 x 10(5) MW/km(2). Our observations demonstrate the highly variable effect of surface fires on conifer species in Siberia. Only trees with DBH > 5 cm survived a year after moderate severity surface fires. After high severity (usually steady) surface fires only pine trees with DBH > 17.2 cm survived, while trees with DBH > 18.1 cm were the most resistant within further post-fire succession.

T2  - RADIOCARBON
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Final Symposium of the European-Commission-CArbon-14-Source-Term-Project (CAST)
CL  - Lyon, FRANCE
AB  - The total C-14 content and its partition between inorganic and organic species were measured on irradiated Zy-4 samples from a CANDU spent fuel rod transferred from Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). Long-term leaching tests and accelerated corrosion tests were carried out to measure the C-14 release and corrosion rate, respectively, in chemical conditions relevant to cementitious environment. Experimentally measured C-14 inventory was compared to the theoretically one predicted based on the irradiation history and impurity content of Zy-4 by means of ORIGEN computations. CANDU SF claddings have a C-14 content of around 2 x 10(4) Bq/g of Zy-4, mainly as organic compounds (more than 99%). The total C-14 content measured by acid dissolution/wet oxidation method is in good agreement with the value estimated by ORIGEN simulations for an average burn-up of 7 MWd/kgU. The total C-14 released as dissolved species after 18 days and 18 months of Zy-4 immersing in alkaline solution are similar, indicating that a small amount of C-14 was available as instant release fraction (0.05% from the initial C-14 content) followed by a very low release rate that could not be measured by liquid scintillation counting. In alkaline conditions, C-14 is released predominantly (approximate to 70%) as soluble species, but also inorganic C-14 was measured as gaseous species. From the soluble C-14 released during leaching test, more than 60% was found to be as organic species. Generally, corrosion rates values ranging between 46 and 130 nm/yr were measured by the linear polarization resistance method. In addition, defects and cracks were observed on the oxide layer by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation.

TI  - Comparison of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and SAR Tomography Using Sentinel-1 in Urban Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, persistent scatterer interferometry and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) tomography have been applied to Sentinel-1 data for urban monitoring. The paper analyses the applicability of SAR tomography to Sentinel-1 data, which is not granted, due to the reduced range and azimuth resolutions and the low resolution in elevation. In a first part of the paper, two implementations of the two techniques are described. In the experimental part, the two techniques are used in parallel to process the same Sentinel-1 data over two test areas. An intercomparison of the results from persistent scatterer interferometry and SAR tomography is carried out, comparing the main parameters estimated by the two techniques. Finally, the paper addresses the complementarity of the two techniques, and in particular it assesses the increase of measurement density that can be achieved by adding the double scatterers from SAR tomography to the persistent scatterer interferometry measurements.

TI  - Morphological Change in the Northern Red River Delta, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion has become a worldwide concern, typically in the densely populated Asian mega-river deltas. Severe coastal erosion in the southern Red River Delta (RRD) has been intensively studied. Coastal morphological change in the northern RRD was examined in detail through DEM (Digital Elevation Model) analysis based on time series of bathymetrical maps (1965-2004) and Landsat images (1975-2015) in this study. The results show that the northern RRD is featured by rapid coastal accretion in the past few decades, although suspended sediment flux has dropped by roughly 60% after the completeness of Hoa Binh Dam (HBD) in 1988 and relative sea level rose at 1.9 mm yr(-1). However, accretion at the outer part of subtidal shoals and platforms was observed to slow down quickly or even turned into erosion in the last two decades. The resuspended sediments from the erosion zone can be transported landward to replenish the inner coastal zone, keeping the latter accretion in the near future to compensate for the sediment discharge decrease from the river. However, this lag effect should be terminated soon if other adverse effects go worse, e.g., damming rivers, sea-level rising, strengthening storms, land reclamation and other poor-designed coastal engineering. Coastal planners and managers should pay full attention to these changes.

TI  - Primary Contact Occupational Therapy Hand Clinics: The pull of an occupational perspective
T2  - AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/aim: Primary contact models of care are an emerging area of occupational therapy practice that aim to respond to the changing health-care landscape. There is a dearth of literature exploring an occupational perspective in primary contact roles, and literature in the broader scope of hand therapy has recognised that occupational therapists' practice often aligns with the biomedical world-view. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the practice of occupational therapists within Primary Contact Occupational Therapy Hand (PCOTH) Clinics from an occupational perspective.Method: This ethnographic study gathered in-depth data through observations of primary contact hand therapy sessions, review of progress notes and interviews with occupational therapists. Qualitative data analysis was conducted using a three-stage process first at the item level, then pattern level and finally at the structural level. The research team collaboratively discussed all codes and then themes.Results: The push of the biomedical culture and the pull of an occupational perspective was conceptualised as an overarching theme shaping occupational therapists' practice in the primary contact clinics. Five themes emerged: bottom-up approach to an occupational perspective, an occupational perspective via informal discussion, occupational therapists' expectations of patients, occupational perspective on autopilot and blurred professional identity.Conclusion: Occupational therapists working in primary contact roles were pushed by the biomedical culture of the setting. Despite this, there was still a pull towards an occupational perspective. This research provides an initial exploration of primary contact clinics, and highlighted the added bonus of an occupational perspective. The findings present a timely opportunity for occupational therapists to critically reflect on practice in PCOTH clinics.

TI  - The impact of dataset selection on land degradation assessment
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of land degradation is a global need, particularly in the world's dryland areas. However, there is a well-documented lack of field data and long-term observational studies for most of these regions. Remotely sensed data offers the only long-term vegetation record that can be used for land degradation assessment at a national, continental or global scale. Both the rainfall and vegetation datasets used for land degradation assessment contain errors and uncertainties, but little work has been done to understand how this may impact results. This study uses the recently developed Time Series Segmented RESidual TREND (TSS-RESTREND) method applied to six rainfall and two vegetation datasets to assess the impact of dataset selection on the estimates of dryland degradation over Australia. Large differences in the data and methods used to produce the precipitation datasets did not significantly impact results with the estimate of average change varying by < 4% and a single dataset being sufficient to capture the direction of change in > 95% of regions. On the other hand, the vegetation dataset selection had a much greater impact. Calibration errors in the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System Version 3 NDVI (GIMMSv3.0g) dataset caused significant errors in the trends over some of Australia's dryland regions. Though identified over Australia, the problematic calibration in the GIMMSv3.0g dataset may have effected dryland NDVI values globally. These errors have been addressed in the updated GIMMSv3.1g which is strongly recommended for use in future studies. Our analysis suggests that using an ensemble composed of multiple runs performed using different datasets allows for the identification of errors that cannot be detected using only a single run or with the data quality flags of the input datasets. A multi-run ensemble made using different input datasets provides more comprehensive quantification of uncertainty and errors in space and time.

TI  - Photochemical features and trace element substituted chlorophylls as early detection biomarkers of metal exposure in the model diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing marine species equipped with efficient biomarkers of trace element stress is a major requirement for the assessment of trace element contamination in marine ecosystems. This study investigates PS II overall activity and efficiency during light harvesting, electron transport chain (ETC) behaviour, OJIP-transient light curves, and pigment profiles, in the model marine diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Pb and to a mixture of all elements combined (Mix). OJIP-test parameters and trace element substituted chlorophylls were investigated as potential biomarkers of stress induced by trace elements. Hg-exposed cells showed a shift in balance towards PS I activity, promoted by increase in the electron transport from PQH(2) to the reduction of PS I end electron acceptors. Other elements had more limited effects, mostly affecting energy dissipation and pigment levels to various degrees. Decoupling of PS II antennae connectivity was found in Co exposed cells. Chromium induced negative effects on PS I, but had no influence at the Oxygen Evolving Complexes (OECs) level. Copper caused a shift in the equilibrium between PS towards the PS I by reducing the PS II efficiency. Cadmium induced damage in OECs of the PS II donor side, but had no effect on the energy transduction pathway, maintaining energy processing efficiency. Lead had no significant effect on the energy transduction pathway, but produced changes at pigment level, leading to an increase in the chlorophyll and diadinoxanthin. In contrast, Ni had a beneficial role in P. tricornuttan photochemistry, leading to increased number of available RC and oxidized quinone pool size, possibly because concentrations used were not able to induce severe cell damage. Copper, Cd and Zn led to substitution of Mg in chlorophyll a molecules, with the formation of less efficient CuChl a, CdChl a and ZnChl a. The biomarkers used evidenced the damaging effect of Co, Cu, Cr, Pb, Hg and all trace elements combined (Mix), pointing to Hg as the most harmful element. These physiological changes highlight P. tricornutum as a promising sentinel species for trace element contamination and the proposed photochemical features suitable as an efficient battery of biomarkers for trace element stress early detection in marine systems.

TI  - Detection of buried archaeological remains with the combined use of satellite multispectral data and UAV data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and passive remote sensing sensors have been applied successfully in the detection of crop marks (vegetation with a different spectral reflectance compared to its surroundings) related with buried archaeological remains. However, the detection of such crop marks depends on the sensor used, the status of the cover and the algorithm applied on the data. Moreover, buried archaeological remains generally produce microrelief marks, which can be very difficult to detect. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the combined use of data from the multispectral orbital sensor WorldView-2 and RGB and near infrared cameras mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can be successfully applied to the detection of buried archaeological remains. Principal Component Analysis, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a purposely proposed band combination were obtained from WorldView-2 data to detect crop marks. The cameras carried by the UAV provide a Real Color composite, the NDVI and a high precision Digital Surface Model. The methodology developed in this work consists of searching for locations that exhibit both crop and microrelief marks with a similar shape. The WorldView-2 NDVI and the normalized Digital Surface Model of the UAV are filtered. An Archaeological Binary Map is constructed, in which pixels with both NDVI and normalized elevation above corresponding threshold values are interpreted as susceptible of containing buried archaeological remains and are given the value of one, otherwise zero. One of the locations of the Archaeological Binary Map, with a very regular pattern, is subsequently surveyed with Ground Penetrating Radar to find a buried structure, the location and shape of which match perfectly those of the Archeological Binary Map.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in leprosy: results of the first prospective open survey conducted by a WHO surveillance network for the period 2009-15
T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a priority for surveillance in bacterial infections. For leprosy, AMR has not been assessed because Mycobacterium leprae does not grow in vitro. We aim to obtain AMR data using molecular detection of resistance genes and to conduct a prospective open survey of resistance to antileprosy drugs in countries where leprosy is endemic through a WHO surveillance network.Methods: From 2009 to 2015, multi-bacillary leprosy cases at sentinel sites of 19 countries were studied for resistance to rifampicin, dapsone and ofloxacin by PCR sequencing of the drug-resistance-determining regions of the genes rpoB, folP1 and gyrA.Results: Among 1932 (1143 relapse and 789 new) cases studied, 154 (8.0%) M. leprae strains were found with mutations conferring resistance showing 182 resistance traits (74 for rifampicin, 87 for dapsone and 21 for ofloxacin). Twenty cases showed rifampicin and dapsone resistance, four showed ofloxacin and dapsone resistance, but no cases were resistant to rifampicin and ofloxacin. Rifampicin resistance was observed among relapse (58/1143, 5.1%) and new (16/789, 2.0%) cases in 12 countries. India, Brazil and Colombia reported more than five rifampicin-resistant cases.Conclusions: This is the first study reporting global data on AMR in leprosy. Rifampicin resistance emerged, stressing the need for expansion of surveillance. This is also a call for vigilance on the global use of antimicrobial agents, because ofloxacin resistance probably developed in relation to the general intake of antibiotics for other infections as it is not part of the multidrug combination used to treat leprosy.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change and Intensive Lesser Snow Goose (<i>Chen caerulescens caerulescens</i>) Activity on Surface Water in High Arctic Pond Complexes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid increases in air temperature in Arctic and subarctic regions are driving significant changes to surface waters. These changes and their impacts are not well understood in sensitive high-Arctic ecosystems. This study explores changes in surface water in the high Arctic pond complexes of western Banks Island, Northwest Territories. Landsat imagery (1985-2015) was used to detect sub-pixel trends in surface water. Comparison of higher resolution aerial photographs (1958) and satellite imagery (2014) quantified changes in the size and distribution of waterbodies. Field sampling investigated factors contributing to the observed changes. The impact of expanding lesser snow goose populations and other biotic or abiotic factors on observed changes in surface water were also investigated using an information theoretic model selection approach. Our analyses show that the pond complexes of western Banks Island lost 7.9% of the surface water that existed in 1985. Drying disproportionately impacted smaller sized waterbodies, indicating that climate is the main driver. Model selection showed that intensive occupation by lesser snow geese was associated with more extensive drying and draining of waterbodies and suggests this intensive habitat use may reduce the resilience of pond complexes to climate warming. Changes in surface water are likely altering permafrost, vegetation, and the utility of these areas for animals and local land-users, and should be investigated further.

TI  - Mapping underrepresented land cover heterogeneity in arid regions: The Sahara-Sahel example
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid and semi-arid regions comprise high levels of habitat heterogeneity that usually remain undetected in available global land cover (GLC) maps. The Sahara-Sahel is a critical example of how GLC maps continue to oversimplify the complex landscape structure of deserts and arid environments. In this work, we aimed to overcome a generalized knowledge gap concerning the LC heterogeneity of arid regions, using the largest warm desert in the world as a study case. We intended to generate a 30x30m land cover map for the Wet Sahara-Sahel and compare the results with currently available GLC maps (ESA GlobCover and GlobeLand30). To do this, we collected an extensive series of GPS field control points (n = 48,857) and associated descriptive traits. We included the control points in a Hierarchical Cluster Analyses (HCA), and the resulting groups were used as LC classes in Landsat 8 image classification. Independent control points (n = 10,082) suggested a robust regional classification (83.3% correctly classified) of land cover. The Sahara was the most representative ecoregion (around 70% of the study area) and exhibited the highest classification accuracy (91%). The final map is composed by a total of 18 classes, providing a higher number of classes for arid regions than currently available GLC maps. Differences were evident amongst the arid regions of the Sahara, in which the derived map presented a more complex land cover in comparison to the analysed GLC maps. The map derived in this study constitutes framework data for mapping local land cover information and for improving the effectiveness of the assessment and management of natural resources for both local human populations and biodiversity. These results highlight the prevalent need for improving local and regional land cover categorization of arid and semi-arid regions, areas whose land cover heterogeneity is still underrepresented by most of the available GLC maps.

TI  - The folk metaphysics of love
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - I argue against the intellectualist view of love according to which we (must) love for reasons so that love is rational. Engaging primarily with the quality appraisal view of love, I concede that qualities can cause love but insist that it is misguided to think of love as having reasons. A number of features of human psychology complicate the issue of how lover relates to beloved's qualities. (a) The lover may be attracted to a quality without appraising that quality reflectively. (b) Personal qualities are not perceived in isolation; rather, our assessment of one quality will affect how we perceive another. In fact, we tend to posit essences in persons, and these guide our interpretation of their other qualities. (c) We do not see persons as bundles of qualities but as unique wholes. This is due to our capacity to fetishize particulars, and it dispels the problem of fungibility. (d) We have a tendency to see meaning in things retrospectively-philosophers have mistaken this sense of meaning for rationality. The philosophical movement to incorporate love into rationality fails to recognize that there is a folk metaphysics built deep into our psyches that does not correspond to the worldview of contemporary philosophers.

TI  - Development and Analysis of a New Solar Radiation Atlas for Argentina from Ground-Based Measurements and CERES_SYN1deg data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, quantifying global solar radiation at surface in Argentina is crucial for the development of projects related to solar energy, calculation of evapotranspiration and eco-sustainability architecture, among other environmental issues. In recent years, several models have been developed to estimate the solar energy resources by means of various techniques, e.g. satellite imaging, kriging, or Artificial Neural Networks. The use of satellite data allows for a better spatial representation, being of great relevance in areas with lack of terrain measurements. In this paper, we use the CERES_SYN1deg to develop a new Global Solar Radiation Atlas for Argentina. In this study, we developed maps of annual and monthly mean daily global solar radiation using CERES_SYN1deg data between 2000 and 2016. In order to validate the global solar radiation data provided by CERES_SYN1deg, they were compared with ground-based measurements in the time overlap of both instruments, in four monitoring sites of the SAVER-Net project and an additional site in Tandil, which belongs to the Remote Sensing Group of IHLLA. The maps show the spatial and temporal variation of global solar radiation in Argentina. Comparisons with ground-based pyranometers reveal relative differences of around 3% at a monthly scale for all sites, while the biases can be neglected. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the maps could be very useful for different technical and scientific purposes, and the comparison with ground-based data demonstrates CERES_SYN1deg's reliability.

TI  - Justice across Real and Imagined Food Worlds: Rural Corn Growers, Urban Agriculture Activists, and the Political Ontologies They Live By
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines two seemingly disparate case studies, one involving conventional corn producers and agriculture professionals located in North Dakota, the other focusing on participants in a diverse urban agriculture cooperative in an anonymized U.S. city. Drawing on qualitative interviews and data-presenting devices known as "word clouds," the article explores how, and to a lesser extent why, understandings of the terms "social justice" and "autonomy" varied between these spaces. While these imagined political ontologies differed greatly, the article describes each case as grounded in a shared neoliberal ("real") world that negatively impacts both populations, a realization that could provide a source of recognition and reconciliation between groups. The article concludes by asking why those interviewed in the rural space failed to understand their marginalization to be an artifact of the neoliberal highly individualistic worldview that their articulated imaginaries appear to support, while also exploring how the divergent political ontologies between the groups can be brought into better conversation with each other.

TI  - Refined Analysis of RADARSAT-2 Measurements to Discriminate Two Petrogenic Oil-Slick Categories: Seeps versus Spills
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our research focuses on refining the ability to discriminate two petrogenic oil-slick categories: the sea surface expression of naturally-occurring oil seeps and man-made oil spills. For that, a long-term RADARSAT-2 dataset (244 scenes imaged between 2008 and 2012) is analyzed to investigate oil slicks (4562) observed in the Gulf of Mexico (Campeche Bay, Mexico). As the scientific literature on the use of satellite-derived measurements to discriminate the oil-slick category is sparse, our research addresses this gap by extending our previous investigations aimed at discriminating seeps from spills. To reveal hidden traits of the available satellite information and to evaluate an existing Oil-Slick Discrimination Algorithm, distinct processing segments methodically inspect the data at several levels: input data repository, data transformation, attribute selection, and multivariate data analysis. Different attribute selection strategies similarly excel at the seep-spill differentiation. The combination of different Oil-Slick Information Descriptors presents comparable discrimination accuracies. Among 8 non-linear transformations, the Logarithm and Cube Root normalizations disclose the most effective discrimination power of almost 70%. Our refined analysis corroborates and consolidates our earlier findings, providing a firmer basis and useful accuracies of the seep-spill discrimination practice using information acquired with space-borne surveillance systems based on Synthetic Aperture Radars.

TI  - ITCZ trend analysis via Geodesic P-spline smoothing of the AIRWAVE TCWV and cloud frequency datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is the region of the Earth's atmosphere where the trade winds converge. This region is characterized by rising air, strong convection, clouds and heavy precipitation and it is tightly related to changes in climate patterns on a global scale. For these reasons assessing the ITCZ migrations is of extreme importance for climate monitoring. This can be achieved through the use of satellite data of different kind. In the last decades several quantities have been used as proxies for this purpose, e.g. infrared radiance measured at the top of atmosphere (TOA), precipitation datasets or vertical and horizontal wind components. In this work the ITCZ position is determined and its time evolution is analysed using the Total Column Water Vapour (TCWV) data, retrieved using the Advanced Infra-Red Water Vapour Estimator algorithm (AIRWAVE). AIRWAVE was developed for the retrieval of the TCWV from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) instrument series, operational from 1991 to 2012. It allows the TCWV retrieval from infra-red channels at 11 and 12 gm exploiting the ATSR nadir and forward viewing geometries, for day/night and cloud-free sea surface scenarios. The information on cloud coverage from ATSRs is used as correlative information in order to expand the ITCZ analysis to land scenes. The TCWV and cloud frequency datasets are analysed with a Geodesic P-spline efficient spatial smoothing method specifically developed to extract information from large datasets. The posterior distribution of the model is considered for identification of the ITCZ both over sea and land with associated uncertainty quantification. The resulting AIRWAVE/cloud frequency monthly fields are analysed to detect trends in the ITCZ latitudinal displacement over the 20 years of the ATSR family lifetime. Results indicate that no significant trends can be detected in the 1991-2012 time period.

TI  - EVALUATION OF PARTIALLY SUBMERGED STICKY TRAPS ON LAKE SPILLWAYS FOR ADULT BLACK FLY (DIPTERA: SIMULIIDAE) SURVEILLANCE AND ARBOVIRUS DETECTION
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel surveillance systems demonstrate an improved ability to supplement monitoring data and anticipate arbovirus outbreaks (i.e., sentinel avian species). Management complications can arise during unpredictable or unseasonal disease detections, especially in rural areas where resident distribution is patchy. Using spillways near residential lake communities as static surveillance locations, we tested a novel partially submerged sticky trapping technique and screened wild populations of adult female black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) for West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). Trap site selection criteria considered the density of immature black fly colonization on spillway surfaces and the number of positive detections of arboviral targets in nearby Culex mosquito populations. On average (+/- standard error), sticky traps captured 134 (+/- 33) adult black flies over a 24-h period, with 1 trap capturing as many as 735 individuals. Although we detected positive cases of WNV from 20 Culex mosquito trapping sites within 16 km (approx. flight radius) of the selected lake spillways, mixed pools of adult female Simulium vittatum complex and Simulium decorum were all negative for both arboviruses. This study yielded an application for partially submerged sticky traps to collect adult female black flies. Its potential uses for monitoring the infection rates of more well-documented Simulium parasites are discussed.

TI  - Dynamics of the snow cover in a small Mediterranean mountain basin: the case of the Tormes river (Duero Basin, Spain)
T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a homogeneous database has been generated to study the spatial-temporal dynamics of the snow cover in the Spanish peninsular territory, from remote sensing (AVHRR-NOAA and MODIS) and energy balance models (WRF-FSM). These data series used at regional scale show the uncertainty of their application in small headwaters to better understand the hydro-climatology of the same. Assuming the disparity of applied techniques, and the diversity of variables in which the estimates are expressed (snow cover, snow days, snow depth and snow water equivalent), the results obtained allow to describe the seasonal behavior of the snow cover in the study catchment, as well as its marked interannual variability. The results show that snow cover data are less useful for hydrological analysis than modeled series (WRF-FSM), which report the thickness and amount of snow water equivalent.

TI  - Defining a Trade-off Between Spatial and Temporal Resolution of a Geosynchronous SAR Mission for Soil Moisture Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The next generation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems could foresee satellite missions based on a geosynchronous orbit (GEO SAR). These systems are able to provide radar images with an unprecedented combination of spatial (1 km) and temporal (12 h) resolutions. This paper investigates the GEO SAR potentialities for soil moisture (SM) mapping finalized to hydrological applications, and defines the best compromise, in terms of image spatio-temporal resolution, for SM monitoring. A synthetic soil moisture-data assimilation (SM-DA) experiment was thus set up to evaluate the impact of the hydrological assimilation of different GEO SAR-like SM products, characterized by diverse spatio-temporal resolutions. The experiment was also designed to understand if GEO SAR-like SM maps could provide an added value with respect to SM products retrieved from SAR images acquired from satellites flying on a quasi-polar orbit, like Sentinel-1 (POLAR SAR). Findings showed that GEO SAR systems provide a valuable contribution for hydrological applications, especially if the possibility to generate many sub-daily observations is sacrificed in favor of higher spatial resolution. In the experiment, it was found that the assimilation of two GEO SAR-like observations a day, with a spatial resolution of 100 m, maximized the performances of the hydrological predictions, for both streamflow and SM state forecasts. Such improvements of the model performances were found to be 45% higher than the ones obtained by assimilating POLAR SAR-like SM maps.

TI  - Flood Mapping in a Complex Environment Using Bistatic TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X InSAR Coherence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we assess the flood mapping capabilities of the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery acquired by the bistatic pair TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X (TDX/TSX). The main objective is to investigate the added value of the bistatic TDX/TSX Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence in addition to the SAR backscatter in the context of inundation mapping. As a classifier, we consider a Random Forest (RF) classification scheme using TDX/TSX SAR intensities and their bistatic InSAR coherence to extract the flood extent map. To evaluate the classification results and as no "ground truth" was available at the SAR data acquisition time, we set up a LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model for simulating the temporal evolution of the flood water. The flood map simulated by the model shows good performances with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 97.92% and a Critical Success Index (CSI) of 94.01%. The SAR-derived flood map is then compared to the LISFLOOD-FP extent map simulated at the SAR data acquisition time. As a test case, we consider the flooding event of the Richelieu River that occurred in the Monteregie region of Quebec (Canada) from April to June 2011. Experimental results highlight the potential of the bistatic InSAR coherence for more accurate flood mapping in a complex landscape with urban and vegetation areas. The classification results of the SAR-derived flood map with respect to the LISFLOOD-FP flood map reach an OA of 78.65% and a Precision of 82.08% when integrating the bistatic InSAR coherence. These classification OA and Precision values are 69.63% and 64.52%, respectively, using only the TDX/TSX SAR intensity.

TI  - Exploring factors affecting first-year students' learning experiences: A case study of a private university in Taiwan
T2  - STUDENT SUCCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Taiwan's low birth rate and declining demand for higher education among the country's high school graduates has led to vigorous competition between Taiwanese universities to attract and retain students. Increasing international student enrolment can help alleviate these existing pressures. However, the transition from high school to university life and the need to study in a degree program with English as the primary medium of instruction, can present challenges for first-year students. We aimed to investigate First Year (FY) Taiwanese and non-Taiwanese students' learning experiences and the barriers they face at a private university. The key research findings are based on factors affecting FY students' learning experiences such as interactive teaching techniques, peer support, program attributes, social integration, and the international learning environment. We argue that for higher education institutions (HEIs) to stand out in a highly competitive environment, university management should optimise their resources and services to meet local and international students' needs.

TI  - Upwelling event characteristics of chlorophyll-a concentration in the surface layer of Sabah waters
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite-based remote sensing data, the study analysed Chl-a levels throughout Sabah's coastal waters and correlated the Chl-a levels with the corresponding SST levels for that time and region. It was found that upwelling in Sabah coastal waters was most strongly noted in Labuan during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM), which brings strong northeasterly winds to Sabah's west and north coast. The strong winds can be cited as the main source of increased upwelling as SST levels did not sufficiently change to suggest a strong relationship between SST and Chl-a levels.

TI  - Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index for Biomass Estimation in Desert Fringe Ecosystems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass estimation of eastern Mediterranean shrublands was investigated using PALSAR full- and dual-polarization L-band and Sentinel-1 dual-polarization C-band data. First, we conducted an empirical assessment of single and multiple regressions between polarized backscattering coefficients and shrubland biomass distribution along the climatic gradient between semiarid and arid regions. We then found that the PALSAR L-band HV-polarized backscattering coefficient has higher biomass information content than Sentinel-1 C-band data. Based on a theoretical volume scattering model and a semiempirical model, we propose a new polarimetric radar vegetation index (PRVI) that utilizes the degree of polarization and the cross-polarized backscattering coefficient. The relationship between the new index and the biomass was assessed with reference to normalized difference vegetation index-based biomass estimates calculated using Landsat imagery. The PRVI was found to have higher correlation with biomass compared with other radar polarization parameters, in general, and an existing radar vegetation index (RVI), in particular. Assessment of PRVI-based biomass predictions compared with allometric data extracted from air photographs, Lidar, and field data for 67 sites across the desert fringe zone indicated moderate performance with an RMSE of 0.329 kg/m(2), while an RVI-based biomass estimation had an RMSE of 0.439 kg/m(2).

TI  - Coupling between Land-Ocean-Atmosphere and Pronounced Changes in Atmospheric/Meteorological Parameters Associated with the Hudhud Cyclone of October 2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - India is vulnerable to all kinds of natural hazards associated with land, ocean, biosphere, atmosphere, and snow/glaciers. These natural hazards impact large areas and the population living in the affected regions. India is surrounded by ocean on three sides and is vulnerable to cyclonic activities. Every year cyclones hit the east and west coasts of India, affecting the population living along the coasts and infrastructure and inland areas. The extent of the affected inland areas depends on the intensity of the cyclone. On 12 October 2014, a strong cyclone Hudhud hit the east coast of India that caused a high degree of devastation along the coast. The impact of this cyclone was seen up to the Himalayan region. Detailed analysis of satellite and ground data show a strong coupling between land-ocean-atmosphere associated with the Hudhud cyclone. The contrast between land and ocean temperature was found to be closely related with the formation of the cyclone in the ocean and its movements towards land. Pronounced changes in the ocean, land, atmospheric, and meteorological parameters with the development of the cyclone and its landfall have been observed. Changes in total column ozone (TCO), relative humidity (RH), and volume mixing ratio of CO (CO VMR), water mixing ratio (H2O MMR), surface latent heat flux (SLHF), and aerosol optical properties derived from satellite data show characteristic behavior of the Hudhud cyclone.

TI  - Remote Sensing Assessment of Safety Risk of Iron Tailings Pond Based on Runoff Coefficient
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems used to capture iron tailings. They are high-risk hazards with high potential energy. If the tailings dam broke, it would pose a serious threat to the surrounding ecological environment, residents' lives, and property. Rainfall is one of the most important influencing factors causing the tailings dam break. This paper took Chengde Area, a typical iron-producing area, as the study area, and proposed a remote sensing method to evaluate the safety risk of tailings ponds under rainfall condition by using runoff coefficient and catchment area. Firstly, the vegetation coverage in the study area was estimated using the pixel dichotomy model, and the vegetation type was classified by the support vector machine (SVM) method from Landsat 8 OLI image. Based on DEM, the slope of the study area was extracted, and the catchment area of the tailings pond was plotted. Then, taking slope, vegetation coverage, and vegetation type as three influencing factors, the runoff coefficient was constructed by weight assignment of each factor using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model in both quantitative and qualitative way. Finally, the safety risk of tailings ponds was assessed according to average runoff coefficient and catchment area in the study area. The results showed that there were 124 low-risk tailings ponds, 16 moderate-risk tailings ponds, and 4 high-risk tailings ponds in the study area. This method could be useful for selecting targeted tailings ponds for focused safety monitoring. Necessary monitoring measurements should be carried out for the high-risk and moderate-risk tailings ponds in rainy season.

TI  - Evaluation of the AVHRR DeepBlue aerosol optical depth dataset over mainland China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on-board NOAA series satellites have been used to observe the Earth's surface and clouds for almost 40 years. Limited by bands and problematic instrument calibration, aerosol studies using AVHRR data have focused on retrieving data over the ocean. However, continuous developments have made it possible to retrieve aerosol over land as well. The newly developed AVHRR Deep Blue (DB) technique has been applied to process global aerosol datasets over both land and the ocean during 1989-1990, 1995-1999 and 2006-2011. This paper aims to evaluate, in detail, the performance of the AVHRR DB aerosol optical depth (AOD) dataset over mainland China by comparison with both ground-based data and satellite aerosol products. The ground-based validation results show that DB AOD is close to ground-based AOD when AOD is moderate during winter, while DB underestimates AOD when AOD increases over 1.0 during summer over vegetated surfaces. AVHRR DB underestimates dry, urban and transitional surfaces in Western China due to the high uncertainty in low retrievals over bright surfaces. Cross-comparison with the Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) DB aerosol dataset shows that the disadvantages of the single longer visible channel are greatly increased over bright surfaces. Together with problematic instrument calibration, the differences between the two datasets over most of mainland China are significant. Meanwhile, the differences show strong seasonal variation characteristics.

TI  - Forest and silvopastoral cover changes and its drivers in northern Morocco
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern Morocco, forest and silvopastoral areas have always formed an integral part of goat feeding and consequently of extensive livestock systems. However, it was reported that these areas are now going through a gradual degradation mainly due to overgrazing, resulting in land use-land cover (LULC) changes. Doubts persist about actual goat grazing impacts on forest and silvopastoral cover changes. Detecting and understanding drivers of LULC changes has become a central component of current strategies for managing natural resources to implement appropriate development policies. The objectives of this study were to assess the forest and silvopastoral cover changes and transition among five major land cover classes that took place in the last three decades (1984-2014), to verify the hypothesis that goats act as a main driver of forest and silvopastoral degradation, and to explore the perception of stakeholders based on remote sensing data, field surveys, and overall statistics. Between 1984 and 2014, forest and silvopastoral areas declined by 25% (matorral included). Farmers and local institutions all agreed that drought, fire, soil erosion, and population growth are the most striking drivers of forest and silvopastoral decreases. One being utilitarian and the other protectionist, they have conflicting perceptions about the effect of agricultural expansion, authority policy, deforestation, and overgrazing. The forest cover change is impacted by interaction among different change drivers. The levels of forest degradation depend on the intensity of this interaction. The outcomes confirm the alarming decrease in the amount of forest and silvopastoral cover. These results can be used as the first guide for future studies and decision makers, focusing on the real drivers of forest and silvopastoral degradation, so as to develop targeted intervention to secure sustainable and sufficient resources needed for animal and population well-being.

TI  - Early life exposure to particulate matter air pollution (PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) and autism in Shanghai, China: A case-control study
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The evidence for adverse effects of ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution on mental health is limited. Studies in Western countries suggested higher risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated with PM air pollution, but no such study has been done in developing countries.Methods: A case-control study was performed in Shanghai with a multi-stage random sampling design. Children's exposures to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 1 mu m,< 2.5 mu m and < 10 mu m, respectively) during the first three years after birth were estimated with satellite remote sensing data. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the PM-ASD association.Results: In total, 124 ASD cases and 1240 healthy controls were included in this study. The median levels of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 exposures during the first three years of life were 48.8 mu g/m(3), 66.2 mu g/m(3) and 95.4 mu g/m(3), respectively, and the interquartile range (IQR) for these three pollutants were 4.8 mu g/m(3), 3.4 mu g/m(3) and 4.9 mu g/m(3), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of ASD associated with an IQR increase for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.86 (1.09, 3.17), 1.78 (1.14, 2.76) and 1.68 (1.09, 2.59), respectively. Higher ORs of ASD associated with PM pollution were observed in the second and the third year after birth.Conclusions: Exposures to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 during the first three years of life were associated with the increased risk of ASD and there appeared to be stronger effects of ambient PM pollution on ASD in the second and the third years after birth.

TI  - Simulation and Analysis of Bidirectional Reflection Based on Field Hyperspectral Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accruacy of field hyperspectral simulation and build the field spectral mixture model, the experiments for detecting mixture spectra of different detected angles and different ratios of leaf cover area were conducted to obtain the mixture spectra by using ASD FieldSpec3 Hi-Res field spectrum instrument with the reflex platform. Based on the theory of equidistant/homalographic model, the computation of weight coefficients for the model was expanded to calculation of three-dimensional weight coefficients. Taking account of the impact of zenith angle on weight coefficient, the three dimensional coefficient model was proposed for simulating mixture spectra, and comparing with the measured spectra for analysis. The results showed that the three dimensional coefficient model had more accurate computation of weight coefficient and had smaller error compared to equidistant/homalographic model. Especially for inclined detected angle, it had better simulation that it reduced the error 0.0161 in RMSE and 0.07 in SAD. The three dimensional coefficient model considered the influence of detected angle, thus enhancing the estimation of mixture spectra and providing a new method for building field mixture model and unmixing mixed spectra from satellite data.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was a product under the background of increasing high-resolution remote sensing data. How to improve the accuracy and efficiency of classification of high-resolution images is one of the important topics in image processing. After objects segmented multiscale by QuickBird image was classified, the efficiency of C5.0, C4.5, and CART decision trees in object-oriented classification of forest areas was analyzed. The accuracy of those three methods were compared with kNN method. The eCognition software was used to multiscale segmentation of remote sensing images, with the result showing that 90 and 40 were the optimal scales. After separating vegetation and non-vegetation at 90 scale, 21 features such as spectrum, texture and shape of different vegetation types were extracted at 40 scale, knowledge mining was carried out by using C5.0, C4.5 and CART decision tree algorithms respectively, and classification rules were automatically established. The vegetation area was classified based on the classification rules and the classification accuracy of different methods was compared. The results showed that the classification accuracy based on decision-tree was higher than that of the traditional kNN method. The accuracy of C5.0 method was the best, with the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient reaching 90.0% and 0.87, respectively. The decision tree algorithm could effectively improve the accuracy in classification of forest species. The Boosting algorithm of the C5.0 decision tree had the most significant improvement on the classification.

TI  - Enhanced health risks from exposure to environmentally persistent free radicals and the oxidative stress of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from Asian dust storms in Erenhot, Zhangbei and Jinan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian dust storms can increase the level of atmospheric pollution over regions downwind of dust storms and may have adverse health effects on residents along the sandstorm transmission route. This study was the first to report the concentration levels, properties and possible sources of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and oxidative potential in atmospheric PM2.5 at the three sites of Erenhot, Zhangbei, and Jinan along the transport route of Asian dust storms during the occurrence of Asian dust storms in the spring of 2016. Under non sandstorm weather conditions, the average EPFR concentrations at the three sites were Zhangbei > Jinan > Erenhot, while the PM-induced oxidative potential levels were Erenhot > Jinan > Zhangbei. The PM2.5 concentration increased significantly during dust storm events, and the total atmospheric concentration of EPFRs (spins/m(3)) and total oxidation potential (a.u./m(3)) of PM2.5 simultaneously increased. However, the EPFR concentration in PM2.5 (spins/g) and the unit mass of the PM oxidation potential (a.u./g) were significantly reduced. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis combined with backward trajectory analysis and MODIS products showed that Asian dust storms can carry EPFRs over long distances. Correlation analysis showed that the atmospheric concentrations of EPFRs were positively correlated with elemental carbon (EC) for the Zhangbei and Jinan samples but were not significantly correlated with EC for the Erenhot samples, indicating that combustion may be an important source of EPFRs for the Zhangbei and Jinan samples. In contrast, the EPFRs in the Erenhot samples were more affected by dust/sand. The EPFR concentration levels showed a significant positive correlation with the oxidation potentials for the Erenhot and Zhangbei samples and showed negative correlations for the Jinan samples, suggesting that the EPFRs in the Erenhot and Zhangbei samples may provide an important contribution to the oxidative stress in PM2.5. In contrast, the oxidation potential for the Jinan samples was mainly caused by substances other than EPFRs. This study presents a basic understanding of the potential health effects of Asian dust storms, and this information can be used to assess the health risks of Asian dust storms in future studies.

TI  - Soil and Vegetation Spectral Coupling Difference (SVSCD) for Minerals Extraction from Hyperion Data in Vegetation Covered Area
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have been widely applied to extract minerals in geologic exploration, however, in areas covered by vegetation, extracted mineral information has mostly been small targets bearing little information. In this paper, we present a new method for mineral extraction aimed at solving the difficulty of mineral identification in vegetation covered areas. The method selected six sets of spectral difference coupling between soil and plant (SVSCD). These sets have the same vegetation spectra reflectance and a maximum different reflectance of soil and mineral spectra from Hyperion image based on spectral reflectance characteristics of measured spectra. The central wavelengths of the six, selected band pairs were 2314 and 701 nm, 1699 and 721 nm, 1336 and 742 nm, 2203 and 681 nm, 2183 and 671 nm, and 2072 and 548 nm. Each data set's reflectance was used to calculate the difference value. After band difference calculation, vegetation information was suppressed and mineral abnormal information was enhanced compared to the scatter plot of original band. Six spectral difference couplings, after vegetation inhibition, were arranged in a new data set that requires two components that have the largest eigenvalue difference from principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial geometric structure features of PC1 and PC2 was used to identify altered minerals by spectral feature fitting (SFF). The collecting rocks from the 10 points that were selected in the concentration of mineral extraction were analyzed under a high-resolution microscope to identify metal minerals and nonmetallic minerals. Results indicated that the extracted minerals were well matched with the verified samples, especially with the sample 2, 4, 5 and 8. It demonstrated that the method can effectively detect altered minerals in vegetation covered area in Hyperion image.

TI  - Social functional mapping of urban green space using remote sensing and social sensing data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is an indispensable component of urban environmental systems and is important to urban residents. Both physical features (e.g., shrubs, trees) and social functions (e.g., public parks, green buffers) are important in UGS mapping. Most UGS studies rely solely on remote sensing data to conduct UGS mapping of physical features, and few studies have focused on UGS mapping from a social function perspective. Due to the limitations of remote sensing in identifying social features; social sensing, which can reflect socioeconomic characteristics, is needed. As a result, a novel methodological framework for integrating these two different data sources to conduct the social functional mapping of UGS has been required. Consequently, we first extracted vegetation patches from an area in Beijing, via the Hyperplanes for Plant Extraction Methodology (HPEM) and considered the parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks as the basic analytical units. Then, near-convex-hull analysis (NCHA) and text-concave-hull analysis (TCHA) were performed to integrate the multi-source data. The results show that the Level I and Level II (refer to Table 3) social function types of UGS had overall accuracies of 92.48% and 88.76%, respectively. Our study provides an improved understanding of UGS and can assist government departments in urban planning. It can also help researchers broaden their research scope by acting as a freely available data source for their work.

TI  - Destriping of Multispectral Remote Sensing Image Using Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral image (MSI) destriping is a challenging topic and has been attracting much research attention in remote sensing area due to its importance in improving the image qualities and subsequent applications. The existing destriping methods mainly focus on matrix-based modeling representation, which fails to fully discover the correlation of the stripe component in both spatial dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank tensor decomposition framework based MSI destriping method by decomposing the striped image into the image component and stripe component. Specifically, for the image component, we use the anisotropic spatial unidirectional total variation (TV) and spectral TV regularization to enhance the piecewise smoothness in both spatial and spectral domains. Moreover, for the stripe component, we adopt tensor Tucker decomposition and l(2,1) -norm regularization to model the spatial correlation and group sparsity characteristic among all bands, respectively. An efficient algorithm using the augmented Lagrange multiplier method is designed to solve the proposed optimization model. Experiments under various cases of simulated data and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the existing single-band and MSI destriping methods in terms of the qualitative and quantitative.

AB  - Increasing agroforestry areas with improper management has produced serious environmental problems, such as soil erosion. It is necessary to rapidly predict the spatial distribution of such erosion risks in a large area, but there is a lack of approaches that are suitable for mountainous regions. The objective of this research was to develop an approach that can effectively employ remotely-sensed and ancillary data, to map soil erosion risks in an agroforestry ecosystem in a mountainous region. This research employed field survey data, soil-type maps, digital elevation model data, weather station data, and Landsat imagery, for extraction of potential variables. It used the random forest approach to identify eight key variables-slope, slope of slope, normalized difference greenness index at leaf-on season, soil organic matter, fractional vegetation at leaf-on season, fractional soil at leaf-off season, precipitation in June, and percent of soil clay-for mapping soil erosion risk distribution in hickory plantations in Western Zhejiang Province, China. The results showed that an overall accuracy of 89.8% was obtained for three levels of soil erosion risk. Approximately one-fourth of hickory plantations were at high-risk, requiring the owners or decision makers to take proper measures to reduce the soil erosion problem. This research provides a new approach to predict soil erosion risk, based on the primary variables that can be extracted directly from remotely-sensed data and ancillary data. This proposed approach will be valuable for other agroforestry and plantations, such as Torreya grandis, eucalyptus, and the rubber tree, that are playing important roles in improving economic conditions for the local farmers but face soil erosion problems.

TI  - Sea Ice Type Classification with Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing sensors provide visually more familiar images than radar images. However, it is difficult to discriminate sea ice types in optical images using spectral information based machine learning algorithms. This study addresses two topics. First, we propose a semantic segmentation which is a part of the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to identify ice types by learning hierarchical and spatial features of sea ice. Second, we propose a new approach by combining of semi-supervised and active learning to obtain accurate and meaningful labels from unlabeled or unseen images to improve the performance of supervised classification for multiple images. Therefore, we successfully added new labels from unlabeled data to automatically update the semantic segmentation model. This should be noted that an operational system to generate ice type products from optical remote sensing data may be possible in the near future.

TI  - Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Axillary Node-Positive Breast Cancer in Diagnosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) on recurrence and survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients with cytology-proven axillary node metastasis. Methods: We selected patients who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis and were treated with NAC followed by curative surgery between January 2007 and December 2014. We classified patients into three groups: group A, negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) status and no further dissection; group B, negative SLN status with backup axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); and group C, no residual axillary metastasis on pathology with standard ALND. Results: The median follow-up time was 51 months (range, 3-122 months) and the median number of retrieved SLNs was 5 (range, 2-9). The SLN identification rate was 98.3% (234/238 patients), and the false negative rate of SLNB after NAC was 7.5%. There was no significant difference in axillary recurrence-free survival (p = 0.118), disease-free survival (DFS; p=0.578) or overall survival (OS; p=0.149) among groups A, B, and C. In the subgroup analysis of breast pathologic complete response (pCR) status, there was no significant difference in DFS (p=0.271, p=0.892) or OS (p=0.207, p=0.300) in the breast pCR and non-pCR patients. Conclusion: These results suggest that SLNB can be feasible and oncologically safe after NAC for cytology-determined axillary node metastasis patients and could help reduce arm morbidity and lymphedema by avoiding ALND in SLN-negative patients.

T2  - YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we report a case of anti-Gerbich (Ge) alloantibody to a high-prevalence Ge antigen in a donor with Fy(a-b-) phenotype. The alloantibody was detected in an Emirati boy who was admitted to a Korean tertiary hospital for marrow hematopoietic progenitor cell donation. He did riot have a history of transfusion. Ins blood type was A, RhD+, and findings from the antibody screening and identification test showed 2+ reactivity in all panel cells except autologous cells. We concluded that it would be very difficult to find compatible blood components for the donor and requested further tests from external laboratories. Anti-Ge2 was identified by additional tests in a foreign reference laboratory, and the Duffy genotype of the donor was FY*02/FY*02N.01 based on the Korean Rare Blood Program. Although the donor was not a Korean, as the number of foreign patients visiting Korea increases annually, them is growing interest in patients with rare blood types in the Korean population. However, there has been very little research on rare or high prevalence blood type antigen and antibody in the Korean population. Therefore, additional research in Korea is needed on rare blood group antibodies and antigens, including Ge cases.

TI  - Investigation of Long Term Changes in Trace Gases and First Retrieval of Nitrogen Dioxide Surface Mixing Ratio over Major Ports Using Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this present study, we investigated long term changes in trace gases (SO2, NO2, and O-3) from shipping emissions over major ports in each continent using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements from 2006 to 2015. Additionally, surface nitrogen dioxide volume mixing ratio (NO2 VMR), which can be used to air quality regulation, is retrieved using tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column density and atmospheric measurement data from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) sensor. The long term variation of retrieved NO2 VMRs are investigated. During ten-years, column densities of sulfur dioxide in planetary boundary layer (PBL SO2) and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (Trop. NO2) decreased by -0.3 DU decade(-1) and -1.8 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) decade(-1), respectively. However, tropospheric ozone (Trop. 0 3 ) tends to increase (2.9 DU decade(-1)). The decreasing trends of PBL SO2 and Trop. NO2 are thought be due to regulation of NOx and SOx from shipping emission of International Maritime Organization. The NO2 VMRs averaged over Busan, Jebel Ali, Rotterdam, LA, and Melbourne are tends to decrease with 0.64 ppbv decade(-1). Especially, the NO2 VMR in Los Angles, which showed high decreasing trend of Trop. NO2, are decreased 1.5 ppbv per decade. The amount of nitrogen dioxide, one of the ozone precursors, decreased due to the emission reduction policy, while the actual Trop. O-3 tends to increase. Additional research is needed, however, the increase in Trop. O-3 column density is thought to be due to changes in volatile organic compound emissions, one of the precursors of ozone.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed land surface temperature (LST) retrieval algorithms based on the time of day and water vapor content using the Himawari-8/AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) data, which is the Japanese next generation geostationary satellite. To develop the LST retrieval algorithms, we simulated the spectral radiance using the radiative transfer model (MODTRAN4) by applying the atmospheric profiles (SeeBor), diurnal variation of LST and air temperature, spectral emissivity of land surface, satellite viewing angle, and spectral response function of Himawari-8/AHI. To retrieve the LST from Himawari-8 data, a linear type of split-window method was used in this study. The Himawari-8 LST algorithms showed a high correlation coefficient (0.996), and a small bias (0.002 K) and root mean square error (RMSE) (1.083 K) between prescribed LSTs and estimated LSTs. However, the accuracy of LST algorithms showed a slightly large RMSE when the lapse rate was larger than 10 K, and the brightness temperature difference was greater than 6 K. The cross-validation of Himawari-8/AHI LST using the MODIS (Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST showed that annual mean correlation coefficient, bias, and RMSE were 0.94, +0.45 K, and 1.93 K, respectively. The performances of LST algorithms were slightly dependent on the season and time of day, generally better during the night (warm season) than during the day (cold season).

TI  - Estimating rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, utilizing time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the most important food crop in Asia and rice exports can significantly contribute to a country's GDP. Vietnam is the third largest exporter and fifth largest producer of rice, the majority of which is grown in the Mekong Delta. The cultivation of rice plants is important, not only in the context of food security, but also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, provides man-made wetlands as an ecosystem, sustains smallholders in Asia and influences water resource planning and run-off water management. Rice growth can be monitored with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series due to the agronomic flooding followed by rapid biomass increase affecting the backscatter signal. With the advent of Sentinel-1 a wealth of free and open SAR data is available to monitor rice on regional or larger scales and limited data availability should not be an issue from 2015 onwards. We used Sentinel-1 SAR time series to estimate rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, for three rice seasons centered on the year 2015. Rice production for each growing season was estimated by first classifying paddy rice area using superpixel segmentation and a phenology based decision tree, followed by yield estimation using random forest regression models trained on in situ yield data collected by surveying 357 rice farms. The estimated rice production for the three rice growing seasons 2015 correlates well with data at the district level collected from the province statistics offices with R(2)s of 0.93 for the Winter-Spring, 0.86 for the Summer-Autumn and 0.87 for the Autumn-Winter season.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 and LUCAS Database for the Inventory of Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry in Wallonia, Belgium
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its cost-effectiveness and repeatability of observations, high resolution optical satellite remote sensing has become a major technology for land use and land cover mapping. However, inventory compilers for the Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector are still mostly relying on annual census and periodic surveys for such inventories. This study proposes a new approach based on per-pixel supervised classification using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2016 for mapping greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with the LULUCF sector in Wallonia, Belgium. The Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2015 was used as training data and reference data to validate the map produced. Then, we investigated the performance of four widely used classifiers (maximum likelihood, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and minimum distance) on different training sample sizes. We also studied the use of the rich spectral information of Sentinel-2 data as well as single-date and multitemporal classification. Our study illustrates how open source data can be effectively used for land use and land cover classification. This classification, based on Sentinel-2 and LUCAS, offers new opportunities for LULUCF inventory of greenhouse gas on a European scale.

TI  - Pauli Phase Calibration in Compact Polarimetry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of true transmitter polarization state estimation for circular compact SAR modes. We employ two methods-the first using point targets such as trihedral reflectors, and the second, a new method, based on the Pauli phase observed over distributed targets like forest canopy. We first show how compact modes allow estimation of the Pauli phase for reflection symmetric scatterers. We show that this phase remains remarkably constant over forest canopies, depending primarily on the dielectric constant of constituent volume particles. We show that small imperfections in the transmit polarization state then lead to large errors in this phase estimate. These errors can then be used as the basis for a calibration strategy that allows estimation of a set of candidate true transmitter states. These can then be compared with the trihedral estimates for validation. We illustrate using L-band compact data from the JAXA ALOS-2 satellite and C-band data from the ISRO RISAT-1 satellite.

TI  - Acceleration and fragmentation of CORINE land cover changes in the United Kingdom from 2006-2012 detected by Copernicus IMAGE2012 satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The CORINE land cover maps present the longest series of land cover maps with a consistent class labelling system and date back to 1985. This paper presents the results of the CORINE land cover mapping of the United Kingdom for 2012 and the corresponding land cover change map from 2006 to 2012. It compares the rates of change with those of the preceding land cover change map 2000-2006 and finds that land cover change has become smaller in scale, more diverse in types of change and affects more land cover polygons than in the past reporting period. Land cover change from 2006 to 2012 affected almost 60% more land cover polygons than from 2000 to 2006. A greater variety of 165 types of land cover change was detected from 2006 to 2012 than the 67 types of change from 2000 to 2006. The total land cover change area increased by over 21,000 ha or 11% but remained at around 1% of the total land area of the UK. Rotation forestry mostly of conifer forests was a dominant type of land cover change in both periods (53% of overall change from 2000 to 2006 and 54% from 2006 to 2012), followed by growth and replanting of conifer forest. From 2006 to 2012 the replanting rate decreased by almost 15,000 ha compared to 2000-2006 and a smaller decrease in planting of broadleaf and mixed forests was also observed. Urban land take continued from 2006 to 2012 in the UK, with over 16,000 ha of increase in artificial surfaces. The rate of change from other land cover types to artificial surfaces accelerated from 2006 to 2012. However, we urge caution when interpreting the rate of land take, as it includes wind farms in forested areas which leave the forest largely intact apart from an access road and the wind turbine sites. We also found that the inference from the land cover change matrices is dependent on the level of class aggregation (level 1, 2 or 3).

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Sentinels-1 & 2 of the Copernicus Mission in Support of Rapid and Cost-effective Wildfire Assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study explores the use of the recently launched Sentinel-1 and -2 data of the Copernicus mission in wildfire mapping with a particular focus on retrieving information on burnt area, bum severity as well as in quantifying soil erosion changes. As study area, the Sierra del Gata wildfire occurred in Spain during the summer of 2015 was selected. First, diverse image processing algorithms for burnt area extraction from Sentinel-2 data were evaluated. In the next step, burn severity maps were derived from Sentinel-2 data alone, and the synergy between Sentinel-2 & Sentinel-1 for this purpose was evaluated.-Finally, the impact of the wildfire to soil erodibility estimates derived from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model implemented to the acquired Sentinel images was explored. In overall, the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier obtained the most accurate burned area mapping, with a derived accuracy of 99.38%. An object-based SVMs classification using as input both optical and radar data was the most effective approach of delineating burn severity, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.97%. Soil erosion mapping predictions allowed quantifying the impact of wildfire to soil erosion at the studied site, suggesting the method could be potentially of a wider use. Our results contribute to the understanding of wildland fire dynamics in the context of the Mediterranean ecosystem, demonstrating the usefulness of Sentinels and of their derived products in wildfire mapping and assessment.

TI  - Unsupervised detection of vineyards by 3D point-cloud UAV photogrammetry for precision agriculture
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective management of precision viticulture processes relies on robust crop monitoring procedures and, in the near future, to autonomous machine for automatic site-specific crop managing. In this context, the exact detection of vineyards from 3D point-cloud maps, generated from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) multispectral imagery, will play a crucial role, e.g. both for achieve enhanced remotely sensed data and to manage path and operation of unmanned vehicles.In this paper, an innovative unsupervised algorithm for vineyard detection and vine-rows features evaluation, based on 3D point-cloud maps processing, is presented. The main results are the automatic detection of the vineyards and the local evaluation of vine rows orientation and of inter-rows spacing.The overall point-cloud processing algorithm can be divided into three mains steps: (1) precise local terrain surface and height evaluation of each point of the cloud, (2) point-cloud scouting and scoring procedure on the basis of a new vineyard likelihood measure, and, finally, (3) detection of vineyard areas and local features evaluation.The algorithm was found to be efficient and robust: reliable results were obtained even in the presence of dense inter-row grassing, many missing plants and steep terrain slopes. Performances of the algorithm were evaluated on vineyard maps at different phenological phase and growth stages. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm does not rely on the presence of rectilinear vine rows, being also able to detect vineyards with curvilinear vine row layouts.

TI  - Field Measurements and Satellite Remote Sensing of Daily Soil Surface Temperature Variations in the Lower Colorado Desert of California
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to better understand the relationships between diurnal variations of air temperature measured hourly at the soil surface, compared with the thermal infra-red (TIR) emission properties of soil surfaces located in the Lower Colorado Desert of California, eastern Riverside County. Fifty air temperature loggers were deployed in January of 2017 on wooden stakes that were driven into the sandy or rocky desert soils at both Ford Dry Lake and the southern McCoy Mountains wash. The land surface temperature (LST) derived from Landsat satellite images was compared to measured air temperatures at 1 m and at the soil surface on 14 separate dates, until mid-September, 2017. Results showed that it is feasible to derive estimated temperatures at the soil surface from hourly air temperatures, recorded at 1 m above the surface (ambient). The study further correlated Landsat LST closely with site measurements of air and surface temperatures in these solar energy development zones of southern California, allowing inter-conversion with ground-based measurements for use in ecosystem change and animal population biology studies.

TI  - Radical Trachelectomy for Early Stage Cervical Cancer
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion StatementIn patients with early-stage cervical cancer, radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy is the gold standard. However, this disease commonly affects women of childbearing age; thus an option to spare fertility is ideal. This option came to fruition in the early 90s when the Dargent procedure or radical trachelectomy was first reported. The procedure has subsequently been modified as technology has improved and now may be performed via minimally invasive techniques. Additionally, with the advent of the sentinel lymph node procedure, the morbidity in this usually young patient population has continued to improve. There is a multitude of data to show that oncologic outcomes, concerning recurrence and mortality, are comparable to radical hysterectomy, as well as obstetrical outcomes are favorable. Data to support its acceptance within the gynecologic oncology community has led to radical trachelectomy being implemented into governing body guidelines and should be offered to appropriate candidates with early-stage cervical cancer who wish to preserve fertility.

T2  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Observational Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: No consensus exists as yet regarding the optimal extent of surgery on the lymph nodes in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant treatment. In addition to axillary dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), anew approach called Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD) was introduced. It requires the marking of metastatic nodes before the neoadjuvant treatment.METHOD: Aretrospective observational study on patients with breast cancer and neoadjuvant chemotherapy treated surgically at asingle institution in 2017.RESULTS: The analysis included 121 cancers in 120 patients. Clinical regression of lymphadenopathy occurred in 29 out of 74 cases. Axillary dissection was performed 34x, SLNB 52x and TAD 35x. In TAD procedures, the marked lymph node was found 30x and was among the sentinel nodes in 19cases. No case occurred in which the marked node was assessed as negative with ametastasis found in the other nodes. On the contrary, there were 3 cases with negative sentinel nodes whereas the marked node was positive. Out of 74 cases with initially pathologic nodes, 23 patients were spared axillary dissection.CONCLUSION: Clinical assessment of the lymph node status is rather inaccurate. In cases with initially pathologic nodes we recommend marking of the most explicit metastatic node to enable TAD. The marked node is likely to reflect the status of the lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment more accurately than common sentinel nodes. Aconsiderable proportion of patients can be spared axillary dissection in this way. However, the long-term oncologic safety of TAD still needs to be verified. Key words: breast cancer - neoadjuvant treatment - axillary dissection - sentinel lymph node biopsy - targeted axillary dissection.

TI  - Analyzing the role of pulse density and voxelization parameters on full waveform LiDAR-derived metrics
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR full-waveform (L-FW) pulse density is not homogeneous along study areas due to overlap between contiguous flight stripes and, to a lesser extent, variations in height, velocity and altitude of the platform. As a result, L-FW-derived metrics extracted at the same spot but at different pulse densities differ, which is called "side-lap effect". Moreover, this effect is reflected in forest stand estimates, since they are predicted from L-FW-derived metrics. This study was undertaken to analyze L-FW-derived metric variations according to pulse density, voxel size and value assignation method in order to reduce the side-lap effect. Thirty LiDAR samples with a minimum density of 16 pulses.m(-2) were selected from the testing area and randomly reduced to 2 pulses.m(-2) with an interval of 1 pulse.m(-2), then metrics were extracted and compared for each sample and pulse density at different voxel sizes and assignation values. Results show that L-FW-derived metric variations as a function of pulse density follow a negative exponential model similar to the exponential semivariogram curve, increasing sharply until they reach a certain pulse density, where they become stable. This value represents the minimum pulse density (MPD) in the study area to optimally minimize the side-lap effect. This effect can also be reduced with pulse densities lower than the MPD modifying L-FW parameters (i.e. voxel size and assignation value). Results show that L-FW-derived metrics are not equally influenced by pulse density, such as number of peaks (NP) and ROUGHness of the outermost canopy (ROUGH) that may be discarded for further analyses at large voxel sizes, given that they are highly influenced by pulse density. In addition, side-lap effect can be reduced by either increasing pulse density or voxel size, or modifying the assignation value. In practice, this leads to a proper estimate of forest stand variables using L-FW data.

TI  - Natural variability and modulation by environmental stressors of global genomic cytosine methylation levels in a freshwater crustacean, <i>Gammarus fossarum</i>
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the assessment of aquatic organism responses to environmental stressors, there is an interest in studying epigenetic marks in addition to other validated biomarkers. Indeed, the epigenetic marks may be influenced by the surrounding environment. Non-model invertebrates such as gammarids are sentinel organisms representative of the diversity of natural stream communities. Despite their ecologically relevance, the epigenetic responses have been to date poorly documented in these species. The present study explores the measurement of the global cytosine methylation level in the genome of the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum. In a first step, natural variability of global cytosine methylation level (basal level) was assessed by studying the effect of sex, age and sampling site of organisms. Results showed a significant effect of age and sampling site. In a second step, effects of water temperature and food starvation were studied. For both factors, a hypermethylation was observed after 1 month of exposure. In a third step, gammarids were exposed to a range of environmentally relevant cadmium concentrations (0.05-5 mu g/L) in order to assess the effect of a chemical stress. Whatever the cadmium concentration used, a significant hypomethylation was observed after 14 days followed by a trend for hypermethylation after 1 month of exposure. These results are the first ones dealing with the 5C-methylation status in gammarids. The results constitute potential markers of environmental stresses in relevant sentinel species widely used in ecotoxicological studies.

TI  - Impact of land-use change and soil erosion on cultural landscapes: the case of cultural paths and sites in Paphos district, Cyprus
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil loss has been long characterized as one of the main threats of climate change with possible impact to natural and cultural heritage (UNESCO report 2006). This study illustrates how applied geomatics integrating earth observation and geographical information systems (GIS) can be used to quantify this threat in an UNESCO protected archeological site as well as on cultural routes such as the ancient Hellenistic-Roman Road network. Both study sites are located in the western part of Cyprus, and specifically in Paphos district, which is an area with undergoing major pressure caused by soil erosion and soil loss. Multi-temporal earth observation methods were applied for identification, mapping and estimation of the possible soil loss caused by soil erosion in the period of the past 30years. The soil loss was estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. Special attention was given to the land use/land cover factor (C) and its impact on the overall estimation of the soil loss. Cover factor represents the effect of soil-disturbing activities, plants, crop sequence and productivity level, soil cover, and subsurface bio-mass on soil erosion. Urban areas have a definite role in retarding the recharge process, leading to increased runoff and soil loss in the broader area. On the other hand, natural vegetation plays a predominant role in reducing water erosion. In specific, cover factor was estimated for the cultural routes, classified and observed in years 1987 and 2016 in the District of Paphos. The variance of the values between 2years was then calculated in order to identify the areas under major pressure of soil erosion caused by the changes in land use and land cover. In addition, high-resolution optical data were analyzed in order estimate the multi-temporal changes in soil loss in the archeological site of Nea Paphos. The results shows that integrated earth observation and GIS can be used as a systematic tool for monitoring cultural heritage sites against natural threats such as soil loss.

TI  - Superresolution of Noisy Remotely Sensed Images Through Directional Representations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop an algorithm for single-image superresolution of remotely sensed data based on the discrete shearlet transform. The shearlet transform extracts directional features of signals and is known to provide near-optimally sparse representations for a broad class of images. This often leads to superior performance in edge detection and image representation when compared with isotropic frames. We justify the use of shearlets mathematically, before presenting a denoising single-image superresolution algorithm that combines the shearlet transform with sparse mixing estimators (SMEs). Our algorithm is compared with a variety of single-image superresolution methods, including wavelet SME superresolution. Our numerical results demonstrate competitive performance in terms of peak-signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index metric.

TI  - Crowdsourced Street-Level Imagery as a Potential Source of In-Situ Data for Crop Monitoring
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - New approaches to collect in-situ data are needed to complement the high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5 d) resolution of Copernicus Sentinel satellite observations. Making sense of Sentinel observations requires high quality and timely in-situ data for training and validation. Classical ground truth collection is expensive, lacks scale, fails to exploit opportunities for automation, and is prone to sampling error. Here we evaluate the potential contribution of opportunistically exploiting crowdsourced street-level imagery to collect massive high-quality in-situ data in the context of crop monitoring. This study assesses this potential by answering two questions: (1) what is the spatial availability of these images across the European Union (EU), and (2) can these images be transformed to useful data? To answer the first question, we evaluated the EU availability of street-level images on Mapillary-the largest open-access platform for such images-against the Land Use and land Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018, a systematic surveyed sampling of 337,031 points. For 37.78% of the LUCAS points a crowdsourced image is available within a 2 km buffer, with a mean distance of 816.11 m. We estimate that 9.44% of the EU territory has a crowdsourced image within 300 m from a LUCAS point, illustrating the huge potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary sampling tool. After artificial and built up (63.14%), and inland water (43.67%) land cover classes, arable land has the highest availability at 40.78%. To answer the second question, we focus on identifying crops at parcel level using all 13.6 million Mapillary images collected in the Netherlands. Only 1.9% of the contributors generated 75.15% of the images. A procedure was developed to select and harvest the pictures potentially best suited to identify crops using the geometries of 785,710 Dutch parcels and the pictures meta-data such as camera orientation and focal length. Availability of crowdsourced imagery looking at parcels was assessed for eight different crop groups with the 2017 parcel level declarations. Parcel revisits during the growing season allowed to track crop growth. Examples illustrate the capacity to recognize crops and their phenological development on crowdsourced street-level imagery. Consecutive images taken during the same capture track allow selecting the image with the best unobstructed view. In the future, dedicated crop capture tasks can improve image quality and expand coverage in rural areas.

TI  - Oral cancers: Current status
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Oral cancer is a global disease. Despite a well elucidated tumour progression model, these cancers present late. Attempts at early detection by way of adjunctive diagnostic technologies and screening have not lived up to expectations in spite initial promise. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Treatment intensification by way of adjuvant radiation/chemo radiation is warranted for those with high risk features. Recent studies have explored intensification in those with intermediate risk factors in an attempt to improve outcomes. There has been generation of recent robust evidence that has influenced the need and extent of neck dissection. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) may have a potential role in organ preservation and borderline resectable oral cancers. Recurrent tumours should be offered surgery whenever feasible while the addition of biological agents to chemotherapy gives best results in the palliative settings.

TI  - Soil Moisture in the Biebrza Wetlands Retrieved from Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study was to estimate soil moisture (SM) from Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellite images acquired over wetlands. The study was carried out during the years 2015-2017 in the Biebrza Wetlands, situated in north-eastern Poland. At the Biebrza Wetlands, two Sentinel-1 validation sites were established, covering grassland and marshland biomes, where a network of 18 stations for soil moisture measurement was deployed. The sites were funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), and the collected measurements are available through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The SAR data of the Sentinel-1 satellite with VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) and VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) polarization were applied to SM retrieval for a broad range of vegetation and soil moisture conditions. The methodology is based on research into the effect of vegetation on backscatter (sigma degrees) changes under different soil moisture and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. The NDVI was derived from the optical imagery of a MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor onboard the Terra satellite. It was found that the state of the vegetation expressed by NDVI can be described by the indices such as the difference between sigma degrees VH and VV, or the ratio of sigma degrees VV/VH, as calculated from the Sentinel-1 images in the logarithmic domain. The most significant correlation coefficient for soil moisture was found for data that was acquired from the ascending tracks of the Sentinel-1 satellite, characterized by the lowest incidence angle, and SM at a depth of 5 cm. The study demonstrated that the use of the inversion approach, which was applied to the newly developed models using Water Cloud Model (WCM) that includes the derived indices based on S-1, allowed the estimation of SM for wetlands with reasonable accuracy (10 vol. %). The developed soil moisture retrieval algorithms based on S-1 data are suited for wetland ecosystems, where soil moisture values are several times higher than in agricultural areas.

TI  - Estimation of Snow Depth over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Based on AMSR-E and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) plays an important role in climate, hydrological, and ecological systems. Currently, passive microwave remote sensing is the most efficient way to monitor snow depth on global and regional scales; however, it presents a serious overestimation of snow cover over the QTP and has difficulty describing patchy snow cover over the QTP because of its coarse spatial resolution. In this study, a new spatial dynamic method is developed by introducing ground emissivity and assimilating the snow cover fraction (SCF) and land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to derive snow depth at an enhanced spatial resolution. In this method, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperature and MODIS LST are used to calculate ground emissivity. Additionally, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS) is applied to simulate brightness temperature with varying ground emissivities to determine the key coefficients in the snow depth retrieval algorithm. The results show that the frozen ground emissivity presents large spatial heterogeneity over the QTP, which leads to the variation of coefficients in the snow depth retrieval algorithm. The overestimation of snow depth is rectified by introducing the ground emissivity factor at 18 and 36 GHz. Compared with in situ observations, the snow cover accuracy of the new method is 93.9%, which is better than the 60.2% accuracy of the existing method (old method) which does not consider ground emissivity. The bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of snow depth are 1.03 cm and 7.05 cm, respectively, for the new method; these values are much lower than the values of 6.02 cm and 9.75 cm, respectively, for the old method. However, the snow cover accuracy with depths between 1 and 3 cm is below 60%, and snow depths greater than 25 cm are underestimated in Himalayan mountainous areas. In the future, the snow cover identification algorithm should be improved to identify shallow snow cover over the QTP, and topography should be considered in the snow depth retrieval algorithm to improve snow depth accuracy in mountainous areas.

AB  - The possibility of increasing the efficiency of forest vegetation mapping is studied using Landsat multitemporal satellite images of medium spatial resolution. To simplify the process of supervised satellite-image classification, the method of automated generation of reference samples is applied based on forest inventory materials. Using the test forest areas of the southern part of Yenisei Siberia, it is demonstrated that native and secondary stands of different ages, from which regeneration series of dark coniferous and light coniferous forests are developed in different forest growing conditions, are mapped as a result of the classification of multiseasonal images with a sufficient level of significance (Kappa coefficient more than 0.7).

TI  - Super-Resolution Multi-Look Detection in SAR Tomography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Tomography (TomoSAR) allows extending the 2-D focusing capabilities of SAR to the elevation direction, orthogonal to the azimuth and range. The multi-dimensional extension (along the time) also enables the monitoring of possible scatterer displacements. A key aspect of TomoSAR is the identification, in the presence of noise, of multiple persistent scatterers interfering within the same 2-D (azimuth range plane) pixel. To this aim, the use of multi-look has been shown to provide tangible improvements in the detection of single and double interfering persistent scatterers at the expense of a minor spatial resolution loss. Depending on the system acquisition characteristics, this operation may require also the detection of multiple scatterers interfering at distances lower than the Rayleigh resolution (super-resolution). In this work we further investigated the use of multi-look in TomoSAR for the detection of multiple scatterers located also below the Rayleigh resolution. A solution relying on the Capon filtering was first analyzed, due to its improved capabilities in the separation of the responses of multiple scatterers and sidelobe suppression. Moreover, in the framework of the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), the single-look support based detection strategy recently proposed in the literature was extended to the multi-look case. Experimental results of tests carried out on two datasets acquired by TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMED sensors are provided to show the performances of the proposed solution as well as the effects of the baseline span of the dataset for the detection capabilities of interfering scatterers.

TI  - Observation on distribution, biology, growth, diet and feeding strategy of blackmouth catshark <i>Galeus melastomus</i> (Rafinesque, 1810) (Chondrichthyes Scyliorhinidae) in Western Algerian coast
T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - The blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus (Rafinesque, 1810) (Chondrichthyes Scyliorhinidae) is an accidentally caught species and it acts as a sentinel, by reflecting the state of the region's fish stocks. Its vulnerability to the impact of fishing, along with the low fertility and late reproduction, do not ensure a good renewal. Data, collected during 13 months from November 2015 to November 2016, were analysed to enrich our knowledge on the population, reproductive biology, growth, and feeding strategy of the blackmouth catshark from the Western coast of Algeria. A total of 551 specimens, 360 males and 191 females, were caught. Their size ranged from 25 cm to 56 cm for both sexes. The length of the first sexual maturity was stunted at 54 cm in females. The asymptotic length was deduced from the von Bertalanffy growth equation to be higher for males than females (females: L infinity = 51.79 cm; males L infinity = 52.14 cm) and the study of the height-weight relationship revealed allometric growth. 551 stomachs were examined and the vacuity index was found to be 63.75%. The preys identified belonged primarily to three major groups: Crustaceans, Osteichthyes, and Cephalopods. Our results show that the feeding strategy of G. melastomus is to be considered generalist and differs from one month to another.

TI  - Space-temporal analysis of vegetable coverage in a hydrographic basin of the region of MATOPIBA, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrographic basin of the Urucui-Preto river, Piaui, with an area of 15.777 km(2), has been characterized over the last 30 years by agricultural expansion, integrating the agricultural frontier of MATOPIBA, composed of the states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui and Bahia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the change in the vegetation cover in this basin from 1984 to 2015. Images of the TM and OLI sensors of the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites, respectively, were used to elaborate mosaics and vegetation enhancement through the Vegetation Index (IVDN), to obtain the evolution of the change in land cover. The supervised classification (Maximum Likelihood) was carried out in five classes: exposed soil, anthropic area, sparse vegetation, sparse vegetation and dense vegetation. The results showed intense anthropization in the analyzed area. In 1984, the exposed soil class corresponded to 390.3 km(2) of the total basin area, with an increase in 2015 to 1,498.20 km(2). In 1984 there were 7,743.2 km(2) of original vegetation cover, reduced in 2015, to 3,487.40 km(2), with a reduction of 45.03% of the class of dense vegetation. This study can aid in strategies for the performance of state environmental agencies and environmental planning in order to reconcile the development of agribusiness with the conservation of natural resources.

TI  - Soybean crop coverage estimation from NDVI images with different spatial resolution to evaluate yield variability in a plot
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore precision farming profits, the variability within a plot can be evaluated using digital technology by different remote means. The objectives of this study were to determine crop coverage (CC) of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merril) with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data obtained by digital photographs on the field and from the satellites LANDSAT (7 and 8), with an overpass each 16 days and a pixel of 30 m, and PROBA-V, which has daily frequency and 100 m of spatial resolution, in order to evaluate productivity differences between sectors of a 45 ha rainfed plot located at south of Cordoba city, Argentina. In the plot, sowed on 22/11/2014 and harvested on 10/04/2015, 16 sampling areas were established to record periodically photographs with a modified camera and, in 8 of them, supplementary crop information. A non-linear model was developed from NDVI data of digital camera (NDVIc) to estimate the soybean CC that showed an appropriate predictive performance. Furthermore, NDVI data of LANDSAT (7 and 8) (NDVIL) and PROBA-V (NDVIp-v) were also applied to estimate CC, resulting in models whose structure and accuracy was similar to that obtained with the digital camera (R-2 = 0.956 and 0.939, respectively). According to the radiometric information the two instruments provide, the digital images classification procedure to determine CC requires increasing the threshold from 0.0 to 0.05 when soybean progresses towards the maturation and senescence stages and green material is mixed with the senescent one. Growing conditions were very favorable for soybean in 2014-2015, since precipitation (PP) not only showed a marked continuity with 60 rainy days during the cycle, but also 642 mm accumulated in this period far exceeded maximum evapotranspiration (ETmax) of 389 mm. The CC had a major development in all sectors, maintaining a complete coverage condition for more than 50 days during most of the reproductive stage. However, prevalent overcast sky restricted significantly solar radiation (SR) and reduced potential yield (PY) to an average value close to 6000 kg ha(-1) which, according to the plot yield map, produced a reduced yield gap (YG) between 10.6 and 19.8%. From the proposed model and with the NDVI data of LANDSAT 7 (NDVI7), soybean CC was estimated in the same plot for 2010-2011. Water availability were less favorable in this case, with accumulated values of 584 mm and 460 mm, for PP and ETmax, respectively, while a higher availability of SR during the crop season increased notably PY that reached a range between 7347 and 8224 kg ha(-1). Moreover, lower water availability was evidenced increasing YG in the plot (40-53%). From the spatial evaluation carried out, only one-third of the plot located at the south reached the highest productivity in both crop seasons, leaving open the question about the weather influence in each productive cycle with respect to the effectiveness of the site-specific management.

TI  - A Region Merging Segmentation with Local Scale Parameters: Applications to Spectral and Elevation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Region merging is the most effective method for the segmentation of remote sensing data. The quality and the size of the resulted image objects is controlled by a global heterogeneity threshold, termed as the scale parameter. However, the multidimensional nature of the visible features in a scene defies the use of an even optimum single global scale parameter. In this study, a novel region merging segmentation method is proposed, where a local scale parameter is defined for each image object by its internal and external heterogeneity measures (i.e., local variance and Moran's I). This method allows image objects with low internal and external heterogeneity to be further merged with higher scale parameter values, since they are more likely to be a part of an adjacent object, than objects with high internal and external heterogeneity. The proposed method was applied in spectral and elevation data and its results were evaluated visually and with supervised and unsupervised evaluation methods. The comparison with multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) showed that the proposed region merging method can produce improved segmentation results in terms of maximizing intra-object homogeneity and inter-object heterogeneity as well as in the delimitation of specific target objects, present in spectral and elevation data. The unsupervised evaluation results of the (1) Cote d'Azur, (2) Manchester, and (3) Szada images from the SZTAKI-INRIA building detection dataset showed that the proposed method (overall goodness, OG(f) (1): 0.7375, (2): 0.7923, (3): 0.7967) performs better than MRS (OG(f) (1): 0.7224, (2): 0.7648, (3): 0.7823). The higher values of OG(f) indicate their ability to produce segmentation results with reduced over-segmentation effects and without the need of presegmented input data, in contrast to the objective heterogeneity and relative homogeneity (OHRH) hybrid segmentation method (OG(f) (1): 0.5864, (2): 0.5151, (3): 0.6983).

TI  - Bleeding emergencies in neonatal and paediatric patients: improving the quality of care using simulation
T2  - TRANSFUSION MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Using a multidisciplinary approach and simulation, a massive transfusion process (MTP) was developed to care for patients in need of emergency transfusion. It was then assessed for effectiveness. Background After a series of sentinel emergency bleeding events, a reliable process for hospital staff to deliver appropriate blood products and obtain relevant laboratory tests to guide therapy for patients with emergency bleeding was needed. Methods To determine the feasibility of the new MTP, multidisciplinary teams participated in simulation events. Each simulation event helped refine the MTP. A special laboratory testing panel was devised. To judge the effectiveness and timeliness of the MTP, process measures and patient survival was retrospectively evaluated during the time period before and after MTP implementation. Results A new emergency bleeding panel of laboratory tests significantly decreased the turn-around time for fibrinogen, haematocrit, International normalised ratio (INR) and platelet count. The speed of commencing the first red blood cells transfusion was also improved (2:00 h vs 0:20 min, P = 0 center dot 001). Of 78 patients, there was no change in survival before (n = 31, 48 center dot 4%) and after (n = 47, 42 center dot 6%; P = 0 center dot 6478) MTP implementation. However, there was significant improvement in survival associated with MTP events on the weekdays. Conclusions A reliable emergency transfusion process consists of an automatic chain of events that keeps decision-making to a minimum and leads to the fast procurement of blood products and salient test results. This work shows that a multidisciplinary iterative process using simulation increases the efficiency of clinical care delivery for bleeding paediatric and neonatal patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the research in Russian literature, and although Russian literary critics hardly study Hibbert's creativity, his works enjoy popularity not only in the writer's native land, but also throughout the world. This paper is a work of the cognitive interpretation of the results of linguistic research, the lexical and semantic modeling of images, and the dominant artistic space of the historical novel, "The Crimean campaign of 1854-1855. The tragedy of Lord Raglan". It was shown that the images of the war have a significant value in the worldview of the author and serve as a key to unlock the problems of the novels focused on the fate of the "historical personality".

TI  - Groundwater quality in Deccan upland region of Chandanapuri Valley, Sangamner, Maharashtra, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is an attempt to decipher physico-chemical characteristics of groundwater collected along Mulmala stream in the Chandanapuri valley through monitoring of its morphological, geological and land use constraints. The Mulmala stream is located in the semi-arid irrigated tract of Western Deccan upland, flowing over Aa and Pahoehoe basalts and alluvium at base of the upland where quality of groundwater is declining. In view of this, 13 groundwater samples (2 borewell + 11 dug well) were collected and analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-2, Cl-, SO4-2, NO3- using standard methods. Survey of India's toposheets (47 I/2 and 47 I/3) and geology map were georeferenced and used for extraction of drainage networks and geological information, respectively, in ArcGIS-10 software. Extracted drainage networks were ordered by Strahler method for bifurcation ratio calculation. Topographic and slope values along with a longitudinal profile were obtained from CartoDEM (v3). Land use mapping were carried out from IRS's Resourcesat-1-LISS III satellite imagery, acquired on December 2008 and October 2010. Finally, incorporation of morphometric, geologic, hydrologic information was carried out with land use. The geochemical and land use data suggests, Chandanapuri valley inching towards vigorous anthropogenic activity having potentially deleterious effects on its natural setting, especially in the northern alluvium strip. The steady decline in forest cover and an equal or more increase in agricultural as well as excavating the Deccan upland for highway construction can have cascading effect on the Mulmala basin ecology. Timely sustainable steps with people participation can halt this deterioration in the study area.

TI  - The 2017 <i>M</i> <sub>w</sub> 7.3 Ezgeleh, Iran earthquake determined from InSAR measurements and teleseismic waveforms
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ezgeleh earthquake on 2017 November 12 is the first instrumentally recorded earthquake larger than M-w 7 that has occurred in the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images from the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 A/B satellites in six different viewing geometries to map the coseismic surface deformation caused by this earthquake. The interferograms exhibit obvious displacements with maximum value of 0.97 m in line-of-sight (LOS) direction. We combine InSAR and teleseismic broad-band P waveforms data to investigate both the fault geometry and rupture slip distribution. Our results show that the event ruptures a blind oblique thrust fault plane with a gentle dip to the northeast and an approximately N-S strike at a depth of 15-20 km. The total seismic moment released within 20 s is 1.1 x 10(20) Nm, equivalent to M-w = 7.3. This earthquake represents a unilateral rupture with its front propagating towards the southwest at an average speed of 2.5 km s(-1). The Ezgeleh earthquake terminated a seismic quiescence along the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt, and highlights a transform fault at the range front, which plays an important role in accommodating the differential convergent deformation along the plate boundary, indicating a seismic risk in this active tectonic area.

TI  - Conversion of time-varying Stokes coefficients into mass anomalies at the Earth's surface considering the Earth's oblateness
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-varying Stokes coefficients estimated from GRACE satellite data are routinely converted into mass anomalies at the Earth's surface with the expression proposed for that purpose by Wahr et al. (J Geophys Res 103(B12):30,205-30,229, 1998). However, the results obtained with it represent mass transport at the spherical surface of 6378 km radius. We show that the accuracy of such conversion may be insufficient, especially if the target area is located in a polar region and the signal-to-noise ratio is high. For instance, the peak values of mean linear trends in 2003-2015 estimated over Greenland and Amundsen Sea embayment of West Antarctica may be underestimated in this way by about 15%. As a solution, we propose an updated expression for the conversion of Stokes coefficients into mass anomalies. This expression is based on the assumptions that: (i) mass transport takes place at the reference ellipsoid and (ii) at each point of interest, the ellipsoidal surface is approximated by the sphere with a radius equal to the current radial distance from the Earth's center (locally spherical approximation). The updated expression is nearly as simple as the traditionally used one but reduces the inaccuracies of the conversion procedure by an order of magnitude. In addition, we remind the reader that the conversion expressions are defined in spherical (geocentric) coordinates. We demonstrate that the difference between mass anomalies computed in spherical and ellipsoidal (geodetic) coordinates may not be negligible, so that a conversion of geodetic colatitudes into geocentric ones should not be omitted.

AB  - The results obtained from test ground-based measurements with a new satellite instrument for mo-nitoring the Earth's ozone layer are considered. The developed spectrometer, called ozonometer-TM, is to be installed aboard small near-Earth spacecraft (Ionosphere). The ozonometer-TM has been developed for monitoring the total ozone content based on the nadir satellite measurements of reflected and scattered light. This instrument operates within a spectral range of 300-500 nm with a spectral resolution of about 0.3-0.6 nm. Its qualification prototype has been manufactured and a number of test ground-based measurements have been performed at the Kislovodsk High-Mountain Station and in Orel. Estimates of the total ozone content have been obtained and compared with independent satellite data obtained during practically the same time period.

TI  - Current Therapeutic Approaches to DCIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMARY GLAND BIOLOGY AND NEOPLASIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Treatment for ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) has historically been extrapolated from studies of invasive breast cancer. Accepted local therapy approaches range from small local excisions, with or without radiation, to bilateral mastectomies. Systemic treatment with endocrine therapy is often recommended for hormone positive patients. With improvements in imaging, pathologic review, and treatment techniques in the modern era, combined with new information regarding tumor biology, the management of DCIS is rapidly evolving. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment is now more important than ever, with a shift towards de-escalating therapy to reduce treatment related toxicity. This review focuses on nuances of clinical management of DCIS in the modern era, highlighting key differences between DCIS as compared to invasive breast cancer. The American Cancer Society (ACS) currently recommends beginning screening with annual mammograms for women age 45, with the option to start at age 40. As treatment of DCIS has not been shown to impact survival, the USPSTF has more conservative screening recommendations of biennial mammograms from age 50-74. Unlike invasive breast cancer, DCIS is almost exclusively diagnosed by mammographic detection, and lymph node evaluation is not recommended. Pathologic review of biopsy specimens should follow the guidelines of the College of American Pathologists. Surgical management options include breast conservation, mastectomy, or possibly nipple sparing mastectomy, with upfront sentinel lymph node evaluation in the case of mastectomy. Radiation therapy is generally recommended as a component of breast conserving therapy for patients with DCIS, though in some low risk patients, there is trial data to suggest that adjuvant radiation may be omitted. Techniques for minimizing radiation toxicity should always be emphasized. Endocrine therapy is offered to women with hormone positive DCIS who have undergone lumpectomy for risk reduction, and has the benefit of decreasing incidence of events in both the ipsilateral and contralateral breast. More recent studies have explored use of targeted treatments such as trastuzumab in DCIS for HER2 overexpression. Future directions include tailoring therapy based on patient characteristics and tumor biology. With so many different options for treatment, it is also critical to engage in a discussion with the patient to arrive at a treatment decision that balances patient preferences for disease control versus treatment toxicity, financial toxicity, cosmesis, and quality of life.

TI  - The deployable telescope: a cutting-edge solution for high spatial and temporal resolved Earth observation
T2  - ADVANCED OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase of spatial and temporal resolution for Earth observation (EO) is the ultimate driver for science and societal applications. However, the state-of-the-art EO missions like DigitalGlobe's Worldview-3, are very costly. Moreover, this system has a high mass of 2800 kg and limited swath width of about 15 km which limits the temporal resolution. In this article, we present the status of the deployable space telescope (DST) project, which has been running for 6 years now at the Delft University of Technology, as a cutting-edge solution to solve this issue. Deployable optics have the potential of revolutionising the field of high resolution EO. By splitting up the primary mirror (M1) of a telescope into deployable segments and placing the secondary mirror (M2) on a deployable boom, the launch volume of a telescope can be reduced by a factor of 4 or more, allowing for much lower launch costs. This allows for larger EO constellations, providing image data with a much better revisit time than existing solutions. The DST specfication baseline, based on Wordview-3, aims to provide images with a ground resolution of 25 cm (panchromatic 450-650 nm) from an orbital altitude of 500 km. In this paper, the current status of the optical, thermo-mechanical, and active optics systems design are described. The concurrent design approach combined with a strict bottom-up and top-down compliant systems engineering approach show that the DST is a healthy system concept.

TI  - Effect of pre-oxide and hydrogen on creep of Zircaloy-4 at 1123 K
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The creep behaviour of pre-oxidized and pre-hydrided Zircaloy-4 was investigated at 1123 K. Outer only and outer + inner pre-oxidation were considered in the study. The cladding creep rate decreases when the thickness of the pre-oxide layer increases and stabilizes for thicknesses higher than about 20 mu m. The effect of pre-oxide is stronger in double-sided than in single-sided pre-oxidized samples and depends on the applied stress. Hydrogen increases Zircaloy-4 creep rate on both bare and pre-oxidized samples. The presence of high amounts of hydrogen, which induces the formation of significant quantities of beta phase at high temperature, modifies the creep mechanism. During pre-oxidation, a network of regularly spaced radial cracks is formed on thick pre-oxide layers. At the beginning of the creep test, these cracks spread out throughout the oxide layer up to the alpha(O) layer, where they stop. Finally, strain develops in the oxide-free zones.

TI  - Perceived stress and worldview influence sleep quality in Bolivian and United States university students
T2  - SLEEP HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study investigated predictors of poor sleep quality among American and Bolivian students.Design: A cross-sectional survey was designed and administered to undergraduate university students.Setting and participants: Psychology classes from 2 public universities (Texas, USA, and Bolivia) were convenience sampled (n - 80 American students: 60 Bolivian students).Measurements: We used a sleep quality index and the Perceived Stress Scale. We added questions concerning worldview, sleep hygiene, sleep deficiency, health behaviors, and demographics.Results: Five variables predicted poor sleep quality: perceived stress, sleep hygiene, sleep deficiency, worldview, and site. Greater stress positively associated with poorer sleep in both cultures. Yet, Bolivian students reported significantly more stress than American students but experienced significantly better sleep quality. Worldview, a measure of optimism or pessimism about the world, negatively associated with sleep quality in both cultures.Conclusion: Three variables that predict sleep quality (worldview, sleep hygiene, and sleep deficiency) did not differ significantly between countries. Only perceived stress differed by country but contrary to the predicted direction. Thus, this work reveals new avenues for future work to the investigation of sleep in different cultures. Lastly, we offer recommendations to ameliorate poor sleep in university students. (C) 2018 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A First-in-Human Study of <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-Nanocolloid PET/CT Sentinel Lymph Node Imaging in Prostate Cancer Demonstrates Aberrant Lymphatic Drainage Pathways
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal was to assess the feasibility, safety, and utility of a novel Ga-68-nanocolloid radiotracer with PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy for identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Methods: This was a pilot study of patients from a tertiary cancer hospital who required insertion of gold fiducials for prostate cancer radiation therapy. Participation did not affect cancer management. Ultrasound-guided transperineal intraprostatic injection of a PET tracer (iron oxide nanocolloid labeled with Ga-68) was performed after placement of the fiducials. PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy imaging took place at approximately 45 and 100 min after injection of the tracer. The study was monitored using a Bayesian design with the assumption that at least 1 SLN could be identified in at least two thirds of cases with more than 80% confidence. Results: SLN identification was successful in all 5 participants, allowing completion of the pilot study as per protocol. No adverse effects were observed. Unexpected potential pathways for transit of malignant cells, as well as the expected regional drainage pathways, were discovered. Rapid tracer drainage to pelvic bone, perivesicular, mesorectal, inguinal, and Virchow nodes was identified. Conclusion: SLN identification using Ga-68-nanocolloid PET/CT can be successfully performed. Nontraditional pathways of disease spread were identified, including drainage to pelvic bone and to perivesicular, mesorectal, inguinal, and Virchow nodes. The prevalence of both aberrant and nonlymphatic pathways of spread should be further investigated with this technique.

TI  - Analysis of multi-decadal wetland changes, and cumulative impact of multiple storms1984 to 2017
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover classification analysis using Landsat satellite imagery acquired between 1984 and 2017 quantified short- (post-Hurricane Sandy) and long-term wetland-change trends along the Maryland and Virginia coasts between Metompkin Bay, VA and Ocean City, MD. Although there are limited options for upland migration of wetlands in the study area, regression analysis showed that wetland area increased slightly between 1984 and 2011, indicating that marsh aggradation rates were sufficient to maintain wetland elevation relative to mean sea level. Following Hurricane Irene (August 2011), the Halloween Nor'Easter (October 2011), and Hurricane Sandy (October 2012), wetland area decreased by more than 7km(2) compared with average pre-storm extents. We assume that Hurricane Sandy had the greatest impact due to the size and intensity of the storm. However, the cumulative effects of multiple storms within a short time period likely contributed to the greater observed losses in coastal wetlands relative to earlier periods. Five years after Hurricane Sandy, wetland area had not significantly recovered, but more time may be necessary to assess if the observed wetland losses will persist or if new growth within flooded marsh areas will be sufficient for the wetlands to recover to pre-storm extents. Comparisons of long-term and storm-driven wetland changes can lead to improved accuracy of habitat vulnerability models and greater understanding of potential impacts of future storms and SLR to coastal wetlands.

TI  - ASTROLOGY AND THE DEMOTIC PRESS: ALMANACS IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND
T2  - ANAFORA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article focuses on the eighteenth- century English almanac as an iconic element of the demotic press, on the one hand, and as a literary commodity published by the Stationers' Company, a guild of artisans involved in the printing trade. Engaged in popularising their astrological content as scientific observations, almanacs were classified by the elite as low reading in tune with the Company's supply and demand policy. My task is to apply the "high" / "low" culture dichotomy to English almanacs and to examine the way in which they marked a radical change from an archaic, superstitious, and irrational frame of mind to a rational, scientific, and, implicitly, modern worldview backed by the Scientific Revolution. Last but not least, the paper will show that eighteenth- century English almanacs were sensitive to historical, national identity and popular patriotism issues and adhered to divergent religious and political allegiances exposed to the shafts of satire - the prevailing genre of the time - practiced by elite writers like Jonathan Swift or by famous almanac-compilers, such as George Parker and John Partridge.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is arare, highly aggressive skin tumor with neuroendocrine features found in older people. The pathogenesis is associated with immunosuppression, chronic UV light exposure and the Merkel cell polyomavirus. Clinically, Merkel cell carcinoma presents as asolitary, cutaneous or subcutaneous, red to bluish node. Due to early lymphogenic metastasis, locoregional metastases are already present in approximately 30% of cases at the time of diagnosis. The frequent local recurrences as well as the regional and distant metastases usually appear within the first 2-3years after the initial diagnosis. The first treatment after diagnosis consists of complete surgical removal of the primary tumor with wide safety margins as well as asentinel lymph node biopsy. Subsequently, adjuvant irradiation of the primary site should be performed. By additional radiotherapy of the regional lymph node stations, the rate of locoregional recurrence can be reduced. For systemic therapy of advanced Merkel cell carcinoma checkpoint inhibitors targeted against the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have proven to be highly and durably effective. In contrast the formerly frequently used chemotherapy shows moderate to good response rates but they are as a rule very short-lived.

TI  - Assessment of the Accuracy Among the Common Persistent Scatterer and Distributed Scatterer Based on SqueeSAR Method
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - SqueeSAR, also known as advanced time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (ATS-InSAR) method, is a significant improvement of conventional persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR), whereby the concepts of distributed scatterer (DS) and persistent scatterer (PS) are first been introduced, respectively. It is worth noting that during the measurement pixel selection, it is inevitable that a number of PS can be categorized as DS as well, hence resulting in common PS-DS pixels. In order to understand the consistency among these common PS-DS pixels with PSInSAR and ATS-InSAR methods, statistical analyses are conducted with 10 real InSAR image stacks in this letter. The relationship between the goodness-of-fit value and four main factors, including root-mean-square difference, DS percentage, PS-DS/PS ratio, and PS-DS/DS ratio, is studied. It is concluded that Sentinel-1-based TS-InSAR can he less influenced by the goodness-of-fit threshold in comparison with the counterpart result of ALOS-1 under the same parameter setting; finally, conclusions for the threshold settings are given.

AB  - Urban growth is a key process affecting the functioning of natural ecosystems, and consequently the global land-surface process. This work aimed at establishing the link between land cover changes around Harare Metropolitan city and the proliferation of aquatic hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in Lake Chivero. Remotely sensed Landsat series acquired in the year 1973, 1981, 1994, 1998, 2008, 2009 and 2014 was used. Image classification was implemented to map the associated changes over time using discriminant analysis algorithm. Derived thematic land cover maps showed that agricultural land increased from 2% in 1973 to a 5% in 1981 reaching up to 30% in 2014, whereas the city's land area significantly (p < 0.05) increased between 1973 and 1994. However, water hyacinth constantly increased over time. The spatial and temporal resolution of Landsat images detected land cover changes and the proliferation of aquatic hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the Lake Chivero over time.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Lakes region contains productive agricultural and forest lands, but it is also highly urbanized, with 32 of its 52 million residents living in nine large metropolitan areas. Urbanization of undeveloped areas may adversely affect the productivity of agricultural and forest lands, and the provision of ecosystem services. We combine demographic and remote sensing data to evaluate land cover change in the region using a two-phase statistical modeling approach that predicts the incidence and extent of land cover change for each of the region's 10,579 county subdivisions. Observed patterns are spatially uneven, and the probability of land cover change is influenced by current land use, human habitation, industry, and demographic change. Pseudo R-2 values varied from 0.053 to 0.338 for the first-phase logistic models predicting the presence of land cover change; second-stage beta models predicting the rate of change were more reliable, with pseudo R-2 ranging from 0.225 to 0.675. Overall, changes from agriculture or greenspace to development were much more predictable than changes from agriculture to greenspace or vice versa, and demographic variables were much more important in models predicting change to development. Although models successfully predicted the general location of land cover change, and models from before the Great Recession were useful for predicting the location but not the amount of change during the recession, fine-grained prediction remained challenging. Understanding where future changes are most probable can inform planning and policy-making, which may reduce the impact of development on resource production, environmental health, and ecosystem services.

AB  - Cucurbitaceae represent an important part of the vegetable production in Martinique. One of the main pest on these crops is the melonworm, Diaphana hyalinata. With the final objective of defining sustainable strategies for the management of this pest with low quantities of pesticides, an inventory of the Trichogramma egg parasitoids was conducted in 2014 on the island. This survey was implemented using two methods, the use of sentinel eggs of Ephestia kuehniella and collections of natural egg clutches. Based on molecular information, two species were finally observed, Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879, and T. chilonis Ishii, 1941. Based on this survey, a strain of T. pretiosum was mass-reared using Corcyra cephalonica and used for first promising inundative releases.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we describe the role of parks, recreation, and tourism in health promotion. We begin by proposing a new definition of health that is rooted in an ecologically based worldview. Our definition sees human health and environmental health as being inextricably intertwined. Indeed, we see them as being one in the same. We then discuss ecological insights rooted in biomimicry that illuminate the kinds of contributions parks, recreation, and tourism professionals can make to health promotion. This application requires us to see ourselves, in the words of Aldo Leopold, as "plain members and citizens of a larger community of life" (Leopold, 1949, p. 224), citizens who recognize that we have much to learn from other species about how to live our lives in a manner that ensures a sustainable future for us all. We then place the principles of biomimicry into a larger global context by explicating a model of ecologically-based health promotion through which park, recreation, and tourism professionals might better understand how the work they do contributes to health promotion. We offer two examples-one international and one local-of what this work looks like in practice, emphasizing how they reflect the principles of biomimicry and an ecological model of health promotion. Finally, we invite readers to ponder the implications of what we propose for the work they do in parks, recreation, and tourism.

TI  - Determination of optimum segmentation parameter values for extracting building from remote sensing images
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Lately, with progresses in remote sensing information techniques and the growingly and unprecedented uses of its uses, remote sensing became a science that cannot be dispensed with in most fields and ground object extraction has turned out to be more exact. Remote sensing image of high spatial resolution gives more inconspicuous components for instance, shape, color, size. The use of the old pixel-based method of classification images inevitably leads to a significant sacrificing of image classification accuracy. The use of unconventional methods such as object based image analysis (OBIA) to obtain data from image of high spatial resolution becomes the focus of many researchers. The initial phase of the OBIA technique is segmentation, which is a procedure that partition an image into moderately homogeneous areas named segments. Because the conventional pixel-based method does not suit the classification of remote sensing images with spatial resolution, it has been replaced by a new standard method OBIA. Choosing the parameters of segmentation is a fundamental stage in the image segmentation process, the main purpose of this research is to try to find the best values or near the best values for the parameters of image segmentation. It is expected to obtain an image object that expresses the reality and therefore obtain the accuracy of the classification of the satellite images if the selection of good and appropriate segmentation parameters well done.There are three parameters that have a significant impact on the accuracy of the results of the segmentation must be determined their values with high precision, where they can be arranged from the lowest up, these are compactness, shape scale. Dependence on use of visual analysis alone in determining the values of these parameters is a waste of time. Consequently, in this paper, a set of segmentations was carried out utilizing the Worldview-3 image with different values for the segmentation parameters to define ideal or close ideal segmentation parameters used to extracting building from remote sensing images.

Pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen revealed a 60mm cancer lesion including a 50 mm invasive ductal carcinoma with surrounding ductal carcinoma in situ, although the pre-operative MRI suggested a 30mm invasive cancer. The surgical margin was positive with the exposure of ductal carcinoma in situ. Additional resection was performed with a resection margin of 20mm from the head-side stump of the previous surgery. Pathological diagnosis of the additionally resected specimen revealed a 6mm invasive carcinoma with its exposure on the surface of the specimen around the new surgical stump distant from the initial surgical margin, where no remnant cancer was noted. She underwent left mastectomy. Pathological diagnosis further revealed 7mm and 2mm invasive carcinomas in the remnant breast. The preoperative imaging was reviewed retrospectively, and it was found that identifying the nodules in the remnant breast was quite difficult based on the images, including MRI. We report a case of breast cancer with metastatic nodules in additionally resected specimens.

TI  - New Insights into Multiclass Damage Classification of Tsunami-Induced Building Damage from SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine resolution of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images enables the rapid detection of severely damaged areas in the case of natural disasters. Developing an optimal model for detecting damage in multitemporal SAR intensity images has been a focus of research. Recent studies have shown that computing changes over a moving window that clusters neighboring pixels is effective in identifying damaged buildings. Unfortunately, classifying tsunami-induced building damage into detailed damage classes remains a challenge. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel multiclass classification model that considers a high-dimensional feature space derived from several sizes of pixel windows and to provide guidance on how to define a multiclass classification scheme for detecting tsunami-induced damage. The proposed model uses a support vector machine (SVM) to determine the parameters of the discriminant function. The generalization ability of the model was tested on the field survey of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and on a pair of TerraSAR-X images. The results show that the combination of different sizes of pixel windows has better performance for multiclass classification using SAR images. In addition, we discuss the limitations and potential use of multiclass building damage classification based on performance and various classification schemes. Notably, our findings suggest that the detectable classes for tsunami damage appear to differ from the detectable classes for earthquake damage. For earthquake damage, it is well known that a lower damage grade can rarely be distinguished in SAR images. However, such a damage grade is apparently easy to identify from tsunami-induced damage grades in SAR images. Taking this characteristic into consideration, we have successfully defined a detectable three-class classification scheme.

T2  - REVISTA DE CHIMIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is the most severe skin neoplasia with an increased incidence in the recent decades, particularly due to the intense exposure to sunlight. Our study analyzed the characteristics of malignant melanoma and the role of sentinel node biopsy in the diagnosis and prognosis of the patients with cutaneous melanoma by identifying the regional metastasis. The small or large clusters of circulating cancer cells are expressing epitops identified by some chemical reaction. These reagents are usually monoclonal antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity which are matching with the right receptor from the melanoma cells. The result is an antibody-antigen complex high-light in the microscopic examination by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The study was conducted on a sample of 151 patients diagnosed with melanoma in different developmental stages: 62 had Breslow index between 1-4 mm, 71 patients had Breslow index (A) over tilde 4 mm and 18 patients had Breslow index < 1 mm. 45 patients (out of 62) with Breslow index between 1-4 mm had SLN positive. The mortality rate was 5% in the case of the patients with SLN positive. Comparing the rate of mortality by considering the Breslow index, 65% of the patients with Breslow index <(A)over tilde> 4 mm died. The correct identification of the patients with negative sentinel node or positive sentinel node improves staging and can facilitate the subsequent therapeutic decision, which is useful for early identification of the micro metastases and of the patients who require regional complete lymph node dissection.

TI  - Determination of correlation coefficient between geoid-to-quasigeoid separation calculated by the satellite data in Sjoberg's equation and GPS/Levelling method
T2  - GEODESY AND CARTOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, two techniques for calculating the geoid-to-quasigeoid separation are employed. One of them is GPS/Levelling customary method as a criterion where the geoid undulation and height anomaly are computed by subtracting the ellipsoid height attained via GPS from the orthometric height and normal height, respectively. Another approach is Sjoberg's equation. We have used of the ICGEM website for definition of the variables of the Sjoberg's equation, as the applied reference model is the EGM2008 global geopotential model and WGS84 reference ellipsoid. The investigations are performed over the stations of the GPS/Leveling network related to three selected areas in desert, mountain and flatland namely the Lout, Zagros and Khuzestan in Iran and afterward the correlation coefficient between the geoid-to-quasigeoid separation calculated using the satellite data in Sjoberg's equation and GPS/Levelling method is estimated. The results indicate a straight correlation between the estimated separations from the two methods as its value for the Lout is 0.754, for the Zagros is 0.497 and for the Khuzestan is 0.659. consequently, using the satellite data in Sjoberg's equation for the regions where there are not the GPS/Levelling and land gravity data, specially for the even areas, yield a satisfactory response of the geoid-to-quasigeoid separation.

TI  - Deforestation and Forest Degradation Due to Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: A 34-Year Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While deforestation rates decline globally they are rising in the Western Amazon. Artisanal-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a large cause of this deforestation and brings with it extensive environmental, social, governance, and public health impacts, including large carbon emissions and mercury pollution. Underlying ASGM is a broad network of factors that influence its growth, distribution, and practices such as poverty, flows of legal and illegal capital, conflicting governance, and global economic trends. Despite its central role in land use and land cover change in the Western Amazon and the severity of its social and environmental impacts, it is relatively poorly studied. While ASGM in Southeastern Peru has been quantified previously, doing so is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the resulting landscape. Using a novel approach to classify mining that relies on a fusion of CLASlite and the Global Forest Change dataset, two Landsat-based deforestation detection tools, we sought to quantify ASGM-caused deforestation in the period 1984-2017 in the southern Peruvian Amazon and examine trends in the geography, methods, and impacts of ASGM across that time. We identify nearly 100,000 ha of deforestation due to ASGM in the 34-year study period, an increase of 21% compared to previous estimates. Further, we find that 10% of that deforestation occurred in 2017, the highest annual amount of deforestation in the study period, with 53% occurring since 2011. Finally, we demonstrate that not all mining is created equal by examining key patterns and changes in ASGM activity and techniques through time and space. We discuss their connections with, and impacts on, socio-economic factors, such as land tenure, infrastructure, international markets, governance efforts, and social and environmental impacts.

TI  - Monitoring the coastal zone using earth observation: application of linear spectral unmixing to coastal dune systems in Wales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal sand dune systems across temperate Europe are presently characterized by a high level of ecological stabilization and a subsequent loss of biological diversity. The use of continuous monitoring within these systems is vital to the preservation of species richness, particularly with regard to the persistence of early stage pioneer species dependent on a strong sediment supply. Linear spectral unmixing was applied to archived Landsat data (1975-2014) and historical aerial photography (1941-1962) for monitoring bare sand (BS) cover dynamics as a proxy for ecological dune stabilization. Using this approach, a time series of change was calculated for Kenfig Burrows, a 6-km(2) stabilized dune system in South Wales, during 1941-2014. The time series indicated that a rapid level of stabilization had occurred within the study area over a period of 75 years. Accuracy assessment of the data indicated the suitability of medium-resolution imagery with an RMSE of <10% across all images and a difference of <3% between observed and predicted BS area. Temporal resolution was found to be a significant factor in the representation of BS cover with fluctuations occurring on a sub-decadal scale, outside of the margin of error introduced through the use of medium-resolution Landsat imagery. This study demonstrates a tractable approach for mapping and monitoring ecologically sensitive regions at a sub-Landsat pixel level.

TI  - New evidence of glacier surges in the Central Andes of Argentina and Chile
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to the large surge-type glacier clusters widely known for several mountain ranges around the world, the presence of surging glaciers in the Andes has been historically seen as marginal. The improved availability of satellite imagery during the last years facilitates investigating of glaciers in more detail even in remote areas. The purpose of the study was therefore to revisit existing information about surge-type glaciers for the Central Andes of Argentina and Chile (32 degrees 40 '-34 degrees 20 ' S), to identify and characterize possible further surge-type glaciers, providing new insights into the mass balance and evolution of the velocity of selected glaciers during the surge phase. Based on the analysis of 1962-2015 satellite imagery, historical aerial images, differencing of digital elevation models and a literature survey, we identified 21 surge-type glaciers in the study area. Eleven surge events and six possible surge-type glaciers were identified and described for the first time. The estimation of annual elevation changes of these glaciers for the 2000-2011 period, which encompasses the latest surge events in the region, showed heterogeneous behavior with strongly negative to positive surface elevation change patterns (-1.1 to +1.0 m yr(-1)). Additionally, we calculated maximum surface velocities of 3 +/- 1.9 m d(-1) and 3.1 +/- 1.1 m d(-1) for two of the glaciers during the latest identifiable surge events of 1985-1987 and 2003-2007. Within this glacier cluster, highly variable advance rates (0.01-1 km yr(-1)) and dissimilar surface velocities at the surge peak (3-35 m d(-1)) were observed. In comparison with other clusters worldwide, surge-type glaciers in the Central Andes are on average smaller and show minor absolute advances. Generally low velocities and the heterogeneous duration of the surge cycles are common between them and glaciers in the Karakorum, a region with similar climatic characteristics and many known surge-type glaciers. As a definitive assertion concerning the underlying surge mechanism of surges in the Central Andes could not be drawn based on the remote sensing data, this opens more detailed research avenues for surge-type glaciers in the region.

TI  - Impact of GVF Derivation Methods on Noah Land Surface Model Simulations and WRF Model Forecasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Green vegetation fraction (GVF) plays a crucial role in the atmosphere-land water and energy exchanges. It is one of the essential parameters in the Noah land surface model (LSM) that serves as the land component of a number of operational numerical weather prediction models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of NOAA. The satellite GVF products used in NCEP models are derived from a simple linear conversion of either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) currently or the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) planned for the near future. Since the NDVI or EVI is a simple spectral index of vegetation cover, GVFs derived from them may lack the biophysical meaning required in the Noah LSM. Moreover, the NDVI- or EVI-based GVF data products may be systematically biased over densely vegetated regions resulting from the saturation issue associated with spectral vegetation indices. On the other hand, the GVF is physically related to the leaf area index (LAI), and thus it could be beneficial to derive GVF from LAI data products. In this paper, the EVI-based and the LAI-based GVF derivation methods are mathematically analyzed and are found to be significantly different from each other. Impacts of GVF differences on the Noah LSM simulations and on weather forecasts of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model are further assessed. Results indicate that LAI-based GVF outperforms the EVI-based one when used in both the offline Noah LSM and WRF Model.

M3  - Article
AB  - The research aims to investigate the pace of rapid urbanization in the mega cities of developing countries. These are facing unprecedented population growth and unplanned rapid urbanization. Pakistan is considered as most urbanized country in Asia. Keeping in view the unplanned urbanization and rapid population growth, study was conducted in metropolitan Lahore which is the second mega city of Pakistan with 82% of urban population to examine the spatiotemporal demographics and land use changes. The secondary data about temporal demographic trends was collected from different government departments and their reports like, Lahore Development Authority (LDA), Cantonment Board Lahore (CBL) Bureau of Statistics Punjab (BOS), Punjab Development Statistics (PDS) and District Census Reports (DCR) Lahore. Spatial primary data was created by geospatial techniques to assess the land use dynamics. 2000 to 2015 Landsat images of 8MSS and 5TM were classified through supervised classification for land use land cover change detection. In-depth interviews were conducted from LDA officials to verify and interpret the temporal population trends and town wise land use land cover changes. Research findings revealed that population of Lahore is continuously rising since 1951 to date due to rural urban migration. The gradual population increase is enhancing civic population density and immense urban sprawl. The research in line with the above-mentioned factors gives the spatial presentation of urban land use land cover changes from 2000 to 2015. The stakeholders should check the alarming speed of urbanization and balance the population agglomeration and land use balance to sustain the city. These perspectives will be helpful to find new way for future project planning and prioritization of the mega cities.

TI  - Automatic Classification of Major Urban Land Covers Based on Novel Spectral Indices
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land cover classification and mapping is an important and ongoing research field in monitoring and managing urban sprawl and terrestrial ecosystems. The changes in land cover largely affect the terrestrial ecosystem, thus information on land cover is important for understanding the ecological environment. Quantification of land cover in urban areas is challenging due to their diversified activities and large spatial and temporal variations. To improve urban land cover classification and mapping, this study presents three new spectral indices and an automated approach to classifying four major urban land types: impervious, bare land, vegetation, and water. A modified normalized difference bare-land index (MNDBI) is proposed to enhance the separation of impervious and bare land. A tasseled cap water and vegetation index (TCWVI) is proposed to enhance the detection of vegetation and water areas. A shadow index (ShDI) is proposed to further improve water detection by separating water from shadows. An approach for optimizing the thresholds of the new indices is also developed. Finally, the optimized thresholds are used to classify land covers using a decision tree algorithm. Using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data from two study sites (Hong Kong and Dhaka City, Bangladesh) with different urban characteristics, the proposed approach is systematically evaluated. Spectral separability analysis of the new indices is performed and compared with other common indices. The urban land cover classifications achieved by the proposed approach are compared with those of the classic support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The proposed approach achieves an overall classification accuracy of 94-96%, which is superior to the accuracy of the SVM algorithm.

AB  - Augmented information (AgI) services allow users to consume information that results from the execution of a chain of service functions that process source information to create real-time augmented value. Applications include real-time analysis of remote sensing data, real-time computer vision, personalized video streaming, and augmented reality, among others. We consider the problem of optimal distribution of AgI services over a wireless computing network, in which nodes are equipped with both communication and computing resources. We characterize the wireless computing network capacity region and design a joint flow scheduling and resource allocation algorithm that stabilizes the underlying queuing system while achieving a network cost arbitrarily close to the minimum, with a trade off in network delay. Our solution captures the unique chaining and flow scaling aspects of AgI services while exploiting the use of the broadcast approach coding scheme over the wireless channel.

TI  - An LM-BP Neural Network Approach to Estimate Monthly-Mean Daily Global Solar Radiation Using MODIS Atmospheric Products
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy is one of the most widely used renewable energy sources in the world and its development and utilization are being integrated into people's lives. Therefore, accurate solar radiation data are of great significance for site-selection of photovoltaic (PV) power generation, design of solar furnaces and energy-efficient buildings. Practically, it is challenging to get accurate solar radiation data because of scarce and uneven distribution of ground-based observation sites throughout the country. Many artificial neural network (ANN) estimation models are therefore developed to estimate solar radiation, but the existing ANN models are mostly based on conventional meteorological data; clouds, aerosols, and water vapor are rarely considered because of a lack of instrumental observations at the conventional meteorological stations. Based on clouds, aerosols, and precipitable water-vapor data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), along with conventional meteorological data, back-propagation (BP) neural network method was developed in this work with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm (referred to as LM-BP) to simulate monthly-mean daily global solar radiation (M-GSR). Comparisons were carried out among three M-GSR estimates, including the one presented in this study, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and remotely-sensed radiation products by Cloud and the Earth's radiation energy system (CERES). The validation results indicate that the accuracy of the ANN model is better than that of the MLR model and CERES radiation products, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.34 MJm(-2) (ANN), 2.46 MJm(-2) (MLR), 2.11 MJm(-2) (CERES), respectively. Finally, according to the established ANN-based method, the M-GSR of 36 conventional meteorological stations for 12 months was estimated in 2012 in the study area. Solar radiation data based on the LM-BP method of this study can provide some reference for the utilization of solar and heat energy.

TI  - Exploring the potential of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance in coastal and inland water applications: A simple aerosol correction method and its merits
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction methods that are designed for either ocean color or land applications often result in low quality or even no surface reflectance data for coastal and inland waters. In contrast, Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) has been used in water applications, although without removing aerosol scattering. However, a systematic effort has not been made to investigate the uncertainties and applicability of R-rc in ocean color studies. This knowledge gap was filled in this study by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data covering a large area (almost the entire middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin and the Yangtze River Estuary) between 2002 and 2016. We first examined the correlation between a quality-controlled reflectance product that was generated using a shortwave-infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction method (Rrs-swir) and R-rc. Improved relationships between these two products were found for all MODIS bands if a subtraction of the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at 1240-nm was utilized as the aerosol correction for R-rc (Rrc- (1240)). The robust correlations between the two products allow for Rrs-swir to be replaced with Rrc-1240-converted reflectance (denoted as Rrs-rrc-1240) in water applications. In situ validations further demonstrated that the accuracy levels between usable Rrs-rrc-1240 and Rrs-swir data are comparable for most MODIS wavelengths. The most striking superiority of Rrs-frc-1240 over Rrs-swir is the pronounced increase in data coverage (especially for small water bodies), where the percentages of usable observations (PUOs) of the former are several times to more than one order of magnitude higher than those of the latter. The differences in PUOs were mostly due to perturbations related to land adjacency effects (LAEs) in the SWIR-based atmospheric correction. Such effects could also explain the reduced PUOs for smaller water bodies. Ocean color applications in the examined regions could benefit from such a dramatic increase in PUOs, which could enhance the capability of tracking short- to long-term dynamics and could create new possibilities for inland water system monitoring at the basin scale.

AB  - BackgroundMale breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease for which no randomised controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted to determine optimal surgical management. The available data have been reviewed to identify reasonable options and reveal areas in need of investigation.MethodsAll published series on the surgical management of MBC have been reviewed to determine approaches to treatment of the primary, the breast and the axilla together with the psychological sequelae of surgery.FindingsMastectomy is still the major surgical offer but a convincing case can be made for the use of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in order to facilitate breast conserving surgery. Sentinel node biopsy has been successfully used for staging MBC although nomograms for prediction of nodal status are inadequately calibrated. There are psychological sequelae of mastectomy in males and as yet no evidence that the needs of those with MBC are being met.ConclusionsCollaborative studies are required so that men can participate in meaningful RCTs to provide an evidence-based rational foundation for the surgery of MBC.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Studies over the past two decades have shown heart regeneration in zebrafish to be a dynamic process, choreographed by multiple cell types. In particular, recent work has identified revascularization of the wound to be a sentinel event during heart regeneration. The cardiac endothelium has emerged as a key orchestrator of heart regeneration, influencing cardiomyocyte hyperplasia and tissue morphogenesis. Here, we review how the coronary vasculature regenerates after injury, how signaling pathways link the cardiac endothelium to heart regeneration, and how understanding these signaling dynamics can lead to targeted therapies for heart regeneration.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Using Hierarchical Multimodal Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The generative semantic nature of probabilistic topic models has recently shown encouraging results within the remote sensing image fusion field when conducting land cover categorization. However, standard topic models have not yet been adapted to the inherent complexity of remotely sensed data, which eventually may limit their resulting performance. In this scenario, this paper presents a new topic-based image fusion framework, specially designed to fuse synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imaging (MSI) data for unsupervised land cover categorization tasks. Specifically, we initially propose a hierarchical multi-modal probabilistic latent semantic analysis (HMpLSA) model that takes advantage of two different vocabulary modalities, as well as two different levels of topics, in order to effectively uncover intersensor semantic patterns. Then, we define an SAR and MSI data fusion framework based on HMpLSA in order to perform unsupervised land cover categorization. Our experiments, conducted using three different SAR and MSI data sets, reveal that the proposed approach is able to provide competitive advantages with respect to standard clustering methods and topic models, as well as several multimodal topic model variants available in the literature.

TI  - Use of MSI/Sentinel-2 and airborne LiDAR data for mapping vegetation and studying the relationships with soil attributes in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga is an important ecosystem in the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil and a natural laboratory for the study of plant adaptation to seasonal water stress or prolonged droughts. The soil water availability for plants depends on plant root depth and soil properties. Here, we combined for the first time the remote sensing classification of Caatinga physiognomies with soil information derived from geostatistical analysis to relate vegetation distribution with physico-chemical attributes of soils. We evaluated the potential of multi-temporal data acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 for Random Forest (RF) classification of seven physiognomies. In addition, we analyzed the contribution of airborne LiDAR metrics to improve classification accuracy compared to six vegetation indices (VIs) and 10 reflectance bands from the MSI instrument. Using a detailed soil survey, the spatial distribution of the vegetation physiognomies mapped by RF was associated with the variability of 20 physico-chemical attributes of 75 soil profiles submitted to principal components analysis (PCA) and ordinary kriging. The results showed gains in overall classification accuracy with use of the multi temporal data over the mono-temporal observations. Gains in classification of arboreous Caatinga were also observed after the insertion of LiDAR metrics in the analysis, especially the percentage of vegetation cover with height greater than 5 m, the terrain elevation and the standard deviation of vegetation height. Overall, the most important metrics for classification were the VIs, especially the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII-1), Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The most important MSI/Sentinel-2 bands were positioned in the red-edge spectral interval. From PCA, soil attributes responsible for most of the data variance were related to soil fertility, soil depth and rock fragments in the surface horizon. The amounts of gravels and pebbles were factors of physiognomic variability with shrub and sub-shrub Caatinga occurring preferentially over shallow and stony soils. By contrast, arboreous Caatinga occurred over soils with total profile depth greater than 1 m. Finally, areas of sub-shrub Caatinga had greater values of cation exchange capacity (CEC) and water retention at field capacity than areas of arboreous Caatinga. The differences were statistically significant at 95% confidence level, as indicated by Mann-Whitney U tests.

TI  - Large-Scale Spatial Modeling of Crop Coefficient and Biomass Production in Agroecosystems in Southeast Brazil
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 images at 10-m resolution were used for modeling crop coefficients and biomass production with the application of the so-called SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) and Monteith model for biomass production in an area nearby the city of aguas de Santa Barbara, in the central-western part of SAo Paulo State, Brazil, which presents a vast agricultural landscape mosaic, to analyze the effects of the end of the recent ENSO's (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) most active period (2016/2017) and its posteriori effects on vegetation (until early 2018). Surface albedo, temperature, net radiation, and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from the main land uses were extracted to process microclimatic comparisons. Crop coefficient (dimensionless) and biomass production (kgha(-1)day(-1)) ranges for the period studied were 0.92-1.35 and 22-104 kgha(-1)day(-1) (in the area occupied by sugarcane crop), 0.56-0.94 and 15-73 kgha(-1)day(-1) (pasture), 1.17-1.56 and 25-210 kgha(-1)day(-1) (silviculture), and 1.05-1.36 and 30-134 kgha(-1)day(-1) (forest). According to the spatial and temporal consistencies, and after comparison with previous point and large-scale studies with similar climatic and thermal conditions, the SAFER and Monteith modelsshowed the ability to quantify and differentiate the large-scale crop coefficients and biomass production of different land uses in the southeast Brazil region. The SAFER algorithm with Sentinel-2 images obtained crop coefficients that indicated plant growth stages and local thermohydrological conditions at a 10-m resolution. The results are important for land use, crop yield and reforestation planning, and for water management plans for actual and future water demand scenarios, and this methodology is useful for monitoring rural and water parameters, and for precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Facility-level changes in receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder: Implications for implementation science
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The U.S. is facing an opioid epidemic, but despite mandates for pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder to be available at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, the majority of veterans with opioid use disorder do not receive these medications. In implementation research, facilities are often targeted for qualitative inquiry or quality improvement efforts based on quality measure performance during a one-year period. However, sites that experience quality performance changes from one year to the next. may be highly informative because mechanisms that impact facility change may be more discoverable. The current study examined changes in receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder in a national healthcare system to determine the extent to which sites fluctuated in performance over a two-year period and illustrate how changes in quality measures over time may be useful for implementation research and healthcare surveillance of quality measures.Methods: Using national VHA data from Fiscal Years (FY) 2016 and 2017, we calculated quality measure performance as the number of patients who received pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) divided by the number of patients with a current non-remitted opioid use disorder diagnosis for each FY at each facility (n = 129) and examined change from FY16 to FY17.Results: The mean rate of receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder was 38% (facility range = 3% to 74%) in FY16 and 41% (facility range = 2% to 76%) in FY17. The average facility-level change in performance was 3% and ranged from 19% to 26%. There were 32 facilities that decreased in provision of pharmacotherapy, 12 facilities with no change, and 85 facilities that increased.Conclusions: For facilities with average or high performance, it was difficult to maintain their performance over time. Identifying and learning from facilities with recent fluctuations may be more informative to guide the design of future quality improvement efforts than studying facilities with stable high or low performance.

TI  - Radiographic Assessment of the Popliteal Lymph Node to Aid the Differentiation of Canine Stifle Osteosarcoma From Moderate to Severe Stifle Degenerative Joint Disease
T2  - TOPICS IN COMPANION ANIMAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Degenerative joint disease of the stifle is a common canine osseous pathology. Early degenerative changes may show mild mineral proliferation of periarticular margins with soft tissue, resulting in joint distension. If the joint is chronically unstable, osseous changes become more complex. Moderate to severe stifle degenerative disease then transitions to a combination of bony proliferation and resorption as subchondral cystic changes develop. The radiographic descriptions of moderate to severe degenerative disease overlap with those of subtle aggressive disease. If this occurs in a location prone to primary bone tumors, like the distal femur, radiographic interpretation becomes difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of objectively assessing the popliteal lymph node size and shape on radiographs to differentiate moderate to severe stifle degenerative joint disease from distal femoral or tibial osteosarcoma. Stifle radiographs were acquired for evaluation of pelvic lameness localized to the stifle joint. Dogs with moderate to severe degenerative stifle joint disease were radiographed at 3 time points: prior to surgery for a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (103), immediately postoperation (103), and at a recheck 6-8 weeks postsurgery (62). Dogs with osteosarcoma were radiographed only at time of diagnosis (42). Length and width gross popliteal lymph node measurements and a ratio of long axis to short axis were compared between groups using nonparametric analysis. No significant difference was determined using a long axis to short axis ratio for the popliteal lymph node to differentiate moderate to severe stifle degenerative joint disease and osteosarcoma (P = .290). The gross measurements of the long axis and short axis of the popliteal lymph node for dogs with osteosarcoma were significantly greater than the degenerative joint disease groups (P = .017, P = .000). Thus, evaluation of a long axis to short axis ratio for popliteal lymph nodes does not provide a clinically useful objective measure in differentiating peristifle osteosarcoma from moderate to severe degenerative disease of the stifle joint. The length and width of the popliteal lymph node differed significantly; however, the clinical difference is minimal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Where Are We Going with Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Gynecologic Cancers?
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is a standard of care for lymphatic assessment of many early-stage gynecologic malignancies. We review the current data, emphasizing the utility of SLN mapping in the management of gynecologic cancers.Recent Findings: Endometrial cancer: recent studies have focused on confirming the safety and efficacy of SLN mapping for high-risk patients. Cervical cancer: the LACC Trial demonstrated reduced survival with minimally invasive surgery, calling into question the validity of prior studies evaluating SLN mapping with a minimally invasive approach. Vulvar cancer: the ongoing GROINS-V-II trial is investigating whether patients with SLN metastasis < 2 mm in diameter can safely undergo adjuvant radiation +/- chemotherapy without completion inguinal lymphadenectomy. NCCN guidelines have incorporated SLN mapping as a lymphatic assessment strategy for endometrial, cervical, and vulvar malignancies. SLN mapping appears to reduce morbidity while still maintaining an appropriate detection rate of lymphatic metastasis. Additional clinical trials will further our knowledge of these procedures.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration over the Central Arizona Irrigation and Drainage District, USA
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of baseline water use for irrigated crops in the U.S. Southwest is important for understanding how much water is consumed under normal farm management and to help manage scarce resources. Remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET) is an effective way to gain that knowledge: multispectral data can provide synoptic and time-repetitive estimates of crop-specific water use, and could be especially useful for this arid region because of dominantly clear skies and minimal precipitation. Although multiple remote sensing ET approaches have been developed and tested, there is not consensus on which of them should be preferred because there are still few intercomparison studies within this environment. To help build the experience needed to gain consensus, a remote sensing study using three ET models was conducted over the Central Arizona Irrigation and Drainage District (CAIDD). Aggregated ET was assessed for 137 wheat plots (winter/spring crop), 183 cotton plots (summer crop), and 225 alfalfa plots (year-round). The employed models were the Satellite-Based Energy Balance for Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB), and Vegetation Index ET for the US Southwest (VISW). Remote sensing data were principally Landsat 5, supplemented by Landsat 7, MODIS Terra, MODIS Aqua, and ASTER. Using district-wide model averages, seasonal use (excluding surface evaporation) was 742 mm for wheat, 983 mm for cotton, and 1427 mm for alfalfa. All three models produced similar daily ET for wheat, with 6-8 mm/day mid-season. Model estimates diverged for cotton and alfalfa sites. Considering ET over cotton, TSEB estimates were 9.5 mm/day, METRIC 6 mm/day, and VISW 8 mm/day. For alfalfa, the ET values from TSEB were 8.0 mm/day, METRIC 5 mm/day, and VISW 6 mm/day. Lack of local validation information unfortunately made it impossible to rank model performance. However, by averaging results from all of them, ET model outliers could be identified. They ranged from -10% to +18%, values that represent expected ET modeling discrepancies. Relative to the model average, standardized ET-estimators-potential ET (ET), FAO-56 ET, and USDA-SW gravimetric-ET-showed still greater deviations, up to 35% of annual crop water use for summer and year-round crops, suggesting that remote sensing of actual ET could lead to significantly improved estimates of crop water use. Results from this study highlight the need for conducting multi-model experiments during summer-months over sites with independent ground validation.

TI  - Community-Based Dietician Services for People With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) experience significantly poorer health outcomes and a shorter life expectancy when compared to the general population. People with I/DD are also more likely to become over weight or develop obesity because of poor nutrition and lack of education. Due to the health disparities that people with I/DD experience and the high prevalence of developing obesity it is important that preventive health measures, such as cost-effective nutrition interventions and services, are readily available. The aim of this study is to explore how Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) 1915(c) waivers-the largest providers of long-term services and supports for people with I/DD-across the United States provided dietician services for people with I/DD. This study analyzed fiscal year (FY) 2015 HCBS waivers for people with I/DD from across the United States (n = 111) to determine how dietary services were provided, particularly focusing on service utilization and expenditures, including unduplicated participants, total projected spending, average spending per participant, reimbursement rates, and average annual service provision per participant. Services' definitions were also analyzed for trends. We found that dietician services were not widely provided in HCBS waivers-less than 1% of the approximately 630,000 people with I/DD supported by HCBS waivers in FY 2015 were projected to receive dietician services. Moreover, despite being useful for health promotion, 0.01% of FY 2015 funding ($26.5 billion) was projected for dietician services. There was also a lack of consistency across states and services. People with I/DD who do not receive support services are less likely to engage in health services or health promotion activities and more likely to develop secondary conditions; for this reason, it is imperative that states utilize HCBS waivers to provide dietician services.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 Data for Monitoring Temperate Mixed Forest Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the potential of Sentinel-1 data to seasonally monitor temperate forests was investigated by analyzing radar signatures observed from plots in the Fontainebleau Forest of the Ile de France region, France, for the period extending from March 2015 to January 2016. Radar backscattering coefficients, sigma(0) and the amplitude of temporal interferometric coherence profiles in relation to environmental variables are shown, such as in situ precipitation and air temperature. The high temporal frequency of Sentinel-1 acquisitions (i.e., twelve days, or six, if both Sentinel-1A and B are combined over Europe) and the dual polarization configuration (VV and VH over most land surfaces) made a significant contribution. In particular, the radar backscattering coefficient ratio of VV to VH polarization, sigma(0)(VV)/sigma(0)(VH), showed a well-pronounced seasonality that was correlated with vegetation phenology, as confirmed in comparison to NDVI profiles derived from Landsat-8 (r = 0.77) over stands of deciduous trees. These results illustrate the high potential of Sentinel-1 data for monitoring vegetation, and as these data are not sensitive to the atmosphere, the phenology could be estimated with more accuracy than optical data. These observations will be quantitatively analyzed with the use of electromagnetic models in the near future.

TI  - WSF-NET: Weakly Supervised Feature-Fusion Network for Binary Segmentation in Remote Sensing Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Binary segmentation in remote sensing aims to obtain binary prediction mask classifying each pixel in the given image. Deep learning methods have shown outstanding performance in this task. These existing methods in fully supervised manner need massive high-quality datasets with manual pixel-level annotations. However, the annotations are generally expensive and sometimes unreliable. Recently, using only image-level annotations, weakly supervised methods have proven to be effective in natural imagery, which significantly reduce the dependence on manual fine labeling. In this paper, we review existing methods and propose a novel weakly supervised binary segmentation framework, which is capable of addressing the issue of class imbalance via a balanced binary training strategy. Besides, a weakly supervised feature-fusion network (WSF-Net) is introduced to adapt to the unique characteristics of objects in remote sensing image. The experiments were implemented on two challenging remote sensing datasets: Water dataset and Cloud dataset. Water dataset is acquired by Google Earth with a resolution of 0.5 m, and Cloud dataset is acquired by Gaofen-1 satellite with a resolution of 16 m. The results demonstrate that using only image-level annotations, our method can achieve comparable results to fully supervised methods.

TI  - Variability in annual temperature cycle in the urban areas of the United States as revealed by MODIS imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its large spatial coverage and frequent revisit, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) has been recently used to explore annual temperature cycle (ATC) variations at regional and global scales. However, variability in seasonality of LSTs has not been examined in detail, particularly in urban areas where elevated temperatures are normally observed. By assuming repetitive temperature cycles, this study aims to reveal differences in ATC parameters between urban and rural areas and the impacts of surface urban heat island (UHI) on the ATC range over the continental United States. To this end, urban areas of larger than 10 km(2) (a total of 1856 urban polygons) in the continental United States were identified from the map of urban extents produced by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data from 2012. The corresponding rural polygons of the same size were generated by using a buffer method. The ATC parameters were optimized using a sinusoidal function fitted with the 8-day MODIS LST composite data. Results showed that urban and rural areas exhibited a significant difference, with a p-value < 0.01, in the ATC parameters, including mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude of surface temperature (YAST), and the revised phase shift parameter. The higher MAST and YAST, but lower phase shift values, were mainly associated with the urban areas. This finding indicated that urban areas contributed to changes in extreme temperatures (the minimum and maximum temperatures) as well as to an overall warming. The regression analysis suggested that surface UHI intensities were positively correlated with the differences in MAST (R-2 = 0.9) and YAST (R-2 = 0.5) between urban and rural areas, but negatively correlated (R-2 = 0.2) with the differences in the revised phase shift parameter. In addition, highest surface UHIs (similar to 3 k) and largest differences in ATC parameters were observed in tropical regions, followed by temperature zones, continental (cold) zones, and arid zones. Overall, this study revealed that urbanization-induced land cover changes could influence urban systems by enhancing temperature variations. However, it should be cautioned that uncertainty in the analysis may arise from the characterization of surface UHIs for the selected similar to 2000 cities with varying configuration and morphological dimensions.

TI  - Clinical Significance of Circumferential Aneurysmal Wall Enhancement in Symptomatic Patients with Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms: aHigh-resolution MRI Study
T2  - CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose The estimates on the risk of rupture of intracranial aneurysms remain acontroversial topic. Circumferential aneurysmal wall enhancement (CAWE) on vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been described in unstable aneurysms. Sentinel headaches and third nerve palsy are possible symptoms prior to the rupture of intracranial aneurysms. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that CAWE could be associated with these symptoms.Methods We performed aretrospective analysis of consecutive symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who were examined by high-resolution MRI from October 2014 to November 2016. Two experienced neurovascular radiologists read the images independently and determined whether there was CAWE of the unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Then, we compared variable factors between patients with and without symptoms through univariate comparison and multivariable logistic regression analyses.Results A total of 45 unruptured intracranial aneurysms were detected in 37 patients. The agreement between 2 experienced readers for CAWE was good (kappa=0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.99). CAWE of unruptured intracranial aneurysm was more frequently observed in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (16/23, 69.6% versus 6/22, 27.3%, respectively, P < 0.05). The CAWE was the only independent factor associated with symptoms in the multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 5.17; 95% confidence interval 1.30-20.52; P = 0.02).Conclusions Our study demonstrates that CAWE correlated with sentinel headaches and third nerve palsy caused by unruptured aneurysms, and this may be an additional clue to distinguish the cause of these symptoms.

TI  - Evaluation of Switching Patterns in FDA's Sentinel System: A New Tool to Assess Generic Drugs
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionNearly 90% of drugs dispensed in the US are generic products.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to develop and implement a tool for analyzing manufacturer-level drug utilization and switching patterns within the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel system.MethodsA descriptive tool was designed to analyze data in the Sentinel common data model and was tested with two case studiesmetoprolol extended release (ER) and lamotrigine ERusing claims data from four Sentinel data partners. We plotted initiators of each brand and generic product over time. For metoprolol ER, we evaluated rates of switching from generics around the time of manufacturing issues. For lamotrigine ER, we examined rates of switching back to the brand among those who switched from brand to generic.ResultsWe identified 1,651,285 initiators of metoprolol ER products between July 2008 and September 2015. We observed a large decrease in monthly metoprolol ER initiators (from 25,465 in December 2008 to 13,128 in February 2009), corresponding to recalls by generic manufacturers. We observed simultaneous increases in utilization of the authorized generic and brand products. We identified 4266 initiators of lamotrigine ER with an epilepsy diagnosis between January 2012 and September 2015. Among those who switched from brand to generic, the cumulative incidence of switching back was close to 20% at 2years. Switchback rates were higher for the first available generic products.ConclusionsThis developed tool was able to elucidate novel utilization and switching patterns in two case studies. Such information can be used to support surveillance of generic drugs and biosimilars.

TI  - Impact of land degradation from mining activities on the sediment fluxes in two large rivers of French Guiana
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed two contrasting catchments located among the world's largest unspoiled tropical rainforests impacted by mining in the northeastern coastlands of South America. We used the following: (a) mining, agricultural, and urbanized areas to compare the land use evolution with suspended sediments and sediment yields; (b) field monthly river suspended sediments in the two catchments (2004-2015: n = 154); (c) MODIS remote sensing water color technique in the Maroni basin to complete (n = 387) and extend field suspended sediment sampling from 2000 to 2015; (d) hydroclimatic statistical analysis conditions and sediment concentrations to identify the long-term trends, the abrupt changes in time series and to analyze if the environmental and anthropogenic factors control sediment yield regional variations. No significant long-term changes were observed in precipitation or water discharge with the Mann-Kendall test. However, the mean suspended sediment concentration has increased significantly (239%) in the Maroni River with a breakpoint in 2009 and decreased (33%) in the Oyapock River (breakpoint in 2008). These differences are explained by the larger percentage of deforestation because of mining activities in the Maroni (0.37%) than in the Oyapock (0.06%) catchment. In the Maroni River, the increasing sediment yield trend (2000-2015) coincide significantly (r2 = 0.97; p < 0.0001) with the increase of 400% of mining areas, whereas no significant relationship with the runoff was found. In the Oyapock River, the runoff explains the sediment yield decreasing trend (r2 = 0.82; p < 0.0001) and no relationship with the land use change was found.

TI  - Japan-Centrism Discourse and the Research on Chinese Mythology: A Study on the Views of Kokugaku on Mythology in Edo Period
T2  - TAIWAN JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Edo period, scholars of Japanese National Learning (Kokugaku, originating from Japanese classical studies) examined thoroughly and elaborated Chinese mythology in the making of Japan-centrism discourse. Such attention to Chinese mythology began with Motoori Norinaga. He claimed Japanese mythology as orthodox and Chinese mythology as the "false version" of it. Hirata Atutane, a disciple of Motoori Norinaga, based on Motoori's idea, collected various kinds of Taoist myths in order to compile a reasonable narrative of Japanese mythology. His interpretations of Chinese ancient emperors, Ten Continents and Three islands, and the creation of civilization strengthened the faith that Japan was the center of the world. Hirata's research on Chinese mythology had a significant influence on the worldview of the succeeding scholars of Japanese National Learning. Take Ookuni Takamasa as an example. Ookuni also treated Chinese mythology as important materials that could be used to emphasize the holiness of Japan when he confronted the military and cultural invasion from the West at the end of Edo period. Chinese mythology, which took its shape based on Chinese civilization, was converted into narrative materials to support Kokugaku scholars' Japan-centrism discourse.

AB  - Death, and its attributes related to weaving, spinning, or destiny, for example. In the studies of ancient Peru they have hardly been investigated. There are investigations, about the remains in funeral contexts, about the figure of Supay, or beings from the underworld, but, really, there is not a work that has made a "fabric" with those characteristics that have great similarity, and that outline the Death, and her attributes as a weaver of destiny, for example. What's more, what do we know about a deity or deities associated with death, attributes, qualities, related to the fabric and temporality? In general, studies on the characteristics of a deity have hardly been developed in this area, we will explain that there really are enough characteristics to speak of death as a deity, with a series of characteristics that enrich the studies on pre-Hispanic worldview of ancient Peru.

TI  - Sequential nonlinear estimation: regularized particle filter applied to the attitude estimation problem with real data
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL & APPLIED MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to analyze the robustness and computational effort of particle filter when applied to the attitude and gyro bias estimation problem. The particle filter is based on the sampling method for sequential importance, in which the basic idea is to represent the density function posteriori by a set of random samples (particles) associated with their respective weights. However, after a few interactions, degeneration of particles may occur. To avoid degeneration, the regularized version of the particle filter was applied. In such estimator, the particles with lower weight are discarded and those with greater weight give rise to new particles close to the areas of the highest probability. For analysis, the attitude dynamical model is described by quaternions, and the observation vector, composed by real data of attitude sensors that are on board the CBERS-2 (China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite). The attitude sensors available are digital sun sensor, infrared Earth sensor, and mechanical gyros. The attitude and bias of gyro estimated by the regularized particle filter are compared with the unscented Kalman filter and the results show that for systems that do not have a high degree of nonlinearity, and under consideration of real data, the unscented Kalman filter has shown better performance than the regularized particle filter.

TI  - C3 glomerulonephritis secondary to mutations in factors H and I: rapid recurrence in deceased donor kidney transplant effectively treated with eculizumab
T2  - NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) is caused by alternate complement pathway over-activation. It frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease, recurs in two-thirds of transplants and in half of these cases progresses to allograft loss. There is currently no proven treatment for C3GN.Case Presentation. We describe a family segregating pathogenic alleles of complement factor H and I (CFH and CFI). The only member carrying both mutations developed C3GN. Prolonged delayed graft function after deceased donor transplantation, heavy proteinuria and isolated C3 hypocomplementemia prompted an allograft biopsy confirming diagnosis of recurrent C3GN.Discussion. This is the first report of early recurrence of C3GN in an allograft in a patient with known mutations in complement regulatory genes and no preexisting para-proteinemia. Complement activation resulting from ischemia-reperfusion injury from prolonged cold ischemia time unabated in the setting of deficiency of two major complement regulators likely led to the early and severe recurrence. In atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, the terminal complement cascade activation in the sentinel event initiating endothelial injury; blockade at the level of C5 convertase with eculizumab is uniformly highly effective in management. C3 glomerulopathies (C3GN and dense deposit disease) are a more complex and heterogeneous group. The relative degree of dysregulation at the levels of C3 and C5 convertases and therefore response to eculizumab varies among patients. In our patient, the clinical response to eculizumab was dramatic with recovery of allograft function and complete resolution of proteinuria. We review all cases of recurrent C3 glomerulopathy treated with eculizumab and discuss how complement biomarkers may aid in predicting response to therapy.

TI  - High-Resolution Observations and Tracking of a Dual-Core Anticyclonic Eddy in the Algerian Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea have been investigated for years, and anticyclonic eddies are regularly observed features in the Algerian Basin. Here we used the AMEDA eddy detection algorithm to track and monitor a particular anticyclonic eddy from its birth to its death. The analysis of remote sensing data sets (AVISO and sea surface temperature) revealed that this anticyclone split from an Algerian eddy, in October 2015, interacted with the North Balearic Front and merged 7months later, in May 2016, with a similar Algerian eddy. In early spring 2016, a field experiment during the ProtevsMed 2016 cruise thoroughly investigated this eddy, when it was located near the North Balearic Front, taking high-resolution (Seasoar) hydrological transects, several Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Profiler measurements. In addition, four drifting buoys were released in the eddy core. These in situ measurements revealed that the vertical structure of this anticyclone was made of two water lenses of very different origins (Atlantic Water above and Western Intermediate Water below) spinning together. In the vicinity of the North Balearic Front, which may act as a dynamical barrier to such oceanic structures, the eddy interacted with a subsurface anticyclonic eddy made of modal water, which fostered cross-front exchanges generating filaments by stirring. The high-resolution sampling revealed fine-scale structures both adjacent to the eddy and within its core.Plain Language Summary A persistent eddy was observed during a scientific cruise in the western Mediterranean Sea. Eddies are spinning water masses with particular characteristics. Using satellite data, it was possible to track the eddy for several months. Thanks to an undulating towed vehicle, the eddy studied here revealed an unexpected structure: it was formed of two superposed water masses of very different origins. The warmer water mass came from the Atlantic Ocean, and the colder one was created in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, in winter. In this study, we explore how these different water masses joined and yet retained their individual characteristics for a relatively long time.

TI  - Modeling alpine grassland cover based on MODIS data and support vector machine regression in the headwater region of the Huanghe River, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in grassland cover is essential in assessment of grassland health as well as the effects of anthropogenic interventions and global climate change on grassland ecosystems. Remote sensing is an effective approach for providing rapid and dynamic monitoring of vegetation cover over large grassland areas. In this study, four types of remote sensing retrieval models (i.e., pixel dichotomy models, univariate vegetation index (VI) regression models, multivariate regression models, and a support vector machine (SVM) model) are built to derive grassland cover based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the measured grassland cover data collected by unmanned aerial vehicle during the grassland peak growing season from 2014 to 2016. The optimal model is then used to map the spatial distribution of grassland cover and its dynamic change in the headwater region of the Huanghe River (Yellow River) (HRHR) of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau over the 16 years period (2001 to 2016). The results show that (1) the pixel dichotomy models based on MODIS VI data are inappropriate for estimating grassland cover in the HRHR when their endmembers (VIsoil and VIved are determined based only on the MODIS data; (2) the multivariate regression models present better performance than the univariate VI (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) models; (3) MODIS NDVI outperforms MODIS EVI for modeling grassland cover in the study area; (4) the SVM model based on nine factors is the optimal model (R-2: 0.75 and RMSE: 6.85%) for monitoring alpine grassland cover in the study area; and (5) majority of the grassland area (59.9%) of the HRHR showed increase in yearly maximum grassland cover from 2001 to 2016, while the average yearly maximum grassland cover for the 16 years exhibited a generally increasing trend from west to east and from north to south. This study provides a more suitable remote sensing inversion model to greatly improve the accuracy of modeling alpine grassland cover in the HRHR, and to better assess grassland health status and the impacts of warming climate to grasslands in regions of remote and harsh environments.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - VITO Remote Sensing, Bruges, BELGIUM
AB  - Increased discrimination capability provided by polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) sensors compared to single and dual polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can improve land use monitoring and change detection. This necessitates reliable change detectionmethods in multitemporal PolSAR datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised change detection algorithm for multilook PolSAR data. In the first step of the method, the Hotelling-Lawley trace (HLT) statistic is applied to measure the similarity of two multilook covariance matrices. As a result of this step, a scalar test statistic image is generated. Then, in the second step, a generalized Kittler and Illingworth (K&I) minimum-error thresholding algorithm is developed to perform on the test statistic image and discriminate between changed and unchanged areas. The K&I thresholding algorithm is based on the generalized Gamma distribution for statistical modeling of change and no-change classes. The proposed methodology is tested on a simulated PolSAR data and two C-band fully PolSAR datasets acquired by the uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR and RADARSAT-2 SAR satellites. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm accurately discriminates between change and no-change areas providing detection results with noticeably lower error rates and higher detection accuracy values compared to those of a CFAR-type thresholding of the HLT statistic. Also, the performance of the HLT statistic compared to the other statistics applied on the multilook polarimetric SAR data is assessed. Goodness-of-fit test results prove that the estimated generalized Gamma class conditional models adequately fit the corresponding change and no-change classes.

TI  - Soil organic carbon and texture retrieving and mapping using proximal, airborne and Sentinel-2 spectral imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a useful representative of soil fertility and an essential parameter in controlling the dynamics of various agrochemicals in soil. Soil texture is also used to calculate soil's ability to retain water for plant growth. SOC and soil texture are thus important parameters of agricultural soils and need to be regularly monitored. Optical satellite remote sensing offers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel 2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airborne hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airborne and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airborne and spaceborne datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airborne sensors. Taken across all SOC levels measured in the reference data, Sentinel-2 results were marginally lower than lab spectroscopy and airborne imagery, but this reduction in precision may be offset by the extensive geographical coverage and more frequent revisit characteristic of satellite observation. The increased temporal revisit and area are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality information on variations in SOC and clay content of bare soils.

TI  - Analyzing risk factors for shrinkage and transformation of East Kolkata Wetland, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Kolkata Wetland, called the 'kidney' of city Kolkata has now become a significant issue for its gradual loss and modification of anthropogenic activities. A socioeconomic elucidation had been used in this article through the analysis using GIS and field observation. Changes of wetland area have been determined from 1991 to 2017 with Landsat images and accuracy assessment through ground truth verification. It is seen that loss of wetland from 1991 to 2001 was 23.55% where it was 7.34% in 2011 to 2017, mainly due to the result of land transformation for aquaculture activity. Hence, three phases of degradation have been observed in this study, these are: the phase of rapid degradation, the phase of controlled degradation and phase of transforming degraded. At the same time, it's highlighted the loophole of management actions. A multi-criteria analysis technique with the analytic hierarchy process has been applied to determine the risk factors of wetland degradation and it is seen that expansion of built-up area, encroachment of cropland, the transformation of wetland into fishing ponds are responsible for wetland degradation. In the conclusion, it highlights the approaches of land developers and real estate agents in their wetland hunting process and emergence consequences on the environment as well as conserving approaches for sustainable management.

AB  - ObjectivesTo provide estimates of the prevalence of chronic conditions in Swiss primary care.MethodsIn total, 175 general practitioners (GP) or pediatricians (PED) reporting to the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network collected morbidity data.ResultsIn 26,853 patient contacts, mean (SD) age was 55.821.6 or 6.1 +/- 5.7years (in GPs vs. PEDs, respectively) and 47% were males. In GP patients, median Thurgau Morbidity Index was 2 (IQR 1-3). The median numbers of chronic conditions and permanently used prescribed drugs were 2 (0-5) and 2 (1-4), respectively; in PEDs medians were 0. Out of all patients, 16.7 and 7.0% of the PED patients were hospitalized during the previous year; patients cared by family/proxies or community nurses were hospitalized significantly more often than patients living in homes (50.1 vs. 35.4%, OR 1.41, p<0.001). Out of patients over 80years of age, 51.5% were care dependent and 45.5% of the patients over 90years were living in homes for the elderly.Conclusionsp id=Par4 In a representative sample of Swiss primary care patients, a substantial part shows multimorbidity with a high prevalence of chronic diseases, multiple drug treatment, and care dependency. These data may serve to be compared with other patient groups or other primary care systems.p id=Par5 Trial registrationwww.clinicaltrials.gov NCT0229537, national study registry www.kofam.ch SNCTP000001207.

TI  - Sparsity inspired pan-sharpening technique using multi-scale learned dictionary
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The significant issues in remote sensing image fusion are enhancing the spatial details and preserving the essential spectral information. The classical pan-sharpening methods often incur spectral distortion and still striving to produce the fused images with prominent spatial and spectral attributes. Motivated by the desirable results of sparse representation (SR) theory, a novel pan-sharpening method is developed based on SR of high frequency (HF) components over a multi-scale learned dictionary (MSLD). MSLD technique acquires the capability of extracting the intrinsic characteristics of images, wherein, it possess the features of both multi-scale representation and learned dictionaries. In this paper, the dictionaries are adaptively learned from HF sub images derived from the two versions of panchromatic image, realized at different spatial resolutions. A fast and computationally efficient algorithm is used for dictionary learning. The notion of SR together with patch recurrence over different scales is incorporated to estimate the high frequency details. The fused image is reconstructed by injecting the band specific spatial details into the up-sampled multi-spectral images. The performance of the proposed method is appraised with the datasets from different satellite sensors namely, QuickBird, IKONOS, WorldView-2 and Pleiades. The observations inferred from visual perception and quality indices analysis manifest the efficiency of proposed method over several well-known methods for the datasets considered at reduced-scale and full-scale resolutions. Further, the quantitative analysis of obtained performance measures confirms the efficacy of the proposed method for the reduced-scale and full-scale data sets. Especially, at a reduced-scale, proposed method yields an optimal value of Correlation coefficient, Structural similarity and Q4. In a comparative sense, usage of the proposed method at full-scale results in 4% and 2.56% improvement in the Spatial distortion index for QuickBird and WorldView-2 data respectively contrary to the best reported outcome obtained from Sparse Representation of injected details (SR-D) scheme. Invariably, for full-scale data, the QNR attains its optimal value.

TI  - Tissue arrays: Two simple and economical methods for manual construction
T2  - ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tissue array (TA) technology is widely used as a method for the in situ investigation of tissue markers in cancer studies. A limitation of this technique is the high price of tissue arrayers. We describe two easy and non-expensive manual methods, that have produced small and medium format arrays.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 TAs were manually constructed from conventional paraffin blocks using two different techniques. For the first method, a 16G Tru-Cut needle whose bevel edge had been cut, was used to make the holes in the donor blocks (80 cases) and the receptor ones (resulting in 2 TAs each one with 55 cases and two with 25 cases). In the second technique, a 4 mm-diameter punch for cutaneous biopsies was applied to the donor blocks (obtaining 210 cylinders from 108 blocks) and to the receptor ones (12 TAs). Hematoxy-lin-eosin, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization stains were performed on sections from these TAs.RESULTS: The tissue loss rate in the sections obtained from the TAs constructed with the first method was 26.5%, but as two cylinders were included from each case, at least one of them was retained. There was not any loss of tissue in the sections from the TAs constructed with the second method. The results of all of the stains performed were successful.CONCLUSIONS: These two manual methods of elaboration of TAs result rather simple and they are economical. The tissue loss rate is significant in the first method but it can be compensated embedding more than one cylinder from each donor block. There was not any problem in the sectioning of the TAs constructed with the second method.

TI  - The Use of NDVI in Digital Mapping of the Content of Available Lithium in the Arable Horizon of Soils in Southwestern Siberia
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have determined the informational value of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for predictive mapping of the content of available lithium in the arable horizon of soils of different slope positions: the first (280-310 m) and the second (240-280 m) altitudinal levels. The NDVI is not informative for the diagnostics or mapping of the content of available lithium in soils of small drainage valleys, the width of which is smaller than the resolution of the satellite image (30 m). In the regression model, the NDVI explains 28% of the variation in the content of available lithium in soils. Based on this model, a predictive map of the content of available lithium in soils has been compiled. Data on the spatial distribution pattern of the NDVI calculated based on a Landsat 8 satellite image (resolution of 30 m) were used as an indicator and the cartographical basis for digital mapping. The accuracy of the prediction of the content of available lithium in soils is good (MAPE is 16.9%). It has been revealed that the NDVI values and the content of available lithium in soils of the first altitudinal level are higher than in the second. The differences between NDVI in the drainage valley and on the first altitudinal level are not insignificant.

TI  - Large-Scale Smoke Haze over the European Part of Russia and Belorus in July 2016
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The smoke haze over the European part of Russia (EPR) and Belorus in July 2016 has been studied with the use of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data measured by MODIS satellite spectrometers. The AOT maximum on the territory limited by coordinates 45 degrees-70 degrees N and 20 degrees-60 degrees E reached 2.95 on July 24, 2016 with an average regional value of 0.48. The total mass of smoke aerosol without the area covered by clouds was 0.73 million tons. Analysis of the wind fields and five-day back trajectories of air mass movement showed that the smoke was transported by the northeast winds to the EPR and Belorus from western Siberia, including the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, which was characterized by large forest fires from July 17 to 23. Simulation of the radiation regime of the smoky atmosphere indicated that the average radiative forcings of smoke aerosol at upper and lower boundaries of the atmosphere for the above-mentioned territory are -29 and -54 W/m(2), respectively (the extreme values are -124 and -154 W/m2, respectively). A comparative analysis of the smoke haze characteristics over the EPR in July 2016 and in summer 2010 has been conducted. According to ground-based measurement data, the mass concentration of PM10 during the smoke period from July 24 to 27 in the Moscow region reached 0.25 mg/m(3).

TI  - Experience of Studying the Vertical Structure of an Urban Heat Island Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure of an urban heat island in the large industrial centers of the European part of Russia is studied based on the MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellite data. The intensity of the heat island is characterized by the different temperature and specific humidity between the urban area and the surrounding territory. It is shown that this analysis can be used only for large megalopolises like Moscow due to the limited horizontal resolution of the satellite data. The satellite data are grouped in time intervals of 19:30-23:30 and 10:00-13:00 UTC, called evening and before noon intervals, respectively. In the summer, Moscow's heat island extends to 1500 m. In the winter, the vertical extent of the heat island is 1000 m before noon, and in the evening the heat island is recorded only in the lowest part of the profile. During the summer, the heat island is accompanied by an urban dry island that extends for a height of 1000 m. Specific humidity increases above these heights as a rule. In the winter, a wet island is most pronounced above the surface.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 73-year-old woman visited our hospital with the chief complaint of a mass in the left breast. Breast ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic area in the left breast. A core needle biopsy showed the proliferation of solid tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry indicated strongly positive expression of E-cadherin, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. We then diagnosed her with breast neuroendocrine carcinoma. The expression of estrogen receptor(ER)and progesterone receptor(PgR)were also strongly positive, and the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2)was negative. Computed tomography( CT)and bone scintigraphy revealed no metastasis. Simple mastectomy of the left breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Final pathological examination of the tumor also led to the diagnosis of breast neuroendocrine carcinoma(T2N0M0, StageⅡA, Luminal A-like). After surgery, endocrine therapy is planned, considering the breast cancer subtype. Breast neuroendocrine carcinoma is rare. It is important to consider the possibility of metastasis from other organs to the breast.

TI  - <i>Aurigaia</i>: mock <i>Gaia</i> DR2 stellar catalogues from the AURIGA cosmological simulations
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present and analyse mock stellar catalogues that match the selection criteria and observ-ables (including uncertainties) of the Gaia satellite data release 2 (DR2). The source are six cosmological high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic ACDM zoom simulations of the formation of Milky Way analogues from the AURIGA project. Mock data are provided for stars with V < 16 mag and V < 20 mag at vertical bar b vertical bar > 20 deg. The mock catalogues are made using two different methods: the public SNAPDRAGONS code, and a method based on that of Lowing et al. (2015) that preserves the phase-space distribution of the model stars. These publicly available catalogues contain five-parameter astrometry, radial velocities, multiband photometry, stellar parameters, dust extinction values, and uncertainties in all these quantities. In addition, we provide the gravitational potential and information on the origin of each star. By way of demonstration, we apply the mock catalogues to analyses of the young stellar disc and the stellar halo. We show that (i) the young outer stellar disc exhibits a flared distribution that is detectable in the height and vertical velocity distribution of A- and B-dwarf stars up to radii of similar to 15 kpc, and (ii) the spin of the stellar halo out to 100 kpc can be accurately measured with Gala DR2 RR Lyrae stars. These catalogues are well suited for comparisons with observations and should help to (i) develop and test analysis methods for the Gaia DR2 data, (ii) gauge the limitations and biases of the data, and (iii) interpret the data in the light of theoretical predictions from realistic ab initio simulations of galaxy formation in the ACDM cosmological model.

TI  - The use of anthropogenic marine debris as a nesting material by brown boobies (<i>Sula leucogaster</i>)
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine debris is pervasive worldwide, and affects biota negatively. We compared the characteristics of debris incorporated within brown booby (Sula leucogaster) nests throughout their pantropical distribution by assessing the type, colour and mass of debris items within nests and in beach transects at 18 sites, to determine if nests are indicators of the amount of debris in local marine environments. Debris was present in 14.4% of nests surveyed, with the proportion of nests with debris varying among sites (range: 0-100%). There was minimal overlap between the type or colour of debris found in nests and on adjacent beaches at individual sites. This suggests that brown boobies do not select debris uniformly across their distribution. We propose that the nests of brown boobies can be used as a sentinel of marine debris pollution of their local environment.

TI  - A tree-based approach to biomass estimation from remote sensing data in a tropical agricultural landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land now exceeds forests as the dominant global biome. Because of their global dominance, and potential expansion or loss, methods to estimate biomass and carbon in agricultural areas are necessary for monitoring global terrestrial carbon stocks and predicting carbon dynamics. Agricultural areas in the tropics have substantial tree cover and associated above ground biomass (AGB) and carbon. Active remote sensing data, such as airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging), can provide accurate estimates of biomass stocks, but common plot-based methods may not be suitable for agricultural areas with dispersed and heterogeneous tree cover. The objectives of this research are to quantify AGB of a tropical agricultural landscape using a tree-based method that directly incorporates the size of individual trees, and to understand how landscape estimates of AGB from a tree-based method compare to estimates from a plot-based method. We use high-resolution (1.12 m) airborne LiDAR data collected on a 9280-ha region of the Azuero Peninsula of Panama. We model individual tree AGB with canopy dimensions from the LiDAR data. We apply the model to individual tree crown polygons and aggregate AGB estimates to compare with previously developed plot-based estimates. We find that agricultural trees are a distinct and dominant part of our study site. The tree-based approach estimates greater AGB in pixels with low forest cover than the plot-based approach, resulting a 2-fold difference in landscape AGB estimates between the methods for non-forested areas. Additionally, one third of the total landscape AGB exists in areas having < 10% cover, based on a global tree cover product. Our study supports the continued use and development of allometric models to predict individual tree biomass from LiDAR-derived canopy dimensions and demonstrates the potential for spatial information from high-resolution data, such as relative isolation of canopies, to improve allometric models.

TI  - Integrating GEOBIA, Machine Learning, and Volunteered Geographic Information to Map Vegetation over Rooftops
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate operational methods for creating a particular type of urban vegetation map-one focused on vegetation over rooftops (VOR), specifically trees that extend over urban residential buildings. A key constraint was the use of passive remote sensing data only. To achieve this, we (1) conduct a review of the urban remote sensing vegetation classification literature, and we then (2) discuss methods to derive a detailed map of VOR for a study area in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from a late season, high-resolution airborne orthomosaic based on an integration of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), pre-classification filtering of image-objects using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and a machine learning classifier. Pre-classification filtering lowered the computational burden of classification by reducing the number of input objects by 14%. Accuracy assessment results show that, despite the presence of senescing vegetation with low vegetation index values and deep shadows, classification using a small number of image-object spectral attributes as classification features (n = 9) had similar overall accuracy (88.5%) to a much more complex classification (91.8%) comprising a comprehensive set of spectral, texture, and spatial attributes as classification features (n = 86). This research provides an example of the very specific questions answerable about precise urban locations using a combination of high-resolution passive imagery and freely available VGI data. It highlights the benefits of pre-classification filtering and the judicious selection of features from image-object attributes to reduce processing load without sacrificing classification accuracy.

TI  - Adjuvant melanoma therapy with new drugs: should physicians continue to focus on metastatic disease or use it earlier in primary melanoma?
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to differentiate between two concepts of adjuvant therapy in melanoma-what we have come to call late adjuvant and early adjuvant therapy. Early adjuvant therapy is defined as a medical intervention that is done after resection of a primary melanoma to eradicate possible undetectable minimal residual disease, whereas late adjuvant therapy is done when an overt metastatic disease (nodal or visceral) has been completely resected, to control disease better than if the same treatment were given at a later time, in the presence of multiple metastases. Early adjuvant therapy is thus a preventive treatment strategy, whereas late adjuvant therapy aims at anticipating treatment of metastatic disease. For patients with melanoma, 1-year treatment with targeted therapies and immunotherapy have only been assessed in late adjuvant settings, the outcomes of which more or less reproduce the same dramatic effect as they have in metastatic disease. However, early adjuvant therapy could provide greater benefits in terms of public health, since thin melanomas without nodal metastases are so common that they account for most deaths by melanoma. In the early adjuvant setting, a treatment course of less than 1 year might be sufficient to control the disease, with less toxicity and at reduced costs. In this Personal View, we discuss the potential benefit of short-term early adjuvant treatment in patients with stage II melanoma, with the hope that sentinel-node biopsy and the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging will soon be replaced by more relevant biomarkers to identify the most suitable candidates for early adjuvant therapy for this disease.

TI  - WINTER SCAVENGING OF UNGULATE CARRION BY BALD EAGLES, COMMON RAVENS, AND COYOTES IN NORTHERN ARIZONA
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ungulate carrion supports an unusual canine-corvid-eagle winter scavenging guild in northern Arizona. To evaluate the effect of location and habitat on carcass use and longevity, between December 1996 and April 2008 we recorded 870 observations of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Common Ravens (Corvus corax) and coyotes (Canis latrans) scavenging 123 ungulate carcasses: 103 elk (Carvus canadensis), 12 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), seven pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), and one domestic cow (Bos taurus). Our temporal metric for measuring carcass longevity and scavenger presence was carcass-day (CD), numbered consecutively from the first day a carcass was recorded until it was consumed. We observed 38 separate carcasses (individual placement), 39 carcasses as part of three-carcass arrays in habitat associated with open, edge, and forest cover types (simultaneous choice), 22 carcasses left along the roadway where killed (monitored in place), and 24 carcasses partially skinned and/or cut open (facilitated). Elk carcasses lasted a mean 11.9 d (range 3-11), with 60% consumed during the first wk. Deer and pronghorn lasted 5.5 d (range 3-12) and 3.0 d (range 2-4), respectively. Ravens normally arrived by CD 3, Bald Eagles by CD 4, and coyotes by CD 6. Bald Eagles relied on ravens for discovery and sentinel duties, whereas both species depended on coyotes for accessibility. Winter- and road-killed carrion, not canine predation, drove carcass availability. Bald Eagles and coyotes used natural carrion more than human-influenced (road-killed or cut-open) carcasses, whereas Common Ravens were uninhibited by the latter. Removing ungulate carcasses from highway rights-of-way and partially opening them will promote quicker carcass consumption and safer avian scavenging by reducing potential for collisions with passing vehicles. A better understanding of the use of road-killed, large ungulate carrion may facilitate managing this supplemental food source as potential mitigation for other anthropogenic threats to both Bald and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), including wind-energy development.

TI  - 2D vs. 3D Change Detection Using Aerial Imagery to Support Crisis Management of Large-Scale Events
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale events represent a special challenge for crisis management. To ensure that participants can enjoy an event safely and carefree, it must be comprehensively prepared and attentively monitored. Remote sensing can provide valuable information to identify potential risks and take appropriate measures in order to prevent a disaster, or initiate emergency aid measures as quickly as possible in the event of an emergency. Especially, three-dimensional (3D) information that is derived using photogrammetry can be used to analyze the terrain and map existing structures that are set up at short notice. Using aerial imagery acquired during a German music festival in 2016 and the celebration of the German Protestant Church Assembly of 2017, the authors compare two-dimensional (2D) and novel fusion-based 3D change detection methods, and discuss their suitability for supporting large-scale events during the relevant phases of crisis management. This study serves to find out what added value the use of 3D change information can provide for on-site crisis management. Based on the results, an operational, fully automatic processor for crisis management operations and corresponding products for end users can be developed.

M3  - Article

CP  - 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - VITO Remote Sensing, Bruges, BELGIUM
AB  - Using observations from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and an unsupervised (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique) clustering method, the class centers for four different optical classes (i.e., moderate turbid or Class I; turbid or Class II; extremely turbid or Class III; and clear waters or Class IV) of Poyang Lake water were determined. A squared-Mahalanobis distance-based classification scheme was then used to classify 320 MERIS data between 2003 and 2012 (similar to 2.7 images/month on average). Significant dynamics of the probability of occurrence (POO) for different classes were observed through long-term analysis. The extremely turbid and clear water classes dominated Poyang Lake, accounting for similar to 70% of the total surface area within the entire time series. Class III and IV waters showed out-of-phase fluctuation patterns, while a large POO was observed in dry seasons for the extremely turbid water class (Class III), and the clear water class (Class IV) represented most of the lake in the wet seasons. The northern narrow water channel of Poyang Lake was generally characterized by Class II and III waters. In contrast, the high POO of Class IV was demonstrated in the southern main lake and some eastern and southern isolated sublakes. The hydrological analysis shows that the south-to-north water level gradients were positively correlated with the combined POOs of Classes II and III (R-2 = 0.4) and that the gradients were negatively correlated with the POO of Class IV (R-2 = 0.36). Significant relationships existed between the POOs of different classes and local precipitation. This study provides critical information for future environmental conservation planning.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - VITO Remote Sensing, Bruges, BELGIUM
AB  - In this study, the influence of altitude on the relationship between vegetation and climate was investigated via net primary productivity (NPP) in the mountainous Yunnan province of China. In order to undertake a detailed spatial analysis at a long-term level, a monthly 1-km NPP time series from 1982 to 2014 was constructed from multisource remote sensing data sets. The altitudinal variation of the relationship between NPP and climatic factors was disclosed at annual, seasonal, and monthly scales, respectively. The results indicated that the correlation between NPP and precipitation gradually decreases from positive to negative with the ascending elevation at an annual scale, which is completely the opposite to temperature. The relationships at seasonal and monthly scales are also consistent, but significant seasonal heterogeneity was found due to the uneven climate. It was also concluded that downward run-off is responsible for the altitudinal heterogeneity, in that high-elevation areas cannot easily retain water, and only low-elevation areas benefit from the increased precipitation. What is more, we also found that the impact of climatic drought on NPP is related to topography. Large river valleys help to facilitate droughts, but the negative impacts on NPP can be mitigated in the rugged area with fluctuating slope.

TI  - Dark Spot Detection in SAR Images of Oil Spill Using Segnet
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Damping Bragg scattering from the ocean surface is the basic underlying principle of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) oil slick detection, and they produce dark spots on SAR images. Dark spot detection is the first step in oil spill detection, which affects the accuracy of oil spill detection. However, some natural phenomena (such as waves, ocean currents, and low wind belts, as well as human factors) may change the backscatter intensity on the surface of the sea, resulting in uneven intensity, high noise, and blurred boundaries of oil slicks or lookalikes. In this paper, Segnet is used as a semantic segmentation model to detect dark spots in oil spill areas. The proposed method is applied to a data set of 4200 from five original SAR images of an oil spill. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through the comparison with fully convolutional networks (FCN), an initiator of semantic segmentation models, and some other segmentation methods. It is here observed that the proposed method can not only accurately identify the dark spots in SAR images, but also show a higher robustness under high noise and fuzzy boundary conditions.

TI  - Detecting Global Vegetation Changes Using Mann-Kendal (MK) Trend Test for 1982-2015 Time Period
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is the main component of the terrestrial ecosystem and plays a key role in global climate change. Remotely sensed vegetation indices are widely used to detect vegetation trends at large scales. To understand the trends of vegetation cover, this research examined the spatial-temporal trends of global vegetation by employing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) time series (1982-2015). Ten samples were selected to test the temporal trend of NDVI, and the results show that in arid and semi-arid regions, NDVI showed a deceasing trend, while it showed a growing trend in other regions. Mann-Kendal (MK) trend test results indicate that 83.37% of NDVI pixels exhibited positive trends and that only 16.63% showed negative trends (P < 0.05) during the period from 1982 to 2015. The increasing NDVI trends primarily occurred in tree-covered regions because of forest growth and re-growth and also because of vegetation succession after a forest disturbance. The increasing trend of the NDVI in cropland regions was primarily because of the increasing cropland area and the improvement in planting techniques. This research describes the spatial vegetation trends at a global scale over the past 30+ years, especially for different land cover types.

TI  - MODIS ocean color product downscaling via spatio-temporal fusion and regression: The case of chlorophyll-a in coastal waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and accurate information on the spatial variation of chlorophyll-a concentration in coastal waters is a critical component of ocean ecology and environmental research. The daily MODIS chlorophyll-a products provided by NASA, with 1 km spatial resolution, are suitable for monitoring this variation globally, but these products are too coarse to apply in practice to obtain detailed information over coastal waters. Early studies have shown that spatiotemporal data fusion techniques can be used to predict higher spatial resolution land-cover data based on time-series information in MODIS and the detailed texture from Landsat. However, this technology hasn't been tested to determine whether it can be used to predict higher spatial-resolution data in coastal waters with rapid water movement. This study aims to answer this question by providing a method to downscale the MODIS chlorophyll-a products from 1 km spatial resolution to 30 m. The spatiotemporal data fusion model U-STFM and the regression model NASA OC2M-HI were used to combine the texture and chlorophyll-a information from Landsat and MODIS. An area with rapid water movement in Bohai Bay of the Bohai Sea, northeast China, was selected for this study. Twelve matched images from MODIS in Aqua platform and Landsat 8, taken over a period of five years (2013-2017), were used to better predict detailed remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) on the targeted days. Landsat 8 Rrs was used as ground-truth data to assess the output. The results on Mar 10th, 2016, show: 1) The downscaled results (30 m) from the U-STFM model indicate a more stable prediction of Rrs with RMSE of 0.00177 and 0.00202 and R-squared of 0.868 and 0.881 for the blue and green bands, respectively. Results from STARFM and ESTARFM fusion models are also compared in this study. 2) High correlation between log10(U-STEM Blue/U-STFM Green) and log10(MODIS Chl) captured by OC2M-HI regression model at 1 km scale with R-squared up to 0.85 and RMSE up to 0.742 mg/m<^>3. This correlation was further used to predict the final chlorophyll-a concentration prediction at 30 m scale on Mar 10th, 2016; 3) The Landsat 8 chlorophyll-a product was used as reference data to evaluate the final chlorophyll-a concentration prediction (30 m) and the original MODIS chlorophyll-a product. The result shows the final prediction (30 m) maintains the accuracy of MODIS chlorophyll-a product and highly improved the local texture details near coastal waters. Predictions on nine other targeted dates with similar conclusions were also evaluated in this paper. The results in this study suggest that low spatial-resolution (1 Ian) daily MODIS chlorophyll-a products can be downscaled to higher resolution (30 m) products based on the U-STFM image fusion model and NASA's OC2M-HI regression model to better understand the dynamic patterns of chlorophyll-a concentration in coastal waters.

CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Roentgen-Ray-Society (ARRS)
CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of convolutional neural network (CNN) in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis, using a breast MRI dataset. An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective review of our database from 1/2013 to 6/2016 identified 275 axillary lymph nodes for this study. Biopsy-proven 133 metastatic axillary lymph nodes and 142 negative control lymph nodes were identified based on benign biopsies (100) and from healthy MRI screening patients (42) with at least 3years of negative follow-up. For each breast MRI, axillary lymph node was identified on first T1 post contrast dynamic images and underwent 3D segmentation using an open source software platform 3D Slicer. A 32x32 patch was then extracted from the center slice of the segmented tumor data. A CNN was designed for lymph node prediction based on each of these cropped images. The CNN consisted of seven convolutional layers and max-pooling layers with 50% dropout applied in the linear layer. In addition, data augmentation and L2 regularization were performed to limit overfitting. Training was implemented using the Adam optimizer, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. Code for this study was written in Python using the TensorFlow module (1.0.0). Experiments and CNN training were done on a Linux workstation with NVIDIA GTX 1070 Pascal GPU. Two class axillary lymph node metastasis prediction models were evaluated. For each lymph node, a final softmax score threshold of 0.5 was used for classification. Based on this, CNN achieved a mean five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 84.3%. It is feasible for current deep CNN architectures to be trained to predict likelihood of axillary lymph node metastasis. Larger dataset will likely improve our prediction model and can potentially be a non-invasive alternative to core needle biopsy and even sentinel lymph node evaluation.

TI  - Mangrove Vegetation and Sediment Type Influences on Macrobenthic Infauna in Overwashed Mangrove Ecosystems: A Case Study from Pari Islands, Jakarta, Indonesia.
T2  - Asian Journal of Conservation Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove vegetations and sediment types influence the community structure of macrobenthic infauna in mangrove ecosystems. Those effects are mostly studied in riverine and fringing mangrove ecosystems, with no attention on overwashed ones. The present study analysed effects of mangrove vegetations (i.e. total area, coverage, and density) and sediment types (i.e. gravel, sand, silt, and clay) on macrobenthic infauna (i.e. total abundance, richness, and taxa composition) in the overwashed mangrove ecosystem of Pari Islands, Jakarta, Indonesia. Mangrove area was calculated based on Geographical Information System and remote sensing satellite data, while coverage and density were quantified using a quadratic plot of 10x10 m. Sediment and macrobenthic infauna samples were collected using a hand corer with covering an area of about 0.02 m2. Effects of mangrove vegetations and sediment types on total abundance and richness were analysed using Generalised Linear Mixed Model, while those on taxa composition were analysed using Redundancy Analysis. Results showed that mangrove vegetations did not provide significant effects on macrobenthic infauna. In contrast, both clay and gravel significantly influenced total abundance and taxa composition but not richness. Therefore, sediment types were more influential than mangrove vegetations in structuring macrobenthic fauna in the overwashed mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence probes for surgical navigation
T2  - MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Optical imaging is a promising tool for visualizing fundamental biological processes including disease progression, detection of tumors, and therapeutic monitoring non-invasively. Unlike visible light, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging (beyond 700-1,700 nm) offers a competitive advantage to yield high-resolution images within a certain penetration depth (few millimeters to centimeters depending on NIR window). The last few years have witnessed rapid development of new NIRF probes within the span of whole NIR window, including small-molecule dyes, inorganic nanoparticles, and organic macromolecules. Benefitted by this, we observe a continual surge in the number of preclinical and clinical studies of NIRF imaging in surgery and related applications. At present, NIRF-guided imaging has emerged as a quintessential procedure to assist surgeons for intraoperative delineation and resection of tumors. Moreover, NIRF imaging is also used to improve the intraoperative staging, identify the hidden lesion in diseased organs, map lymph node metastases, detect tumor margins, and highlight vital organs intraoperatively. Considering rapid advancement of this field, we review recent progress in the development of NIRF probes, cancer-targeting strategies and their application for surgical navigation, particularly for the sentinel lymph node mapping, detection of tumors, and angiography. Moreover, we spotlight surgical navigation instrumentation that is currently used for intraoperative tumor detection. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Estimation of Arctic Air Temperature in Summer Based on Machine Learning Approaches Using IABP Buoy and AMSR2 Satellite Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to measure the Arctic surface air temperature because it plays a key-role in the exchange of energy between the ocean, sea ice, and the atmosphere. Although in-situ observations provide accurate measurements of air temperature, they are spatially limited to show the distribution of Arctic surface air temperature. In this study, we proposed machine learning-based models to estimate the Arctic surface air temperature in summer based on buoy data and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) satellite data. Two machine learning approaches-random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)-were used to estimate the air temperature twice a day according to AMSR2 observation time. Both RF and SVM showed R-2 of 0.84-0.88 and RMSE of 1.31-1.53 degrees C. The results were compared to the surface air temperature and spatial distribution of the ERA-Interim reanalysis data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). They tended to underestimate the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, and the Baffin Bay region where no IABP buoy observations exist. This study showed both possibility and limitations of the empirical estimation of Arctic surface temperature using AMSR2 data.

TI  - Analysis of Ice Velocity Variations of Nansen Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, from 2000 to 2017 Using Landsat Multispectral Image Matching
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Collapse of an Antarctic ice shelf and its flow velocity changes has the potential to reduce the restraining stress to the seaward flow of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which can cause sea level rising. In this study, variations in ice velocity from 2000 to 2017 for the Nansen Ice Shelf in East Antarctica that experienced a large-scale collapse in April 2016 were analyzed using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. To extract ice velocity, image matching based on orientation correlation was applied to the image pairs of blue, green, red, near-infrared, panchromatic, and the first principal component image of the Landsat multispectral data, from which the results were combined. The Landsat multispectral image matching produced reliable ice velocities for at least 14% wider area on the Nansen Ice Shelf than for the case of using single band (i.e., panchromatic) image matching. The ice velocities derived from the Landsat multispectral image matching have the error of 2.1 m a(-1) compared to the in situ Global Positioning System (GPS) observation data. The region adjacent to the Drygalski Ice Tongue showed the fastest increase in ice velocity between 2000 and 2017. The ice velocity along the central flow line of the Nansen Ice Shelf was stable before 2010 (similar to 228 m a(-1)). In 2011-2012, when a rift began to develop near the ice front, the ice flow was accelerated (similar to 255 m a(-1)) but the velocity was only about 11% faster than 2010. Since 2014, the massive rift had been fully developed, and the ice velocity of the upper region of the rift slightly decreased (similar to 225 m a(-1)) and stabilized. This means that the development of the rift and the resulting collapse of the ice front had little effect on the ice velocity of the Nansen Ice Shelf.

TI  - A Long-term Variability of the Extent of East Asian Desert
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The area of desert in East Asia is increasing every year, and it cause a great cost of social damage. Because desert is widely distributed and it is difficult to approach people, remote sensing using satellites is commonly used. But the study of desert area comparison is insufficient which is calculated by satellite sensor. It is important to recognize the characteristics of the desert area data that are calculated for each sensor because the desert area calculated according to the selection of the sensor may be different and may affect the climate prediction and desertification prevention measures. In this study, the desert area of Northeast Asia in 2001-2013 was calculated and compared using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Vegetation. As a result of the comparison, the desert area of Vegetation increased by 3,020 km(2)/year, while in the case of MODIS, it decreased by 20,911 km(2)/year. We performed indirect validation because It is difficult to obtain actual data. We analyzed the correlation with the occurrence frequency of Asian dust affected by desert area change. As a result, MODIS showed a relatively low correlation with R = 0.2071 and Vegetation had a relatively high correlation with R = 0.4837. It is considered that Vegetation performed more accurate desert area calculation in Northeast Asian desert area.

TI  - Estimation of High-Resolution Daily Ground-Level PM<sub>2</sub><sub>.5</sub> Concentration in Beijing 2013-2017 Using 1 km MAIAC AOT Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatiotemporal-resolution PM2.5 data are critical to assessing the impacts of prolonged exposure to PM2.5 on human health, especially for urban areas. Satellite-derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is highly correlated to ground-level PM2.5, providing an effective way to reveal spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 across urban landscapes. In this paper, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOT and ground-based PM2.5 measurements were fused to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing for 2013-2017 at 1 km resolution through a linear mixed effect model (LMEM). The results showed a good agreement between the estimated and measured PM2.5 and effectively revealed the characteristics of its spatiotemporal variations across Beijing: (1) the PM2.5 level is higher in the central and southern areas, while it is lower in the northern and northwestern areas; (2) the PM2.5 level is higher in autumn and winter, while it is lower in spring and summer. Moreover, annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 24.03% for the whole of Beijing and 31.46% for the downtown area from 2013 to 2017. The PM2.5 data products we generated can be used to assess the long-term impacts of PM2.5 on human health and support relevant government policy decision-making, and the methodology can be applied to other heavily polluted urban areas.

TI  - The Effect of the Gully Land Consolidation Project on Soil Erosion and Crop Production on a Typical Watershed in the Loess Plateau
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gully Land Consolidation Project (GLCP) was launched to create more arable land by excavating soil from the slopes on both sides of gullies, combined with simultaneous comprehensive gully prevention and control measures. The purpose of the GLCP is to increase crop production and reduce soil erosion to achieve ecological and agricultural sustainability. In this study, we assess the effects of the GLCP on soil erosion and crop production by studying the BaoChengGou Watershed in the Loess Plateau, primarily by means of high spatial-resolution satellite images (taken by the GF-1 and ZY-3 satellites) combined with the InVEST model and field investigations. Sloping cropland, sparse forestland, and natural grassland are the main land use types in the study area. After implementing the GLCP, consolidated land in the cropland increased by 7.35%, an increase that has come largely at the expense of grassland and forestland. The GLCP has markedly reduced soil erosion in the BaoChengGou Watershed, especially in the sense that soil erosion intensity was also reduced significantly in the project region on the whole, despite intensifying in certain places, such as excavated slopes; furthermore, it has improved crop yields in the study area by 10.9%. Comprehensive measurement shows the GLCP to be scientific, reasonable, and clearly efficacious. This study presents findings regarding the positive significance of the GLCP in promoting ecological and agricultural sustainability in the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Evaluating Remote Sensing Model Specification Methods for Estimating Water Quality in Optically Diverse Lakes throughout the Growing Season
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral images from remote sensing platforms are extensively used to estimate chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations for water quality studies. Empirical models used for estimation are often based on physical principles related to light absorption and emission properties of chl-a and generally relying on spectral bands in the green, blue, and near-infrared bands. Because the physical characteristics, constituents, and algae populations vary widely from lake to lake, it can be difficult to estimate coefficients for these models. Many studies select a model form that is a function of these bands, determine model coefficients by correlating remotely-measured surface reflectance data and coincidentally measured in-situ chl-a concentrations, and then apply the model to estimate chl-a concentrations for the entire water body. Recent work has demonstrated an alternative approach using simple statistical learning methods (Multiple Linear Stepwise Regression (MLSR)) which uses historical, non-coincident field data to develop sub-seasonal remote sensing chl-a models. We extend this previous work by comparing this method against models from literature, and explore model performance for a region of lakes in Central Utah with varying optical complexity, including two relatively clear intermountain reservoirs (Deer Creek and Jordanelle) and a highly turbid, shallow lake (Utah Lake). This study evaluates the suitability of these different methods for model parameterization for this area and whether a sub-seasonal approach improves performance of standard model forms from literature. We found that while some of the common spectral bands used in literature are selected by the data-driven MLSR method for the lakes in the study region, there are also other spectral bands and band interactions that are often more significant for these lakes. Comparison of model fit shows an improvement in model fit using the data-driven parameterization method over the more traditional physics-based modeling approaches from literature. This suggests that the sub-seasonal approach and exploitation of information contained in other bands helps account for lake-specific optical characteristics, such as suspended solids and other constituents contributing to water color, as well as unique (and season-specific) algae populations, which contribute to the spectral signature of the lake surface, rather than only relying on a generalized optical signature of chl-a. Consideration of these other bands is important for development of models for long-term and entire growing season applications in optically diverse water bodies.

TI  - Annual Cropland Mapping Using Reference Landsat Time Series-A Case Study in Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of cropland is an important prerequisite for regular crop condition monitoring, management of land and water resources, or tracing and understanding the environmental impacts of agriculture. Analyzing archives of satellite earth observations is a proven means to accurately identify and map croplands. However, existing maps of the annual cropland extent either have a low spatial resolution (e.g., 250-1000 m from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and existing high-resolution maps (such as 30 m from Landsat) are not provided frequently (for example, on a regular, annual basis) because of the lack of in situ reference data, irregular timing of the Landsat and Sentinel-2 image time series, the huge amount of data for processing, and the need to have a regionally or globally consistent methodology. Against this backdrop, we propose a reference time-series-based mapping method (RBM), and create binary cropland vs. non-cropland maps using irregular Landsat time series and RBM. As a test case, we created and evaluated annual cropland maps at 30 m in seven distinct agricultural landscapes in Xinjiang, China, and the Aral Sea Basin. The results revealed that RBM could accurately identify cropland annually, with producer's accuracies (PA) and user's accuracies (UA) higher than 85% between 2006 and 2016. In addition, cropland maps by RBM were significantly more accurate than the two existing products, namely GlobaLand30 and Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC).

TI  - Injury upon injury: a prospective cohort study examining subsequent injury claims in the 24 months following a substantial injury
T2  - INJURY PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study examines subsequent injuries reported to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), New Zealand's universal no-fault injury insurer, in the 24 months following an ACC entitlement claim injury event. Specific aims were to determine the: (1) 12 and 24 month cumulative incidence of at least one ACC-reported subsequent injury (ACC-SUBS-Inj), (2) characteristics of participants with and without ACC-SUBS-Inj, (3) frequency of ACC-SUBS-Inj, (4) time periods in which people are at higher risk of ACC-SUBS-Inj and (5) types of ACC-SUBS-Inj. Methods Interview data collected directly from participants in the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS) were combined with ACC-SUBS-Inj data from ACC and hospital discharge datasets. A subsequent injury was defined as any injury event resulting in an ACC claim within 24 months following the injury event for which participants were recruited to POIS (the sentinel injury). All ACC-SUBS-Inj were included irrespective of whether they were the same as the sentinel injury or not. Results Of 2856 participants, 58% (n=1653) experienced at least one ACC-SUBS-Inj in 24 months; 31% (n=888) had more than one ACC-SUBS-Inj. The time period of lowest risk of ACC-SUBS-Inj was the first 3 months following the sentinel injury event. Spine sprain/strain was the type of injury with the greatest number of ACC-SUBS-Inj claims per person. Conclusions More than half of those with an ACC entitlement claim injury incurred further injury events that resulted in a claim in the following 24 months. Greater understanding of these subsequent injury events provides an avenue for injury prevention.

TI  - "Keeping Some Wildness Always Alive": Posthumanism and the Animality of Children's Literature and Play
T2  - CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores posthumanism as a philosophy that emphasizes human relationships with the natural world by examining representations of animality, both in children's literature (e.g. titles such as Where the Wild Things Are, Wild, Virginia Wolf, and No Fits, Nilson!) and in children's play in order to better understand the significance of philosophy in children's literature and lives. By fostering a feeling of necessary wilderness, or connection to nature (Almond, 2011, p. 110), and by practicing a sense of being in nature, keeping some wildness always alive (Lerman, 2012, p. 311) through literary engagement and animal play, the authors suggest that children and adults can maintain an interconnectedness with the natural world, even when they cannot be in it themselves. Through a mixed methods approach that combines educational theory, ecocriticism, and qualitative research, we discuss links between children's stories and bodies, identifying how becoming animals through narrative engagement and play reflects posthumanist theory in practice, and encourages a child's embodied knowledge of nature. The authors also speak to the ways that embodied education approaches that encourage animal play and expressive literary engagement [Sipe, 2002, pp. 476-483]) can support a shifting and necessary worldview informed by posthumanism, suggesting that philosophical change is necessary if humanity aims to survive the ecological and technological changes to come.

TI  - Understanding Land Cover Change in a Fragmented Forest Landscape in a Biodiversity Hotspot of Coastal Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding forest cover changes is especially important in highly threatened and understudied tropical dry forest landscapes. This research uses Landsat images and a Random Forest classifier (RF) to map old-growth, secondary, and plantation forests and to evaluate changes in their coverage in Ecuador. We used 46 Landsat-derived predictors from the dry and wet seasons to map these forest types and to evaluate the importance of having seasonal variables in classifications. Initial RF models grouped old-growth and secondary forest as a single class because of a lack of secondary forest training data. The model accuracy was improved slightly from 92.8% for the wet season and 94.6% for the dry season to 95% overall by including variables from both seasons. Derived land cover maps indicate that the remaining forest in the landscape occurs mostly along the coastline in a matrix of pastureland, with less than 10% of the landscape covered by plantation forests. To obtain secondary forest training data and evaluate changes in forest cover, we conducted a change analysis between the 1990 and 2015 images. The results indicated that half of the forests present in 1990 were cleared during the 25-year study period and highlighted areas of forest regrowth. We used these areas to extract secondary forest training data and then re-classified the landscape with secondary forest as a class. Classification accuracies decreased with more forest classes, but having data from both seasons resulted in higher accuracy (87.9%) compared to having data from only the wet (85.8%) or dry (82.9%) seasons. The produced cover maps classified the majority of previously identified forest areas as secondary, but these areas likely correspond to forest regrowth and to degraded forests that structurally resemble secondary forests. Among the few areas classified as old-growth forests are known reserves. This research provides evidence of the importance of using bi-seasonal Landsat data to classify forest types and contributes to understanding changes in forest cover of tropical dry forests.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This data article provides a precise level data on alluvial fans of the western border of Lut desert, a unique location on the Earth, known as one of the hottest spot on the Earth. This data is essential for morphotectonic investigations and is valuable in the field of tectonic and geomorphology studies. It helps to evaluate the region from the viewpoint of tectonic activity by considering the dynamics of alluvial fans, climate and tectonic setting. The data which are presented for 68 quaternary alluvial fans, is taken by processing of remotely sensed Landsat satellite data, photogeology of aerial photographs, measuring on topographic maps and controlled by field checking. This data is useful for defining of a morphotectonic model of this limited access region considering the uplift of the source area along Nayband fault, as the basin margin fault, respect to the base level.

TI  - Establishment of a Sentinel Laboratory-Based Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network in Ethiopia
T2  - HEALTH SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, as part of the Global Health Security Agenda, Ethiopia was provided the technical and financial resources needed to prioritize antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the national public health sphere. Under the direction of a multi-stakeholder working group, AMR surveillance was launched in July 2017 at 4 sentinel sites across the country. The AMR surveillance initiative in Ethiopia represents one of the first systematic efforts to prospectively collect, analyze, and report national-level microbiology results from a network of hospitals and public health laboratories in the country. Baseline readiness assessments were conducted to identify potential challenges to implementation to be addressed through capacity-building efforts. As part of these efforts, the working group leveraged existing resources, initiated laboratory capacity building through mentorship, and established infrastructure and systems for quality assurance, data management, and improved coordination. As a result, AMR surveillance data are being reported and analyzed for use; data from more than 1,700 patients were collected between July 2017 and March 2018. The critical challenges and effective solutions identified through surveillance planning and implementation have provided lessons to help guide successful AMR surveillance in other settings. Ultimately, the surveillance infrastructure, laboratory expertise, and communication frameworks built specifically for AMR surveillance in Ethiopia can be extended for use with other infectious diseases and potential public health emergencies. Thus, building AMR surveillance in Ethiopia has illustrated how laying the foundation for a specific public health initiative can develop capacity for core public health functions with potential benefit.

TI  - Diagnostic value of near-infrared or fluorescent indocyanine green guided sentinel lymph node mapping in gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Methods This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of near-infrared (NIR) or fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in gastric cancer (GC). This meta-analysis was registered at the PROSPERO. Clinical studies were retrieved from the electronic database Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Web of science, and the Cochrane Library. Quality assessment was conducted by an adapted checklist of QUADAS-2. A bivariate mixed-effects model was used to pool the data. Evaluation of articles quality, analysis for publication bias, summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curves, and meta-regression were also performed. Subgroup analysis was used to explain the heterogeneities. Results Conclusion A total of 13 clinical studies (971 patients) were included. The NIR or fluorescent imaging (FI) involved infrared ray electronic endoscopy (IREE), infrared ray laparoscopic system (IRLS), and FI system. Significant evidence of heterogeneity was found for sensitivity and specificity (I-2 = 91.1% and I-2 = 98.2%), respectively. The pooled SLN sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 0.94(95%CI: 0.80-0.99), 1.00(95%CI: 0.60-1.00), 34.0(95%CI: 9.25-125.29), 0.06(95%CI:0.02-0.22), and 252.50(95%CI: 94.93-671.61), respectively. Area under curve (AUC) of SROC curve was 1.00 (95%CI: 0.99-1.00), and the summary operating point (cut-off value) was SENS = 0.94(95%CI: 0.80-0.99) and SPEC = 1.00(95%CI: 0.60-1.00). Subgroup analysis showed that NIR imaging, imaging performed 20 minutes after intraoperative injection, preoperative injection (especially for FI imaging), stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) (+hematoxylin-eosin [HE]), cT1 stage, submucosa injection (especially for cT1), mean number of SLN >= 5, study size > 26 were associated with higher SLN sensitivity. In terms of ICG concentration, diluted ICG concentration that 0.5 mg/mL (compared with 5 mg/mL) in NIR imaging and 0.05 mg/mL (compared with 0.5 mg/mL) in FI system showed higher sensitivities. However, the differences in tumor diameter (<= 30 mm vs >30 mm), gastrectomy methods (opening vs laparoscopy), lymphadenectomy methods (LBD vs pick-up), and publication year (>= 2010 vs <2010) did not achieve statistical significance. ICG combined with NIR or FI guided SLN mapping is technically feasible for GC. Based on the small sample size evidence, the IREE and IRLS devices may have higher sensitivity than FI in current clinical studies; and there may be an excessive ICG concentration used for current SLN mapping in GC. However, well-designed further studies with large sample size are needed to confirm the best procedure and suitable criteria. Mini-abstract This meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO. Clinical studies on this topic were retrieved from the electronic database Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The NIR or FI involved IREE, IRLS, and FI techniques. A total of 13 clinical studies (971 patients) were included. Based on the small sample size evidence, NIR or FI ICG guided SLN mapping in GC is technically feasible.

TI  - The 2016 Mw 6.7 Aketao earthquake in Muji range, northern Pamir: Rupture on a strike-slip fault constrained by Sentinel-1 radar interferometry and GPS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - On 25 November 2016, the Aketao, Xinjiang earthquake occurred on the Muji fault, which is located at the northernmost end of the right-lateral Karakorum Fault (ICF). This event provides a rare chance to gain insights into how the stress accumulates in Pamir margin as the Indian plate collides with the Eurasian plate. Space geodetic measurements including InSAR and GPS were used to obtain coseismic surface displacements associated with this earthquake. Based on a finite fault model, the coseismic slip distribution inverted by the combined datasets indicates that the 2016 Aketao event is caused by a primary shallow strike-slip with minor normal-slip at a steep-dipping angle. To explore the real structure of Muji fault, listric fault model inferred by relocated aftershocks as well as the planar fault model, were used in our slip distribution inversion. The results suggest that the optimal fault model should be a highly-dipping planar fault with two separated asperities. The large slip zone is beneath the surface near the epicenter with a maximum slip of 1.1 m, while the small one in the east breaks the surface, in a good agreement with the field seismic geological survey. The total geodetic moment is 1.35 x 10(19) N.m, equivalent to Mw 6.7. The nearly pure dextral strike-slip Aketao earthquake, and the recent 2015 Mw 7.2 sinistral strike-slip Tajikstan earthquake in this region, to some extent, manifest the extension motion is dominated in northern Pamir Plateau, in response to the northward convergence between Indian and Eurasian collision.

TI  - Review of Snow Data Assimilation Methods for Hydrological, Land Surface, Meteorological and Climate Models: Results from a COST HarmoSnow Survey
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES1404 HarmoSnow, entitled, A European network for a harmonized monitoring of snow for the benefit of climate change scenarios, hydrology and numerical weather prediction (2014-2018) aims to coordinate efforts in Europe to harmonize approaches to validation, and methodologies of snow measurement practices, instrumentation, algorithms and data assimilation (DA) techniques. One of the key objectives of the action was Advance the application of snow DA in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and hydrological models and show its benefit for weather and hydrological forecasting as well as other applications. This paper reviews approaches used for assimilation of snow measurements such as remotely sensed and in situ observations into hydrological, land surface, meteorological and climate models based on a COST HarmoSnow survey exploring the common practices on the use of snow observation data in different modeling environments. The aim is to assess the current situation and understand the diversity of usage of snow observations in DA, forcing, monitoring, validation, or verification within NWP, hydrology, snow and climate models. Based on the responses from the community to the questionnaire and on literature review the status and requirements for the future evolution of conventional snow observations from national networks and satellite products, for data assimilation and model validation are derived and suggestions are formulated towards standardized and improved usage of snow observation data in snow DA. Results of the conducted survey showed that there is a fit between the snow macro-physical variables required for snow DA and those provided by the measurement networks, instruments, and techniques. Data availability and resources to integrate the data in the model environment are identified as the current barriers and limitations for the use of new or upcoming snow data sources. Broadening resources to integrate enhanced snow data would promote the future plans to make use of them in all model environments.

TI  - Review of bovine brucellosis surveillance in Europe in 2015
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Bovine brucellosis is a major zoonosis and is responsible for significant reproductive disorders and production losses in cattle. Surveillance and control are regulated at the European level with specific conditions to obtain and maintain the officially free status, which facilitates access to export markets. These European standards allow for harmonisation in brucellosis surveillance and diagnosis while leaving some flexibility to countries in the choice of measures to meetthe desired objectives. This study reviews the bovine brucellosis surveillance systems currently in place across the European continent, according to countries' brucellosis status, based on a survey addressed to brucellosis diagnosis experts in the National Reference Laboratory of each country. Experts were asked to provide synthesised surveillance data and to describe technical conditions and screening tests carried out for the surveillance of abortions, serological testing in herds, movement controls and any other surveillance components in 2015. Results were obtained for 34 out of 37 countries (92%). Surveillance systems included abortion surveillance (34 countries), routine herd screening (28 countries), movement testing (14 countries), routine testing at bull stations (9 countries), and screening tests at slaughterhouses (4 countries). The review highlighted variability in technical conditions and screening tests among countries. These results are discussed with regard to the European Union regulations, disease risks and epidemiological situations, with the aim of improving surveillance efficacy and efficiency.

TI  - Road Segmentation in SAR Satellite Images With Deep Fully Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is extensively used in cartography. As transportation networks grow and change, extracting roads automatically from satellite images is crucial to keep maps up-to-date. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites can provide high-resolution topographical maps. However, roads are difficult to identify in these data as they look visually similar to targets, such as rivers and railways. Most road extraction methods on SAR images still rely on a prior segmentation performed by the classical computer vision algorithms. Few works study the potential of deep learning techniques, despite their successful applications to optical imagery. This letter presents an evaluation of fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) for road segmentation in SAR images. We study the relative performance of early and state-of-the-art networks after carefully enhancing their sensitivity toward thin objects by adding the spatial tolerance rules. Our models show promising results, successfully extracting most of the roads in our test data set. This shows that although FCNNs natively lack efficiency for road segmentation, they are capable of good results if properly tuned. As the segmentation quality does not scale well with the increasing depth of the networks, the design of specialized architectures for roads extraction should yield better performances.

TI  - Combined Use of Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for REDD+ Applications in Malawi
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in satellite data availability allow tropical forest monitoring to expand in two ways: (1) dense time series foster the development of new methods for mapping and monitoring dry tropical forests and (2) the combination of optical data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data reduces the problems resulting from frequent cloud cover and yields additional information. This paper covers both issues by analyzing the possibilities of using optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) time series data for forest and land cover mapping for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) applications in Malawi. The challenge is to combine these different data sources in order to make optimal use of their complementary information content. We compare the results of using different input data sets as well as of two methods for data combination. Results show that time-series of optical data lead to better results than mono-temporal optical data (+8% overall accuracy for forest mapping). Combination of optical and SAR data leads to further improvements: +5% in overall accuracy for land cover and +1.5% for forest mapping. With respect to the tested combination methods, the data-based combination performs slightly better (+1% overall accuracy) than the result-based Bayesian combination.

TI  - Patterns and Determinants of Post-Soviet Cropland Abandonment in the Western Siberian Grain Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition from a command to a market economy resulted in widespread cropland abandonment across the former Soviet Union during the 1990s. Spatial patterns and determinants of abandonment are comparatively well understood for European Russia, but have not yet been assessed for the vast grain belt of Western Siberia, situated in the Eurasian forest steppe. This is unfortunate, as land-use change in Western Siberia is of global significance: Fertile black earth soils and vast mires store large amounts of organic carbon, and both undisturbed and traditional cultural landscapes harbor threatened biodiversity. We compared Landsat images from ca. 1990 (before the break-up of the Soviet Union) and ca. 2015 (current situation) with a supervised classification to estimate the extent and spatial distribution of abandoned cropland. We used logistic regression models to reveal important determinants of cropland abandonment. Ca. 135,000 ha classified as cropland around 1990 were classified as grassland around 2015. This suggests that ca. 20% of all cropland remain abandoned ca. 25 years after the end of the Soviet Union. Abandonment occurred mostly at poorly drained sites. The likelihood of cropland abandonment increased with decreasing soil quality, and increasing distance to medium-sized settlements, roads and railroads. We conclude that soil suitability, access to transport infrastructure and availability of workforce are key determinants of cropland abandonment in Western Siberia.

TI  - Risk factors of sentinel and non-sentinel lymph node metastases in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: A nationwide study
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Unexplained axillary metastases have been detected in some patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), possibly because of occult invasion or iatrogenic tumor cell displacement. The significance of these metastases is unknown and brings into questions the need for upstaging and axillary surgery. What are the risk factors for sentinel lymph node (SN) and non-SN metastases, including the risk of iatrogenic displacement of tumor cells in relation to an excisional biopsy, in patients diagnosed with DCIS?Methods: Nationwide data on 1787 women diagnosed with DCIS between 2001 and 2015 were retrieved from the Danish Breast Cancer Group database. The association of clinicopathological variables with a positive SN (isolated tumor cells (ITCs), micro- or macrometastases) was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results: Of the 1787 patients, 71 (4.0%) had a positive SN: 15 (0.8%) had macrometastases, 42 (2.4%) had micrometastases, and 14 (0.8%) had ITCs. Five patients with a positive SN also had a positive non-SN. In adjusted analysis, a positive SN was associated with younger age (P = 0.036), increased size (P = 0.002), palpability (P = 0.0004) and surgical excisional biopsy (P < 0.001).Conclusions: The overall risk of a positive SN in patients with DCIS on final pathology is low and less than 9% of these patients had positive non-SNs. This argues against using axillary lymph node dissection in this group. The odds of positive SN after surgical excisional biopsies showed more than a four-fold increase, indicating iatrogenic tumor cell displacement. It is questioned whether these patients should be upstaged and classified as having invasive carcinoma. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Procedural sedation of elderly patients by emergency physicians: a safety analysis of 740 patients
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The elderly are perceived as a high-risk group for procedural sedation. Concern exists regarding the safety of sedation of this patient group by emergency physicians, particularly when using propofol.Methods: We analysed prospectively collected data on patients aged 75 yr or older undergoing sedation between October 2006 and March 2017 in the emergency department of a single centre. We used the World Society of Intravenous Anaesthesia International Sedation Task Force adverse event tool, stratifying identified adverse events according to consensus agreement.Results: Of 740 consecutive patients (median age 84 yr), 571 patients received propofol, 142 morphine and midazolam, and 27 other agents. We identified 19 sentinel events: 2 cases of hypoxaemia, 10 of apnoea (without hypoxaemia), 5 of hypotension, and 2 of both hypoxaemia and hypotension. We also identified 30 moderate, 41 minor, and 7 minimal risk adverse events. There were no adverse outcomes.Conclusions: We observed safe sedation practice in this high-risk group of patients. A sentinel adverse event rate of 2.6% including a hypoxaemia rate of 0.5% with no adverse outcomes sets a benchmark for sedation of the elderly.

TI  - From a Vegetation Index to a Sustainable Development Goal Indicator: Forest Trend Monitoring Using Three Decades of Earth Observations across Switzerland
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests represent important habitats for species and provide multiple ecosystem services for human well-being. Preserving forests and other terrestrial ecosystems has become crucial to halt desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss worldwide, and is also one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Remote sensing could greatly contribute to measuring progress toward SDGs by providing consistent and repetitive coverage of large areas, as well as information in various wavelengths, which facilitates the monitoring of environmental trends at various scales. This paper focuses on SDG indicator 15.1.1-"Forest area as a percentage of total land area to demonstrate the potential of Earth Observation Data Cubes for SDGs. The approach presented here uses Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) stored in the Swiss Data Cube, and offers a complementary method to ground-based approaches to monitor Switzerland's forest extent based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The proposed method performs time-series analyses to extract a forest/non-forest map and a graph representing the trend of SDG 15.1.1 indicator over time. Preliminary results suggest that this approach can identify similar forest extent and growth patterns to observed trends, and can therefore help monitor progress toward the selected SDG indicator more effectively.

TI  - A Review on Monitoring Mt. Baekdu Volcano Using Space-based Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Mt. Baekdu is a stratovolcano located at the border between China and North Korea and is known to have formed through its differentiation stage after the Oligocene epoch in the Cenozoic era. There has been a growing interest in the magma re-activity of Mt. Baekdu volcano since 2010. Several research projects have been conducted by government such as Korea Meteorological Administration and Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources. Because, however, the Mt. Baekdu volcano is located far from South Korea, it is quite difficult to collect in-situ observations by terrestrial equipment. Remote sensing is a science to analyze and interpret information without direct physical contact with a target object. Various types of platform such as automobile, unmanned aerial vehicle, aircraft and satellite can be used for carrying a payload. In the past several decades, numerous volcanic studies have been conducted by remotely sensed observations using wide spectrum of wavelength channels in electromagnetic waves. In particular, radar remote sensing has been widely used for volcano monitoring in that microwave channel can gather surface's information without less limitation like day and night or weather condition. Radar interferometric technique which utilized phase information of radar signal enables to estimate surface displacement such as volcano, earthquake, ground subsidence or glacial movement, etc. In 2018, long-term research project for collaborative observation for Mt. Baekdu volcano between Korea and China were selected by Korea government. A volcanic specialized research center has been established by the selected project. The purpose of this paper is to introduce about remote sensing techniques for volcano monitoring and to review selected studies with remote sensing techniques to monitor Mt. Baekdu volcano. The acquisition status of the archived observations of six synthetic aperture radar satellites which are in orbit now was investigated for application of radar interferometry to monitor Mt. Baekdu volcano. We will conduct a time-series analysis using collected synthetic aperture radar images.

TI  - Evaluation of the RPC Model for Ziyuan-3 Three-line Array Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite is the first civilian stereo mapping satellite in China and was designed to achieve the 1: 50,000 scale mapping for land and ocean. Rigorous sensor model (RSM) is required to build the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) object space and two-dimensional (2D) image space of ZY-3 satellite imagery. However, each satellite sensor has its own imaging system with different physical sensor models, which increase the difficulty of geometric integration of multi-source images with different sensor models. Therefore, it is critical to generate generic model, especially rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) of optical imagery. Recently, relatively a few researches have been conducted on RPCs generation to ZY-3 satellite. This paper proposes an approach to evaluate the performance of RPCs generation from RSM of ZY-3 imagery. Three scenario experiments with different terrain features (such as ocean, hill, city and grassland) are designed and conducted to comprehensively evaluate the replacement accuracies of this approach and analyze the RPCs fitting error. All the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved the encouraging accuracy of better than 1.946E-04 pixel in both x-axis direction and y-axis direction, and it indicates that the RPCs are suitable for ZY-3 imagery and can be used as a replacement for the RSM of ZY-3 imagery.

TI  - Seasonal Activity of Influenza in Iran: Application of Influenza-like Illness Data from Sentinel Sites of Healthcare Centers during 2010 to 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to predict seasonal influenza activity and detection of influenza outbreaks. Data of all registered cases (n = 53,526) of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) from sentinel sites of healthcare centers in Iran were obtained from the FluNet web-based tool, World Health Organization (WHO), from 2010 to 2015. The status of the ILI activity was obtained from the FluNet and considered as the gold standard of the seasonal activity of influenza during the study period. The cumulative sum (CUSUM) as an outbreak detection method was used to predict the seasonal activity of influenza. Also, time series similarity between the ILI trend and CUSUM was assessed using the cross-correlogram. Of 7684 (14%) positive cases of influenza, about 71% were type A virus and 28% were type B virus. The majority of the outbreaks occurred in winter and autumn. Results of the cross-correlogram showed that there was a considerable similarity between time series graphs of the ILI cases and CUSUM values. However, the CUSUM algorithm did not have a good performance in the timely detection of influenza activity. Despite a considerable similarity between time series of the ILI cases and CUSUM algorithm in weekly lag, the seasonal activity of influenza in Iran could not be predicted by the CUSUM algorithm.HIGHLIGHTSActivity of influenza in Iran could not be predicted by CUSUM algorithm.The majority of the outbreaks occurred in winter and autumn.CUSUM algorithm did not have a good performance in detection of influenza outbreaks.

TI  - Acculturation and Career Development of International and Domestic College Students
T2  - CAREER DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors examined the relationships between career and cultural characteristics among 53 international and 54 domestic students at a large university in the southeastern United States. One-way multivariate analysis of variance results showed an overall significant difference between groups for mainstream acculturation, but not for vocational identity, dysfunctional career thoughts, goal instability, or heritage acculturation. Regression results indicated that 71% of the variance in vocational identity of domestic college students was explained by dysfunctional career thoughts and acculturation, whereas dysfunctional career thoughts were the only significant predictor of vocational identity for international college students. Thus, a key implication from this study is for career practitioners to address and challenge the dysfunctional thinking of all students to improve their vocational identity. Future researchers should also explore how other potential moderator variables (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education) may influence vocational identity, as well as include more qualitative approaches to better understand an individual's worldview, including career and cultural characteristics.

Land-use regression (LUR) models have thus been used frequently to estimate individual levels of exposures to ambient air pollution. This paper used remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) tools to develop ten regression models for PM2.5-bound compound concentration based on measurements of a six-year period including , OC, EC, Ba, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Sb. The explained variance (R-2) of these LUR models ranging from 0.60 to 0.92 confirms that this study successfully estimated the fine spatial variability of PM2.5-bound compound concentrations in Taiwan where the distribution of traffic, industrial area, greenness, and culture-specific PM2.5 sources like temples collected from GIS and remote sensing data were main variables. In particular, while they were much less used, this study showcased the necessity of remote sensing data of greenness in future LUR studies for reducing the exposure bias. In terms of local residents' health outcome or health effect indicators, this study further offers much-needed support for future air epidemiological studies. The results provide important insights into expanding the application of GIS and remote sensing on exposure assessment for PM2.5-bound compounds.

TI  - Monitoring mangrove forest change in China from 1990 to 2015 using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal variability metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information of national-level mangrove forest change in China is urgently needed for Chinese government to make appropriate policies of mangrove forest conservation. Yet, employing traditional methods (all based on single-date remotely sensed imagery) to accurately map mangrove forest in China is relatively difficult, given the influence of tide variability on the spectrum of a large proportion of mangrove forest and the spectral similarity between mangrove forest, cropland, and natural terrestrial vegetation. However, the temporal profile of spectrum for mangrove forest is likely to be distinctive, due to the influence of tide variability on mangrove forest spectrum. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the potential of using some robust spectral-temporal variability metrics (quantiles), capturing characteristics of temporal profiles for different land cover types, to reliably separate mangrove forest. We also mapped mangrove forest in China for 6 periods (1986-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002, 2003-2007, 2008-2012, and 2013-2017) and analyzed mangrove forest change over past decades using all available Landsat imagery. Producer's and user's accuracies of the land cover type "mangrove forest" for all periods are high (> 90%), indicating the effectiveness of our method. We found that mangrove forest in China has significantly increased, from 10774 ha in the period 1986-1992 to 19220 ha in the period 2013-2017. There is also a potential for employing our method to map global mangrove forest around 2015.

TI  - An automatic approach for land-change detection and land updates based on integrated NDVI timing analysis and the CVAPS method with GEE support
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use/land-cover information is the basis of global-change research and regional governmental management. Automatic approaches are always required to update land maps for large-scale areas, and change detection techniques are the most important component of land-updating methods. Previous research has confirmed that simple change detection based on Landsat images from two different years with two different phenophases yields unsatisfactory results and may induce many misclassifications and pseudo-change identifications because of the phenological differences between remote sensing images. With the support of the Google Earth Engine (GEE), we propose a land-use/land-cover type discrimination method based on a classification and regression tree (CART), apply change-vector analysis in posterior probability space (CVAPS) and the best histogram maximum entropy method for change detection, and further improve the accuracy of the land-updating results in combination with NDVI timing analysis, which indicates the annual growth of ground vegetation. In the case study, we select western China as the research area and obtain a 2014 land map based on the ESA GlobCover 2009 dataset. The results confirm that the accuracy of the land-renewal results based on the CART-CVAPS-NDVI method reach 78.6-88.2%, which is 4-10% higher than that of the CART-CVPAS method without NDVI timing analysis. The CART-CVAPS-NDVI method has more detailed and accurate resolutions for land-change detection.

TI  - A Deep Convolution Neural Network Method for Land Cover Mapping: A Case Study of Qinhuangdao, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and its dynamic information is the basis for characterizing surface conditions, supporting land resource management and optimization, and assessing the impacts of climate change and human activities. In land cover information extraction, the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) method has several problems, such as the inability to be applied to multispectral and hyperspectral satellite imagery, the weak generalization ability of the model and the difficulty of automating the construction of a training database. To solve these problems, this study proposes a new type of deep convolutional neural network based on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. The network integrates cascaded cross-channel parametric pooling and average pooling layer, applies a hierarchical sampling strategy to realize the automatic construction of the training dataset, determines the technical scheme of model-related parameters, and finally performs the automatic classification of remote sensing images. This study used the new type of deep convolutional neural network to extract land cover information from Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, and compared the experimental results with those obtained by traditional methods. The results show that: (1) The proposed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model can automatically construct the training dataset and classify images. This model performs the classification of multispectral and hyperspectral satellite images using deep neural networks, which improves the generalization ability of the model and simplifies the application of the model. (2) The proposed DCNN model provides the best classification results in the Qinhuangdao area. The overall accuracy of the land cover data obtained is 82.0%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.76. The overall accuracy is improved by 5% and 14% compared to the support vector machine method and the maximum likelihood classification method, respectively.

TI  - Atmospheric Artifacts Correction With a Covariance-Weighted Linear Model Over Mountainous Regions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigating the atmospheric phase delay is one of the largest challenges faced by the differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry community. Recently, many publications have studied correcting the stratified tropospheric phase delay by assuming a linear model between them and the topography. However, most of these studies have not considered the effect of turbulent atmospheric artifacts when adjusting the linear model to data. In this paper, we present an improved technique that minimizes the influence of the turbulent atmosphere in the model adjustment. In the proposed algorithm, the model is adjusted to the phase differences of pixels instead of using the unwrapped phase of each pixel. In addition, the different phase differences are weighted as a function of its atmospheric phase screen covariance estimated from an empirical variogram to reduce, in the model adjustment, the impact of pixel pairs with a significant turbulent atmosphere. The good performance of the proposed method has been validated with both the simulated and real Sentinel-1A SAR data in the mountainous area of Tenerife island, Spain.

TI  - The uncertainty analysis of the MODIS GPP product in global maize croplands
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is very important in the global carbon cycle. Currently, the newly released estimates of 8-day GPP at 500 m spatial resolution (Collection 6) are provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Science Team for the global land surface via the improved light use efficiency (LUE) model. However, few studies have evaluated its performance. In this study, the MODIS GPP products (GPP(MOD)) were compared with the observed GPP (GPP(EC)) values from site-level eddy covariance measurements over seven maize flux sites in different areas around the world. The results indicate that the annual GPP(MOD) was underestimated by 6%aEuro'58% across sites. Nevertheless, after incorporating the parameters of the calibrated LUE, the measurements of meteorological variables and the reconstructed Fractional Photosynthetic Active Radiation (FPAR) into the GPP(MOD) algorithm in steps, the accuracies of GPP(MOD) estimates were improved greatly, albeit to varying degrees. The differences between the GPP(MOD) and the GPP(EC) were primarily due to the magnitude of LUE and FPAR. The underestimate of maize cropland LUE was a widespread problem which exerted the largest impact on the GPP(MOD) algorithm. In American and European sites, the performance of the FPAR exhibited distinct differences in capturing vegetation GPP during the growing season due to the canopy heterogeneity. In addition, at the DE-Kli site, the GPP(MOD) abruptly produced extreme low values during the growing season because of the contaminated FPAR from a continuous rainy season. After correcting the noise of the FPAR, the accuracy of the GPP(MOD) was improved by approximately 14%. Therefore, it is crucial to further improve the accuracy of global GPP(MOD), especially for the maize crop ecosystem, to maintain food security and better understand global carbon cycle.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - VITO Remote Sensing, Bruges, BELGIUM
AB  - Landsat data are an ideal data source for deriving fine-resolution land cover maps, and integrating temporal features extracted from time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data achieves better performance. This paper compares the different roles of NDVI statistic features and phenology features in land cover classification at a finer scale. Time-series NDVI with fine resolution is first obtained by fusing Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) NDVI via spatiotemporal fusion algorithm. Statistic and phenology features are then extracted from the fused data and added into random forest (RF) classifier. Performance under different classifiers and importance of phenology features are further discussed. Results show that both NDVI statistic features and phenology features have great effects on improving the classification accuracy after adding them to Landsat spectral bands. The overall accuracy is improved approximately 3% and 5%. Phenology features contain majority information of statistic features, and better reflect the seasonal variations of time-series NDVI, especially for vegetation types. Additionally, neural network classifier achieved similar trends of results with RF but lower accuracy, while support vector machine classifier seems to be poor in dealing with high-dimension temporal features, especially in regions with abundant vegetation. Among phenology features, maximum value, large integrated value, and base value have the highest importance scores, while start, end, and middle times of season provide extra information for identifying grass and nongrass.

TI  - Remote sensing of albedo-reducing snow algae and impurities in the Maritime Antarctica
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow algae have been proposed to play a key role in climate change as they can reduce albedo ("bioalbedo") and thus accelerate the melting of snow and ice fields. Although satellite-derived data has opened opportunities for larger scale observations, remote sensing of snow algae has been scarce and is methodologically challenging due to the presence of other light-absorbing impurities (LAIs). So far the studies on the role of LAIs in reducing albedo and increasing melting have been strongly focused on the Arctic ice sheets. The aims of the present study were to compare the relative impact of microalgae and other LAIs in reducing albedo in the snow of Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Maritime Antarctica, using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), which allows mapping sub-pixel fractions of multiple components in mixed pixels from satellite-derived data (Sentinel-2A). Also, the applicability of band ratios previously proposed for classifying snow algae (Red-Green band ratio) and impurities (Snow Darkening Index (SDI)) was tested and compared with SMA. Ground validation was made by characterizing the composition of snow algae (through chlorophyll a fluorescence) and by measurements of spectral absorption of solar radiation in red and green snow. SMA resulted a reliable method to classify snow algae and impurities with low amount of false positives (user accuracy 92-93%). However, omission error derived from dominant type (> 50% abundance) confusion matrix was higher (producer accuracy for algae 63% and impurity 53%). In contrast, classification with band ratios resulted in large number of false positives (user accuracy for SDI 36%, for R/G 46%), and even higher omission error for R/G (producer accuracy 36%), whereas SDI had better producer accuracy (68%). SMA provided higher precision in separating dominant LAIs than the band ratios, which resulted in widely overlapping signals. Reduced albedo could be related with SMA-derived snow algae and impurity abundancies at albedo levels > 45% for algae and > 30% for impurities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIndications for superficial inguinal lymph node (ILN) dissection in melanoma include fine needle aspiration or clinically positive ILN and sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). Open inguinal lymphadenectomy may be complicated by poor wound healing, deep vein thrombosis, and lymphedema. Technical considerations and case series of a novel surgical approach, robotic inguinal lymphadenectomy, are presented.MethodsThis is a case series of four robotic ILN dissections for melanoma at a tertiary care facility. Each patient had previously diagnosed melanoma by lymph node biopsy. Physician and patient jointly decided on robotic procedure after disclosure of this novel approach. Demographic, complication, pathological outcome, estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, and length of stay (LOS) data were collected.ResultsNo cases were aborted due to technical difficulty. The median patient age was 44.5years (range 22-53years) and median BMI was 27.5 (range 20.4-40.2). Operative time range was 120-231min and EBL from 0 to 100mL. Median nodal count was 5.5 (range 1-14 nodes). Patient LOS ranged from 0 (discharged from post anesthesia care unit) to 96h. There was one complication of port site cellulitis, one seroma formation, and no instances of lymphedema. To date, there have been no deaths or melanoma recurrences in this population.ConclusionRecent data suggest a minimum node count of six to seven for inguinal dissection. Of our four dissections, two were above this threshold and there were minimal postoperative complications. Given our limited sample size, future focus should be on increasing the data on this approach to optimize surgical outcomes and oncologic results.

TI  - Cloud Cells by Data of Satellite Measurements and Convective Energy Balance on Invasion of Cold Air into the Atmosphere over the Black Sea
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers a typical case of winter cold air invasion into the Black Sea region in January 2010. Using the WRF numerical model, the intensive convection over the sea on January 25 has been reproduced and the simulation results have been verified using satellite data on cloudiness, cloud top temperature, and specific humidity. It has been shown that, according to both the modeling results and the satellite data, mixed convection over the sea occurred but with the prevalence of cells playing the main part in the mixing in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The cloud top height has been determined both by satellite data and by simulation results; it has been shown that the model reproduces the observed increase in the cloud top height over the sea with the distance from the coast. Spectral analysis of the vertical convective moisture flux fields has shown that the model correctly reproduced the horizontal size of cloud structures near the shore. It was found from the modeling results and satellite pictures that the horizontal size of convective cells over the sea increased downwind. The main components of the convective kinetic energy balance in the atmospheric boundary layer have been considered: energy generation due to pressure pulsations and work of the buoyancy force, as well as the decrease in energy due to turbulent diffusion and convective advection. It has been shown how these quantities varied with height and with the distance from the shore.

TI  - Mapping mineral chemistry of a lateritic outcrop in new Caledonia through generalized regression using Sentinel-2 and field reflectance spectra
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining is fundamental for human development, yet it currently requires innovative spatial techniques as it faces diverse environmental and social pressures. With the free Sentinel-2 data of the Copernicus programme, new opportunities arise for studies related to nickel laterite, especially with its reported potential in mapping iron oxide. This work utilizes samples from drill-holes extracted from Tiebaghi, New Caledonia. The chemical composition and the hyperspectral reflectance of each sample are obtained. The reflectance spectra are re sampled to Sentinel-2's characteristics, and generalized linear regression was used to accurately predict Fe2O3, MgO, SiO2, Al2O3, and nickel content where three regression approaches were compared: Ridge, Elastic Net, and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). With the resulting regression models, mineral chemistry of an outcrop in the vicinity of the drill-holes is mapped by a scene of Sentinel-2. The work shows the great potential of free satellite imagery in mapping chemical characteristics of minerals and rocks. It opens up great opportunities for monitoring outcrops and for achieving more efficient mineral exploration.

TI  - Anti-C5a complementary peptide mitigates zymosan-induced severe peritonitis with fibrotic encapsulation in rats pretreated with methylglyoxal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a previous study of fungal peritoneal injury in peritoneal dialysis patients, complement (C)-dependent pathological changes were developed in zymosan (Zy)-induced peritonitis by peritoneal scraping. However. the injuries were limited to the parietal peritoneum and did not show any fibrous encapsulation of the visceral peritoneum, which differs from human encapsular peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). We investigated peritoneal injury in a rat model of Zy-induced peritonitis pretreated with methylglyoxal (MGO) instead of scraping (Zy/MGO peritonitis) to clarity the role of C in the process of fibrous encapsulation of the visceral peritoneum. Therapeutic effects of an anti-C5a complementary peptide, AcPepA, on peritonitis were also studied. In Zy/MGO peritonitis, peritoneal thickness, fibrin exudation, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and deposition of C3b and C5b-9 with loss of membrane C regulators were increased along the peritoneum until day 5. On day 14, fibrous encapsulation of the visceral peritoneum was observed, resembling human EPS. Peritoneal injuries and fibrous changes were significantly improved with AcPepA treatment, even when AcPepA was administered following injection of Zy in Zy/MGO peritonitis. The data show that C5a might play a role in the development of encapsulation-like changes in the visceral peritoneum in Zy/MGO peritonitis. AcPepA might have therapeutic effects in fungal infection-induced peritoneal injury by preventing subsequent development of peritoneal encapsulation.

TI  - Impact of urban land cover change on land surface temperature
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth in urban population is seen to create a need for the development of more urban infrastructures. In order to meet this need, natural surfaces such as vegetation are been replaced with non-vegetated surfaces such as asphalt and bricks which has the ability to absorb heat and release it later. This change in land cover is seen to increase the land surface temperature. Previous studies have tried to explain the impact of land cover changes on the land surface temperature. However, there is a growing need to spatially quantify the extent to which temperature has increased so as to identify areas where immediate mitigation measures can be introduced. In view of this, this study has incorporated remotely sensed Landsat data with remote sensing techniques in order to effectively quantify the spatial extent of urban growth and its impact on the land surface temperature in Lagos, Nigeria. The result shows that there have been changes in the land cover which has increased the land surface temperature between 2002 and 2013. Overall, there was an increase in the highly dense areas, moderately dense areas and less dense areas by 3.35% (2200.77 ha), 27.87% (13681.35 ha), 6.20% (3284.01 ha) and a corresponding increase in the mean land surface temperature of these urban areas by 3.8 degrees C, 4.2 degrees C and 2.2 degrees C. Hence, it was recommended that in order to reduce the land surface temperature of urban areas, sustainable urban planning strategies that include increasing the vegetated areas and embracing other green initiatives such as urban forestry should be adopted.

TI  - Human Rights Under Attack: What Comes Next?
T2  - ETHICS & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Review
AB  - Samuel Moyn argues that the human rights movement, which thrived in the 1970s and peaked after the Cold War, became dominated by a misplaced focus on sufficiency rather than equality, ultimately abetting neoliberalism. He deplores the rise and fall of an egalitarian and redistributive worldview, from the Jacobin era to the slow decline of socialism in the twentieth century, culminating in ineffectual and unambitious human rights endeavors. Here Moyn cavalierly dismisses the enormous achievements of the human rights movement in many countries, overlooking the contributions of unsung heroes who fought for human rights at the peril of their lives. Even readers who share Moyn's political perspective will find little solace, either in the form of lessons learned or in forward-looking strategies for addressing socioeconomic inequity and other human rights violations of our time.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) can significantly alter seasonal vegetation phenology which in turn affects the global and regional energy balance. These are the most important parameters of surface-atmosphere interactions and climate change. Methods for retrieving LSTs from satellite remote-sensing data are beneficial for modeling hydrological, ecological, agricultural and meteorological processes on the Earth's surface. This paper assesses the geospatial patterns of LST using correlations of the seasonally integrated normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) in the southeastern region of Bangladesh from 2001 to 2016. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series datasets for LST and SINDVI were used for estimations in the study. From 2001 to 2016, the MODIS-based land surface temperature in the southeastern region of Bangladesh was found to have gently increased by 0.2 degrees C (R-2 = 0.030), while the seasonally integrated normalized difference vegetation index also increased by 0.43 (R-2 = 0.268). The interannual average LSTs mostly increased across the study areas, except in some coastal plain and tidal floodplain areas of the study. However, the SINDVI increased in the floodplain and coastal plain regions, except for in hilly areas. Physiographically, the study area is a combination of low lying alluvial floodplains, river basin wetlands, tidal floodplains, tertiary hills, terraced lands and coastal plains in nature. The hilly areas are mostly covered by dense forests, with the exception of agricultural areas. The impacts of increased LSTs were inversely correlated for the hilly areas and areas with forest coverage; LSTs were conversely correlated for the floodplain region, and tree cover outside of the forest and agricultural crops. This study will be very helpful for the protection and restoration of the natural environment.

TI  - Mesoscale Atmospheric Cyclonic Vortices over the Black and Caspian Seas as Seen in Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This is an analysis of optical images from Terra, Aqua, and Suomi NPP satellites, as well as associated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Radarsat-1/2 and Sentinel-1A/1B satellites, which reflect mesoscale atmospheric cyclonic vortices (MACV) and local cyclones over the Black and Caspian seas. The MACVs are observed both in the cloudiness field on optical images and in the sea-surface roughness field on SAR images, induced by the near-surface wind. The analysis SAR images of the sea surface and optical images combined with NCEP reanalysis has allowed us to obtain both qualitative and quantitative data on these phenomena. The formation of MACVs has been shown to occur rather frequently over the eastern Black Sea, as well as over the northern and middle Caspian Sea. They are 50 to 200 km in diameter, their lifetime is usually almost a day, and they can create wind speeds of 10-12 m/s over the sea surface. From time to time, they can deepen and lead to a sharp deterioration in the local and regional weather.

TI  - Expanding dialogical analysis across (sub-)cultural backgrounds
T2  - CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to develop a diagram as a tool for analysing empirical data concerning the issue of difference of subcultural backgrounds and worldviews in the dialogue and its implications to the psychological practice in social work. From a theoretical view on dialogical and cultural psychology, we will trace the roots of selected contemporary dialogical and social representation theories and elaborate on it how distinct subcultures of interlocutors can produce misunderstandings when the professional interprets the utterance of the other. Focusing the social pedagogic practice, we will approach dialogues between people that belong to different cultural contexts as instances of the challenges in the communication, i.e. pedagogues and adolescents, doctors and patients, people belonging to different societies, etc. We argue that the theoretical approach presented and discussed here is part of a general understanding of communication processes, showing that despite mutual understanding will never be fully achieved in a dialogical situation, the possibility of sharing meanings and senses depends on the effort to take into consideration the worldview of the other in the background of what is presently uttered.

TI  - Dynamic Assessment of Soil Water Erosion in the Three-North Shelter Forest Region of China from 1980 to 2015
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the risk and dynamic change trends of water erosion status and intensity spatial distribution in the Three-North Shelter Forest Project (TNSFP) region from 1980 to 2015, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), after integrating precipitation, soil characteristics, vegetative cover, topography, land use, and a cover management factor weighted with rainfall during flood seasons, was employed. The results illustrated that soil conservation improved and the average water erosion rate decreased from 530 to 230 t/ (km(2) a) following vegetation restoration and land use changes. The water erosion area decreased by 17% in the study area, and 78% of the area tended to be stable. However, a deteriorated region of 14.87 million km(2) area was determined to be an erosional risk region, mainly distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region and the southwestern Sandstorm region, which should be a priority for conservation measures. The new approach to calculate C-factor values, fully considering rainfall intensity as an appropriate weight, provided a rational and reliable estimate of the C-factor on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Further, it was found that the effectiveness of forest land use in reducing water erosion is a significant priority. These results will be useful for soil conservation management and the planning of TNSFP in the future.

TI  - Construction of the 500-m Resolution Daily Global Surface Water Change Database (2001-2016)
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is the most dynamic land-cover type. Transitions between water and nonwater types (such as vegetation and ice) can happen momentarily. More frequent mapping is necessary to study the changing patterns of water. However, monitoring of long-term global water changes at high spatial resolution and in high temporal frequency is challenging. Here we report the generation of a daily global water map data set at 500-m resolution from 2001 to 2016 based on the daily reflectance time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Each single-date image is classified into three types: water, ice/snow, and land. Following temporal consistency check and spatial-temporal interpolation for missing data, we conducted a series of validation of the water data set. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 94.61% and 93.57%, respectively, when checked with classification results derived from 30-m resolution Landsat images. Both the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy reached better than 90% when compared with manually interpreted large-sized sample units (1,000mx1,000m) collected in a previous global land cover mapping project. Generally, the global inland water area reaches its maximum (similar to 3.80x10(6)km(2)) in September and minimum (similar to 1.50x10(6)km(2)) in February during an annual cycle. Short-duration water bodies, sea level rise effects, different types of rice field use can be detected from the daily water maps. The size distribution of global water bodies is also discussed from the perspective of the number of water bodies and the corresponding water area. In addition, the daily water maps can precisely reflect water freezing and help correct water areas with inconsistent cloud flags in the MOD09GA quality assessment layer.Plain Language Summary Daily global inland surface water maps are produced from more than 1.9 million frames of satellite images for the period of 2001-2016 with a spatial resolution of 500m. From this time series of maps, we found that the inland surface water on Earth varies greatly in area within an annual cycle. It can reach more than 3.8 million square kilometers in September and reduce to approximately 1.5 million square kilometers in February. We demonstrate that (1) short-duration water bodies in arid areas, which are particularly important to life, can be detected from these daily water maps; (2) sea level rise effects on land submersion can be detected over some gentle-slope coasts like west Florida; and (3) different types of rice field use exist in the world. For example, in California, United States, rice fields are filled with water after harvest to help create a wetland environment for wild birds in the winter.

TI  - Role of simvastatin in tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphangiogenesis plays a crucial role in promoting cancer metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) and beyond. Increasing data have shown that simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering medication for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, is involved in tumor growth and dissemination, and endothelial functions. This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of simvastatin on lymphatic formation and LN metastasis. Tumor models were established by subcutaneous injection of B16-F10 melanoma cells into mouse hind footpads. Simvastatin was administered (0.2 mu g/g, intraperitoneal injection, IP) every other day for a total of eight times. Tissue samples were removed and examined by immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. The lymphatics of LN, skin, liver, and lung exhibited morphological changes, and LN weight and metastatic area of the tumor group treated with simvastatin was lower than that of the untreated tumor group. Analysis of lymphatic size, area fraction, and lymphatic vessel density showed tissue specificity and variation to melanoma carcinogenesis in the simvastatin-treated group compared with the untreated group. In addition, LNs and cutaneous tissues showed altered expression of lymphangiogenic factors and inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF-A/-C/-D and TNF-. These findings indicated that simvastatin may modify lymphangiogenesis and tumor progression in malignant melanoma.

TI  - Study on the Identification Method of Glacier in Mountain Shadows Based on Landsat 8 OLI Image
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are extremely sensitive to climate change. And glacier changes have great impacts on the regional climate, ecology, water resources and so on. Remote sensing images are often used to study glacial changes. For plateau mountainous areas, the images usually have a larger area of the mountain shadows. Shadows cause loss or distraction of the information reflected by the ground target, making remote sensing image difficult to understand. Therefore, the identification of glaciers in the mountain shadow area based on remote sensing images becomes a technical difficulty. In this study, a large mountain glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was chosen as experimental subject. Based on Landsat 8 OLI data, this study first analyzed the reflection characteristics of different bands for glacier and non-glacier in shadow area. The results showed that due to the fact that direct light is blocked and target objects in a shadow area are mainly irradiated by the scattered light, the blue band which has shorter wavelength and higher intensity of the scattered light is preferred band for glacier identification in shaded area. For longer wavelength band, the reflectance of ground target in the entire shadow region is very low, and it is difficult to distinguish between glaciers or non-glacial regions. On this basis, a shaded glacier information enhanced index is proposed. Compared with the conventional glacier information extraction methods, the proposed method can give a result to identify the segmentation threshold more clearly in the histogram; and get the best result both in accuracy of the extracted boundary and the total area. For largescale glacier extractionin the plateau mountainous area, it is recommended to use the proposed method which can be helpful in improving the overall work efficiency.

TI  - Monitoring loss and recovery of mangrove forests during 42 years: The achievements of mangrove conservation in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are valuable ecosystems that have been protected and restored for decades in China. However, little is known about achievements of China's mangrove conservation efforts, This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of these efforts by presenting long-term dynamics of mangrove forests areal extent at the national scale. To achieve this goal, 123 Landsat images, covering all the mangrove forests in China from 1973 to 2015, were interpreted. For the first time, we built a new dataset of China's mangrove forest changes during past 42 years called Chinese Academy of Sciences Mangroves (CAS_Mangroves). Based on this dataset, we conducted case studies in seven mangrove national nature reserves to show dramatic changes of mangrove forests before and after the establishment of the reserves. Results showed that: 1) on the national scale, mangrove forests declined from 48,801 ha to 18,702 ha between 1973 and 2000, then partially recovered to 22,419 ha in 2015; 2) in each reserve, the areal extent of mangrove forests increased immediately after the reserve was established. Depending on our analysis, in the early time, agricultural reclamation caused the loss of mangrove forests; in contrast, recently, protection and reforestation actions prompt to mangrove forest restoration greatly. Because of China's conservation efforts, since 2000, direct destruction by human beings has rarely happened, and natural disasters and the existing artificial seawalls have become major threats to mangrove forest in China. This study is an application of remote sensing technologies in evaluating effectiveness of conserving natural resources. And the experiences and achievements of China's mangrove conservation efforts presented in this study will facilitate the development of applicable coastal management strategies globally, especially in developing countries.

TI  - A NE-Trending Oblique-Slip Fault Responsible for the 2016 Zaduo Earthquake (Qinghai, China) Revealed by InSAR Data
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Twelve Sentinel-1 images are used to measure the surface displacements caused by the Zaduo earthquake on 17 October 2016 in Qinghai, China. Comprehensive analysis of the local geologic structure, focal mechanisms, relocated aftershocks, and fault geometrical parameters from nonlinear inversions of the InSAR data indicates that a NE-trending fault with a strike of61 degrees, namely the Aduo fault, was responsible for this event. Further geodetic inversions for finite fault models show that the dip angle of this fault is 75 degrees to the SE. The majority of the slip occurred at the depth from 5km to 17km, and the normal-slip component was comparable to the strike-slip component. The peak slip of31cm occurred at a depth of10km. The InSAR determined moment is 9.61x10(17) Nm with a rigidity of 30 GPa, equivalent to Mw 5.9. The geological map reveals that the Aduo fault was characterized by a left-lateral strike-slip component in the past, as evidenced by the offset of Paleogene sedimentary rocks. Our results for the Zaduo earthquake suggest that the Qiangtang block probably consists of two or more sub-blocks with different eastward extrusion velocities and that the deformation of the Qiangtang block is occurring not only along its boundaries but also in its interior.

TI  - Detecting Surface Changes Triggered by Recent Volcanic Activities at Kilauea, Hawai'i, by using the SAR Interferometric Technique: Preliminary Report
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent eruptive activity at Kilauea Volcano started on at the end of April in 2018 showed rapid ground deflation between May and June in 2018. On summit area Halemaumau lava lake continued to drop at high speed and Kilauea's summit continued to deflate. GPS receivers and electronic tiltmeters detected the surface deformation greater than 2 meters. We explored the time-series surface deformation at Kilauea Volcano, focusing on the early stage of eruptive activity, using multi-temporal COSMO-SkyMed SAR imagery. The observed maximum deformation in line-of-sight (LOS) direction was about -1.5 meter, and it indicates approximately -1.9 meter in subsiding direction by applying incidence angle. The results showed that summit began to deflate just after the event started and most of deformation occurred between early May and the end of June. Moreover, we confirmed that summit's deflation rarely happened since July 2018, which means volcanic activity entered a stable stage. The best-fit magma source model based on time-series surface deformation demonstrated that magma chambers were lying at depths between 2-3 km, and it showed a deepening trend in time. Along with the change of source depth, the center of each magma model moved toward the southwest according to the time. These results have a potential risk of including bias coming from single track observation. Therefore, to complement the initial results, we need to generate precise magma source model based on three-dimensional measurements in further research.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Polarimetric SAR Calibration Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the diverse applications of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems, it is a crucial to conduct polarimetric calibration, which aims to remove the radar system distortion effects prior to utilizing polarimetric SAR observations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of different polarimetric calibration methods. Two widely used methods, the Van Zyl and Quegan methods, and one recently proposed method, such as the Villa method, have been selected among various calibration methods in literature. The selected methods have basic differences in their assumptions that are applied to the polarimetric system model. In order to evaluate the calibration performances under different system parameters and ground characteristics, comparative analysis of the calibration results were conducted on synthetic polarimetric SAR data and ALOS PALSAR quad-pol mode data. Based on the experimental results, the advantages and limitations of different methods were clarified, and a simple hybrid calibration method is presented to further improve the polarimetric calibration performance.

TI  - Classification of Landslide Activity on a Regional Scale Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry at the Moselle Valley (Germany)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major natural hazard which can cause significant damage, economic loss, and loss of life. Between the years of 2004 and 2016, 55,997 fatalities caused by landslides were reported worldwide. Up-to-date, reliable, and comprehensive landslide inventories are mandatory for optimized disaster risk reduction (DRR). Various stakeholders recognize the potential of Earth observation techniques for an optimized DRR, and one example of this is the Sendai Framework for DRR, 2015-2030. Some of the major benefits of spaceborne interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) techniques, compared to terrestrial techniques, are the large spatial coverage, high temporal resolution, and cost effectiveness. Nevertheless, SAR data availability is a precondition for its operational use. From this perspective, Copernicus Sentinel-1 is a game changer, ensuring SAR data availability for almost the entire world, at least until 2030. This paper focuses on a Sentinel-1-based Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) post-processing workflow to classify landslide activity on a regional scale, to update existing landslide inventories a priori. Before classification, a Line-of-Sight (LOS) velocity conversion to slope velocity and a cluster analysis was performed. Afterwards, the classification was achieved by applying a fixed velocity threshold. The results are verified through the Global Positioning System (GPS) survey and a landslide hazard indication map.

TI  - Analysis of rain fall and the temperature of Coimbatore District using land use and land cover change detection by image segmentation
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation is a process has done for the classification of high resolution remote sensing images in the present research work. The segmentation results are capable of influencing the subsequent process effects. An image can be partitioned into a number of disjoint segments which is used to represent the image structures. It is found that it is more compact to represent an image and the low level and high structures can be combined. There are different types of methods to segment an image namely, threshold-based, edge-based and region-based. Region growing approach is image segmentation methods in which the neighboring pixels are examined and merged with the class region in case of no edges are detected. The iteration is done for every pixel boundary. Unlike gradient and Laplacian methods, the edges of the region are found by the region growing and it is perfectly their region. The images are determined by the LANDSAT TM satellite data. The remote sensing technique is used for collecting information about the Coimbatore district. The sensed data is a key to many diverse applications. The contribution of this work for Coimbatore district is to find the change of the Land used and Land covered in the entire region and also to find the changes in the green lands, vegetation and Land surface utilized for urban area. The neighboring regions are taken into account and the similarities are checked in the growing process. No single region is allowed to dominate the entire proceedings. A certain number of regions are allowed to grow at a time. Comparable regions will gradually combine into expanding regions. The Control of these methods may be quite complicated but efficient methods have been developed. The directions of growing pixels are easy and efficient to implement on parallel computers. The threshold-based segmentation is completely depending on the gray level images which regards the reflectivity of the featured images. It determines a threshold based on brightness of the ground objects. It is purely from the image background. But it is rapid and its uncertainty is significant. It is not convenient to process multi-spectral images.

TI  - Assessing the Spatial Drivers of Land Use and Land Cover Change in the Protected and Communal Areas of the Zambezi Region, Namibia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) changes is fundamental for rational and specific planning for sustainable land management. Using remote sensing techniques, geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical modeling via multinomial logistic regression, we sought to identify spatial variables that determine LULC change and their extent over time in the protected and communal areas of the Zambezi Region, Namibia. Multi-temporal satellite imagery of the Landsat series was used to map changes over a period of twenty-six years, divided into three stages (1984-1991, 1991-2000 and 2000-2010). Post classification change detection methodologies were used to determine conversions between LULC classes. Additionally, socio-economic characteristics of the area were used to identify drivers of changes. Four spatial drivers of LULC change that we identified included the distance to the nearest road, distance to settlements, population density and fire return periods. Population density, distance to settlements and fire return period were significantly associated with conversion from crop/grass land to crop/grass land and forest land to crop/grass, forest land to bare land and forest land to forest land in the protected area. In communal areas, distance to the road was found to significantly influence conversion from crop/grass land to crop/grass land. The study concluded that the influence of these drivers is attributable to distinct political and agro-demographical differences during the study period. Policy makers and planners need to take these drivers into consideration together with their subsidiaries to respond and make sound decisions regarding undesirable changes in LULC.

TI  - A phenology-based approach to the classification of Arctic tundra ecosystems in Greenland
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The disproportionate warming in the Arctic and the resulting adverse ecosystem changes underline the importance of continued monitoring of these ecosystems. Land-cover classification maps of the Arctic regions are essential for monitoring and change detection purposes, as well as upscaling of various ecosystem processes. However, large-scale land cover maps of the Arctic regions are often too coarse to properly capture the heterogeneity of these landscapes. In this study, we bridge this gap through incorporating multi temporal Landsat-8 OLI data in a large-scale land cover classification, and subsequently produce a tundra classification map for the entire Greenland. An algorithm is developed that allows for the extraction of vegetation phenology from single year time series of 4169 OLI scenes at 30 m resolution despite the low revisit frequency of the satellite and persistent cloud cover. The phenological metrics, satellite-derived wetness, and terrain information are then used to separate land surface classes using a random forest classifier. The optimal algorithm parameters and input layers are identified, ultimately yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 89.25% across the studied area. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis on the resulting land-cover map and for the first time presented the geographical distribution, latitudinal gradients, and climate linkages of the various tundra vegetation classes across the ice-free part of Greenland. With a resolution of 30 m and Greenland-wide spatial coverage, the produced land-cover map can support various applications at scales ranging from the landscape to regional level.

TI  - A conceptual framework for environmental risk and social vulnerability assessment in complex urban settings
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - High numbers of weather-related mortalities are associated with extreme heat events in the United States. Satellite data confirms that urbanization leads to higher temperatures within microclimates and formation of heat pockets that are linked to higher risks of heat related illnesses and heat stroke. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of different surface types on the impact of UHI by looking at physical properties of the urban system through a framework to formulate risk and social vulnerabilities. A conceptual model was developed using data from Landsat, department of building, U.S. census and USGS. The factors of interest include people, environment, and building/infrastructure. This model quantifies risk as a function of temperature and physical properties of the surrounding environment. Results show, neighborhoods of Manhattan, Queens and Bronx are at the highest risk of social and environmental vulnerability and should be targeted for policy changes, implementation of green infrastructures and vegetation coverage to counteract the heating effects. Neighborhoods which need to be targeted for urban planning due to high environmental risk are Harlem, Upper Manhattan, East Harlem, Elmhurst, Jamaica, Ridgewood, Flatbush, University height and Woodlawn.

TI  - A Weighted Overlay Method for Liquefaction-Related Urban Damage Detection: A Case Study of the 6 September 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake, Japan
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analyses to observe ground displacements and assess damage after the M 6.6 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake in northern Japan on 6 September 2018. A multitemporal SAR coherence map is extracted from 3-m resolution ascending (track 116) and descending (track 18) ALOS-2 Stripmap datasets to cover the entire affected area. To distinguish damaged buildings associated with liquefaction, three influential parameters from the space-based InSAR results, ground-based LiquickMap (from seismic intensities in Japanese networks) and topographic slope of the study area are considered together in a weighted overlay (WO) analysis, according to prior knowledge of the study area. The WO analysis results in liquefaction potential values that agree with our field survey results. To investigate further, we conducted microtremor measurements at 14 points in Hobetsu, in which the predominant frequency showed a negative correlation with the WO values, especially when drastic coherence decay occurred.

TI  - Systematic review of sentinel lymph node biopsy in Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor arising on the head and neck in 40%-50% of patients. Between 20% and 40% will harbor subclinical nodal metastasis. Methods Using search terms 'Merkel AND sentinel', MEDLINE, PUMED, and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed for publications regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in classification I and II MCC of the head and neck. Results Twenty-nine publications encompassing 136 patients were included. The SLNB finding was positive in 42 patients (30.9%). Primary MCC was located on the malar/zygomatic (34.4%), forehead/frontal (13.5%), and nasal (13.5%) regions. Recurrence in an SLNB negative nodal basin result occurred in 10 patients (false negative rate of 19.2%). Site of primary MCC was not associated with a false-negative SLNB result; however, there was a non-statistically significant trend for increased frequency among midline lesions. Conclusions Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is recommended for eligible patients with classification I and II head and neck MCC.

TI  - Model for Estimation of Global Horizontal Irradiance in the Presence of Dust, Fog, and Clouds
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The poor spatial resolution of available ground data provides an opportunity to estimate solar irradiation from computational models based on the satellite data. The developed model employs various spectral bands of the satellite data and focuses on distinguish weather signatures, such as: dust, aerosols, fog, and clouds. These parameters affect the solar radiation availability all over the world. However, for a tropical country like India, which is potentially rich in solar energy resources, the study of these parameters is of crucial importance. A modified version of the HELIOSAT model is developed and an all-day index based on various bands of satellite data is introduced. Results are validated against the ground data recorded at various stations of the Indian Meterological Department as well as with the Meteosat East data.

TI  - Romanticism As The Mirroring Of Modernity and The Emergence of Romantic Modernization in Islamism
T2  - CUMHURIYET ILAHIYAT DERGISI-CUMHURIYET THEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The emphasis that the modernity gives to disengagement and beginning leads one to think that the modernity itself is in fact a culture that initiares crisis. Even if there is no initial crisis, it can be created through the ambivalent nature of modernity. Behind the concept of crisis lies the notion that history is a continuous process or movement that opens the door to nihilistic understanding which stems from the idea of contemporary life and thought alienation through the pessimistic meaning of the word. There is a dialectical relationship between the ideas of modernity and progress, and the decadence, and the main theme of Nietzsche's philosophical career. Since the death of Hegel, who made the idea of crisis plausible, everything is nothing but a counter-movement not only in Germany, but also in Europe. The first of these counter-movements is romanticism with its objection to the mind which is liberated from the bonds of tradition. The main thesis of the present article is, between reactiveness of romanticism -on the surface- and the modernity; from one side romanticism's consuming modernity, which is its mirror image, while at the same time feeding from it and modernity's manipulating the ideas developed against it and monopolizing them thanks to its ambivalent nature. For this purpose, following an an anti-enlightenment thinker Nietzsche's, anti-romantic footsteps which at the same time feeds from the romantic heritage, an attempt will be made to analyze the relationship between modernity and romanticism. Another goal of this article is to allow a comparison of how the intellectual development in the West finds its response on the modernization process of our country by probing how the modernization experience of early period Islamist's who experienced this process in a feeling of "b ackwardness" and with a wounded consciousness and anxiety has led to a shallow romantic worldview.

TI  - Impact of land use on the efficiency of carbon sequestry in the south of the Amazon
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to analyze the efficiency of the sequestered carbon in different land use cover between 1989 and 2016 in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso, located at the southern border of the Amazon. Two orbital images of the Landsat series (TM and OLI) were analyzed, both from July. The best classification method of land use and occupation was selected, and some band compositions were tested. The assessment of the efficiency of the sequestered carbon was made by the CO(2e)flux index. For the classification of the classes, the selected method was maximum likelihood, with composition of bands: medium infrared, near infrared and red. In 27 years, the area classified as agriculture increased by 172.90%, and the native vegetation was the most affected (-45.26%) in area loss. The work identified a reduction in the average of the carbon sequestration efficiency of native vegetation (48.48%) and the total area (52.17%), which occurred due to the loss of native vegetation, in which it consists of the coverage of greater photosynthetic activity, therefore greater fixed carbon. The study concludes that changes in land use impact on the carbon sequestration efficiency of the study area in 27 years.

TI  - Estimating recreational fishing fleet using satellite data in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (Mediterranean Sea)
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Mediterranean Sea, recreational fishing is part of the local culture and has been practiced for centuries using various techniques and gears. Yet, recreational fishing effort and catches are not officially recorded in most Mediterranean countries, Greece included. The objective of this work was to estimate the number of vessels fishing for recreational purposes in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (Greece) using two independent sources of data. Firstly, we physically visited 42 ports and marinas across the Greek Aegean Sea coastline and counted the recreational vessels. Secondly, we used satellite image frames (from Google Earth) to count the recreational vessels at the same and in additional 620 ports and marinas of the entire Aegean (420 ports) and Ionian (200 ports) coastlines, including the inhabited islands. The agreement between the in situ visits and the satellite data was very high (correlation coefficient r = 0.96, P < 0.001), indicating that Google Earth is a valuable and low cost tool that provides useful information for fisheries management. According to the satellite data, the total number of recreational fishing vessels was about 24,650 in the 462 ports of the Aegean Sea and 7000 in the 200 ports of the Ionian Sea; this adds up to a total number of around 31,650 recreational fishing vessels in Greek waters, which agrees with the number of recreational fishing licenses issued in 2014 but is lower compared to previous estimates. Most vessels were recorded near large cities, where the majority of inhabitants are concentrated and in islands, where the majority of tourists spend their time.

TI  - Integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR for volcano mapping and monitoring through image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical and laser remote sensing provide resources for monitoring volcanic activity and surface hydrothermal alteration. In particular, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging can be used for detecting lithologies and mineral alterations on the surface of actively degassing volcanoes. This paper proposes a novel workflow to integrate existing optical and laser remote sensing data for geological mapping after the 2012 Te Maari eruptions (Tongariro Volcanic Complex, New Zealand). The image classification is based on layer-stacking of image features (optical and textural) generated from high-resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, Light Detection and Ranging data (LiDAR) derived terrain models, and aerial photography. The images were classified using a Random Forest algorithm where input images were added from multiple sensors. Maximum image classification accuracy (overall accuracy = 85%) was achieved by adding textural information (e.g. mean, homogeneity and entropy) to the hyperspectral and LiDAR data. This workflow returned a total surface alteration area of similar to 0.4 km(2) at Te Maari, which was confirmed by field work, lab-spectroscopy and backscatter electron imaging. Hydrothermal alteration on volcanoes forms precipitation crusts on the surface that can mislead image classification. Therefore, we also applied spectral matching algorithms to discriminate between fresh, crust altered, and completely altered volcanic rocks. This workflow confidently recognized areas with only surface alteration, establishing a new tool for mapping structurally controlled hydrothermal alteration, evolving debris flow and hydrothermal eruption hazards. We show that data fusion of remotely sensed data can be automated to map volcanoes and significantly benefit the understanding of volcanic processes and their hazards.

TI  - Glacial Lakes in the Nepal Himalaya: Inventory and Decadal Dynamics (1977-2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers, in general, are shrinking and glacial lakes are evolving and growing rapidly in number and size as a result of climate change. This study presents the latest remote sensing-based inventory (2017) of glacial lakes (size >= 0.0036 km(2)) across the Nepal Himalaya using optical satellite data. Furthermore, this study traces the decadal glacial lake dynamics from 1977 to 2017 in the Nepal Himalaya. The decadal mapping of glacial lakes (both glacial-fed and nonglacial-fed) across the Nepal Himalaya reveals an increase in the number and area of lakes from 1977 to 2017, with 606 (55.53 +/- 16.52 km(2)), 1137 (64.56 +/- 11.64 km(2)), 1228 (68.87 +/- 12.18 km(2)), 1489 (74.2 +/- 14.22 km(2)), and 1541 (80.95 +/- 15.25 km(2)) glacial lakes being mapped in 1977, 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017, respectively. Glacial lakes show heterogeneous rates of expansion in different river basins and elevation zones of Nepal, with apparent decadal emergences and disappearances. Overall, the glacial lakes exhibited similar to 25% expansion of surface areas from 1987 to 2017. For the period from 1987 to 2017, proglacial lakes with ice contact, among others, exhibited the highest incremental changes in terms of number (181%) and surface area (82%). The continuous amplified mass loss of glaciers, as reported in Central Himalaya, is expected to accompany glacial lake expansion in the future, increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). We emphasize that the rapidly increasing glacial lakes in the Nepal Himalaya can pose potential GLOF threats to downstream population and infrastructure.

TI  - The role of somatisms in the Bashkir toponymy
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to the study of the characteristic features of geographical terms and toponyms, formed from somatisms in the Bashkir language on the basis of metaphorization. A diverse landscape of the Republic of Bashkortostan, with steppes and forest-steppes being replaced by taiga, forests, mountain peaks and thousands of rivers and hundreds of lakes cutting through the natural landscape, gave birth to a specific geographical terminology in the Bashkir language. In total, more than 60 somatic terms have been identified, among which the names of the visible parts of the body, rather than of the internal organs, prevail. Most of the geographical terms-somatisms are universal for all Turkic languages. As seen from the factual material, the words bas 'head', hyrt 'back', arqa 'back', qul 'arm', moron 'nose', tamaq 'throat', (sic) 'eye' etc. are the most frequent in all Turkic languages, including Bashkir. Some words are presented showing the specific use of somatisms in certain Turkic languages. The study reveals the characteristic geographical terms of the Bashkir toponymy and explains the features of their origin in connection with the mythological view and the worldview of the Bashkirs. It is noted that the mountainous and water landscapes differ according to the somatisms used; a specific representation of each of them is revealed. According to the linguistic materials, the Bashkir mountain is personified by a living creature that faces the subject. The subject perceives only its visible part from the top to the slope. Therefore, only the parts of the body above the waist are used among somatisms. As concerns the names of large rivers, they represent a person with all of his/her external body parts from head to foot. The water space is represented in the language picture of the Bashkir world as something being stretched.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soyang Lake has been contributing to economic growth by preventing flood damage in the metropolitan area, the water level in the middle to upper flow of lake has been greatly decreased due to the drought in 2015. In order to restore the existing flow rate, Bupyungbo has been built in Bupyeongri, Shin Nam-myeon, Inje-gun to cause artificial changes on the sedimentary environment of Bupyeong freshwater region. Therefore, this study intends to confirm the changes of sedimentary environment since Bupyeongbo has been utilized. For this study, we used the Sentinel-2 satellite image data periodically to measure the dimension of water according to the volume of water kept near Bupyung district and analyzed the particle size and the percentage of water content of the sediments through field study. The Sentnel-2 satellite images showed us how the water surface has been changed and that during the period from September 2017 to October 2018, the minimum and maximum area of water surface was observed in June 2018 and in January 2018, respectively. In addition, we find that the smaller being the particle size, the higher having the water content and that there is higher the correlation between the water content and the grain size of the sediment layer. Hereafter, if we will acquire the drone images at Bupyung district, we expect that we will be able to measure the distribution of sediments in the same area according to different time periods and observe various kinds of sediment through field work.

TI  - Reflection Symmetry of PALSAR Quad-Pol Imagery in the Amazon Rainforest
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents reflection symmetry of polarimetric SAR over the Amazon rainforest in terms of correlation coefficients between the pairs of HH- and HV-pol and VV- and VH-pol data by ALOS PALSAR. The reflection symmetry is defined as a non-zero correlation between HH- and HV-pol and VV- and VH-pol over natural distributed targets, and is a fundamental assumption for cross-talk calibration coefficient computation and for three-component decomposition for polarimetric SAR data. The Amazon rainforest is especially one of the common global reference sites for the reflection symmetry. The correlation coefficients for the pairs of reflection symmetry obtained in this study range from 0.018 to 0.097. The results imply that there exists a non-negligible dependency between co-pol and cross-pol in the distributed natural targets, and consequently the non-zero correlation must be considered as a potential contribution to errors of spaceborne SAR polarimetry to some extent.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of fireworks using aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol optical properties (AOP) from Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sunphotometer, and PM data were observed in Gwangju, South Korea and Shanghai, China. During the Lunar New Year period in 2014, the PM2.5 concentration by fireworks in Shanghai showed the highest concentration (356 mu g/m(3)) on the day of Lunar New Year, and air pollutants of long-range transport by fireworks were affected the increase of PM(10 )concentration and aerosol optical depth over the Korean peninsula (PM10: 129 mu g/m(3), AOD: 0.68). These results show that the effect of fireworks, which was recognized as a local air pollution problem, can be transported to the Korean peninsula from China. The results of this study can be very useful for monitoring the atmosphere by firework effect over the Korean Peninsula.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)

AB  - Researchers constantly seek more efficient detection techniques to better utilize enhanced image resolution in accurately detecting and monitoring land cover. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown high performances comparable to or even better than widely used and adopted machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of CNNs for land cover classification by using two-dimensional (2-D) spectral curve graphs from multispectral satellite images. The land cover classification was conducted in Concord, New Hampshire, USA, and South Korea by using multispectral images acquired from 30-m Landsat-8 and 500-m Geostationary Ocean Color Imager images. For the construction of input data specific to CNNs, two seasons (winter and summer) of multispectral bands were transformed into 2-D spectral curve graphs for each class. Land cover classification results of CNNs were compared with the results of support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RFs). The CNNs model showed higher performance than RFs and SVMs in both study sites. The examination of land cover classification maps demonstrates a good agreement with reference maps, Google Earth images, and existing global scale land cover map, especially for croplands. Using the spectral curve graph could incorporate the phenological cycles on classifying the land cover types. This study shows that the use of a new transformation of spectral bands into a 2-D form for application in CNNs can improve land cover classification performance.

TI  - Comparison of Co-registration Algorithms for TOPS SAR Image
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For TOPS InSAR processing, high-precision image co-registration is required. We propose an image co-registration method suitable for the TOPS mode by comparing the performance of cross correlation method, the geometric co-registration and the enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) matching algorithm based on the spectral diversity (SD) on the Sentinel-1 TOPS mode image. Using 23 pairs of interferometric pairs generated from 25 Sentinel-1 TOPS images, we applied the cross correlation (CC), geometric correction with only orbit information (GC1), geometric correction combined with iterative cross-correlation (GC2, GC3, GC4), and ESD iteration (ESD_GC, ESD_1, ESD_2). The mean of coregistration errors in azimuth direction by cross correlation and geometric matching are 0.0041 pixels and 0.0016 pixels, respectively. Although the ESD method shows the most accurate result with the error of less than 0.0005 pixels, the error of geometric co-registration is reduced to 0.001 pixels by repetition through additional cross correlation matching between the reference and resampled slave image. The ESD method is not applicable when the coherence of the burst overlap areas is low. Therefore, the geometric co-registration method through iterative processing is a suitable alternative for time series analysis using multiple SAR data or generating interferogram with long time intervals.

TI  - Spatial disaggregation of ASCAT soil moisture under all sky condition using support vector machine
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With recent advances in downscaling methodologies, soil moisture (SM) estimation using microwave remote sensing has become feasible for local application. However, disaggregation of SM under all sky conditions remains challenging. This study suggests a new downscaling approach under all sky conditions based on support vector regression (SVR) using microwave and optical/infrared data and geolocation information. Optically derived estimates of land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land and atmosphere products were utilized to obtain a continuous spatio-temporal input datasets to disaggregate SM observation from Advanced SCATterometer in South Korea during 2015 growing season. SVR model was compared to synergistic downscaling approach (SDA), which is based on physical relationship between SM and hydrometeorological factors. Evaluation against in situ observations showed that the SVR model under all sky conditions (R: 0.57 to 0.81, ubRMSE: 0.0292 m(3) m(-3) to 0.0398 m(3) m(-3)) outperformed coarse ASCAT SM (R: 0.55 to 0.77, ubRMSE: 0.0300 m(3) m(-3) to 0.0408m(3)m(-3)) and SDA model (mean R: 0.56 to 0.78, ubRMSE: 0.0324 m(3) m(-3) to 0.0436 m(3) m(-3)) in terms of statistical results as well as sensitivity with precipitation. This study suggests that the spatial downscaling technique based on remote sensing has the potential to derive high resolution SM regardless of weather conditions without relying on data from other sources. It offers an insight for analyzing hydrological, climate, and agricultural conditions at regional to local scale.

TI  - The Korean Poet Yoon Dong Ju's <i>Cross</i> and its Image of Martin Luther
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SINO-WESTERN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korean poet Yoon, Dong Ju was born in Myongdong village in 1917, and grew an intelligent student at Yongjeong ,Northern Gando in China from 1931. His family set out to build a Christian community at the base of Northern Gando in China. At the time, Northern Gando had been integrated with the transmission of Chosun Nationalism and Christianity. There are two similarities that Yoon, Dong Ju and Luthor, Martin; the Korean poet who died at the prison of Japan for the rebellious ideas in 1945 and the German theologist who argued for the Reformation of the corrupted Catholic Church in 1517, have in common. First ,they are both devout believers. They considered leading a life in accordance with the teachings of Jesus as their most important calling. As such, they did not deny their beliefs in the moments of unjust trials in which their lives were being threatened. Second 'they were citizens of powerless countries, each devoted to uniting their nations and forming a common identity through their works written in their native language. Despite the 500-year difference of their time and spatial distance between them, they both pose the same contemporary question of "How do we live a good life as ethical believers (Ethos) ,as writers that communicate with readers (Pathos) , and as intellects who strive for logical reasoning (Logos) ?" By analyzing the concerns of the poetic narrator in 'The Cross' ,written by S. Korea's major poet Yoon, Dong Ju, this study intends to reflect upon the common attitude or Christian intellects who stand against the unjustifiable execution forced by existing power structures,across all ages and countries.

TI  - A Study on the Radiometric Correction of Sentinel-1 HV Data for Arctic Sea Ice Detection
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, active research on the Arctic Ocean has been conducted due to the influence of global warming and new Arctic ship route. Although previous studies already calculated quantitative extent of sea ice using passive microwave radiometers, melting at the edge of sea ice and surface roughness were hardly considered due to low spatial resolution. Since Sentienl-1A/B data in Extended Wide (EW) mode are being distributed as free of charge and bulk data for Arctic sea can be generated during a short period, the entire Arctic sea ice data can be covered in high spatial resolution by mosaicking bulk data. However, Sentinel-1A/B data in EW mode, especially in HV polarization, needs significant radiometric correction for further classification. Thus, in this study, we developed algorithms that can correct thermal noise and scalloping effects, and confirmed that Arctic sea ice and open-water were well classified using the corrected dual-polarization SAR data.

AB  - A 61-year-old woman with a breast tumor detected by mammography examination was admitted to our hospital. Ultrasonography showed a 15.5*7.2mm sized irregular mass at the left BD area. Vacuum-assisted biopsy did not reveal any malignant cells. After 3 months, ultrasonography reexamination showed that the irregular mass had increased to 24.2*16.5mm in size, and it had spread to multiple axillary lymph nodes. The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer by core needle biopsy of the axillary lymph node. Total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological diagnosis was solid-tubular carcinoma with infarcted necrosis. The number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes was confirmed to be 23 in total. This case was considered very rare and important because there have been very few reports of breast cancer with infarcted necrosis.

M3  - Article
AB  - The short period variability of the duration of the occurrence of stable snow cover and the concentration of marine ice is revealed and compared for Northern Eurasia and the adjacent area of the Arctic Ocean against a background of multiannual variations in indices of atmospheric correlation in 2000-2015. The main principles of multiannual variations in the characteristics are determined. No correlation between the multiannual tendencies and interannual variability is found. Nonetheless, the calculation of the Fourier harmonics allowed identification of three five-year periods similar for all characteristics: 2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2014. The most intense variations of the duration of the occurrence of stable snow cover and concentration of marine ice from one five-year period to another are typical of the East European Platform in contrast to the noticeable but small variations for Siberia.

TI  - Utilization of Indocyanine Green to Aid in Identifying Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Merkel Cell Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a relatively rare skin cancer with high rates of regional lymph node involvement and metastatic spread. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for staging purposes. The goal of this study is to report our experience utilizing indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-based technology to aid in SLNB detection in MCC.Methods: Consecutive MCC patients who underwent SLNB with radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy, with intraoperative handheld gamma probe, and ICG-based fluorescence imaging from 2012 to 2017 were prospectively studied (Cohort A). A group of historical controls that underwent SLNB for MCC with radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy and vital blue dye (VBD) (lymphazurin or methylene blue dye) was also analyzed (Cohort B).Results: Twenty-four consecutive patients underwent SLNB with lymphoscintigraphy and ICG-based fluorescence and 11 controls underwent SLNB with lymphoscintigraphy and VBD. The localization rate by node with VBD was 63.6% and ICG-based fluorescence was 94.8%. For two patients, a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) was detected only by ICG-based fluorescence and the nodes were not detected by gamma probe and one patient's only positive node was identified via ICG fluorescence only. VBD or gamma probe did not identify any unique positive SLNs in either cohort B or either cohort, respectively.Conclusions: In this study, we indicate that ICG-based fluorescence is not only feasible to augment SLN identification, but it has a higher node localization rate as compared to blue dye and it was able to identify positive SLNs otherwise missed by gamma probe. This study suggests the importance of utilizing two modalities to augment SLN identification and that ICG-based fluorescence may be able to identify nodes that would have been otherwise missed by gamma probe. We will continue to follow these patients and enroll more patients in this prospective study to further determine the role that ICG-based fluorescence has in identifying sentinel lymph nodes in MCC.

TI  - Analyzing Transformational Development as Engagement with African Millennials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MISSION
M3  - Article
AB  - This research focuses on the missiological and diaconal prospects of inclusion of the millennial generation (18-35 years of age) as agents of transformational development in Africa. Transformational development takes place on three levels to address the dichotomies of the modern worldview; spiritual world (gospel as word), seen world (gospel as deed), and the excluded middle (gospel as sign). The literature study shows that although millennials make up the largest population group in Africa, they are not adequately involved in transformational development, neither by the church nor by other agents of development. The article uses the transformational praxis "model" of Kritzinger and Saayman to discuss the possible role of millennials in transformational development in Africa, which includes several dimensions important for a holistic view of transformational development: spirituality, agency, contextual understanding, scrutiny, interpretation of tradition, discernment for action, and reflexivity.

T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The foundations of an effective and evidence-based training program are the metrics, which characterize optimal performance.Purposes: To develop, operationally define, and seek consensus from procedure experts on the metrics that best characterize a reference approach to the performance of a closed reduction and internal fixation of a 31A2 unstable pertrochanteric fracture with a cephalomedullary nail with distal locking through the proximal guide.Methods: A Metrics Group consisting of 3 senior orthopaedic surgeons, a surgeon/medical scientist, an education expert and a behavioural scientist deconstructed the performance of the selected fixation procedure and defined performance metrics. At a modified Delphi meeting, 32 senior orthopaedic and trauma surgeons from 18 countries critiqued these metrics and their operational definitions before reaching consensus.Results: Initially performance metrics consisting of 14 Phases with 62 Steps, 84 errors and 20 Sentinel errors were identified that characterize the safe and effective performance of the procedure. During the Delphi panel meeting these were modified and consensus was reached on 15 Phases (1 added, p = 0.967)) with 75 Steps (14 added and 1 deleted; p = 0.028), 88 errors (10 added and 6 deleted; p = 0.47), and 28 Sentinel errors (8 added; p = 0.107). Pre and Post Delphi characterizations were highly correlated (r = 0.81-0.94).Conclusions: Surgical procedures can be broken down into constituent, essential, and elemental tasks necessary for the safe and effective completion of a reference approach to a specified procedure. Procedure experts from 18 countries reached consensus on performance metrics for the fixation procedure. This metric-based characterization should form the basis of more quantitative validation studies to guide the construction of a proficiency-based progression training curriculum.

TI  - A Coupling Model for Soil Moisture Retrieval in Sparse Vegetation Covered Areas Based on Microwave and Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important component of natural water cycles and plays a crucial role for the healthy development of ecological environment in arid and semiarid areas. Microwave remote sensing techniques are promising to rapidly monitor regional soil moisture. However, major difficulties associated with retrieving soil moisture via microwave remote sensing are attributed to effects of surface roughness and vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potentials of combined roughness parameters and develop a model that mostly relies on the satellite data and requires minimum a priori information for soil moisture inversion over sparse vegetation covered areas through combing Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GF-1 data. For the purpose, the impacts of vegetation on the radar backscattering coefficient were removed by the water-cloud model (WCM) and a new roughness parameter Zs (Zs = S-3/L is defined as a combined roughness parameter) was proposed by simulating relationships between surface roughness parameters, soil moisture, and backscattering coefficients using advanced integral equation model (AIEM). On the basis, a coupling model of soil moisture inversion for blown-wind areas of the Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, China, was in turn developed with Radarsat-2 HH and VV polarization data, and the soil moisture content (SMC) values for sparse vegetation covered surfaces were retrieved with limited use of in situ roughness parameters. The in situ measurements and satellite data set were used to validate the reliability of the developed model. The results showed that the retrieved soil moisture levels fell below in situ soil moisture levels before the vegetation effect was removed, and the precision of retrieved soil moisture was effectively improved when the vegetation effect was corrected by the WCM, with the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error decreasing from 7.45% and 6.24% to 5.12% and 3.44%, respectively. According to the map of retrieved soil moisture levels generated for the study area, most of SMCs were below 35% in accordance with field observations. These study results can serve as a foundation for monitoring soil moisture and water environments in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - Geomorphic trajectory and landform analysis using graph theory: A panel data approach to quantitative geomorphology
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing successive datasets of GIS polygons derived from remote-sensing data is a common approach to quantify morphological change. GIS-derived datasets capture instantaneous observations or "snapshots" of the state of a system at a given time but do not explicitly capture the temporal sequences needed to characterize system processes. Comparisons between these "temporally-naive" datasets can be used to infer properties and trends of the landscape as a whole, but tracking changes in the characteristics of individual landforms (e.g. sandbars, dunes, or other surface features of interest) across snapshots is labor-intensive and infeasible for large or irregular datasets. Using traditional computer-based procedural methods to compare sequences of datasets without knowledge of temporal trajectories introduces several challenges and data artifacts that complicate analysis. We propose a graph-theory approach for processing sequential spatial data to automatically identify and track distinct groups of related landforms or "geomorphic units" across fully or partially overlapping snapshots. This approach allows tracking even in cases where landforms fragment, merge, migrate, or become temporarily obstructed from view. The method promotes new panel data analysis opportunities and overcomes three critical limitations of traditional procedural methods of assessing landscape change from spatial data: (1) it can generate landscape metrics based on geomorphic units, rather than the arbitrary geographic units of the underlying spatial datasets, (2) it distinguishes missing or obstructed observations from changes in the characterization of landforms due to environmental conditions, and (3) it automatically generates panel datasets and discriminates between within-landform change and across-landform variation. The panel datasets can be used to upscale feature-level information to system-level metrics and analysis. Furthermore, a graph-theory approach can yield insight on geomorphic change through analysis of the graph structure, and offers a promising approach for geomorphological analyses which retain information on the spatial configuration of geomorphic units. We demonstrate the method with examples from emergent sandbars on the Missouri River.

TI  - Twenty-Five Years of Reforestation on Nonforest Lands in Smolenskoe Poozerye National Park According to Landsat Imagery Assessment
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation on nonforest lands (including abandoned agricultural lands) in Smolenskoe Poozerye National Park has been assessed from summer Landsat image series taken in 1984 to 2016. The boundaries of nonforest lands have been delimited using cartographic materials from the 1970s-1980s. The continuous time series of reflectance for each pixel of spectral bands have been obtained by the simple moving average method. Thematic processing is performed using the Random Forest supervised classification algorithm. An analysis of the obtained cartographic products for different stages of recovery successions shows a monotonous decrease in open soil areas from 3651 ha (9.7%) in 1990 to 1489 ha (4%) in 2016. Almost 38% of nonforest lands had been covered by woody vegetation by 1990. The area of forest lands increased by about 18% over the next 25 years (generally due to deciduous species); half of this forest growth was observed during the 1990s. In 2015, 46.0% of the initial nonforest lands were naturally reforested by young birch forests and 9.6% were occupied by young pine forests. Ground survey data showed that the type of succession is primarily determined by the lithological conditions and species composition of the nearby forests and influences the pattern of preceding land use during the natural reforestation of nonforest lands.

TI  - Earth-Observation-Based Estimation and Forecasting of Particulate Matter Impact on Solar Energy in Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the impact of dust aerosols on surface solar radiation and solar energy in Egypt based on Earth Observation (EO) related techniques. For this purpose, we exploited the synergy of monthly mean and daily post processed satellite remote sensing observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations utilizing machine learning, in conjunction with 1-day forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As cloudy conditions in this region are rare, aerosols in particular dust, are the most common sources of solar irradiance attenuation, causing performance issues in the photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) plant installations. The proposed EO-based methodology is based on the solar energy nowcasting system (SENSE) that quantifies the impact of aerosol and dust on solar energy potential by using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in terms of climatological values and day-to-day monitoring and forecasting variability from MODIS and CAMS, respectively. The forecast accuracy was evaluated at various locations in Egypt with substantial PV and CSP capacity installed and found to be within 5-12% of that obtained from the satellite observations, highlighting the ability to use such modelling approaches for solar energy management and planning (M&P). Particulate matter resulted in attenuation by up to 64-107 kWh/m(2) for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and 192-329 kWh/m(2) for direct normal irradiance (DNI) annually. This energy reduction is climatologically distributed between 0.7% and 12.9% in GHI and 2.9% to 41% in DNI with the maximum values observed in spring following the frequent dust activity of Khamaseen. Under extreme dust conditions the AOD is able to exceed 3.5 resulting in daily energy losses of more than 4 kWh/m(2) for a 10 MW system. Such reductions are able to cause financial losses that exceed the daily revenue values. This work aims to show EO capabilities and techniques to be incorporated and utilized in solar energy studies and applications in sun-privileged locations with permanent aerosol sources such as Egypt.

TI  - [One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification method - what is the future of sentinel lymph node management?]
T2  - Ceska gynekologie
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The article summarizes current possibilities of usage of the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification method (OSNA) in the perioperative management of sentinel lymph nodes in oncologic surgery. The principle of this method is the detection of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) in the lymphatic tissue as a marker of the metastatic spread.DESIGN: Review article.SETTINGS: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Department of Immunochemistry, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Sikls Department of Pathology, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague.METHODS: The review of the literature published until the end of April 2017 available on the PubMed database was performed. The official abbreviation OSNA and the full name of the method One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification was used for search in this database.CONCLUSION: The usage of the OSNA method with the detection of CK 19 in the sentinel lymph nodes as a marker of metastatic spread to the lymphatic tissue currently represents an acceptable form of perioperative sentinel lymph node management in patients with breast and colorectal cancer. Until now published data are pointing towards possible successful application of this method in sentinel lymph node management in patients with some other malignancies, such as thyroid carcinoma, gastric cancer, uterus cancer and head and neck cancer. More data is needed to establish this method also in those neoplasms.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Climate Variability on Wildfires in the N'Zi River Watershed in Central Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the impact of climate variability on wildfire regime in the N'Zi River Watershed (NRW) in central Cote d'Ivoire. For that purpose, MODIS active fire and monthly burned area data are used to evaluate wildfire occurrence, impacts and trends. Wildfire data are compared to past trends of different climatic parameters extracted from long-term meteorological records. Generalized additive models and Spearman correlations are used to evaluate the relationships between climate variables and wildfire occurrence. Seasonal Kendall and Sen's slope methods were used for trend analysis. Results showed that from 2001 to 2016, 19,156 wildfire occurrences are recorded in the NRW, of which 4443 wildfire events are observed in forest, 9536 in pre-forest, and 5177 in Sudanian zones. The burned areas are evaluated at 71,979.7 km(2), of which 10,488.41 km(2) were registered in forest, 33,211.96 km(2) in pre-forest, and 28,279.33 km(2) in Sudanian zones. A downward trend is observed in fire records. The results indicates a strong correlation between some climatic variables and wildfire regime in this ecoregion. These correlations can be used to develop models that could be used as prediction tools for better management of fire regimes and support decision-making in the NRW.

TI  - Modelling glacial lake outburst flood impacts in the Bolivian Andes
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bolivian Andes have experienced sustained and widespread glacier mass loss in recent decades. Glacier recession has been accompanied by the development of proglacial lakes, which pose a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk to downstream communities and infrastructure. Previous research has identified three potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the Bolivian Andes, but no attempt has yet been made to model GLOF inundation downstream from these lakes. We generated 2-m resolution DEMs from stereo and tri-stereo SPOT 6/7 satellite images to drive a hydrodynamic model of GLOF flow (HEC-RAS 5.0.3). The model was tested against field observations of a 2009 GLOF from Keara, in the Cordillera Apolobamba, and was shown to reproduce realistic flood depths and inundation. The model was then used to model GLOFs from Pelechuco lake (Cordillera Apolobamba) and Laguna Arkhata and Laguna Glaciar (Cordillera Real). In total, six villages could be affected by GLOFs if all three lakes burst. For sensitivity analysis, we ran the model for three scenarios (pessimistic, intermediate, optimistic), which give a range of similar to 1100 to similar to 2200 people affected by flooding; between similar to 800 and similar to 2100 people could be exposed to floods with a flow depth 2m, which could be life threatening and cause a significant damage to infrastructure. We suggest that Laguna Arkhata and Pelechuco lake represent the greatest risk due to the higher numbers of people who live in the potential flow paths, and hence, these two glacial lakes should be a priority for risk managers.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of hyperspectral remote sensing of high spatial resolution is compared to conventional ground-based forest surveys on sample plots and is considered as a possible alternative to these labor-intensive works. Pattern recognition methods have become the principal approach used to solve this type of applied problems. Pattern recognition processing of hyperspectral images serves to identify different classes of objects as well as to determine their parameters, such as the net primary productivity of forests with different ages and species composition. The employed classifiers use the latest advances in forest pattern recognition based on hyperspectral images. The classification accuracy is compared to the accuracy of ground-based observations. The results indicate the promise of the proposed novel approach.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Reinforces Antitumour T cell Response in Urothelial Urinary Bladder Cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence indicates that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may promote antitumour immune responses by activating T cells. The tumour-draining sentinel node (SN) is a key site to study tumour-specific T cell activation, being the primary immunological barrier against the tumour. In this prospective study, we set out to elucidate the effects of NAC on T cell subsets in the SNs of patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. We found that CD8(+) effector T (Teff) cell exhaustion was reduced after NAC treatment, while cytotoxicity was increased. Additionally, in complete responders (CR patients), these cells were functionally committed effectors, as displayed by epigenetic analysis. In CD4(+) Teffs, NAC treatment was associated with increased clonal expansion of tumour-specific SN-derived cells, as demonstrated by a specific cell reactivity assay. In contrast, we observed an attenuating effect of NAC on regulatory T cells (Tregs) with a dose-dependent decrease in Treg frequency and reduced effector molecule expression in the remaining Tregs. In addition, multicolour flow cytometry analysis revealed that CR patients had higher Teff to activated Treg ratio, promoting antitumoural T cell activation. These results suggest that NAC reinforces the antitumour immune response by activating the effector arm of the T cell compartment and diminishing the influence of suppressive Tregs.Patient summary: In this report, we analysed the effect of chemotherapy on immune cell subsets of 40 patients with advanced bladder cancer. We found that chemotherapy has a positive effect on immune effector T cells, whereas an opposite, diminishing effect was observed for immune-suppressive regulatory T cells. We conclude that chemotherapy reinforces the antitumour immune response in bladder cancer patients. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

TI  - Can We Improve Parametric Cyclonic Wind Fields Using Recent Satellite Remote Sensing Data?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Parametric cyclonic wind fields are widely used worldwide for insurance risk underwriting, coastal planning, and storm surge forecasts. They support high-stakes financial, development and emergency decisions. Yet, there is still no consensus on a potentially best parametric approach, nor guidance to choose among the great variety of published models. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that recent progress in estimating extreme surface wind speeds from satellite remote sensing now makes it possible to assess the performance of existing parametric models, and select a relevant one with greater objectivity. In particular, we show that the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission of NASA, along with the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), are able to capture a substantial part of the tropical cyclone structure, and to aid in characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of a number of parametric models. Our results suggest that none of the traditional empirical approaches are the best option in all cases. Rather, the choice of a parametric model depends on several criteria, such as cyclone intensity and the availability of wind radii information. The benefit of using satellite remote sensing data to select a relevant parametric model for a specific case study is tested here by simulating hurricane Maria (2017). The significant wave heights computed by a wave-current hydrodynamic coupled model are found to be in good agreement with the predictions given by the remote sensing data. The results and approach presented in this study should shed new light on how to handle parametric cyclonic wind models, and help the scientific community conduct better wind, wave, and surge analyses for tropical cyclones.

CP  - International Conference on Maritime Spatial Planning, Ecosystem Approach and Supporting Information Systems (MaPSIS)
CL  - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN
AB  - The Dolgaya spit is the large accumulative bodies on the Russian coast of the Sea of Azov. Plots of natural forest steppe and wetland landscapes with unique flora and fauna were preserved there. A part of the Dolgaya spit is a natural landmark of regional significance. Sand and shell beaches of the Dolgaya spit are actively used for recreational purposes being the basis of social and economic development of the Dolzhanskaya resort. The presence of anthropogenic and natural threats impedes sustainable development of the Dolgaya spit geographical complex. Our study is aimed at search of a solution to this issue.Field studies that include the analysis of natural features and anthropogenic changes were carried out in the course of the work. In addition, the conducted studies were based on the analysis of the remote sensing data. An important part of the research were opinion polls and the analysis of urban planning and statistical information.As the results of the social researches show, the most attractive natural factors in the choice of the Dolzhanskaya resort as the place of vacation are the sea, the beaches, clean dry air, steppe vegetation and spaciousness. Negative factors are predominantly social and economic ones: low level of recreational infrastructure and service, poor transport accessibility.The lack of a balanced strategy impedes the development of the Dolzhanskaya resort. Uncontrolled development resulted in excessive traffic and recreational load, spontaneous development, lack of transport and recreational infrastructure and destruction of natural landscapes. The situation is aggravated by serious natural threats. The distal part of the northeast coast of the spit erodes and draws back.On the basis of the received information, it was possible to develop recommendations on economic use and conservation of the Dolgaya spit. The landscape approach in the scientifically grounded organization of the functional and morphological structure of the resort and reservation within the Dolgaya spit will help to maintain and develop its economic and environmental potential.

TI  - Assessment of Runoff Pattern and Relationship to Sediment Yield of Bhagirathi-Alaknanda River Basin Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosion has been as a major issue in Bhagirathi and Alaknanda river basins due to high surface runoff. The river basins are located in the Uttarakhand state of India and have a total basin area of 19,066.5 km(2). Sediment yield has been estimated and then correlated with the surface runoff using geospatial techniques during the period 2000-2015. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to estimate the sediment yield. All required layers for assessment of runoff and sediment yield has been prepared in a geographical information system environment. Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall data (0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) runoff data (0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) elevation data (30 m), and Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images (30 m) have been used to prepare rainfall maps, runoff maps, relief maps, and land use/land cover maps respectively. The study has shown that the sediment yield, as well as runoff, has a non-monotonic trend during 2000 to 2015. The highest runoff has been observed in the year 2013 whereas minimum runoff was in the year 2009. Correspondingly, the highest and lowest sediment yields were observed in the years 2013 and 2009 respectively. The northern part of the catchment was observed to be more vulnerable with respect to high sediment yield as well as runoff. As a whole, both river basins have a strong positive correlation between sediment yield and runoff with R-2 values of 0.8. With respect to the findings, it can be concluded that some of the reservoirs for hydropower projects within these river basins may be in danger in the near future due to high sediment yields.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability of Coccolithophore Blooms in the Eastern Bering Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coccolithophores are a widespread group of marine phytoplankton that produce plates of calcium carbonate that cover their cells. Large blooms of coccolithophores may significantly influence the biogeochemical properties of the ocean and atmosphere and trophic dynamics of the marine ecosystem. Because of the important implications of coccolithophore blooms, their timely monitoring and reporting is necessary for ecosystem management. To communicate with ecosystem management stakeholders, we developed an annual Coccolithophore Bloom Index (CBI) for the eastern Bering Sea shelf using satellite ocean color data. Comparisons between in situ and satellite data and the CBI (years 1997-2017) were used to examine the hypotheses regarding environmental influences on interannual bloom variability. A significant nonlinear relationship with summer stratification was found: the CBI was higher during years with either very low or very high stratification. In addition, while the blooms usually occurred over the middle shelf (50- to 100-m depth), more of the bloom was located over the shallow (30-50m) inner shelf when stratification was low. Spatial correspondence between nutrient concentrations (nitrate and ammonium) and the areal extent of the coccolithophore bloom provides tantalizing but nonconclusive evidence that nutrient availability plays a role in bloom formation and location.Plain Language Summary Intense blooms of coccolithophores, phytoplankton that occur in all of the world's oceans, have been implicated in seabird die-offs and other effects on the food web. These blooms turn the ocean milky white and can be seen from space. Because of important implications of coccolithophore blooms, monitoring and reporting is necessary for ecosystem management. We developed a measure of spatial extent of coccolithophore blooms in the Bering Sea each September using satellite ocean color data and examined what conditions are favorable to bloom formation. The water column in this region is typically two layered during summer with warmer surface layer separated from colder deep layer. We found that the difference between the two layers (strength of stratification) was important. Coccolithophore blooms were larger during years with either very weak or very strong stratification. In addition, while blooms usually occurred over the middle shelf (50- to 100-m depth), more of the bloom was located over the shallow (30-50m) inner shelf when stratification was weak. Nutrient availability likely plays a role in bloom formation and location. Understanding the factors leading to coccolithophore blooms may allow us to forecast blooms in the future, providing important advance information for resource managers.

TI  - A comparative study of available water in the major river basins of the world
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous large river basins of the world have few and irregular observations of the components of the terrestrial hydrological cycle with the exception of stream gauges at a few locations and at the outlet along with sparsely distributed rain gauges. Using observations from satellite sensors and output from global land surface models, it is possible to study these under-observed river basins. With populations greater than a billion people, some of these rivers (e.g., the Ganga-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Nile and the Mekong) are the economic engines of the countries they transect, yet thorough assessment of their flow dynamics and variability in regard to water resource management is still lacking. In this paper, we use soil moisture (0-2 m) and surface runoff from the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), evapotranspiration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and total water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to examine variability of individual water balance components. To this end, understanding the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability and the spatial variability of the water balance components in the major river basins of the world will help to plan for improved management of water resources for the future.

TI  - 14-year case series of eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma in Chinese patients and review of management
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) of the eyelid is a rare but potentially deadly cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th Edition T category for SGC correlated with metastasis and survival in the Chinese population.Methods This was a retrospective, single-centre cohort study. Patients with surgically resected eyelid SGC between January 2001 and May 2015 at the Hong Kong Eye Hospital were reviewed. Tumours were staged using the AJCC criteria. The main outcome measures included local recurrence, metastasis and death. Disease-free survival (DFS) was measured from the completion of treatment; overall survival was measured from the date of initial diagnosis.Results The study included 22 Chinese patients with a mean age of 65.4 years. The majority presented as a nodular lesion (91%) with 12 eyes (54.5%) initially misdiagnosed and a mean presentation time of 1 year. It was found that those with AJCC stage T2b or higher were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.002) when compared with those with stage T2a. Older age at diagnosis (P=0.035) and no misdiagnosis (P=0.025) were associated with shorter DFS. Those with stage 3a or higher were associated with shorter DFS (P=0.007) and overall survival (P=0.024).Conclusion Similar to previous reports, in this Chinese cohort, AJCC staging for SGC correlated with lymph node metastasis, DFS and overall survival. Those with stage 2b or higher on presentation will need closer surveillance for lymph node metastasis and may benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Safeguarding the Child and Adolescent Athlete
T2  - CURRENT SPORTS MEDICINE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Youth athletics can provide numerous benefits to children. Until recently, athletics have been relatively free from scrutiny over the ways they put participants at risk. While it was often disregarded in early childhood research, athletics emerged as an avenue of child abuse in the 1980s. Individual cases reporting maltreatment of children participating in sports certainly existed, but these were felt to be single instances, not sentinel events. By the 1990s a small body of research had been established showing a pattern of abuse, spurring sporting organizations and governing bodies to assess their own policies and produce rough standards for safeguarding children against abuse. While multiple strides have been taken, there still exist gaps in knowledge surrounding abuse of child and adolescent athletes. This article reviews the scope and prevalence of abuse in youth athletics, definitions and what ultimately constitutes "abuse," the unique aspects of abuse in sport, and recognition and preventative efforts.

TI  - A Cross-Cutting Approach to Surveillance and Laboratory Capacity as a Platform to Improve Health Security in Uganda
T2  - HEALTH SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global health security depends on effective surveillance for infectious diseases. In Uganda, resources are inadequate to support collection and reporting of data necessary for an effective and responsive surveillance system. We used a cross-cutting approach to improve surveillance and laboratory capacity in Uganda by leveraging an existing pediatric inpatient malaria sentinel surveillance system to collect data on expanded causes of illness, facilitate development of real-time surveillance, and provide data on antimicrobial resistance. Capacity for blood culture collection was established, along with options for serologic testing for select zoonotic conditions, including arboviral infection, brucellosis, and leptospirosis. Detailed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for all admissions were captured through a web-based system accessible at participating hospitals, laboratories, and the Uganda Public Health Emergency Operations Center. Between July 2016 and December 2017, the expanded system was activated in pediatric wards of 6 regional government hospitals. During that time, patient data were collected from 30,500 pediatric admissions, half of whom were febrile but lacked evidence of malaria. More than 5,000 blood cultures were performed; 4% yielded bacterial pathogens, and another 4% yielded likely contaminants. Several WHO antimicrobial resistance priority pathogens were identified, some with multidrug-resistant phenotypes, including Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. Leptospirosis and arboviral infections (alphaviruses and flaviviruses) were documented. The lessons learned and early results from the development of this multisectoral surveillance system provide the knowledge, infrastructure, and workforce capacity to serve as a foundation to enhance the capacity to detect, report, and rapidly respond to wide-ranging public health concerns in Uganda.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Desertification in an Arid Oasis Using Remote Sensing Data and Spectral Index Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is an environmental problem worldwide. Remote sensing data and technique offer substantial information for mapping and assessment of desertification. Desertification is one of the most serious forms of environmental threat in Morocco, especially in the oases in the south-eastern part of the country. This study aims to map the degree of desertification in middle Draa Valley in 2017 using a Sentinel-2 MSI (multispectral instrument) image. Firstly, three indices, namely, tasselled cap brightness (TCB), greenness (TCG) and wetness (TCW) were extracted using the tasselled cap transformation method. Secondly, other indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and albedo, were retrieved. Thirdly, a linear regression analysis was performed on NDVI-albedo, TCG-TCB and TCW-TCB combinations. Results showed a higher correlation between TCW and TCB (r = -0.812) than with that of the NDVI-albedo (r = -0.50). On the basis of this analysis, a desertification degree index was developed using the TCW-TCB feature space classification. A map of desertification grades was elaborated and divided into five classes, namely, nondesertification, low, moderate, severe and extreme levels. Results indicated that only 6.20% of the study area falls under the nondesertification grade, whereas 26.92% and 32.85% fall under the severe and extreme grades, respectively. The employed method was useful for the quantitative assessment of desertification with an overall accuracy of 93.07%. This method is simple, robust, powerful, and easy to use for the management and protection of the fragile arid and semiarid lands.

TI  - Super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images: Learning a globally applicable deep neural network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 satellite mission delivers multi-spectral imagery with 13 spectral bands, acquired at three different spatial resolutions. The aim of this research is to super-resolve the lower-resolution (20 m and 60 m Ground Sampling Distance - GSD) bands to 10 m GSD, so as to obtain a complete data cube at the maximal sensor resolution. We employ a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform end-to-end upsampling, which is trained with data at lower resolution, i.e., from 40 -> 20 m, respectively 360 -> 60 m GSD. In this way, one has access to a virtually infinite amount of training data, by downsampling real Sentinel-2 images. We use data sampled globally over a wide range of geographical locations, to obtain a network that generalises across different climate zones and land-cover types, and can super-resolve arbitrary Sentinel-2 images without the need of retraining. In quantitative evaluations (at lower scale, where ground truth is available), our network, which we call DSen2, outperforms the best competing approach by almost 50% in RMSE, while better preserving the spectral characteristics. It also delivers visually convincing results at the full 10 m GSD.

TI  - Stages of Corporate Sustainability: Integrating the Strong Sustainability Worldview
T2  - ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Businesses are increasingly adopting sustainability, yet the environment continues to decline. This research responds to Dyllick and Muff's assertion that this paradox is caused by a constricted understanding of the meaning of corporate sustainability, lack of inclusion of constructs from related streams of literature, and failure to integrate micro and macro perspectives of sustainability. The current research addresses these concerns through an integration of 22 micro- and macro-level models of stages of development from literature in corporate sustainability, corporate social responsibility, environmental management, and sustainable development. This integration results in a new unified model of stages of corporate sustainability that broadens the current narrowly constricted understanding of corporate sustainability, extends the paradigm of corporate sustainability beyond the business case and into the realm of ecological science and strong sustainability, and sheds light on the paradox.

TI  - Effects of landscape pattern and vegetation type on the fire regime of a mesic savanna in Mali
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Savanna fires are a critical earth-system process that alter vegetation regionally and contribute to changes in atmospheric composition globally. The fire regime in savannas has shifted over time resulting in a large reduction in burned area. Savanna fires, which are human caused and set for a plethora of reasons, produce complex mosaic burned area patterns that tend to result in lower overall burned area. Mosaic fire regimes are difficult to detect and map accurately using available satellite data. Imagery-induced low-resolution bias makes it difficult to link fires with relevant environmental and anthropogenic factors, while higher resolution imagery is temporally less frequent. We explore how landscape pattern affects the fire regime in a mesic savanna by quantifying relationships between the spatial patterns of vegetation, which are shaped by natural and human factors, widely used ecological indices, and the seasonality and frequency of fires. The study finds that landscape pattern influences the fire regime; fire seasonality and frequency varied by landscape index at both the vegetation class and landscape scales. Percent cover, shape index and largest patch landscape ecological indices demonstrated the most consistency in burn date trends across scales. The study finds that landscape fragmentation-specifically a reduction in the size of patches and an increase in their number-results in an earlier fire regime. We conclude that fire intensity and severity will continue to decline as agriculture expands and landscapes fragment from agriculture in savannas. Our methods also demonstrate the ability to integrate landscape indices with coarse-resolution fire data.

TI  - HPV16 viral characteristics in primary, recurrent and metastatic vulvar carcinoma
T2  - PAPILLOMAVIRUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vulvar carcinoma is the fourth most common gynecological malignancy. Two separate carcinogenic pathways are suggested, where one is associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV16 the most common genotype.The aim of this study was to evaluate HPV-markers in a set of primary tumors, metastases and recurrent lesions of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCC). Ten HPV16-positive VSCC with metastatic regional lymph nodes, distant lymphoid/hematogenous metastases or local recurrent lesions were investigated for HPV genotype, HPV16 variant, HPV16 viral load, HPV16 integration and HPV16 E2BS3 and 4 methylation.In all 10 analyzed case series, the same HPV genotype (HPV16), HPV16 variant and level of viral load were detected in all lesions within a patient case. Primary tumors with a high E2/E6 ratio were found to have fewer vulvar recurrences and/or metastases after diagnosis and treatment. Also, a significantly lower viral load was evident in regional lymph nodes compared to primary tumors.The data presented strengthens the evidence for a clonal HPV-induced pathway for vulvar carcinoma.

TI  - Linking Landsat to terrestrial LiDAR: Vegetation metrics of forest greenness are correlated with canopy structural complexity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation metrics derived from satellite imagery provide continuous and large spatial-scale measurements that are critical for interpreting and predicting ecosystem function. However, uncertainty still remains as to the precise structural information that could be estimated from these metrics. Landsat-derived metrics provide pixel measurements of vegetation across the landscape, whereas Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides multidimensional data on the vertical arrangement of forests. Terrestrial LiDAR metrics of structural complexity describe the arrangement of vegetation in the canopy, and could be coupled with Landsat-derived metrics through their influence on energy and light. Linking Landsat to terrestrial LiDAR estimates of canopy structure could expand the interpretation of Landsat-derived metrics and broaden the spatial scale at which structural complexity can be evaluated. Here, we examined associations between Landsat-derived metrics and terrestrial LiDAR measurements of structural complexity. Structural complexity measurements were obtained with terrestrial LiDAR from plots within eight forested NEON sites across eastern North America. Vegetation metrics (NDVI, EVI, tasseled cap metrics) were calculated for corresponding locations from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Results showed that canopy reflectance, greenness and brightness, were linked with several measures of canopy structure. Higher levels of greenness were associated with stands having a taller canopy, greater leaf area density and variability, and a less open and porous canopy. Among greenness metrics, NDVI was most strongly correlated with structural complexity metrics (adj. R-2 = 0.52 - 0.62 for six metrics). Additionally, we found that a brighter canopy was associated with greater leaf area density and variability, canopy cover, porosity, and lower leaf clumping. Our results demonstrated the potential for large-spatial extent estimates of structural complexity using satellite imagery, and may lead to improved predictions of forest ecosystem functioning such as those predicted in "big leaf" ecosystem models.

TI  - Estimating the abundance of polar bears on Wrangel Island during late summer using high-resolution satellite imagery: a pilot study
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wrangel Island, Russia is well-known as a critical denning location in the Chukchi Sea polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population, but little is known about abundance and distribution of bears there. Our objective was to apply high-resolution satellite imagery (VHR; 0.3-0.5m resolution) methods to estimate the density and abundance of bears on Wrangel Island. We used image-differencing to search 9% of the island and count polar bears on WorldView-3 imagery. We calculated potential densities of polar bears under three stratification scenarios: (1) one stratum, assuming constant density across the search area; (2) two strata, delineated into a higher-density area within 8km around the coast and a lower density in the Wrangel Island interior; and (3) three strata such that the higher-density, coastal zone was bisected between the north and south coasts, since polar bears may be more likely to be present on the northern coast given the northward recession of sea-ice throughout summer. We counted 26 bears on this single image, resulting in density estimates ranging from 1 to 18 polar bears/100km(2). Assuming constant densities within each strata across the island, abundance estimates may range from 290 to 331 independent polar bears during August 2015. These estimates of density and abundance are comparable to previous research on Wrangel Island, although our estimates require ground validation and should be interpreted with caution. Using WV-03 imagery provides increased spatial resolution that is expanding applications and increasing our ability to detect polar bears.

TI  - Reducing harms from treatment. Sixteen years of surgery of the axilla for screen-detected breast cancers in Italy
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Available evidence on axillary surgery has accumulated dramatically in the last two decades in favor of less invasive care. The aim of this paper is to study 16-years trends in the surgical management of the axilla in a large population-based data set of screen-detected breast cancers in Italy and to document at what extent recommendations have been adopted in actual clinical care.Material and methods: This is a retrospective cohort study documenting the surgical management of the axilla in primary breast cancer patients over time. We retrieved from the Italian database of screen-detected cancers 41213 cases diagnosed in women aged 50-69 between years 2000 and 2015 in twelve Italian Regions.Results: In pN0 cases, an increasing trend (p < 0.001) in the number of patients who received sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as the only axillary staging procedure was observed. In pN + cases SLNB was the only staging procedure in an increasing number of patients (p < 0.001) especially since the publication of the ACOSOG-Z0011 paper. In ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) SLNB was more frequent in mastectomies and in high grade and large lesions. However, 45% of low grade, small DCIS over the whole time period had some form of axillary surgery.Conclusion: This large series of screen-detected cases documents a strong time trend in the direction of reducing axillary surgery and hence potential harms from treatment. The continuing practice of SLNB in low risk DCIS is of concern in an era of increasing awareness towards overdiagnosis and overtreatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Social Thinking®, Pseudoscientific, Not Empirically Supported, and Non-Evidence Based: a Reply to Crooke and Winner
T2  - BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IN PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - J. B. Leaf et al. (Behavior Analysis in Practice, 9, 152-157, 2016) wrote a commentary on social thinking (ST), an intervention commonly implemented for individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors described what constitutes scientific, pseudoscientific, and antiscientific evidence and contended that ST aligns with the definition of pseudoscience and, to date, is not empirically supported or evidence based. Crooke and Winner (Behavior Analysis in Practice, 9, 403-408, 2016) responded, arguing that ST meets their definition of an evidence-based practice and identifying purported misconceptions and inaccuracies described by J. B. Leaf et al. In the current article, the authors clarify the original arguments, critically evaluate Crooke and Winner's definition of what constitutes evidence-based practice, further evaluate the research on ST, discuss issues regarding how ST is conceptualized, and express concerns about the endorsement and use of an eclectic approach to treating ASD. As this response was written by behavior analysts, it specifically addresses the conceptual consistency of this approach from a behavior-analytic worldview.

TI  - THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE IN FREUD'S AND JUNG'S WORKS
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article compares the concept of culture in two versions of psychoanalysis: Freud's and Jung's. The carried out comparison is based on three main parameters: the problem of the origin of culture according to Freud and Jung works, the problem of its further development and the problem of the relationship between culture and nature. The article proves the thesis that the difference in understanding of culture in the concepts of Freud and Jung should not obscure the fact of their fundamental similarity, connected primarily with the commonality of the worldview assumptions. This resemblance lies first of all in assurance of both Freud and Jung that culture as it develops strives for its own integrity and rational transparency (although perhaps this goal can never be achieved). This approach undoubtedly has its advantages: it sets a clear teleological dimension to culture and it is supported by a strong philosophical tradition. At the same time as it is revealed in the article such approach has its flaw being unable to reconcile with others even when there are no major differences between them. Tragic but at the same time creatively productive gap between Freud and Jung is one example of this.

TI  - Analysis of the relationship between volcanic eruption and surface deformation in volcanoes of the Alaskan Aleutian Islands using SAR interferometry
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alaskan Aleutian Islands form one of the world's largest volcanic island chains. The islands are exposed to both direct and indirect damage from continuous volcanic eruptions. Surface deformation is mostly observed before volcanic eruption, but with some volcanoes, such as Ontake Volcano, deformations cannot be detected. In this study, we analyzed volcanic eruptions in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands, which is a region of frequent volcanic eruptions. Based on our results, we predicted the type of eruption that would occur on Baekdusan Volcano according to the presence or absence of surface deformation. For this purpose, 10 sites were selected from areas where recent volcanic activity had occurred in the Aleutian Islands. Additionally, Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS-PALSAR) and European Remote Sensing (ERS)-1/2 satellite data were obtained from 10 experimental sites. Based on the radar satellite data, the volcanic surface deformations were identified, and the characteristics of the volcanic eruption were quantitatively calculated by determining the presence of surface deformation. The results of this study should facilitate the process of correlation between volcanic eruption and surface deformation.

TI  - Detection of Surface Changes by the 6th North Korea Nuclear Test Using High-resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On September 3rd 2017, strong artificial seismic signals from North Korea were detected in KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration) seismic network. The location of the epicenter was estimated to be Punggye-ri nuclear test site and it was the most powerful to date. The event was not studied well due to accessibility and geodetic measurements. Therefore, we used remote sensing data to analyze surface changes around Mt. Mantap area.First of all, we tried to detect surface deformation using InSAR method with Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). Even though ALOS-2 data used L-band long wavelength, it was not working well for this particular case because of decorrelation on interferogram. The main reason would be large deformation near the Mt. Mantap area. To overcome this limitation of decorrelation, we applied offset tracking method to measure deformation. However, this method is affected by window kernel size. So we applied various window sizes from 32 to 224 in 16 steps. We could retrieve 2D surface deformation of about 3 m in maximum in the west side of Mt. Mantap.Second, we used Pleiadas-A/B high resolution satellite optical images which were acquired before and after the 6th nuclear test. We detected widespread surface damage around the top of Mt. Mantap such as landslide and suspected collapse area. This phenomenon may be caused by a very strong underground nuclear explosion test. High-resolution satellite images could be used to analyze non-accessible area.

TI  - Attributable Cost of Dementia: Demonstrating Pitfalls of Ignoring Multiple Health Care System Utilization
T2  - HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To determine dementia prevalence and costs attributable to dementia using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data with and without Medicare data. Data Sources VHA inpatient, outpatient, purchased care and other data and Medicare enrollment, claims, and assessments in fiscal year (FY) 2013. Study Design Analyses were conducted with VHA data alone and with combined VHA and Medicare data. Dementia was identified from a VHA sanctioned list of ICD-9 diagnoses. Attributable cost of dementia was estimated using recycled predictions. Data Collection Veterans age 65 and older who used VHA and were enrolled in Traditional Medicare in FY 2013 (1.9 million). Principal Findings VHA records indicated the prevalence of dementia in FY 2013 was 4.8 percent while combined VHA and Medicare data indicated the prevalence was 7.4 percent. Attributable cost of dementia to VHA was, on average, $10,950 per veteran per year (pvpy) using VHA alone and $6,662 pvpy using combined VHA and Medicare data. Combined VHA and Medicare attributable cost of dementia was $11,285 pvpy. Utilization attributed to dementia using VHA data alone was lower for long-term institutionalization and higher for supportive care services than indicated in combined VHA and Medicare data. Conclusions Better planning for clinical and cost-efficient care requires VHA and Medicare to share data for veterans with dementia and likely more generally.

TI  - Seasonal Variations in the Flow of Land-Terminating Glaciers in Central-West Greenland Using Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-terminating sectors of the Greenland ice sheet flow faster in summer after surface meltwater reaches the subglacial drainage system. Speedup occurs when the subglacial drainage system becomes saturated, leading to a reduction in the effective pressure which promotes sliding of the overlying ice. Here, we use observations acquired by the Sentinel-1a and b synthetic aperture radar to track changes in the speed of land-terminating glaciers across a 14,000 km(2) sector of west-central Greenland on a weekly basis in 2016 and 2017. The fine spatial and temporal sampling of the satellite data allows us to map the speed of summer and winter across the entire sector and to resolve the weekly evolution of ice flow across the downstream portions of five glaciers. Near to the ice sheet margin (at 650 m.a.s.l.), glacier speedup begins around day 130, persisting for around 90 days, and then peaks around day 150. At four of the five glaciers included in our survey the peak speedup is similar in both years, in Russell Glacier there is marked interannual variability of 32% between 2016 and 2017. We present, for the first time, seasonal and altitudinal variation in speedup persistence. Our study demonstrates the value of Sentinel-1's systematic and frequent acquisition plan for studying seasonal changes in ice sheet flow.

TI  - Utilizing Collocated Crop Growth Model Simulations to Train Agronomic Satellite Retrieval Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its worldwide coverage and high revisit time, satellite-based remote sensing provides the ability to monitor in-season crop state variables and yields globally. In this study, we presented a novel approach to training agronomic satellite retrieval algorithms by utilizing collocated crop growth model simulations and solar-reflective satellite measurements. Specifically, we showed that bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BLSTMs) can be trained to predict the in-season state variables and yields of Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) maize crop growth model simulations from collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m satellite measurements over the United States Corn Belt at a regional scale. We evaluated the performance of the BLSTMs through both k-fold cross validation and comparison to regional scale ground-truth yields and phenology. Using k-fold cross validation, we showed that three distinct in-season maize state variables (leaf area index, aboveground biomass, and specific leaf area) can be retrieved with cross-validated R-2 values ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 for significant portions of the season. Several other plant, soil, and phenological in-season state variables were also evaluated in the study for their retrievability via k-fold cross validation. In addition, by comparing to survey-based United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) ground truth data, we showed that the BLSTMs are able to predict actual county-level yields with R-2 values between 0.45 and 0.6 and actual state-level phenological dates (emergence, silking, and maturity) with R-2 values between 0.75 and 0.85. We believe that a potential application of this methodology is to develop satellite products to monitor in-season field-scale crop growth on a global scale by reproducing the methodology with field-scale crop growth model simulations (utilizing farmer-recorded field-scale agromanagement data) and collocated high-resolution satellite data (fused with moderate-resolution satellite data).

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of CDOM in shallow inland waters from a semi-analytical inversion of Landsat-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bottom reflectance is often the main cause of high uncertainty in Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) estimation for optically shallow waters. This study presents a Landsat-8 based Shallow Water Bio-optical Properties (SBOP) algorithm to overcome bottom effects so as to successfully observe spatial and temporal CDOM dynamics in inland waters. We evaluated the algorithm via 58 images and a large set of field measurements collected across seasons of multiple years in the Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Results showed that the SBOP algorithm reduced estimation errors by as much as 4 times (RMSE = 0.17 and R-2 = 0.87 in the Saginaw Bay) when compared to the QAA-CDOM algorithm that did not take into account bottom reflectance. These improvements in CDOM estimation are consistent and robust across broad range CDOM absorption. Our analysis revealed: 1) the proposed remote sensing algorithm resulted in significant improvements in tracing spatial-temporal CDOM inputs from terrestrial environments to lakes, 2) CDOM distribution captured with high re-solution land-viewing satellite is useful in revealing the impacts of terrestrial ecosystems on the aquatic environment, and 3) Landsat-8 OLI, with its 16 days revisit time, provides valuable time series data for studying CDOM seasonal variations at land-water interface and has the potential to reveal its relationship to adjacent terrestrial biogeography and hydrology. The study presents a shallow water algorithm for studying freshwater or coastal ecology, as well as carbon cycling science.

TI  - Assessment of the cloud liquid water from climate models and reanalysis using satellite observations
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We perform a model-observation comparison and report on the state-of-the-art cloud liquid water content (CLWC) and path (CLWP) outputs from the present-day global climate models (GCMs) simulations in CMIP3/CMIP5, two other GCMs (UCLA and GEOS5) and two reanalyses (ECMWF Interim and MERRA) in comparison with two satellites observational datasets (CloudSat and MODIS). We use two different liquid water observation products from CloudSat and MODIS, for CLWP and their combined product for LWC with a method to remove the contribution from precipitating and convective core hydrometeors so that more meaningful model-observation comparisons can be made. Considering the CloudSat's limitations of CLWC retrievals due to contamination from the precipitation and from radar clutter near the surface, an estimate CLWC is synergistically constructed using MODIS CLWP and CloudSat CLWC. The model-observation comparison shows that most of the CMIP3/CMIP5 annual mean CLWP values are overestimated by factors of 2 - 10 compared to observations globally. There are a number of CMIP5 models, including CSIRO, MPI, and the UCLA GCM that perform well compared to the other models. For the vertical structure of CLWC, significant systematic biases are found with many models biased significantly high above the mid-troposphere. In the tropics, systematic high biases occur at all levels above 700 hPa. Based on the Taylor diagram, the ensemble performance of CMIP5 CLWP simulation shows little or no improvement relative to CMIP3.

TI  - Retrieval of Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using Nonlinear Methods: A Case Study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with adverse health impacts on the population. Satellite observations and machine learning algorithms have been applied to improve the accuracy of the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations. In this study, we developed a PM2.5 retrieval approach using machine-learning methods, based on aerosol products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the NASA Earth Observation System (EOS) Terra and Aqua polar-orbiting satellites, near-ground meteorological variables from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), and ground-based PM2.5 observation data. Four models, which are orthogonal regression (OR), regression tree (Rpart), random forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were tested and compared in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China in 2015. Aerosol products derived from the Terra and Aqua satellite sensors were also compared. The 10-repeat 5-fold cross-validation (10 x 5 CV) method was subsequently used to evaluate the performance of the different aerosol products and the four models. The results show that the performance of the Aqua dataset was better than that of the Terra dataset, and that the RF algorithm has the best predictive performance (Terra: R = 0.77, RMSE = 43.51 g/m(3); Aqua: R = 0.85, RMSE = 33.90 g/m(3)). This study shows promise for predicting the spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5 using the RF model and Aqua aerosol product with the assistance of PM2.5 site data.

TI  - Land-Use Changes and Human Driving in and Near the Yangtze River Delta from 1995-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the characteristics and trends of land-use change in and near the coastal zone of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during five periods (1995, 2000 2005, 2010, and 2015) using remotely sensed Landsat imagery. Using automatic supervised classification combined with visual interpretation, we obtained land-use information for five study areas (Nantong, Shanghai, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Zhoushan). Significant land-use changes have occurred in this area between 1995 and 2015, characterized in particular by large reductions in cultivated land and rapid increases in urbanized land. In addition, land reclamation was very active in this period as an effective supplement to the increased demand for land development: since 1995, 1622 km(2) of land was reclaimed from near-coastal regions in the study area. This increase in urbanization was jointly driven by population, economic, transportation, and policy factors. Urban areas expanded from the center outward in concentric rings, with infrastructure guiding the radial expansion of development along transportation corridors, thus forming a network of connections. Due to the influence of national land regulation policies, the expansion rate of development in the YRD gradually diminished after 2010. This indicates that the area's resource and environmental carrying capacity has reached a saturation stage in which urbanization has transitioned from broad and incremental expansion to the intensive use of land resources.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining annually updated data of actually planted rice paddy is essential for evaluating food security and estimating methane emission. Paddy field in southern China generally displays unique phenological landscape changes from exposed soils, shallow flooding water, to rice plants during the whole growth period in a year. A phenology-based algorithm was developed to map the rice planted paddies in the Poyang Lake Plain (PLP), China, in 2014, a typical region in Central China single- and double-rice cropping belt. This algorithm, or a normalized vegetation index, was based on the normalization of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager-derived enhanced vegetation index and soil-adjusted vegetation index. It highlighted the temporal differences in vegetation cover and background soil between two critical growth phases of paddy rice, i.e., the flooding to transplanting stage and reproductive to ripening stage. There was estimated to be 7148.31 km(2) in the PLP, with an overall accuracy of 96.8% and the kappa coefficient of 0.97. Comparison between Landsat-detected results and the statistics of paddy field at the county level showed a high determination coefficient with the R-2 of 0.88. The phenology-based algorithm greatly facilitates rice farming monitoring at the regional scale.

TI  - HSF-Net: Multiscale Deep Feature Embedding for Ship Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection is an important and challenging task in remote sensing applications. Most methods utilize specially designed hand-crafted features to detect ships, and they usually work well only on one scale, which lack generalization and impractical to identify ships with various scales from multiresolution images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep feature-based method to detect ships in very high-resolution optical remote sensing images. In our method, a regional proposal network is used to generate ship candidates from feature maps produced by a deep convolutional neural network. To efficiently detect ships with various scales, a hierarchical selective filtering layer is proposed to map features in different scales to the same scale space. The proposed method is an end-to-end network that can detect both inshore and offshore ships ranging from dozens of pixels to thousands. We test our network on a large ship data set which will be released in the future, consisting of Google Earth images, GaoFen-2 images, and unmanned aerial vehicle data. Experiments demonstrate high precision and robustness of our method. Further experiments on aerial images show its good generalization to unseen scenes.

TI  - Using MAIAC AOD to verify the PM<sub>2.5</sub> spatial patterns of a land use regression model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information of PM2.5 is critical for air pollution control and epidemiological studies. Land use regression (LUR) models have been widely used for predicting spatial distribution of ground PM2.5. However, the predicted PM2.5 spatial patterns of a LUR model has not been adequately examined due to limited ground observations. The increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD) products might be an approximation of spatially continuous observation across large areas. This study established the relationship between seasonal 1 km x 1 km MAIAC AOD and observed ground PM2.5 in Beijing, and then seasonal PM2.5 maps were predicted based on AOD. Seasonal LUR models were also developed, and both the AOD and LUR models were validated by hold-out monitoring sites. Finally, the spatial patterns of LUR models were comprehensively verified by the above AOD PM2.5 maps. The results showed that AOD alone could be used directly to predict the spatial distribution of ground PM2.5 concentration at seasonal level (R-2 >= 0.53 in model fitting and testing), which was comparable with the capability of LUR models (R-2 >= 0.81 in model fitting and testing). PM2.5 maps derived from the two methods showed similar spatial trend and coordinated variations near traffic roads. Large discrepancies could be observed at urban-rural transition areas where land use characters varied quickly. Variable and buffer size selection was critical for LUR model as they dominated the spatial patterns of predicted PM2.5. Incorporating AOD into LUR model could improve model performance in spring season and provide more reliable results during testing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Capabilities of Chinese Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar in Selected Topics for Coastal and Ocean Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3), the first Chinese spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in C-band for civil applications, was launched on August 2016. Some studies have examined the use of GF-3 SAR data for ocean and coastal observations, but these studies generally focus on one particular application. As GF-3 has been in operation over two years, it is essential to evaluate its performance in ocean observation, a primary goal of the GF-3 launch. In this paper, we offer an overview demonstrating the capabilities of GF-3 SAR in ocean and coastal observations by presenting several representative cases, i.e., the monitoring of intertidal flats, offshore tidal turbulent wakes and oceanic internal waves, to highlight the GF-3's full polarimetry, high spatial resolution and wide-swath imaging advantages. Moreover, we also present a detailed analysis of the use of GF-3 quad-polarization data for sea surface wind retrievals and wave mode data for sea surface wave retrievals. The case studies and statistical analysis suggest that GF-3 has good ocean and coastal monitoring capabilities, though further improvements are possible, particularly in radiometric calibration and stable image quality.

TI  - Dasymetric mapping of urban population in China based on radiance corrected DMSP-OLS nighttime light and land cover data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution urban population dataset is increasingly required for sustainable urban planning and management. Dasymetric mapping is an effective approach to create such dataset. However, the created gridded total population datasets usually have limitation for urban analysis in developing countries as they usually underestimate urban population because of the strong urban-rural difference. In this study, we aimed to create a dataset of gridded urban population with 1 km resolution in China in year 2000 and 2010. We proposed an index of urban nighttime light (UNTL) by integrating radiance corrected DMSP nighttime light (RcNTL) and urban land, which is then used as weight to disaggregate county-level urban population. The validation using township population in Beijing as references shows reasonable accuracy with a mean relative error of 38% and a R-2 of 68%. Using only two widely available datasets (RcNTL and urban land), the proposed method is simple and computing efficient compared with methods using multiple geospatial data (e.g., land use and land cover, distance to city center, slope) and that combined with remote sensing imagery. As the used two auxiliary datasets are accessible globally, the method has great potential to produce similar urban population dataset for other developing countries where fine scale census population datasets are scarce. The produced urban population dataset is valuable for enriching our understanding of the urbanization process and designing sustainable urban planning and management strategies in China.

TI  - An Improved Automated Method to Detect Landfast Ice Edge off Zhongshan Station Using SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice is an important component of the Antarctic sea ice. Its edge generally advances offshore to its annual maximum extent by mid-winter before retreating later in spring. This study presents an automated method to detect the seaward landfast ice edge (SLIE) at its maximum extent in the beginning in the austral spring (October) for a region northeast of the Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctic. Here, the net gradient difference algorithm developed by Mahoney [1] has been extended to include the medium edge detection method to automatically delineate the SLIE using the sequential SAR data. The underlying method is to use a spatial gradient operation to identify potential edge pixels, before applying the noise removal using a baseline (2000-2008) SLIE, and a pixel connection technique to generate a contiguous edge. We show that in 2016, the SLIE extended 20 km (25%) further equatorward than in 2008. Good agreement has been achieved between the SLIE derived from our automated method and the manual SLIE extraction using the original SAR as well as a near-coincident Landsat-8 OLI image. The error in the automated approach is minimized when using three to four calibrated SAR images, all with the same incident angle and the maximum separation between them is less than 20 days. Our results confirm the potential of the method for operational application, and we expect it to promote the study of Antarctic landfast ice.

TI  - Analysis of slight precipitation in China during the past decades and its relationship with advanced very high radiometric resolution normalized difference vegetation index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is one of the most important factors determining the occurrence of extreme hydro-meteorological events and water resource availability. Precipitation in different grades has diverse ecological effects, and slight precipitation (SP, defined as 0.1-1.0 mm/day) is the minimal level among them. In this study, we investigated SP trends from 1961 to 2013, as well as the relationship between SP and advanced very high radiometric resolution (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in China during growing season from 1981 to 2006. The distributions and trends of SP were analysed by calculating the daily precipitation data. The average annual slight precipitation amount (SPA) and the number of slight precipitation days (SPD), derived from 839 monitoring stations in China, show a decreasing trend over the last five decades, which is in agreement with total precipitation (TP) but in different rates. When the trend was analysed seasonally, SP in most stations decreases significantly in September-October-November (SON) and June-July-August (JJA), and the largest decrease is found in SON. About 49.5 and 68.7% of monitoring stations show a decreasing trend in SON, in both SPA and SPD, whereas the trend is less popular in March-April-May (MAM, SPA: 19.7%, SPD: 41.4%) and December-January-February (JJF, SPA: 25.6%, SPD: 43.1%). Moreover, our analysis indicates that the decrease of SP is mainly due to the decrease of SPD as the median amount of daily SP was unchanged over the past five decades (close to 0.3 mm/day). Based on 26-year (1981-2006) semi-monthly AVHRR NDVI data and the records of SP data, the relationship between AVHRR NDVI and SP was also investigated. In regions with lower (< 600 mm) TP, the correlation coefficients between NDVI and SP tend to be higher. These results highlight that SP has different effects than TP on vegetation growth. We also analysed time lag effects and concluded that the sensitivity of NDVI to SP for grass vegetation (the correlation coefficient is 0.327) is more noticeable than for trees (0.211) or shrubs (-0.058). The relationship between SP and NDVI also provides us new insights on the dependence of vegetation growth on meteorological factors.

TI  - Study of the Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics of Forest Landscape Patterns in Shanghai from 2004 to 2014 Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape patterns of urban forests not only reflect the influence of urbanization on urban forests, but also determines its function in urban ecosystem services. In the case of mastering the overall forest landscape pattern of a city, a study of the structure of urban forest landscapes at different scales and in urbanized regions is beneficial to a comprehensive understanding of the forest characteristics of a city. In the present study, an attempt was made to map and monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of an urban forest in Shanghai from 2004 to 2014 using remote sensing techniques. Methods of landscape ecology analysis are followed to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of an urban forest landscape by urban and rural gradient regionalization. The results show that the spatial structure of an urban forest landscape is essentially consistent with an urban landscape pattern. Due to strong interference from human activities, the ecological quality of forest landscapes is low. At the landscape level, the urban forest coverage rate increased from 11.43% in 2004 to 16.02% in 2014, however, the number of large patches decreased, there was a high degree of urban forest landscape fragmentation, landscape connectivity was poor, landscape patch boundaries were uniform, and weak links were present between ecological processes. Different urban and rural gradient division methods exhibit obvious gradient characteristics along the urban-rural gradient in Shanghai. The regional differences in the urban forest landscape ecological characteristics have further increased as a result of urban planning and zoning. The total amount of urban forest is located closer to the urban center, which has the smallest total amount of forest; however, in terms of urban forest coverage, the suburbs have more coverage than do the outer suburbs and the central urban areas. The urban forest landscape's spatial distribution area is evidently different. Urbanization affects the areas closest to urban residential areas, which are markedly disturbed by humans, and the urban forest landscape has a high degree of fragmentation. The forest patches have become divided and unconnected, and the degree of natural connectivity has gradually decreased over the past 10 years. At the landscape class level, broadleaf forests are dominant in Shanghai, and their area exhibits an increasing trend; shrublands and needleleaf forests, however, show a decreasing trend. Compared with other forest types, the spatial distribution of broadleaf forest is concentrated in the suburbs, and the aggregation effect is relatively apparent. From the perspective of urban forest landscape pattern aggregation characteristics in Shanghai, the spatial distribution of urban forest landscape point patterns in the study area exhibit extremely uneven characteristics. The point density of urban forest patches larger than 1 ha in Shanghai increased from 2004 to 2014. However, the total number of patches with areas larger than 5 ha decreased, and this decrease plays an important role in the ecological environment. In the past 10 years, the concentration characteristics of urban forests with large patches has gradually decreased. In 2014, the urban forest landscapes decreased by 5 km compared to the intensity of aggregates in 2004, which also indicates that urban forests in Shanghai tend to be fragmented. The results of this study can be useful to help improve urban residents' living environments and the sustainable development of the urban ecosystem, and they will also be vital to future management.

TI  - Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration Estimation from Satellite Data in the Beijing Area Using a Specific Particle Swarm Extinction Mass Conversion Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) has a substantial influence on the environment, climate change and public health. Due to the limited spatial coverage of a ground-level PM2.5 monitoring system, the ground-based PM2.5 concentration measurement is insufficient in many circumstances. In this paper, a Specific Particle Swarm Extinction Mass Conversion Algorithm (SPSEMCA) using remotely sensed data is introduced. Ground-level observed PM2.5, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and relative humidity (RH) reanalyzed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine-mode fraction (FMF), particle size distribution, and refractive indices from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) of the Beijing area in 2015 were used to establish this algorithm, and the same datasets for 2016 were used to test the performance of the SPSEMCA. The SPSEMCA involves four steps to obtain PM2.5 values from AOD datasets, and every step has certain advantages: (I) In the particle correction, we use eta(2.5) (the extinction fraction caused by particles with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m) to make an accurate assimilation of AOD(2.5), which is contributed to by the specific particle swarm PM2.5. (II) In the vertical correction, we compare the performance of PBLHc retrieved by satellite Lidar CALIPSO data and PBLHe reanalysis by ECMWF. Then, PBLHc is used to make a systematic correction for PBLHe. (III) For extinction to volume conversion, the relative humidity and the FMF are used together to assimilate the AVEC (averaged volume extinction coefficient, mu m(2)/mu m(3)). (IV) PM2.5 measured by ground-based air quality stations are used as the dry mass concentration when calculating the AMV (averaged mass volume, cm(3)/g) in humidity correction, that will avoid the uncertainties derived from the estimation of the particulate matter density . (V) Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) 1 km x 1 km AOD was used to retrieve high resolution PM2.5, and a LookUP Table-based Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (LUT-SDA) FMF was used to avoid the large uncertainties caused by the MODIS FMF product. The validation of PM2.5 from the SPSEMCA algorithm to the AERONET observation data and MODIS monitoring data achieved acceptable results, R = 0.70, RMSE (root mean square error) = 58.75 mu g/m(3) for AERONET data, R = 0.75, RMSE = 43.38 g/m(3) for MODIS data, respectively. Furthermore, the trend of the temporal and spatial distribution of Beijing was revealed.

TI  - An automatic change detection approach for rapid flood mapping in Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a two-step automatic change detection chain for rapid flood mapping based on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is presented. First, a reference image is selected from a set of potential image candidates via a Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence-based index. Second, saliency detection is applied on log-ratio data to derive the prior probabilities of changed and unchanged classes for initializing the following expectation maximization (EM) based generalized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM). The saliency-guided GGMM is capable of capturing the primary pixel-based change information and handling highly imbalanced datasets. A fully connected conditional random field (FCRF) model, which takes long-range pairwise potential connections into account, is integrated to remove the ambiguities of the saliency-guided GGMM and to achieve the final change map. The whole process chain is automatic with an efficient computation. The proposed approach was validated on flood events at the Evros River, Greece and the Wharfe River and Ouse River in York, United Kingdom. Kappa coefficients (k) of 0.9238 and 0.8682 were obtained respectively. The sensitivity analysis underlines the robustness of the proposed approach for rapid flood mapping.

TI  - Systematic analysis of parameters predicting pathological axillary status (ypN0 vs. ypN+) in patients with breast cancer converting from cN+ to ycN0 through primary systemic therapy (PST)
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimization of axillary staging among patients converting from clinically node-positive disease to clinically node-negative disease through primary systemic therapy is needed. We aimed at developing a nomogram predicting the probability of positive axillary status after chemotherapy based on clinical/pathological parameters. Patients from study arm C of the SENTINA trial were included. Univariable/multivariable analyses were performed for 13 clinical/pathological parameters to predict a positive pathological axillary status after chemotherapy using logistic regression models. Odds ratios and 95%-confidence-intervals were reported. Model performance was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. Calculations were performed using the SAS Software (Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 369 of 553 patients in Arm C were included in multivariable analysis. Stepwise backward variable selection based on a multivariable analysis resulted in a model including estrogen receptor (ER) status (odds ratio (OR) 3.916, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.318-6.615, p<0.001), multifocality (OR 2.106, 95% CI 1.203-3.689, p=0.0092), lymphovascular invasion (OR 9.196, 95% CI 4.734-17.864, p<0.001), and sonographic tumor diameter after PST (OR 1.034, 95% CI 1.010-1.059, p=0.0051). When validated, our model demonstrated an accuracy of 70.2% using 0.5 as cut-point. An area under the curve of 0.81 was calculated. The use of individual parameters as predictors of lymph node status after chemotherapy resulted in an inferior accuracy. Our model was able to predict the probability of a positive axillary nodal status with a high accuracy. The use of individual parameters showed reduced predictive performance. Overall, tumor biology was the strongest parameter in our models.

TI  - Hysterectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy in the setting of pre-operative diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia: A cost-effectiveness analysis
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be considered in the setting of a pre-operative diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) due to high rates of concurrent invasive cancer. The aim of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness of different surgical management strategies for a pre-operative diagnosis of EIN.Methods. A decision model was developed from a third party payer perspective to compare four surgical strategies for the management of EIN: (1) hysterectomy; (2) hysterectomy with frozen section (hysterectomy + froozen); (3) hysterectomy with SLNB (hysterectomy + SLNB); (4) hysterectomy with frozen section and SLNB (hysterectomy + frozen + SLNB). The probability that frozen section identifies high- or low-risk cancer, final pathology distribution, adjuvant treatments, and surgery/imaging costs were abstracted from the literature, Medicare reimbursement data, and the financial department of a private academic hospital. Adjuvant treatments were determined through NCCN guidelines and published studies. Effectiveness was quantified as percentage of patients who received the guideline-based treatment that aligned with their true stage.Results. The base case cost and effectiveness of each strategy was: hysterectomy-$4383/89%, hysterectomy + frozen-$5220/99.2%, hysterectomy + SLNB-$535 4 / 9 4.7% and hysterectomy + frozen + SLNB-$5938/99.6%. Hysterectomy + frozen had an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8111 per patient who received adjuvant treatment that aligned with true stage compared to hysterectomy. Hysterectomy + frozen + SLNB had an ICER of $168,171 per additional patient who received adjuvant treatment that aligned with their true stage compared to hysterectomy + frozen.Conclusion. Hysterectomy + frozen + SLNB is a costly strategy for pre-operative EIN when compared to hysterectomy + frozen, with limited clinical benefit. Hysterectomy with frozen section and subsequent intraoperative staging decisions should continue to be standard of care. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of historical map and aerial imagery to characterize long-term land-use change and landscape dynamics: An object-based analysis via Random Forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking Earth's past helps us to move from hindsight to foresight in seeking landscape sustainability, a pursuit aided by modern mapping capabilities but hindered by a dearth of historical landscape information. To fill the data gap and exemplify the use of old maps for land-use change sciences, we combined an old paper-based US civil war map and modem aerial photos to derive land-use history and landscape dynamics at fine scales for a region near Chancellorsville, USA, from 1867 to 2014. We also tested how advanced algorithms object-based image analysis and Random Forests (RF)-could aid in data processing. Automatic classification of the scanned 1867 paper map proved difficult, but its manual digitization could benefit from object-based image segmentation. Classifying digital aerial images was more accurate via the object-based than pixel-based method, but only if the images were segmented appropriately. In the object-based classification, spectral-based features were much more important and useful than shape/geometry features for land-cover discrimination, as ranked by RF. During the 147 years, 32% of the region changed in land type. Settlement and roads increased in extent by 1850% and 691%, respectively, and woodland decreased by 19%. These changes fragmented the landscape, altered the hydrological regime, and affected river morphology. The utility of old maps exemplified here provides an impetus for leveraging extant old maps or historical records to support land-use and global change research. Our study also connotes the importance of preserving and geotagging current non-traditional data, such as photos, videos, and citizen science data, that can serve as a baseline to document future landscape change.

TI  - Broad Consistency Between Satellite and Vegetation Model Estimates of Net Primary Productivity Across Global and Regional Scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has the potential to significantly decrease net primary production (NPP). However, the drought sensitivity of NPP remains unclear globally. Here we investigated the response of NPP to drought for the period 1982-2011 using NPP derived from satellite models, eight dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and several drought indices. Our results indicate that the sign of drought response of NPP is consistent across satellites and DGVMs globally. Both the model and satellite data show a unimodal distribution of drought sensitivity across climatic gradients and indicate that semiarid regions are the most drought-sensitive areas. In addition, a decreasing drought trend was significantly correlated with an increasing trend in satellite-derived NPP or DGVM-derived NPP globally. However, the DGVM-derived NPP is more sensitive to drought than the satellite-derived NPP over most vegetated land areas and presents a stronger correlation with drought, higher drought sensitivity, and larger slopes between NPP and drought trends. The overresponse of the DGVM-derived NPP to drought relative to the satellite-derived NPP could be attributed to the higher drought sensitivity of the simulated leaf area index and overresponse of the DGVM-derived NPP to the vapor pressure deficit. Overall, large uncertainties remain in the response of NPP to drought and additional long-term observations are required to better represent NPP responses to water stress in DGVM models.

TI  - Cloud Effective Emissivity Retrievals Using Combined Ground-Based Infrared Cloud Measuring Instrument and Ceilometer Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a new inversion procedure for cloud effective emissivity retrievals using a combined ground-based infrared cloud measuring instrument with ceilometer was developed. A quantitative sensitivity and performance analysis of the proposed method was also provided. It was found that the uncertainty of the derived effective emissivity was mainly associated with errors on the measurement radiance, the simulated radiance of clear sky and blackbody cloudy sky. Furthermore, the retrieval at low effective emissivity was most sensitive to the simulated clear sky radiances, whereas the blackbody cloudy sky radiance was the prevailing source of uncertainty at high emissivity. This newly proposed procedure was applied to the measurement taken in the CMA Beijing Observatory Station from November 2011 to June 2012 by the whole-sky infrared cloud-measuring system (WSIRCMS) and CYY-2B ceilometer. The cloud effective emissivity measurements were in good agreement with that of the MODIS/AQUA MYD06 Collection 6 (C6) cloud products. The mean difference between them was 0.03, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.71. The results demonstrate that the retrieval method is robust and reliable.

TI  - Rapid Invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> in the Coastal Zone of Mainland China: New Observations from Landsat OLI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasion imposes significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. Thus, monitoring the spatial pattern of invasive plants is vital for effective ecosystem management. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has been one of the most prevalent invasive plants along the China coast, and its spread has had severe ecological consequences. Here, we provide new observation from Landsat operational land imager (OLI) images. Specifically, 43 Landsat-8 OLI images from 2014 to 2016, a combination of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, and field surveys covering the whole coast were used to construct an up-to-date dataset for 2015 and investigate the spatial variability of S. alterniflora in the coastal zone of mainland China. The classification results achieved good estimation, with a kappa coefficient of 0.86 and 96% overall accuracy. Our results revealed that there was approximately 545.80 km(2) of S. alterniflora distributed in the coastal zone of mainland China in 2015, from Hebei to Guangxi provinces. Nearly 92% of the total area of S. alterniflora was distributed within four provinces: Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian. Seven national nature reserves invaded by S. alterniflora encompassed approximately one-third (174.35 km(2)) of the total area of S. alterniflora over mainland China. The Yancheng National Nature Reserve exhibited the largest area of S. alterniflora (115.62 km(2)) among the reserves. Given the rapid and extensive expansion of S. alterniflora in the 40 years since its introduction and its various ecological effects, geospatially varied responding decisions are needed to promote sustainable coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Classification of Rice Heavy Metal Stress Levels Based on Phenological Characteristics Using Remote Sensing Time-Series Images and Data Mining Algorithms
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal pollution in crops leads to phenological changes, which can be monitored by remote sensing technology. The present study aims to develop a method for accurately evaluating heavy metal stress in rice based on remote sensing phenology. First, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) was applied to blend Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat to generate a time series of fusion images at 30 m resolution, and then the vegetation indices (VIs) related to greenness and moisture content of the rice canopy were calculated to create the time-series of VIs. Second, phenological metrics were extracted from the time-series data of VIs, and a feature selection scheme was designed to acquire an optimal phenological metric subset. Finally, an ensemble model with optimal phenological metrics as classification features was built using random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) classifiers, and the classification of stress levels was implemented. The results demonstrated that the overall accuracy of discrimination for different stress levels is greater than 98%. This study suggests that fusion images can be utilized to detect heavy metal stress in rice, and the proposed method may be applicable to classify stress levels.

TI  - Multi-sensor image registration by combining local self-similarity matching and mutual information
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic multi-sensor image registration is a challenging task in remote sensing. Conventional image registration algorithms may not be applicable when common underlying visual features are not distinct. In this paper, we propose a novel image registration approach that integrates local self-similarity (LSS) and mutual information (MI) for multi-sensor images with rigid/nonrigid radiometric and geometric distortions. LSS is a well-performing descriptor that captures common, local internal layout features for multi-sensor images, whereas MI focuses on global intensity relationships. First, potential control points are identified by using the Harris algorithm and screened based on the self-similarity of their local surrounding internal layouts. Second, a Bayesian probabilistic model for matching the ensemble of the LSS features is introduced. Third, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to optimize the point and region correspondences for maximum self-similarity and MI and, ultimately, a robust mapping function. The proposed approach is compared with several conventional image registration algorithms that are based on the sum of squared differences (SSD), scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT), and speeded-up robust features (SURF) through the experimental registration of pairs of Landsat TM, SPOT, and RADARSAT SAR images. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and accurate.

TI  - Scene Classification Based on Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the large amount of high-spatial resolution images now available, scene classification aimed at obtaining high-level semantic concepts has drawn great attention. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are typical deep learning methods, have widely been studied to automatically learn features for the images for scene classification. However, scene classification based on CNNs is still difficult due to the scale variation of the objects in remote sensing imagery. In this paper, a multiscale CNN (MCNN) framework is proposed to solve the problem. In MCNN, a network structure containing dual branches of a fixed-scale net (F-net) and a varied-scale net (V-net) is constructed and the parameters are shared by the F-net and V-net. The images and their rescaled images are fed into the F-net and V-net, respectively, allowing us to simultaneously train the shared network weights on multiscale images. Furthermore, to ensure that the features extracted from MCNN are scale invariant, a similarity measure layer is added to MCNN, which forces the two feature vectors extracted from the image and its corresponding rescaled image to be as close as possible in the training phase. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared the results obtained using three widely used remote sensing data sets: the UC Merced data set, the aerial image data set, and the google data set of SIRI-WHU. The results confirm that the proposed method performs significantly better than the other state-of-the-art scene classification methods.

TI  - Efficiency of landscape metrics characterizing urban land surface temperature
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of the relationship between landscape metrics and urban land surface temperature (LST) provides a basic understanding of the interaction of landscape pattern and ecological process. However, the evidenced relationships between landscape metrics and LST are still uncertain, and cannot provide fundamental support to landscape management. Other than a test of statistical significance, four judgments (median correlation value; temporal variation and statistical scale; threshold; and effects of key variables) are considered "efficient" criteria in this study. Partial correlation and piecewise linear regression are used to focus on the indicators of land cover proportion, biophysical proportion, and mainly area- or shape-related landscape configuration indicators. The results show: (1) land cover proportion can almost substitute for area-related landscape configuration indicators; (2) landscape composition is more efficient than configuration as an indicator because of its relatively stable temporal correlation values at different statistical scales; (3) the evident landscape composition threshold of vegetated land surfaces (50-70% for land cover proportion and 0.2-0.3 for biophysical proportion) is more indicative in application than the linear relationship for unvegetated land surfaces; and (4) landscape metrics are better correlated with LST in high temperature than in low temperature, and urban area weakly influences this correlation (R-2 < 0.2). Additionally, the configuration metrics at a landscape level are not recommended for characterizing LST. Depended on the efficient indicators, such as the application of thresholds, landscape planning can be linked to the quantitative observations and statistical evidence in landscape metrics.

TI  - Ice Surface Temperature Retrieval from a Single Satellite Imager Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current methods for estimating the surface temperature of sea and lake ice-the ice surface temperature (IST)-utilize two satellite imager thermal bands (11 and 12 mu m) at moderate spatial resolution. These "split-window" or dual-band methods have been shown to have low biases and uncertainties. A single-band algorithm would be useful for satellite imagers that have only the 11 mu m band at high resolution, such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), or that do not have a fully functional 12 mu m band, such as the Thermal Infrared Sensor onboard the Landsat 8. This study presents a method for single-band IST retrievals, and validation of the retrievals using IST measurements from an airborne infrared radiation pyrometer during the NASA IceBridge campaign in the Arctic. Results show that IST with a single thermal band from the VIIRS has comparable performance to IST with the VIIRS dual-band (split-window) method, with a bias of 0.22 K and root-mean-square error of 1.03 K.

AB  - Wetland protection and recovery needs scientific foundations for a better understanding of wetland floods, since the flooding existence and its dynamics are the key aspects in the formation and evolution of wetland ecosystems. The Honghe National Natural Reserve (HNNR) in the Northeast China has been listed in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands since 2002. The specific dates for determining of an average inundation boundary caused by a regular flooding were firstly fixed from multiple rainfall events by a hydro-meteorological analysis based on the long-term rainfall data. The flood inundation areas in the HNNR marshes were mapped according to the correlation between hydro-geomorphology and regular flood progress. The mapping of the flood inundation areas were supported technically from the application of remote sensing images, combining the hydro-geomorphologic analysis with meteorological statistical data. The final map with the spatial-temporal content of an inundation created by hydro-geomorphological analysis and remote sensing data was validated by the long-term rainfall, soil moisture and surface water level data in the HNNR. The results indicated that the flood inundation areas were mainly distributed in large patches along the two main river courses of Nongjiang River and its branch of Woyalan River in the northern and central HNNR. The flood inundation patches were scattered as seasonal marshes and permanent ponds in the southern and eastern HNNR. The extracted flood inundation area accounted for more than a quarter of the total area of HNNR. The flood inundation area of Nongjiang was much larger than that of Wuyalan.

TI  - Hyperspectral discrimination of foliar biotic damages in rice using principal component analysis and probabilistic neural network
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of crop health status in real time could provide reliable and useful information for making effective and efficient management decisions regarding the appropriate time and method to control crop diseases and insect damage. In this study, hyperspectral reflectance of symptomatic and asymptomatic rice leaves infected by Pyricularia grisea Sacc, Bipolaris oryzae Shoem, Aphelenchoides besseyi Christie and Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guen was measured in a laboratory within the 350-2500nm spectral region. Principal component analysis was performed to obtain the principal component spectra (PCs) of different transformations of the original spectra, including original (R), common logarithm of reciprocal (lg (1/R)), and the first derivative of original and common logarithm of reciprocal spectra (R and (lg (1/R))). A probabilistic neural network classifier was applied to discriminate the symptomatic rice leaves from asymptomatic ones with the front PCs. For identifying symptomatic and asymptomatic rice leaves, the mean overall discrimination accuracies for R, lg (1/R), R and (lg (1/R)) were 91.3, 93.1, 92.3 and 92%, and the mean Kappa coefficients were 0.771, 0.835, 0.829 and 0.82, respectively. To discriminate between disease and insect damage, the overall accuracies for R, lg (1/R), R and (lg (1/R)) were 97.7, 98.1, 100 and 100%, and the Kappa coefficients were 0.962, 0.97, 1 and 1, respectively. These results demonstrated that hyperspectral remote sensing can discriminate between multiple diseases and the insect damage of rice leaves under laboratory conditions.

AB  - Wheat vegetative growth, defined as the stage from green-up date to heading date (STAGE), is a crucial phrase, which largely affects crop yield. Previous some studies mainly focused on site-based changes of STAGE. However, there are few studies concerning large-scale changes of STAGE, which limits our understanding of regional changes of STAGE in response to climate change. Here, we introduced robust satellite-based phenological algorithms as well as third-generation global inventory modeling and mapping studies normalized difference vegetation index for the period of 1982-2015 to spatially derive winter wheat green-up date, heading date, and STAGE over croplands of the North China Plain (NCP). Changes of STAGE and their response to climate change were then investigated. Results showed that a strong predicted ability of introduced heading date algorithm was observed with r of 0.88 (p < 0.01), bias of -1.0 day and RMSE of 4.9 days. We found that unlike the patterns of winter wheat green-up and heading date, STAGE spatially decreased from southwestern to northeastern NCP with regional averaged stage of 41.2 +/- 4.6 days. Advanced green-up date faster than advanced heading date induced lengthened stage of entire NCP with 1 day/decade (R-2 = 0.11, p = 0.06). Stage of 23.4% cropland pixels performed significantly lengthened trends (p < 0.05), mainly locating in western NCP. The relationships between STAGE and climatic variables suggested that compared to precipitation, temperature was more responsible for changes of STAGE (r = 0.59, p < 0.01). This study highlights important roles of remote sensing data and satellite-based phenological algorithms for regional crop growth monitoring and management.

AB  - Objective to study the peculiarities of clinical characteristics and polymorphism of ABO and Rh blood group systemsin relation to the natural history of plasma cell myeloma in the ChNPP accident survivors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peculiarities of the disease natural history were reviewed in the 111 plasma cell myeloma(PCM) patients receiving medical management at the Department of Radiation Oncohematology of the NRCRM dur-ing 2010-2017. Principal clinical and laboratory characteristics of PCM, namely the values/levels of LDH, beta2-mic-roglobulin, albumin, serum calcium, urea, creatinine and hemoglobin were assessed, taking into account the gender,radiation history (ChNPP accident clean-up workers, evacuees from areas of obligatory resettlement, inhabitants ofcontaminated territories, and the comparison group) and the PCM stage codenamed by Durie-Salmon et al. (1975)and the ISS (1985) classifications. Distribution of polymorphic variants on ABO and Rh blood systems was studiedin the 106 PCM patients.RESULTS: It was found that the level of beta2-micro-globulin and calcium was increased significantly in male (p = 0.02and p = 0.04, respectively), whereas serum urea content was elevated in female (p = 0.04) PCM patients featuring acompromised radiation anamnesis in comparison to non-irradiated patients. Some probable differences were foundfor urea level (F = 3.58, p = 0.05) and serum albumin (F = 4.00, p = 0.05) in the examined group of PCM patients.Probable (p < 0.05) incidence increase of the B phenotype was established as a predictor of complicated natural his-tory of PCM with abnormal genetic equilibrium resulted from the increased incidence of IB allele in chronic renal fail-ure (CRF) patients. Significant (p < 0.05) prolongation of the remission period upon a standard PCT application wasfound in PCM patients being the A phenotype carriers having a preserved gene and phenotypic equilibrium comparedwith carriers of O and B phenotypes.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and hematological parameters are different in PCM patients survived after the ChNPP accidentand those with favorable radiation history. Distribution of polymorphic variants of ABO antigenic structures inpatients with complicated natural history of the disease is also different, that can be a background for predictingthe effectiveness of treatment. Further research is required in this field.

AB  - Fine-particulate pollution is a major public health concern in China. Accurate assessment of the population exposed to PM2.5 requires high-resolution pollution and population information. This paper assesses China's potential population exposure to PM2.5, maps its spatiotemporal variability, and simulates the effects of the recent air pollution control policy. We relate satellite-based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals to ground-based PM2.5 observations. We employ block cokriging (BCK) to improve the spatial interpolation of PM2.5 distribution. We use the subdistrict level population data to estimate and map the potential population exposure to PM2.5 pollution in China at the subdistrict level, the smallest administrative unit with public demographic information. During 8 April 2013 and 7 April 2014, China's population-weighted annual average PM2.5 concentration was nearly 7 times the annual average level suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). About 1322 million people, or 98.6% of the total population, were exposed to PM2.5 at levels above WHO's daily guideline for longer than half a year. If China can achieve its Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution targets by 2017, the population exposed to PM2.5 above China's daily standard for longer than half a year will be reduced by 85%.

TI  - Effectiveness of sentinel rodents for surveillance of exposure to undocumented bacterial pathogens in animal research facility
T2  - THAI JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of sentinel animals in animal research facilities is the cornerstone of animal health monitoring for exposure to natural pathogens of laboratory animals. This is because infection with these pathogens produces no overt signs of disease yet the infection may affect the outcome of research utilising these animals. One of the important pathogens includes Klebsiella pneumoniae, whose prevalence can be high in laboratory animals. This study sought to document the prevalence of K. pneumoniae and other undocumented bacterial pathogens in laboratory rodents for a 3-year period. K. pneumoniae and Chryseobacterium gleum were isolated from sentinel ICR mice housed in three different satellite animal laboratories, suggesting the effectiveness of the sentinel program. A novel strain of K. pneumoniae ST3125 was recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of the ICR mouse. beta-lactamase and virulence genes were detected among K. pneumoniae and C. gleum strains, suggesting the acquisition of these genes from the users of the animal research facilities. Examination of the animal housing environment, feed and water specimens however, returned negative for the presence of K. pneumoniae and C. gleum suggesting that current hygiene practices were adequate in controlling transmission from the environment. Nevertheless, stringent hygiene practices and infection control protocols have to be applied in animal facilities to prevent the colonization and spread of pathogens capable of distorting experimental results.

TI  - Sustaining ecological and subsistence functions in conservation areas: eider habitat and access by Native hunters along landfast ice
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Arctic, rapid climate change has kindled efforts to delineate and project the future of important habitats for marine birds and mammals. These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning is key to sustaining social-ecological systems. In the northeast Chukchi Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration route for half a million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast ice. Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the variable ice edge. Based on benthic sampling in 2010-2012, a model of eider foraging energetics and satellite data on ice patterns in April and May 1997-2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider feeding. In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited or too far from landfast ice to provide regular hunting access. In other sectors, overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable, but often within a consistent geographic range. Areas accessible to hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the hunters' needs. These results can inform spatial planning of industrial activities that yield cash income critical to subsistence hunting in less developed locations. Our study provides an approach for mapping subsistence conservation areas' throughout the Arctic and an example for such efforts elsewhere.

TI  - Dynamic Analysis of Mangrove Forests Based on an Optimal Segmentation Scale Model and Multi-Seasonal Images in Quanzhou Bay, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are important coastal ecosystems and are crucial for the equilibrium of the global carbon cycle. Monitoring and mapping of mangrove forests are essential for framing knowledge-based conservation policies and funding decisions by governments and managers. The purpose of this study was to monitor mangrove forest dynamics in the Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve. To achieve this goal, we compared and analyzed the spectral discrimination among mangrove forests, mudflats and Spartina using multi-seasonal Landsat images from 1990, 1997, 2005, 2010, and 2017. We identified the spatio-temporal distribution of mangrove forests by combining an optimal segmentation scale model based on object-oriented classification, decision tree and visual interpretation. In addition, mangrove forest dynamics were determined by combining the annual land change area, centroid migration and overlay analysis. The results showed that there were advantages in the approaches used in this study for monitoring mangrove forests. From 1990 to 2017, the extent of mangrove forests increased by 2.48 km(2), which was mostly converted from mudflats and Spartina. Environmental threats including climate change and sea-level rise, aquaculture development and Spartina invasion, pose potential and direct threats to the existence and expansion of mangrove forests. However, the implementation of reforestation projects and Spartina control plays a substantial role in the expansion of mangrove forests. It has been demonstrated that conservation activities can be beneficial for the restoration and succession of mangrove forests. This study provides an example of how the application of an optimal segmentation scale model and multi-seasonal images to mangrove forest monitoring can facilitate government policies that ensure the effective protection of mangrove forests.

TI  - Partition dynamic threshold monitoring technology of wildfires near overhead transmission lines by satellite
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a major natural disaster that can threaten the safe and stable operation of overhead transmission lines. Compared with large-area forest fires, transmission-line wildfires usually cover a small area and spread rapidly, making monitoring accuracy and real-time requirements of high priority. Wildfire monitoring based on satellite remote sensing has advantages in terms of monitoring-range width and the capacity for real-time monitoring; however, the detection threshold changes dynamically due to the influences of climate, geography, weather, and other factors that affect monitoring accuracy. To focus on small-area wildfires near overhead transmission lines, we developed a partition dynamic threshold calculation method based on time-series prediction. Basic thresholds are obtained based on a large number of historical values, followed by partitioning one of these values according to digital elevation model data and subsequent correction. Compared with conventional constant-threshold monitoring methods, our proposed method significantly reduced missed and false detection rates. Additionally, to improve fire-spot localization to the overhead transmission-line towers, we developed a tower-location algorithm based on block searching. Compared with the traditional traversal algorithm, our algorithm enabled a 15,000-fold increase in operation speed. These improvements will significantly enhance the monitoring of transmission-line wildfires, which are highly reliant upon alarm speed.

TI  - Bag of deep features for preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy among women. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is a crucial prognostic factor for breast cancer. In this paper, we propose an integrated scheme of deep learning and bag-of-features (BOF) model for preoperative prediction of SLN metastasis. Specifically, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract deep features from the three 2D representative orthogonal views of a segmented 3D volume of interest. Then, we use a BOF model to furtherly encode the all deep features, which makes features more compact and products high-dimension sparse representation. In particular, a kernel fusion method that assembles all features is proposed to build a discriminative support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The bag of deep feature model is evaluated using the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) database of 172 patients, including 74 SLN and 98 non-SLN. The results show that the proposed method achieves area under the curve (AUC) as high as 0.852 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716-0.988) at test set. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can potentially provide a noninvasive approach for automatically predicting prediction of SLN metastasis in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Cyclic Properties of Seismic Noise and the Problem of Predictability of the Strongest Earthquakes in Japanese Islands
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of an analysis of the properties of low-frequency seismic noise in the Japanese Islands from early 1997 to March 2018 are presented. The time interval under consideration includes one of the largest seismic disasters of recent times, the Tohoku earthquake of March 11, 2011. The presence of a dense network of seismic observations provides a unique opportunity to investigate how the preparation of a strong earthquake is reflected in changes in the properties of seismic noise in time and space. An analysis of the clustering of the daily multifractal and entropic properties of seismic noise in a 1-year moving time window averaged over all stations of the network made it possible to find a 2.5-year periodicity established since the beginning of 2003. This periodicity correlates with the occurrence of strong earthquakes in Japan. Studying features of the spatial distribution of seismic-noise properties allows us to put forward a hypothesis about the increased danger of the next megaearthquake in Japan in the area of the contact between the northern boundary of the Philippine Sea plate and Honshu Island, in the Nankai deepwater trough area, not far from Tokyo. In the Japanese Islands, in addition to the network of seismic observations, there is a dense network of fixed GPS points for which observations are available from the beginning of March 2015 with a time step of 5 min. The availability of such measurements makes it possible to complement the analysis of seismic-noise properties and to calculate the degree of correlation of GPS data at any point from measurements at neighboring stations. An analysis and processing of measurement results show that the most intense spot of increased correlation of the Earth's surface tremor, measured using GPS, is located in the Nankai Trough, with the center at the point of 34 degrees N and 138 degrees E.

TI  - Ship Classification and Detection Based on CNN Using GF-3 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean surveillance via high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries has been a hot issue because SAR is able to work in all-day and all-weather conditions. The launch of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite has provided a large number of SAR imageries, making it possible to marine targets monitoring. However, it is difficult for traditional methods to extract effective features to classify and detect different types of marine targets in SAR images. This paper proposes a convolutional neutral network (CNN) model for marine target classification at patch level and an overall scheme for marine target detection in large-scale SAR images. First, eight types of marine targets in GF-3 SAR images are labelled based on feature analysis, building the datasets for further experiments. As for the classification task at patch level, a novel CNN model with six convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers has been designed. With respect to the detection part, a Single Shot Multi-box Detector with a multi-resolution input (MR-SSD) is developed, which can extract more features at different resolution versions. In order to detect different targets in large-scale SAR images, a whole workflow including sea-land segmentation, cropping with overlapping, detection with MR-SSD model, coordinates mapping, and predicted boxes consolidation is developed. Experiments based on the GF-3 dataset demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods for marine target classification and detection.

TI  - Evaluating the uncertainty of Landsat-derived vegetation indices in quantifying forest fuel treatments using bi-temporal LiDAR data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems in the American west have long been influenced by timber harvests and fire suppression, and recently through treatments that reduce fuel for fire management. Precisely quantifying the structural changes to forests caused by fuel treatments is an essential step to evaluate their impacts. Satellite imagery-derived vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been widely used to map forest dynamics. However, uncertainties in using these vegetation indices to quantify forest structural changes have not been thoroughly studied, mainly due to the lack of wall-to-wall validation data. In this study we generated forest structural changes in aboveground biomass (AGB) and canopy cover as a result of fuel treatments using bitemporal airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and field measurements in a mixed coniferous forest of northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA. These LiDAR-derived forest structural measures were used to evaluate the uncertainties of using Landsat-derived vegetation indices to quantify treatments. Our results confirmed that vegetation indices can accurately map the extents of forest disturbance and canopy cover changes caused by fuel treatments, but the accuracy in quantifying AGB changes varied by the pre-treatment forest densities and treatment intensity. Changes in vegetation indices had relatively weaker correlations (coefficient of determination < 0.45) to biomass changes in forests with sparse (AGB < 100 Mg/ha) or dense biomass (AGB > 700 Mg/ha), than in forests with moderate-density (AGB between 100 Mg/ha and 700 Mg/ha) before the disturbances. Moreover, understory treatments (canopy height < 10 m) were poorly indicated by changes in satellite-derived vegetation indices. Our results suggest that when relating vegetation indices to AGB changes, researchers and managers should be cautious about their uncertainties in extremely dense or sparse forests, particularly when treatments mainly removed small trees or understory fuels.

TI  - A rapid method for quantifying landscape-scale vegetation disturbances by surface coal mining in arid and semiarid regions
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextQuantifying landscape-scale vegetation disturbances by surface coal mining (SCM) is crucial for assessing and mitigating its negative impacts on the environment. Methods for detecting such disturbances in woody ecosystems exist, but these methods do not work well for deserts and grasslands in arid and semiarid regions because of their sensitive responses to precipitation variations.ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to develop a new index to reliably detect the locations and spatial extents of SCM-induced vegetation disturbances in dryland regions in the face of fluctuating precipitation.MethodsWe have developed a vegetation disturbance index (VDI) that combines MODIS EVI data with precipitation data to detect vegetation disturbances by SCM on the Mongolian Plateau during 2000-2015. The VDI is computed by comparing vegetation production per unit precipitation for a given year with a multi-year mean, and by considering distances from coal-mining areas.ResultsOur results show that the VDI was able to adequately distinguish vegetation disturbances by SCM from climate-driven vegetation changes in five selected sites across the Mongolian Plateau.ConclusionsThe VDI provides an effective tool for quantifying the locations, spatial extents, and severity of vegetation disturbances by SCM in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - Using matrix models to estimate aboveground forest biomass dynamics in the eastern USA through various combinations of LiDAR, Landsat, and forest inventory data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to harmonize data sources with varying temporal, spatial, and ecosystem measurements (e.g. forest structure to soil organic carbon) for creation of terrestrial carbon baselines is paramount to refining the monitoring of terrestrial carbon stocks and stock changes. In this study, we developed and examined the short- (5 years) and long-term (30 years) performance of matrix models for incorporating light detection and ranging (LiDAR) strip samples and time-series Landsat surface reflectance high-level data products, with field inventory measurements to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics for study sites across the eastern USA-Minnesota (MN), Maine (ME), Pennsylvania-New Jersey (PANJ) and South Carolina (SC). The rows and columns of the matrix were stand density (i.e. number of trees per unit area) sorted by inventory plot and by species group and diameter class. Through model comparisons in the short-term, we found that average stand basal area (B) predicted by three matrix models all fell within the 95% confidence interval of observed values. The three matrix models were based on (i) only field inventory variables (inventory), (ii) LiDAR and Landsat-derived metrics combined with field inventory variables (LiDAR + Landsat + inventory), and (iii) only Landsat-derived metrics combined with field inventory variables (Landsat + inventory), respectively. In the long term, predicted AGB using LiDAR + Landsat + inventory and Landsat + inventory variables had similar AGB patterns (differences within 7.2 Mg ha(-1)) to those predicted by matrix models with only inventory variables from 2015-2045. When considering uncertainty derived from fuzzy sets all three matrix models had similar AGBs (differences within 7.6 Mg ha(-1)) by the year 2045. Therefore, the use of matrix models enabled various combinations of LiDAR, Landsat, and field data, especially Landsat data, to estimate large-scale AGB dynamics (i.e. central component of carbon stock monitoring) without loss of accuracy from only using variables from forest inventories. These findings suggest that the use of Landsat data alone incorporating elevation (E), plot slope (S) and aspect (A), and site productivity (C) could produce suitable estimation of AGB dynamics (ranging from 67.1-105.5 Mg ha(-1) in 2045) to actual AGB dynamics using matrix models. Such a framework may afford refined monitoring and estimation of terrestrial carbon stocks and stock changes from spatially explicit to spatially explicit and spatially continuous estimates and also provide temporal flexibility and continuity with the Landsat time series.

TI  - Assessing the spatiotemporal distributions of evapotranspiration in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of China using remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the global hydrological cycle, and it has a large impact on water resource management as it affects the availability of freshwater resources. It is important to understand the hydrological cycle for the water resources planning and management. This study used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite derived ET, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite derived precipitation datasets to assess the spatial and temporal distributions of ET, PET, and precipitation during the study period at Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. Based on the topographic variations and land-use/land-cover distributions, the study region which includes five counties of Hubei Province and nineteen counties of Chongqing Municipality was divided into four study zones. The ET and precipitation data were evaluated using in situ observations. The ET, PET, and precipitation data were compared to analyze the spatial and long-term (2001-2016) temporal distributions of average annual ET, PET, and precipitation, and to understand the relationships between them in the study region. The results showed that each selected zone had highest ET at the counties with the Yangtze River passing through whereas lowest at the counties which were located away from the river. Results also showed increasing trends in ET and PET from south-west to north-east in the study region. Analysis showed TGR had a significant impact on spatial and temporal distributions of ET and PET in the study region. Therefore, this study helps to understand the impact of TGR on spatial and temporal distributions of ET and PET during and after the construction.

TI  - Interactive effects of contamination and trematode infection in cockles biochemical performance
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities, especially those involving substances that pollute the environment can interfere with bivalve populations, as well as parasitism, a fundamental ecological interaction often neglected. In marine environments, organisms are concomitantly exposed to pollutants and parasites, a combination with synergistic, antagonistic or additive effects representing a potential threat to aquatic communities sustainability. In the present study, Cerastoderma edule (the edible cockle)-Himasthla elongate (trematode) was used as host-parasite model. Cockles are worldwide recognized as good sentinel and bioindicator species and can be infected by several trematodes, the most abundant macroparasites in coastal waters. Tested hypotheses were: 1) cockles exposed to increasing parasite pressure will present greater stress response; 2) cockles exposure to arsenic (single concentration test: 5.2 mu g L-1) will change parasite infection success and cockles stress response to infection. Arsenic was used for being one of the most common pollutants in the world and stress response assessed using biochemical markers of glycogen content, metabolism, antioxidant activity and cellular damage. Results showed that intensity of parasite pressure was positively correlated to biochemical response, mainly represented by higher metabolic requirements. Contamination did not affect parasite infection success. Compared to arsenic, trematode infection alone exerted a stronger impact: higher glycogen storage, metabolism and cellular damage and antioxidant activity inhibition. In interaction, parasitism and arsenic reduced hosts metabolism and cellular damage. Therefore, to a certain extent and in a contamination scenario, cockles may benefit from trematode infection, working as a protection for the pollutant accumulation in the organisms, reducing overall ROS production, which can consequently led to less toxic effects. These findings highlighted the deleterious effects of trematode infection in their hosts and showed the importance of including parasitology in ecotoxicological studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reforestation dynamics after land abandonment: a trajectory analysis in Mediterranean mountain landscapes
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation after land abandonment across Mediterranean mountains, together with the related landscape pattern dynamics and its possible impacts on the natural flora and fauna are issues that need further research efforts. This research, based on multi-temporal land cover maps derived from remotely sensed data (1987, 2003, 2016) of the Central Apennines, sets out to (i) quantify land cover changes and (ii) explore forest re-growth accounting for the interdependencies between forest gain and spatial configuration through trajectory analyses. Landscape change was assessed by transition matrix. Forest composition and configuration over time were analyzed by trajectory analysis based on random sampling techniques. This approach, implemented here for the first time for analyzing forest re-growth, allows us to explore the relationship between forest gain (the percentage of landscape covered by forests) and changes in spatial pattern (patch density, edge density, and mean patch area). An increase in forest cover over the past 30years underlined the intense process of natural re-colonization, which started after World War II, at the expense of the typical heterogeneity of Mediterranean cultural landscapes. The change in the spatial pattern of forested areas highlighted a significant transformation which is related to two processes: the centrifugal development of existing patches and the establishment of new nuclei. The trajectory analysis highlighted non-linear relationships between forest gain and spatial pattern, offering the basis envisage of their effects on biodiversity. Conservation-oriented management of Mediterranean mountain forests must acknowledge both the role of natural succession in generating complex mosaics and the importance of maintaining forest patches of different dimensions and configuration.

TI  - Time to response and patient visibility during tonic-clonic seizures in the epilepsy monitoring unit
T2  - EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: There is a high cost associated with recording quality video and electroencephalography (EEG) data in National Association of Epilepsy Center (NAEC) level IV epilepsy monitoring units (EMU). This study considers potential quality measures in EMUs for generalized tonic-(Ionic (GTC) seizures: types of safety signals, response time, and visibility of patient's limbs for semiology. These quality measures have been summarized across 12 EMUs to estimate response times to GTC seizures and the quality of video data that is captured during admissions.Methods: Video electroencephalographies (vEEGs) from two prospective regulatory studies for the Brain Sentinel device were reviewed. A total of 232 subjects with a history of GTC seizures underwent routine clinical EMU stays. Fifty-four of the study subjects had 96 GTC seizures. The vEEG of events were reviewed for safety signal used, response time, and visibility of patient's limbs.Results: The average response time from members of the hospital team was 22 s from electrographic generalization (minimum - 37 s, maximum 111 s, two no response). For caregivers, average response was 11 s (minimum -15 s, maximum 33 s, 45 not present/no response). In 73% of events, the patient visibility was limited at seizure onset. In 55% of events with limited limb visibility, the visibility was improved (by removing sheets or improving camera angle) >30 s after start of the event. The primary safety signals were as follows: an alert from outside the patient room (54%), button press (23%), hospital team present at seizure start (14%), caregiver vocal alert (6%), and no response (2%).Significance: The average response time of caregivers was twice as fast as the hospital team, underscoring the importance of having a person in the room during onset of a GTC seizure. Diagnostic yield could be improved with more timely removal of patient coverings. It was observed that when patients experienced a GTC seizure, 40% were fully or partially obscured for more than 30 s during the event, compromising the ability of epileptologists to evaluate semiology during seizure onset. Automated seizure alarms may help staff get to patients more quickly and improve diagnostic characterization. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Retrieval of Maize Leaf Area Index Using Hyperspectral and Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Field spectra acquired from a handheld spectroradiometer and Sentinel-2 images spectra were used to investigate the applicability of hyperspectral and multispectral data in retrieving the maize leaf area index in low-input crop systems, with high spatial and intra-annual variability, and low yield, in southern Mozambique, during three years. Seventeen vegetation indices, comprising two and three band indices, and nine machine learning regression algorithms (MLRA) were tested for the statistical approach while five cost functions were tested in the look-up-table (LUT) inversion approach. The three band vegetation indices were selected, specifically the modified difference index (mDI(d: 725; 715; 565)) for the hyperspectral dataset and the modified simple ratio (mSR(c: 740; 705; 865)) for the multispectral dataset of field spectra and the three band spectral index (TBSIb: 665; 865; 783) for the Sentinel-2 dataset. The relevant vector machine was the selected MLRA for the two datasets of field spectra (multispectral and hyperspectral) while the support vector machine was selected for the Sentinel-2 data. When using the LUT inversion technique, the minimum contrast estimation and the Bhattacharyya divergence cost functions were the best performing. The vegetation indices outperformed the other two approaches, with the TBSIb as the most accurate index (RMSE = 0.35). At the field scale, spectral data from Sentinel-2 can accurately retrieve the maize leaf area index in the study area.

TI  - Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) based landslide susceptibility mapping of Lish river basin of eastern Darjeeling Himalaya, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is one of the most destructive natural hazards of Darjeeling Himalaya. In the present study, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been applied to develop landslide susceptibility map of the Lish river basin of Eastern Darjiling Himalaya based on geospatial tools. A total of 188 landslide location points of very small to large polygon coverage were identified with the help of GPS study, SOI (Survey of India) topo-sheets and Digital Globe Quick Bird image to prepare a landslide inventory map. 70% training data sets of the landslide inventory was applied for training analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model and remaining 30% data sets were used for validation of the landslide susceptibility map. ERDAS IMAGINE, ASTER GDEM image, Arc GIS and PCI Geomatica software, topographical map, Landsat TM and 8 OLI satellite image, google earth image, soil map (NBSS and LUP Regional Centre), geomorphology and lithology (NATMO and GSI) were used and processed to prepare seventeen causative factors i.e. slope angle, slope aspect, slope curvature, altitude, relative relief, geomorphology, geology, distance to lineaments, lineament density, soil, LAND USE & land cover, NDVI, drainage density, distance o drainage, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and rainfall. Factor weights and class weights of all the data layers were derived using AHP and then weighted data layers were integrated to generate the landslide susceptibility map. To validate the result, success rate curve was made with the help of landslide susceptibility and cumulative percentage of landslide occurrence which showed the accuracy level of 89.72%.

TI  - Sen4Rice: A Processing Chain for Differentiating Early and Late Transplanted Rice Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 SAR Data With Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatio-temporal information about rice growth is an important factor for agronomic management and regional grain yield estimation. In this letter, a unified framework for monitoring and mapping of rice using dense time-series of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is proposed. A processing chain for such dense time-series Sentinel-1 images is developed with the Google Earth Engine's cloud computing platform. A dense time-series analysis of backscatter response of rice with different management practices is analyzed. Subsequently, the early and late transplanted rice is classified using a clustering algorithm within this platform. The proposed approach is used to monitor different cultivars of rice in three districts in the state of West Bengal, which is one of the major rice growing regions in India. The classification accuracy is assessed across 150 validation points spanning multiple blocks for the 2017 monsoon season. The Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired up to the early vegetative stage for rice have provided satisfactory classification accuracy with an overall accuracy >85% with kappa similar to 0.86 across different management practices throughout the region.

TI  - Upper Ocean and Subsurface Variability in the Bay of Bengal During Cyclone ROANU: A Synergistic View Using In Situ and Satellite Observations
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the upper ocean and subsurface variability during the different phases of the cyclonic storm ROANU along the western Bay of Bengal (BoB) in May 2016 are investigated by using the moored buoys, Argos, HF radar and satellite datasets in the proximity of the cyclone track. The moored buoy observations recorded a decrease of sea surface temperature (SST) by similar to 1 degrees C all over the track, whereas increase in salinity by similar to 1.5 PSU was detected along with the highest wind speed of 16ms(-1), pressure drop of 14hPa and air temperature drop of 4 degrees C. The cooling at the cyclone centers from the satellite data indicated higher (lower) SST drops when translation speed of the cyclone was low (high) and took more (less) time to recover to its pre-cyclone state in southern (northern) BoB. Mostly, higher SST drop was observed along the right side of the cyclone track. Interestingly, the opposite phenomenon occurred before landfall, where SST drop was higher on the left due to upwelling in the head bay as observed both from wave rider buoy (WRB) at Digha and satellite SST. The WRB near Vizag showed the maximum increase in significant wave heights by similar to 2.4m during the passage of cyclone. Argos also captured cyclone-induced drop in temperature due to upwelling and entrainment reasonably well. In the southwestern bay, significant upwelling was observed from the Argos with drop in temperature and increase in salinity in the upper layers. However, a strong stratification was observed from Argos in the northwestern BoB due to lesser salinity and higher precipitation. The currents from in situ as well as HF radar datasets measured the increase in current magnitude during the passage of ROANU. Rotary spectral analysis showed strong inertial currents with frequency similar to 2.1days at BD11 location, with higher amplitudes of the clockwise component during the cyclone period.

TI  - Digital mapping of paludification in soils under black spruce forests of eastern Canada
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern boreal ecosystems, paludification is defined as the accumulation of partially decomposed organic matter over saturated mineral soils, a process that reduces tree regeneration and forest growth. Given this negative effect on forest productivity, spatial prediction of paludification in black spruce stands is important in forest management. Here, we used the Random Forest approach to predict organic layer thickness (OLT) as a proxy of paludification in northeastern Canada, where forests tend to paludify naturally. The RF approach involved regression and classification models using a suite of 20 environmental predictors derived from multiple sources. The performance of each model was evaluated using cross-validation and an independent dataset based on conventional ecological survey maps from a provincial forest inventory. Importance measures of the predictors indicated that slope, topographic position index, spectral bands 4 and 5 from Landsat, latitude, and PALSAR_HH were the most important variables explaining the spatial distribution of OLT for both models. Cross-validated relative root mean square error (+/- standard deviation) for the regression model was estimated at 20.66% +/- 0.576, with R-2 of 0.41 +/- 0.020, whereas the average out-of-bag error for the classification model was estimated at 44.75%. However, both models performed better in predicting high risk of paludification (OLT values >40 cm). With predicted OLT values averaging 44.07 +/- 16.80 cm (range 4.25-104.58 cm), the spatial patterns were in accordance with the results of previous studies at the national and landscape scale. These results highlight that ecological types such as black spruce-sphagnum on thin-to-thick organic deposit, with ombrotrophic drainage, are particularly prone to paludification (OLT depth > 40 cm) throughout the study area. Limitations of the models and applications for decision-making in forest management are discussed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Earthquake sequence in the NE Lut, Iran: observations from multiple space geodetic techniques
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of observations supports temporal clustering behaviour of earthquakes within fault systems. As earthquake occurrence is mainly controlled by the crustal stresses, it is crucial to determine their spatio-temporal evolution to understand the generation of catastrophic seismic sequences. A possible way to constrain these variations is to measure the surface displacement field induced by seismic sequences. However, the observation time of modern satellite geodesy (InSAR/GPS) is short compared to the duration of an earthquake sequence. Thus, the goal of this paper is to extend the temporal range of observations of a seismic sequence. We focus on the largest earthquakes of the 1936-1997, Northeast Lut, Iran, sequence that is composed of 11 M-w >= similar to 6 earthquakes. Using subpixel correlation of historic (KH9) and recent (Sentinel-2) optical satellite images, wemeasure for the first time the surface displacement field of the 1979 M-w 7.1 Khuli-Boniabad earthquake, which broke the eastern part of the Dasht-e-Bayaz fault. Using subpixel correlation of optical (SPOT2-4) and SAR (JERS-2) images, we also measure the surface displacement field of the M-w 7.2 Zirkuh earthquake, which ruptured the Abiz fault. We found that both earthquakes have a mean slip of 2.5 m but the Khuli-Boniabad earthquake broke two main segments (total rupture similar to 60 km), whereas the Zirkuh earthquake broke three main segments (total rupture similar to 125 km). We suggest that the differences are controlled by the maturity of the faults, the Dasht-e-Bayaz fault being less mature than the Abiz fault. Furthermore, we succeed to measure offsets up to 2.60 m for the 1979 M-w 6.6 Korizan earthquake that broke the northern part of the Abiz fault. It is the first time that the surface displacement field for such a small historic earthquake has been measured using optical correlation. Finally, our study confirms the potential of historical optical imagery for retrieving surface displacements for past earthquakes (pre-modern geodesy era).

TI  - The Contribution of Multi-Sensor Infrared Satellite Observations to Monitor Mt. Etna (Italy) Activity during May to August 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In May 2016, three powerful paroxysmal events, mild Strombolian activity, and lava emissions took place at the summit crater area of Mt. Etna (Sicily, Italy). During, and immediately after the eruption, part of the North-East crater (NEC) collapsed, while extensive subsidence affected the Voragine crater (VOR). Since the end of the May eruptions, a diffuse fumarolic activity occurred from a fracture system that cuts the entire summit area. Starting from 7 August, a small vent (of similar to 20-30 m in diameter) opened up within the VOR crater, emitting high-temperature gases and producing volcanic glow which was visible at night. We investigated those volcanic phenomena from space, exploiting the information provided by the satellite-based system developed at the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis (IMAA), which monitors Italian volcanoes in near-real time by means of the RSTVOLC (Robust Satellite Techniques-volcanoes) algorithm. Results, achieved integrating Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, showed that, despite some issues (e.g., in some cases, clouds masking the underlying hot surfaces), RSTVOLC provided additional information regarding Mt. Etna activity. In particular, results indicated that the Strombolian eruption of 21 May lasted longer than reported by field observations or that a short-lived event occurred in the late afternoon of the same day. Moreover, the outcomes of this study showed that the intensity of fumarolic emissions changed before 7 August, as a possible preparatory phase of the hot degassing activity occurring at VOR. In particular, the radiant flux retrieved from MODIS data decreased from 30 MW on 4 July to an average value of about 7.5 MW in the following weeks, increasing up to 18 MW a few days before the opening of a new degassing vent. These outcomes, in accordance with information provided by Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) and Landsat 8-OLI (Operational Land Imager) data, confirm that satellite observations may also contribute greatly to the monitoring of active volcanoes in areas where efficient traditional surveillance systems exist.

TI  - Classification of Expansive Grassland Species in Different Growth Stages Based on Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansive species classification with remote sensing techniques offers great support for botanical field works aimed at detection of their distribution within areas of conservation value and assessment of the threat caused to natural habitats. Large number of spectral bands and high spatial resolution allows for identification of particular species. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data provide information about areas such as vegetation structure. Because the species differ in terms of features during the growing season, it is important to know when their spectral responses are unique in the background of the surrounding vegetation. The aim of the study was to identify two expansive grass species: Molinia caerulea and Calamagrostis epigejos in the Natura 2000 area in Poland depending on the period and dataset used. Field work was carried out during late spring, summer and early autumn, in parallel with remote sensing data acquisition. Airborne 1-m resolution HySpex images and LiDAR data were used. HySpex images were corrected geometrically and atmospherically before Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation and vegetation indices calculation. Based on a LiDAR point cloud generated Canopy Height Model, vegetation structure from discrete and full-waveform data and topographic indexes were generated. Classifications were performed using a Random Forest algorithm. The results show post-classification maps and their accuracies: Kappa value and F1 score being the harmonic mean of producer (PA) and user (UA) accuracy, calculated iteratively. Based on these accuracies and botanical knowledge, it was possible to assess the best identification date and dataset used for analysing both species. For M. caerulea the highest median Kappa was 0.85 (F1 = 0.89) in August and for C. epigejos 0.65 (F1 = 0.73) in September. For both species, adding discrete or full-waveform LiDAR data improved the results. We conclude that hyperspectral (HS) and LiDAR airborne data could be useful to identify grassland species encroaching into Natura 2000 habitats and for supporting their monitoring.

TI  - Windthrows control biomass patterns and functional composition of Amazon forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon forests account for similar to 25% of global land biomass and tropical tree species. In these forests, windthrows (i.e., snapped and uprooted trees) are a major natural disturbance, but the rates and mechanisms of recovery are not known. To provide a predictive framework for understanding the effects of windthrows on forest structure and functional composition (DBH >= 10 cm), we quantified biomass recovery as a function of windthrow severity (i.e., fraction of windthrow tree mortality on Landsat pixels, ranging from 0%-70%) and time since disturbance for terra-firme forests in the Central Amazon. Forest monitoring allowed insights into the processes and mechanisms driving the net biomass change (i.e., increment minus loss) and shifts in functional composition. Windthrown areas recovering for between 4-27 years had biomass stocks as low as 65.2-91.7 Mg/ha or 23%-38% of those in nearby undisturbed forests (similar to 255.6 Mg/ha, all sites). Even low windthrow severities (4%-20% tree mortality) caused decadal changes in biomass stocks and structure. While rates of biomass increment in recovering vegetation were nearly double (6.3 +/- 1.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) those of undisturbed forests (similar to 3.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), biomass loss due to post-windthrow mortality was high (up to -7.5 +/- 8.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), 8.5 years since disturbance) and unpredictable. Consequently, recovery to 90% of "pre-disturbance" biomass takes up to 40 years. Resprouting trees contributed little to biomass recovery. Instead, light-demanding, low-density genera (e.g., Cecropia, Inga, Miconia, Pourouma, Tachigali, and Tapirira) were favored, resulting in substantial post-windthrow species turnover. Shifts in functional composition demonstrate that windthrows affect the resilience of live tree biomass by favoring soft-wooded species with shorter life spans that are more vulnerable to future disturbances. As the time required for forests to recover biomass is likely similar to the recurrence interval of windthrows triggering succession, windthrows have the potential to control landscape biomass/carbon dynamics and functional composition in Amazon forests.

TI  - Continental-scale surface reflectance product from CBERS-4 MUX data: Assessment of atmospheric correction method using coincident Landsat observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A practical atmospheric correction algorithm, called Coupled Moderate Products for Atmospheric Correction (CMPAC), was developed and implemented for the Multispectral Camera (MUX) on-board the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4). This algorithm uses a scene-based processing and sliding window technique to derive MUX surface reflectance (SR) at continental scale. Unlike other optical sensors, MUX instrument imposes constraints for atmospheric correction due to the absence of spectral bands for aerosol estimation from imagery itself. To overcome this limitation, the proposed algorithm performs a further processing of atmospheric products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors as input parameters for radiative transfer calculations. The success of CMPAC algorithm was fully assessed and confirmed by comparison of MUX SR data with the Landsat-8 OLI Level-2 and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-derived SR products. The spectral adjustment was performed to compensate for the differences of relative spectral response between MUX and OLI sensors. The results show that MUX SR values are fairly similar to operational Landsat-8 SR products (mean difference < 0.0062, expressed in reflectance). There is a slight underestimation of MUX SR compared to OLI product (except the NIR band), but the error metrics are typically low and scattered points are around the line 1:1. These results suggest the potential of combining these datasets (MUX and OLI) for quantitative studies. Further, the robust agreement of MUX and AERONET-derived SR values emphasizes the quality of moderate atmospheric products as input parameters in this application, with root-mean-square deviation lower than 0.0047. These findings confirm that (i) CMPAC is a suitable tool for estimating surface reflectance of CBERS MUX data, and (ii) ancillary products support the application of atmospheric correction by filling the gap of atmospheric information. The uncertainties of atmospheric products, negligence of the bidirectional effects, and two aerosol models were also identified as a limitation. Finally, this study presents a framework basis for atmospheric correction of CBERS-4 MUX images. The utility of CBERS data comes from its use, and this new product enables the quantitative remote sensing for land monitoring and environmental assessment at 20 m spatial resolution.

TI  - Combining COSMO-SkyMed satellites data and numerical modeling for the dynamic management of artificial recharge basins
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many urbanized areas in the world are using artificial recharge basins (ARB) as an efficient solution to maintain adequate groundwater recharge while coping with flooding problems. The effective management of these basins to adequately maintain their functionality over mid-to-long term requires a suitable monitoring network. Here, we explored the use of a temporal satellite analysis to closely evaluate the efficiency of the ARB in terms of infiltration capacity, depending on hydraulic conditions of the topsoil transitioning from unclogged to clogged conditions in the ARB.COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were integrated with ground data and numerical modeling to advance the capability for monitoring low water levels and flooded areas within the ARB. The understanding of biofilm development and effects was achieved by identifying anomalous drawdown phases, by constraining ponding boundary conditions in the numerical model, and by estimating subsequent infiltration rate changes under progressive clogging.With appropriate meteorological conditions (consecutive rainfall events separated by few dry days), the biofilm could develop rapidly and cover large surfaces (e.g., 22 ha) in about two months. During this process, the hydraulic conductivity of the basin surface could decrease by more than three orders of magnitude, completely altering the relationship with the local groundwater regime. Quantitative estimation of the evolution of the infiltration rate provides crucial insights about the overall recharge behavior of ARBs to make reliable economical plans in both the design and monitoring phase.

TI  - Adapting the DIPLOMACY Board Game Concept for 21st Century International Relations Teaching
T2  - SIMULATION & GAMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. This article reports on pedagogical experiences of designing and teaching an active learning international relations (IR) course utilizing the classical board game DIPLOMACY, with added game elements and modified game rules to make the game better suited for educational purposes. Aim. Game adaptations include team play, a dedicated peace mediator team, altered win rules and a post-game debriefing discussion on different cultures of anarchy. These elements were designed to overcome a shortcoming that the game approximates a worldview akin to offensive realism, which is not practical in contemporary international relations, and also normatively objectionable to many IR scholars. Method. Teacher experiences designing and modifying the course, coupled with student feedback on the course concept from three consecutive years. Results. Student feedback has been exceedingly positive, with a 4.61 average grade (n = 210 grades) on a five-point Likert-type scale, where 1 signifies poor and 5 excellent. Conclusions. Through game modifications, students turned a game infamous for its backstabbing and breaking of promises into a game that resolves in a mediated and negotiated outcome. The findings suggest that DIPLOMACY can be useful beyond teaching the realist worldview, and adapted to create a more accurate microworld approximation of international relations.

TI  - Time Series Analysis of MODIS-Derived NDVI for the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park, South Africa: Impact of Recent Intense Drought
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of temperature and precipitation influenced by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is potentially one of key factors contributing to vegetation product in southern Africa. Thus, understanding large-scale ocean-atmospheric phenomena like the ENSO and Indian Ocean Dipole/Dipole Mode Index (DMI) is important. In this study, 16 years (2002-2017) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra/Aqua 16-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), extracted and processed using JavaScript code editor in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to analyze the vegetation response pattern of the oldest proclaimed nature reserve in Africa, the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP) to climatic variability. The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), burned area index (BAI), and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) were also analyzed. The study used the Modern Retrospective Analysis for the Research Application (MERRA) model monthly mean soil temperature and precipitations. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) evapotranspiration (ET) data were used to investigate the HiP vegetation water stress. The region in the southern part of the HiP which has land cover dominated by savanna experienced the most impact of the strong El Nino. Both the HiP NDVI inter-annual Mann-Kendal trend test and sequential Mann-Kendall (SQ-MK) test indicated a significant downward trend during the El Nino years of 2003 and 2014-2015. The SQ-MK significant trend turning point which was thought to be associated with the 2014-2015 El Nino periods begun in November 2012. The wavelet coherence and coherence phase indicated a positive teleconnection/correlation between soil temperatures, precipitation, soil moisture (NDII), and ET. This was explained by a dominant in-phase relationship between the NDVI and climatic parameters especially at a period band of 8-16 months.

TI  - All Revolutions Are Equal; But Some Are More Equal Than Others
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUTURES STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a substantive body o f literature that argues contemporary societies are being impacted by revolutionary conditions, although precisely what is meant by the idea o f revolution varies enormously in almost every case. This article argues that it is essential foresight practitioners have an understanding o f the systemic and worldview altering possibilities that many revolutions imply, and that such an understanding is then contextualized into whatever foresight praxis is being undertaken. It seeks to explore a plurality o f revolutionary realities through indications o f characteristics, manifestations and potential foresight impacts, while asserting that there is a nested interdependence in the variety. It also contends that the bio-physical revolution now upon us requires a completely different theoretical and ontological orientation to anything that has gone before. Finally, it suggests that if new thinking requires new forms then the practice of foresight not only requires a conceptual framing that integrates the past with the future as part of practice, but if it is to be relevant in the future conversations that matter, it may need to completely reconceive itself as a conceptual space.

TI  - Investigation of high ozone events due to wildfire smoke in an urban area
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using data from the St. Luke's site in Meridian, ID (near Boise) during 2006-2017 and a 2017 summer intensive campaign, we investigate enhancements in ozone (O-3) during wildfire events in an urban area. We calculate a wildfire criterion based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke product and historically averaged PM2.5 data to determine when wildfire emissions are influencing the area (smoke vs. non-smoke events). We also use a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to investigate anomalous sources of O-3, such as wildfires, in this urban area. During the summer 2017 intensive campaign, we find that peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), reactive nitrogen (NO,), and maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O-3 show significant enhancements during smoke events compared with non-smoke periods (65%, 42%, and 32%, respectively). We calculate the 95% confidence interval of Delta PM2.5/Delta CO, Delta NOy/Delta CO, Delta PAN/Delta NOy, and Delta PAN/Delta CO enhancement ratios (ERs) to be 0.129-0.144 mu g/m(3)/ppbv, 0.018-0.022 ppbv/ppbv, 0.152-0.192 ppbv/ppbv, and 3.04-3.76 ppbv/ppmv, respectively, for wildfire smoke influenced events. We also observe an enhancement in O-3 production up to PM2.5 concentrations of 60-70 mu g/m(3) in smoke, after which we see a reduction in average MDA8 O-3 mixing ratios. We use the four highest O-3 events during summer 2017 as case studies to examine the highly variable conditions due to the influence of wildfire smoke in an urban area. In two cases, we investigate smoke days that show significant O-3 enhancement and moderate PM2.5 concentrations. These cases suggest that ERs, such as Delta PM2.5/Delta CO and Delta NOy/Delta CO, are less useful in determining the influence of wildfire smoke in an urban area on moderate smoke days. Another case shows reduced O-3 production during a very high, 3-day smoke event (PM2.5 > 70 mu g/m(3)). After this high smoke period, a 20 ppbv enhancement in MDA8 O-3 is observed in moderate smoke. These results indicate that wildfire-influenced O-3 enhancements are highly variable in urban areas but generally increase up to around 60 mu g/m(3) of PM2.5, after which they decrease at very high smoke concentrations. This study also suggests that multiple tracer measurements are needed to fully characterize wildfire plumes in urban areas.

TI  - Enhancing the Irish NFI using <i>k</i>-nearest neighbors and a genetic algorithm
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a nationwide application of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to estimate growing stock volume per hectare for the Irish National Forest Estate using optical satellite imagery and field inventory data from the second National Forest Inventory (NFI). Two approaches are tested: an unweighted k-NN and an improved version (ik-NN) that is optimised using a genetic algorithm. The performance of the models is assessed in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction error. From the simulations, it was found that the optimal value of k was 3, and the smallest pixel-level RMSE for growing stock was 126m(3).ha(-1) when ik-NN was used. Comparisons with estimates from the NFI show that the ik-NN technique can enhance the Irish NFI. These improvements include a total estimate of growing stock volume of 102 million m3 with a confidence interval of +/- 3%, which is smaller than the NFI-reported confidence interval of +/- 5%. In addition, while total county-level estimates of growing volume estimated using ik-NN were consistent with those published from the NFI, their corresponding confidence intervals were much narrower, in the range of a two-to four-fold reduction in the width of the confidence interval.

TI  - Examination of the Physical Atmosphere in the Great Lakes Region and Its Potential Impact on Air QualityOverwater Stability and Satellite Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High mixing ratios of ozone along the shores of Lake Michigan have been a recurring theme over the last 40 years. Models continue to have difficulty in replicating ozone behavior in the region. Although emissions and chemistry may play a role in model performance, the complex meteorological setting of the relatively cold lake in the summer ozone season and the ability of the physical model to replicate this environment may contribute to air quality modeling errors. In this paper, several aspects of the physical atmosphere that may affect air quality, along with potential paths to improve the physical simulations, are broadly examined. The first topic is the consistent overwater overprediction of ozone. Although overwater measurements are scarce, special boat and ferry ozone measurements over the last 15 years have indicated consistent overprediction by models. The roles of model mixing and lake surface temperatures are examined in terms of changing stability over the lake. From an analysis of a 2009 case, it is tentatively concluded that excessive mixing in the meteorological model may lead to an underestimate of mixing in offline chemical models when different boundary layer mixing schemes are used. This is because the stable boundary layer shear, which is removed by mixing in the meteorological model, can no longer produce mixing when mixing is rediagnosed in the offline chemistry model. Second, air temperature has an important role in directly affecting chemistry and emissions. Land-water temperature contrasts are critical to lake and land breezes, which have an impact on mixing and transport. Here, satellite-derived skin temperatures are employed as a path to improve model temperature performance. It is concluded that land surface schemes that adjust moisture based on surface energetics are important in reducing temperature errors.

TI  - Developing 5 m resolution canopy height and digital terrain models from WorldView and ArcticDEM data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital terrain models (DTMs) and vegetation canopy height models (CHMs) are used in a wide range of earth and environmental sciences. An increasing number of CHM products are available from active, passive, and photogrammetric remotely sensed data; however, high-resolution (<= 5 m), wall-to-wall CHMs for the arctic and northern boreal domains that are suitable for detailed spatial analysis are lacking. Recently, a 5-m spatial resolution pan-arctic digital surface model - the ArcticDEM - was created using automated stereopair analysis of high-resolution satellite data. The ArcticDEM is unprecedented in extent and spatial resolution, yet the product generally follows the uppermost surface elevation (i.e., representing a digital surface model, DSM) without regard to whether the surface is comprised of vegetation or bare-earth terrain. To address this limitation, we developed and tested an approach to map vegetation canopy height at a 5-m spatial resolution (hereafter called the local ArcticCHM), and then subtracted these estimated canopy heights from the ArcticDEM in order to create a 5-m resolution DTM (local ArcticDTM). We selected three pilot study areas (total 58 km(2)) across a north-south gradient in Alaska, representing a range of vegetation types and topographic conditions. We estimated and mapped canopy height using random Forest and imputation modeling approaches, with the ArcticDEM and high spatial resolution multispectral satellite data (WorldView-2) used as predictors. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data was used for model calibration and independent validation. Canopy height was reliably predicted across the three study areas, with the best models ranging from root mean square errors (RMSE) 2.2 to 2.6 m and R-2 ranging from 0.59 to 0.76 relative to ALS-based CHM reference data. Similarly, the RMSE between the new local ArcticDTM product and ALS-based DTM reference data was 45-68% less than similar comparisons with the ArcticDEM. Our results offer a means to extend these local ArcticDTM and CHM products to establish high resolution products elsewhere in Alaska of high value for a wide range of earth and environmental sciences research investigations.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 107th Annual Meeting of the United-States-and-Canadian-Academy-of-Pathology (USCAP)
CL  - Vancouver, CANADA
AB  - As multigene panel testing for hereditary cancer syndromes becomes commonplace, germline mutations in genes other than BRCA112 are increasingly identified in breast cancer patients. While histopathologic features of BRCA-mutated breast cancers have been well-characterized, less is known about non-BRCA-related hereditary cancers. We herein investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancers in women with non-BRCA germline mutations. Out of 612 women who underwent germline testing, 16 (2.6%) women with 18 cancers had mutations in non-BRCA genes: ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, TP53, BMPRIA, BRIP1, MUTYH, and RADS. An additional 2 cancers were identified in a woman with a diagnosis of Bloom syndrome (BLM mutation) who was not germline tested. Average age at diagnosis was 50 (range: 27-77), and 65% had no personal cancer history. The majority (79%) of tumors were grade 1 to 2; 35% were either lobular or ductal with lobular features. Stromal responses varied from absent to desmoplastic to sclerotic; 69% of cases had an in situ component. With the exception of a brisk lymphocytic response in BLM- and TP53-mutated cancers, lymphocytic infiltration was mild or absent. In summary, the majority of non BRCA-related hereditary breast cancers represent the patient's sentinel malignancy. Lobular features were seen in a subset, and high-grade, immunogenic carcinomas were uncommon except in the setting ofBLM and TP53 mutations. Overall, these findings demonstrate a range of involved genes in non-BRCA mutation carriers with breast cancer and histopathologic heterogeneity in the associated cancers, arguing against use of histomorphology to infonn panel testing algorithms.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we derive a generic decomposition of the option pricing formula for models with finite activity jumps in the underlying asset price process (SVJ models). This is an extension of the well-known result by Alos [(2012) A decomposition formula for option prices in the Heston model and applications to option pricing approximation, Finance and Stochastics 16 (3), 403-422, doi:10.1007/s00780-012-0177-0] for Heston [(1993) A closed-form solution for options with stochastic volatility with applications to bond and currency options, The Review of Financial Studies 6 (2), 327-343, doi:10.1093/rfs/6.2.327] SV model. Moreover, explicit approximation formulas for option prices are introduced for a popular class of SVJ models - models utilizing a variance process postulated by Heston [(1993) A closed-form solution for options with stochastic volatility with applications to bond and currency options, The Review of Financial Studies 6 (2), 327-343, doi:10.1093/rfs/6.2.327]. In particular, we inspect in detail the approximation formula for the Bates [(1996), Jumps and stochastic volatility: Exchange rate processes implicit in Deutsche mark options, The Review of Financial Studies 9 (1), 69-107, doi:10.1093/rfs/9.1.69] model with log-normal jump sizes and we provide a numerical comparison with the industry standard - Fourier transform pricing methodology. For this model, we also reformulate the approximation formula in terms of implied volatilities. The main advantages of the introduced pricing approximations are twofold. Firstly, we are able to significantly improve computation efficiency (while preserving reasonable approximation errors) and secondly, the formula can provide an intuition on the volatility smile behavior under a specific SVJ model.

TI  - LiDAR derived topography and forest stand characteristics largely explain the spatial variability observed in MODIS land surface phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past, studies have successfully identified climatic controls on the temporal variability of the land surface phenology (LSP). Yet we lack a deeper understanding of the spatial variability observed in LSP within a land cover type and the factors that control it. Here we make use of a high resolution LiDAR based dataset to study the effect of subpixel forest stand characteristics on the spatial variability of LSP metrics based on MODIS NDVI. Multiple linear regression techniques (MLR) were applied on forest stand information and topography derived from LiDAR as well as land cover information (i.e. CORINE and proprietary habitat maps for the year 2012) to predict average LSP metrics of the mountainous Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Six different LSP metrics, i.e. start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of season (LOS), NDVI integrated over the growing season (NDVIsum), maximum NDVI value (NDVImax) and day of maximum NDVI (maxDOY) were modelled in this study. It was found that irrespective of the land cover, the mean SOS, LOS and NDVIsum were largely driven by elevation. However, inclusion of detailed forest stand information improved the models considerably. The EOS however was more complex to model, and the subpixel percentage of broadleaf forests and the slope of the terrain were found to be more strongly linked to EOS. The explained variance of the NDVImax improved from 0.45 to 0.71 when additionally considering land cover information, which further improved to 0.84 when including LiDAR based subpixelforest stand characteristics. Since completely homogenous pixels are rare in nature, our results suggest that incorporation of subpixel forest stand information along with land cover type leads to an improved performance of topography based LSP models. The novelty of this study lies in the use of topography, land cover and subpixel vegetation characteristics derived from LiDAR in a stepwise manner with increasing level of complexity, which demonstrates the importance of forest stand information on LSP at the pixel level.

TI  - Comparison of Digital Building Height Models Extracted from AW3D, TanDEM-X, ASTER, and SRTM Digital Surface Models over Yangon City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical urban growth in the form of urban volume or building height is increasingly being seen as a significant indicator and constituent of the urban environment. Although high-resolution digital surface models can provide valuable information, various places lack access to such resources. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using open digital surface models (DSMs), such as the AW3D30, ASTER, and SRTM datasets, for extracting digital building height models (DBHs) and comparing their accuracy. A multidirectional processing and slope-dependent filtering approach for DBH extraction was used. Yangon was chosen as the study location since it represents a rapidly developing Asian city where urban changes can be observed during the acquisition period of the aforementioned open DSM datasets (2001-2011). The effect of resolution degradation on the accuracy of the coarse AW3D30 DBH with respect to the high-resolution AW3D5 DBH was also examined. It is concluded that AW3D30 is the most suitable open DSM for DBH generation and for observing buildings taller than 9 m. Furthermore, the AW3D30 DBH, ASTER DBH, and SRTM DBH are suitable for observing vertical changes in urban structures.

TI  - Effect of environmental policies in combating aeolian desertification over Sejzy Plain of Iran
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion in arid and semi-arid regions is a serious concern because it can cause land degradation and consequently affect the land use pattern. The aim of this study was to assess the variations of aeolian sediments and gypsum sediment surfaces (ASGSS) during 1992-2017 in Sejzy Plain and to analyze the impact of plans against desertification, as well as human and environmental activities on the variations of these surfaces. In the current study, Landsat satellite images were classified using the multiple layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Finally, the logistic regression model has been used to study the impact and role of plans against desertification, human and environmental activities on the ASGSS variations in the studied area. The ASGSS decreased from 37.9% in 1992 to 24.3% in 2017 in the study area. Investigation of the effect of aeolian desertification in the region showed that planting stabilizing species and preventive measures taken in controlling gypsum-mining activities and grill areas, especially in the northern parts of the region has prevented further variation in the gypsum sediment cover. The results indicate that the planting of stabilizing species in lands outside the ASGSS has a greater effect on reducing ASGSS, in comparison with the planting of stabilizing species in the interior lands of the and ASGSS. Also, the results show that policies related to plans against desertification have been useful in reducing lands with ASGSS.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Using Landsat Data Series (MSS, TM, ETM+ and OLI) in Azrou Forest, in the Central Middle Atlas of Morocco
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of land use/land cover (LULC) has become an increasingly important stage in the development of forest ecosystems strategies. Hence, the main goal of this study was to describe the vegetation change of Azrou Forest in the Middle Atlas, Morocco, between 1987 and 2017. To achieve this, a set of Landsat images, including one Multispectral Scanner (MSS) scene from 1987; one Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scene from 2000; two Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes from 1995 and 2011; and one Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene from 2017; were acquired and processed. Ground-based survey data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to identify and to improve the discrimination between LULC categories. Then, the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method was applied was applied, in order to produce land cover maps for each year. Three classes were considered by the classification of NDVI value: low-density vegetation; moderate-density vegetation, and high-density vegetation. Our study achieved classification accuracies of 66.8% (1987), 99.9% (1995), 99.8% (2000), 99.9% (2011), and 99.9% (2017). The results from the Landsat-based image analysis show that the area of low-density vegetation was decreased from 27.4% to 2.1% over the past 30 years. While, in 2017, the class of high-density vegetation was increased to 64.6% of the total area of study area. The results of this study show that the total forest cover remained stable. The present study highlights the importance of the image classification algorithms combined with NDVI index for better understanding the changes that have occurred in this forest. Therefore, the findings of this study could assist planners and decision-makers to guide, in a good manner, the sustainable land development of areas with similar backgrounds.

TI  - An efficient feature optimization for wetland mapping by synergistic use of SAR intensity, interferometry, and polarimetry data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are home to a great variety of flora and fauna species and provide several unique environmental services. Knowledge of wetland species distribution is critical for sustainable management and resource assessment. In this study, multi-temporal single- and full-polarized RADARSAT-2 and single-polarized TerraSAR-X data were applied to characterize the wetland extent of a test site located in the north east of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The accuracy and information content of wetland map using remote sensing data depend on several factors, such as the type of data, input features, classification algorithms, and ecological characteristics of wetland classes. Most previous wetland studies examined the efficiency of one or two feature types, including intensity and polarimetry. Fewer investigations have examined the potential of interferometric coherence for wetland mapping. Thus, we evaluated the efficiency of using multiple feature types, including intensity, interferometric coherence, and polarimetric scattering for wetland mapping in multiple classification scenarios. An ensemble classifier, namely Random Forest (RF), and a kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) were also used to determine the effect of the classifier. In all classification scenarios, SVM outperformed RF by 1.5-5%. The classification results demonstrated that the intensity features had a higher accuracy relative to coherence and polarimetric features. However, an inclusion of all feature types improved the classification accuracy for both RF and SVM classifiers. We also optimized the type and number of input features using an integration of RF variable importance and Spearman's rank-order correlation. The results of this analysis found that, of 81 input features, 22 were the most important uncorrelated features for classification. An overall classification accuracy of 85.4% was achieved by incorporating these 22 important uncorrelated features based on the proposed classification framework.

TI  - Machine learning approaches in GIS-based ecological modeling of the sand fly <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i>, a vector of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Golestan province, Iran
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and abundance of Phlebotomus papatasi, the primary vector of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in most semi-/arid countries, is a major public health challenge. This study compares several approaches to model the spatial distribution of the species in an endemic region of the disease in Golestan province, northeast of Iran. The intent is to assist decision makers for targeted interventions. We developed a geo-database of the collected Phlebotominae sand flies from different parts of the study region. Sticky paper traps coated with castor oil were used to collect sand flies. In 44 out of 142 sampling sites, Ph. papatasi was present. We also gathered and prepared data on related environmental factors including topography, weather variables, distance to main rivers and remotely sensed data such as normalized difference vegetation cover and land surface temperature (LST) in a GIS framework. Applicability of three classifiers: (vanilla) logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine (SVM) were compared for predicting presence/absence of the vector. Predictive performances were compared using an independent dataset to generate area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Kappa statistics. All three models successfully predicted the presence/absence of the vector, however, the SVM classifier (Accuracy = 0.906, AUC = 0.974, Kappa = 0.876) outperformed the other classifiers on predicting accuracy. Moreover, this classifier was the most sensitive (85%), and the most specific (93%) model. Sensitivity analysis of the most accurate model (i.e. SVM) revealed that slope, nighttime LST in October and mean temperature of the wettest quarter were among the most important predictors. The findings suggest that machine learning techniques, especially the SVM classifier, when coupled with GIS and remote sensing data can be a useful and cost-effective way for identifying habitat suitability of the species.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Multi-Class and Single-Class Classification Approaches for Mountain Agriculture Extraction Using Time-Series NDVI
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised multi-class classification (MCC) approach is widely being used for regional-level land use-land cover (LULC) mapping and monitoring. However, it becomes inefficient if the end user wants to map only one particular class. Therefore, an improved single-class classification (SCC) approach is required for quick and reliable map production purpose. In this regard, the current study attempts to evaluate the performance of MCC and SCC approaches for extracting mountain agriculture area using time-series normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). At first, samples of eight LULC classes were acquired using Google Earth image, and corresponding temporal signatures (TS) were extracted from time-series NDVI to perform classification using minimum distance to mean (MDM) and spectral angle mapper (i.e., multi-class SAMMCSAM) under MCC approach. Secondly, under SCC approach, the TS of three agriculture classes (i.e., agriculture, mixed agriculture and plantation) were utilized as a reference to extract agriculture extent using Euclidean distance (ED) and SAM (i.e., single-class SAMSCSAM) algorithms. The area of all four maps (i.e., MDM19.77% of total geographical area (TGA), MCSAM21.07% of TGA, ED15.23% of TGA, SCSAM13.85% of TGA) was compared with reference agriculture area (14.54% of TGA) of global land cover product, and SCC-based maps were found to have close agreement. Also, the class-wise detection accuracy was evaluated using random sample point-based error matrix which reveals the better performance of ED-based map than rest three maps in terms of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient.

T2  - EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper offers a case study of three selected ecovillages (two in Hungary and one in Slovakia). The main objective is to characterize, analyse and eventually compare types, trends and problems in the development of ecovillages and to discuss the possible impacts and effects of ecovillage movement on sustainable rural development. The authors used interviews, observation and inquiry for data collection and methods of document analysis, content analysis of different sources, and analysis of foot marks. They attempt to bring the worldview closer by introducing the basic ecovillage concept and framework, and by describing the ecovillage types, recent trends, problems and challenges. The analytical part begins with a short characteristic of the ecovillage movement in Hungary and Slovakia and follows with six thematic subchapters that investigate and compare the observed ecovillages according to the purposes and motivation for their founding, the communication models and public relations, local economic systems and self-sufficiency phenomenon, the employment structure and the existing infrastructure. Finally, the last part is devoted to assess the main research findings.

TI  - A methodology to derive global maps of leaf traits using remote sensing and climate data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a modular processing chain to derive global high-resolution maps of leaf traits. In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45% of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE <= 20%) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> isolates in Alaska, 2000-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Alaska Natives experience a high burden of Helicobacter pylori infection and concomitant high rates of gastric cancer. Additionally, the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant H. pylori has been shown to be high in Alaska. In this study, antimicrobial resistance over time among sentinel surveillance isolates was evaluated and risk factors for carrying antimicrobial-resistant H. pylori were assessed.Methods: Through Alaska's H. pylori sentinel surveillance system, antral and fundal biopsies from Alaska Native patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for clinical indications during 2000-2016 were collected and cultured. For positive cultures, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, tetracycline and levofloxacin were determined.Results: A total of 800 H. pylori isolates obtained from 763 patients were tested. Resistance to metronidazole was most common (342/800; 42.8%), followed clarithromycin (238/800; 29.8%), both clarithromycin and metronidazole (128/800; 16.0%) and levofloxacin (113/800; 14.1%). Low proportions of isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and tetracycline. Levofloxacin resistance increased between 2000 and 2016 (P < 0.001), but resistance to other antimicrobials did not change over time. Metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance were more common among women (P < 0.001 for both), whilst levofloxacin resistance was more common among those with an urban residence (P = 0.003). Metronidazole and levofloxacin resistance were more common among older patients (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Between 2000 and 2016, a large percentage of H. pylori isolates received by the Alaska Sentinel Surveillance System demonstrated resistance to common antimicrobials. The surveillance system provides valuable information for clinicians to make informed treatment choices for patient with H. pylori.

TI  - Tasseled cap transformation for assessing hurricane landfall impact on a coastal watershed
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tasseled cap transformation (TCT) has been used to observe relationships among soil moisture, vegetation cover, and canopy condition. Time series Landsat satellite images of high resolution may provide continuous and accurate observations of the land surface, which can be further analyzed using the TCT for natural hazard events. This study explores the use of a unique dispersion phenomenon of TCT for observing the dynamics of vegetation cover and landscape changes due to a major hurricane landfall in the United States. This is based on the Landsat images taken during the Hurricane Bob event, during which the hurricane made landfall in the highly developed New England area in late August 1991. A unique comparison of the TCT time series plots illustrating the relative TCT dispersion phenomenon, which addresses the landfall's profound impact on the Mattapoisett River watershed in 1991, reflects the interactions among biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere in hurricane-prone regions. This analysis can be done without the use of ground truth data and can be further supported by the multitemporal and multidimensional change detection of box plots in terms of brightness and greenness to gain more biophysical interpretation. Findings unveil an inherent earth system process via the varying levels of dispersion among brightness, greenness, and wetness over the coastal watershed with environmental sustainability implications.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I focus on the increasing interest taken by European political and educational policy makers in inter-worldview education. My article has two parts. The first part consists of a document analysis of pivotal European publications on this and related issues. In the second and more critical part of this article, I make explicit my concerns about these European pleas for inter-worldview education. The main criticism that I present below is that the European policy on inter-worldview dialogue views the problem of intolerance too much as an individual problem that can and must be dealt with pedagogically, without recognizing that intolerance is just as much a structural socio-political problem. Important European policy documents, to be examined in the first part of this article, do not discuss how the way our societies are structured results in a sustenance of inequalities and in the marginalization of certain groups of people. At no point does these documents link inter-worldview education to the need "to examine the ideologies and structures of society critically," as a consequence the plea for dialogue loses some of its critical and transforming potential.

TI  - Efficient nonlinear beamformer based on <i>P</i>'th root of detected signals for linear-array photoacoustic tomography: application to sentinel lymph node imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In linear-array transducer-based photoacoustic (PA) imaging, B-scan PA images are formed using the raw channel PA signals. Delay-and-sum (DAS) is the most prevalent algorithm due to its simple implementation, but it leads to low-quality images. Delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) provides a higher image quality in comparison with DAS while it imposes a computational burden of O(M-2). We introduce a nonlinear (NL) beamformer for linear-array PA imaging, which uses the p'th root of the detected signals and imposes the complexity of DAS [O(M)]. The proposed algorithm is evaluated numerically and experimentally [wire-target and in-vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging], and the effects of the parameter p are investigated. The results show that the NL algorithm, using a root of p (NL_p), leads to lower sidelobes and higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with DAS and DMAS, for (p > 2). The sidelobes level (for the wire-target phantom), at the depth of 11.4 mm, are about -31, -52, -52, -67, -88, and -109 dB, for DAS, DMAS, NL_2, NL_3, NL_4, and NL_5, respectively, indicating the superiority of the NL_p algorithm.

TI  - Estimation and analysis of land surface temperature of Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia, by using remote sensing and GIS technologies
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameter used for analyzing the heat energy balance and thermal flux of land surfaces. It is also useful for making urban heat transfer models, water resource management, climate change modeling, and environmental studies. This study is to find the surface temperature of Jubail Industrial City, which is one of the biggest industrial areas in the world. The study also aims to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of LST of the city. Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Remote Sensor (TIRS) data has been used for this study and the surface temperature has been estimated by using single-channel (SC) method. The study reveals that the surface temperature is relatively low and ranging from 20 to 30 degrees C in January. However, the industrial area and some parts of the residential area have more temperature than the rest of the city. During the month of March, the temperature increases gradually and reaches high in June. During the summer, the surface temperature in the residential area of the city is around 40-50 degrees C. The temperature in the sub urban areas is moderate; however, high temperature (50-55 degrees C) has been recorded in the industrial area of the city. Significant heat islands of temperature more than 60 degrees C have also been noted near the iron and steel factories of the industrial area. In the month of September, the land surface temperature in most part of the city is lower than that of peak summer.

TI  - WORLD OUTLOOK AND INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF STATE CONFESSIONAL POLICY IN MODERN RUSSIA
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS AND IDEOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the main components of the mechanism of formation and implementation of the state policy related to religious confessions: worldview-evaluative, normative-legal, institutional-organizational, functional-activity. Based on the matrix developed by the author, an assessment is made of the degree of institutionalization and effectiveness of Russian state policy in the religious sphere. The conclusion is drawn that the salient features of the state confessional policy in modern Russia are: on the one hand, the existence of basic conditions and opportunities for ensuring the sustainable development of all religions without exception to provide citizens with freedom of conscience and satisfaction of religious needs, on the other hand, the presence of ineffective tools for the implementation of state policy in this area. The administrative-managerial system for managing state-confessional relations, both at the federal and regional levels, is not well regulated. This leads to a huge variety of patterns of interaction of power structures with religious associations, the absence of a single vertical of power. There are no general federal body for religious associations, system for forecasting the state of inter-confessional relations, as well as prompt response to the growth of inter-confessional tensions.

TI  - Human Rights Are Neither Universal Nor Natural
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences between various theories of human rights have so far been mainly those of within the same Western worldview, which has either ignored other viewpoints or treated them with condescension. To avoid abstract theorizing on the nature of human rights without studying concrete societies, which had previously existed or exist today, without the analysis of why some of them had become slave-owning societies while others had evolved into liberal-democracies, it is necessary to take historical and comparative approaches. Historically the emergence of human rights is related to the advent of centralized States in the Medieval Europe where those belonging to the class of nobles needed tools that would have justified their claims against the king becoming all-powerful. Both, human rights expressing the good that exists in humans, and human wrongs, reflecting the evil existing in the world and in us, are both equally human, though not necessarily humane. Human rights are social constructs that are called upon to respond to human needs and help remedy human wrongs. Some human rights may, indeed, become universal (namely, become universal, not to be such as God given or deriving from something called human nature), others may be universalisable, while the domain of application of certain rights may remain relatively restricted. While human beings, in essence (i.e. not superficially, as to the colour of their skin or slant of their eyes), are very much the same, societies differ hugely. Societal and cultural differences acquired during the tens of thousands of years long journey of the Homo Sapiens from an African village to all over the world cannot be overcome within decades or even centuries, if ever. There is no global village in the horizon and the world has not become flat.

TI  - Spatial structure of remnants of native forest in the Dry Chaco and the Espinal
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - The vast territory of the Dry Chaco and the Espinal became one of the global centers for the production of grains and meat. Due to different legal norms, productive limitations or cultural causes, the native forest is preserved on extensive patches as well as on numerous small fragments within the agricultural matrix. These remnants are seldom considered by the scientific community and decision-makers, and are left out of territorial planning and conservation actions. In this paper, we describe the spatial structure of the remnants and generate a classification scheme that allows identifying different types according to their spatial properties. Following an object-based classification strategy, we mapped similar to 22000 remnants in eight foci areas (FA) scattered throughout the territory using CBERS-2B satellite images. By means of spatial metrics, these remnants of variable sizes, shapes and isolation levels were categorized into five classes, from "islets" to "compact blocks". The surface of remnants was higher in the Dry Chaco than in the Espinal (between 10.1% and 19.4% in the first region, and between 3.1% and 7.3% in the second). Differences in the level of fragmentation were amplified between FA, depending both on the total surface of remnants and on the relative occurrence of different types. Thus, in the FA of San Luis the fragmentation was 70 times higher than in the FA of Anta (Salta). In this work, we provide tools for the identification and monitoring of these remnants, which may be considered for both productive and conservation purposes. Finally, management and conservation actions must recognize the existence of these pieces of forest in landscapes highly transformed by agricultural activity.

TI  - Tugendhat's Problem of "Truth" in Confrontation with Heidegger
T2  - FILOZOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is to provide a critical commentary on the position held by E. Tugendhat in his work Egocentricity and Mysticism (published in 2003) in terms of his own criteria of the hermeneutic concept of truth. The article presents this concept of truth in its original negative-critical form, and explores two lines of inquiry in an attempt to explicitly grasp the implicitly understood "world as a whole" in Wittgenstein's perspective of the impossibility of reflecting the boundaries of the language. The second, parallel theme is an attempt to investigate the "universe" (understood as a whole) as the basis of his theory of mysticism. The first thesis of this study is that both of these levels, on the one hand the enlightenment worldview and on the other hand the existential concept of mysticism, have to be separated and thematized as a relationship between the condition of a possibility and the conditioned. The second thesis is that as a result of his theory of mysticism Tugendhat introduced the concept of "egocentricity" in two mutually contradictory meanings. The third is that by his essentialism in the concept of anthropology" Tugendhat allowed the return of Heidegger's problem of the historical picture of the world to the place of universal truth, and also the return of the problem of authentic and non-authentic existence beyond the sphere of ethics.

TI  - <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis: a challenge in diagnosis and the role of amniotic membrane transplant as an alternative therapy
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDONESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a very rare, sight-threatening corneal disease caused by the infection of a free-living amoeba. The aim of this report was to demonstrate the challenges in the diagnosis of AK with an atypical presentation. Amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) was done in this case to accelerate wound healing. A woman who frequently used contact lens came with redness and a whitish spot in her left eye 2 weeks before admission. There was a history of rinsing contact lens in tap water. The patient had already been on a topical steroid for 2 weeks. Visual acuity of the left eye was light perception with wrong projection. Examination of the left cornea showed a semi-circular central ulcer with a 5.8-mm area and 1/3 stromal depth. It is surrounded by a feathery-edge infiltrate with positive satellite lesions but without hypopyon. It was diagnosed as corneal ulcers due to mixed infection (bacteria and fungi). After 2 weeks of bacterial and fungal therapy, the size of the ulcer decreased, but the corneal infiltrate remained; therefore, an Acanthamoeba culture was done to determine the possibility of Acanthamoeba infection. Two weeks after the Acanthamoeba topical therapy, the visual acuity improved. AMT was performed to accelerate wound healing. Two months post-AMT, visual acuity improved to 1/60 with no conjunctival or ciliary vasodilation, and the ulcer was resolved. The patient was planned to undergo keratoplasty. The diagnosis of AK with an atypical presentation is challenging. AMT can be used as an alternative therapy to accelerate wound healing.

TI  - The delineation of alluvial aquifers towards a better understanding of channel transmission losses in the Limpopo River Basin
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWPSA Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Management - Water Security, Sustainability and Development in Eastern and Africa Southern
CL  - Gaborone, BOTSWANA
AB  - Understanding the impact of key hydrological processes on the availability of water resources is an integral component of equitable and sustainable integrated water resource management. Previous hydrological studies conducted in the Limpopo River Basin have revealed a gap in the understanding of surface water-groundwater interactions, particularly channel transmission loss processes. These studies, focused largely on the Limpopo River's main stem, have attributed the existence of these streamflow losses to the presence of significant alluvial aquifers and indicated that the losses account for about 30 percent (or 1000 Mm(3) a(-1)) of the basin's water balance. This paper reports on the delineation of alluvial aquifers across the Luvuvhu sub-basin using Landsat-8 imagery and the estimation of potential transmission losses based on the aquifer properties. To delineate alluvial aquifers, general land cover classes including alluvial aquifers were produced from Landsat-8 imagery through image classification. The areal extent of the delineated alluvial aquifers was calculated using ArcMap 10.3 Results indicate that the alluvial aquifers occur as relatively narrow channel alluvial deposits (32-124 m in width) and extensive vegetated floodplain deposits. In the Luvuvhu sub-basin, these are mostly located along the lower reach of the 200 km long meandering Luvuvhu River. The outcome of the delineation of the alluvial aquifer is seen to be consistent with existing regional hydrogeological maps. Based on the characteristics and size of the aquifer it is estimated that the capacity of the aquifer is approximately 9.34 Mm(3), which could be 'lost' from the Luvuvhu River system at any given point in time. The actual transmission losses however depend on a number of factors including the level of flow, the size of the aquifer in contact with the riverbed, regional slope for water loss into the adjacent areas, antecedent moisture content of the aquifer and riparian evapotranspiration.

TI  - Prediction of aerosol optical depth in West Asia using deterministic models and machine learning algorithms
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the lack of ground-based observations in large parts of West Asia, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is mainly monitored by using remote sensing techniques. AOD can also be predicted by short term forecasts with commonly called Deterministic weather prediction models (DMs). The skill of DMs in reproducing remotely sensed observations when averaged over monthly time scales over West Asia is rather limited due to significant uncertainties in inputs and complexity of dust, which is the dominant type of aerosols in the region.Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs), which require much less computational expenses than DMs, can be used. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) AOD as the representative of response variable, MLAs, especially Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), outperformed DMs on monthly time scale. MLAs have yielded lower prediction error (RMSE) and higher correlation with observations than DMs. In addition, findings disclosed that DMs, especially MACC, have failed to simulate observed AOD values over western Iran where the Zagros Mountains prevent advection of fine dust particles to the east of the study area. Prediction errors of MLAs and DMs along with major DB AOD peaks, over Iraq, can be traced back to the rough resolution of variable datasets, omission of some unknown influential predictors representing the life cycle of dust and/or other aerosols, and scarcity of extreme cases. It also remains to be tested in how far the results presented can be generalized to other regions and time scales.

It gradually increased in size and contained solid components. A core needle biopsy revealed an intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast. Partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathological examination revealed an encapsulated papillary carcinoma and a papillary lesion surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. Myoepithelial cells were not found at the periphery of the lesion or within fibrovascular cores. Currently, it is classified as non-invasive carcinoma, and the patient has a good prognosis.

TI  - Clinical application of photodynamic medicine technology using light-emitting fluorescence imaging based on a specialized luminous source
T2  - MEDICAL MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The natural amino acid 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) precursor and a new-generation photosensitive substance that accumulates specifically in cancer cells. When indocyanine green (ICG) is irradiated with near-infrared (NIR) light, it shifts to a higher energy state and emits infrared light with a longer wavelength than the irradiated NIR light. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using ALA and ICG-based NIR fluorescence imaging has emerged as a new diagnostic technique. Specifically, in laparoscopic examinations for serosa-invading advanced gastric cancer, peritoneal metastases could be detected by ALA-PDD, but not by conventional visible-light imaging. The HyperEye Medical System (HEMS) can visualize ICG fluorescence as color images simultaneously projected with visible light in real time. This ICG fluorescence method is widely applicable, including for intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes, visualization of blood vessels in organ resection, and blood flow evaluation during surgery. Fluorescence navigation by ALA-PDD and NIR using ICG imaging provides good visualization and detection of the target lesions that is not possible with the naked eye. We propose that this technique should be used in fundamental research on the relationship among cellular dynamics, metabolic enzymes, and tumor tissues, and to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety in multicenter cooperative clinical trials.

TI  - Role of the Appropriateness of the Pelvic Lymphadenectomy and Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in Early-Stage Poorly Differentiated Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeWith this work, we intend to investigate the prognostic role of the pelvic lymphadenectomy, analyzing the pattern of recurrence in poorly differentiated endometrial carcinoma.Methods and MaterialsOur study analyzes a total of 98 patients affected by early-stage (T1/T2) poorly differentiated endometrial carcinoma. Detailed data concerning clinical presentation, pathology, adjuvant treatment, and outcomes were collected and correlated with disease-free survival (DFS), further distinguished in local and distant DFS, and overall survival (OS). The extent of the lymphadenectomy was considered appropriated when a number of 12 lymph nodes were removed.ResultsThe only characteristic significantly associated with locoregional DFS was the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (p: 0.003), whereas the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT, p: 0.004), the appropriateness of lymphadenectomy (p: 0.019), and the higher age (>65years, p: 0.037) are associated with distance DFS. The only significant variable associated with OS was the higher age (p: 0.025). On multivariate analysis, RT was correlated (p: 0.017) with locoregional DFS, whereas RT (p: 0.019) and age (p: 0.048) were correlated with distance DFS. The multivariate analysis of OS showed that the only parameter associated was the age (p: 0.047).ConclusionsThe results of our study underline the importance of an appropriate lymphadenectomy and the selection of the correct adjuvant strategy in the treatment of early-stage poorly differentiated endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Automatic detection of shoreline change: case of North Sinai coast, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces an appropriate visualization of how to effectively digitize, quantify and predict shoreline kinematics changes. The method relies mainly on the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS) with Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The North Sinai coast in Egypt is selected as a case study. The proposed technique is applied over a quarter-centennial period of 27years (1989-2016). However, the years 2025, 2035, and 2050 are used for prediction purpose. Histogram threshold of band 5, Histogram threshold of band ratio, and Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) are initially tempted as semi-automatic shoreline extraction techniques for Landsat ETM 2010 imagery. Among of them, the TCT is found superior as a digitizing technique that attains the least normalized root mean square errors with the corresponding field data in 2010. Meanwhile, the shoreline change rates in the form of erosion/accretion patterns are automatically quantified by four statistical parameters functioned in DSAS coding. Those, namely end point rate (EPR), net shoreline movement (NSM), linear regression rate (LRR), and least median of squares (LMS). On the basis of the LRR and EPR results, this study offers to the coastal managers a highly reliable decision-support-algorism that can dynamically assist in elaborating strategies to curtail the non-affirmative consequences due to the erosion/accretion of the shoreline.

TI  - RegCM4 simulation with AVHRR land use data towards temperature and precipitation climatology over Indian region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Regional Climate Modeling system (RegCM) is being widely used for climate simulation at seasonal to multi-decadal scales over many regions across the world in recent decades. In this study, we conducted a 10 years simulation using RegCM4 by replacing the United States Geological Survey (USGS) land use data (the default land use data in RegCM) with the land use data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images to test the usefulness of AVHRR land use data in RegCM. We focused on the 10 years (1991-2000) of temperature and precipitation climatologies over Indian region from the model with AVHRR land use data and that of with USGS land use data. The results are compared with Climate Research Unit (CRU) observation through the model biases, standard error, the temporal and spatial correlation between the model and observation in two results (USGS vs. AVHRR). Results indicate that the annual and seasonal climatology of surface temperature and precipitation in both simulations (i.e. with USGS and AVHRR) are close to each other over Indian region. However, the simulation with AVHRR land use data improved up to similar to 2 degrees C in temperature field and similar to 1 mm/d in precipitation field over few regions. The inter-annual variability of surface temperature and precipitation in both simulations are also found almost same. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the AVHRR land use data can be used in RegCM to conduct regional climate simulations over Indian region. Additionally this study suggests that, as AVHRR dataset is available for longer period in 15 days interval, so the impact of land use change on different climatic variables during a period can be studied by using RegCM.The Regional Climate Modeling system (RegCM) is being widely used for climate simulation at seasonal to multi-decadal scales over many regions across the world in recent decades.

Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the AVHRR land use data can be used in RegCM to conduct regional climate simulations over Indian region. Additionally this study suggests that, as AVHRR dataset is available for longer period in 15 days interval, so the impact of land use change on different climatic variables during a period can be studied by using RegCM.

TI  - Classification of Satellite Images in Assessing Urban Land Use Change Using Scale Optimization in Object-Oriented Processes (A Case Study: Ardabil City, Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By using satellite imagery, the recognition and evaluation of various phenomena and extraction of information necessary for the planning of land resources or other purposes are easily accomplished. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency of seven commonly used methods of monitored classification of satellite data to evaluate land use changes using TM and OLI Landsat, IRS, Spot5 and Quick Bird bands as well as different color combinations of these images to detect agricultural land, residential areas and aquatic areas using object-oriented processing. Digital processing of satellite images was carried out in 1998 and 2016 using advanced methods. Training samples were extracted in five user classes by eCognition software using segmentation scale optimization, different color combinations and coefficients of shape and compression. The appropriate segmentation scale for arable land, human complications and the blue areas were, respectively, 50, 8 and 10. Then each image was classified separately using seven methods and extracted samples, and efficiency of each classification method was obtained by calculating two general health and Kappa coefficients. The results show that the accuracy of each classification method and the neural network with a total accuracy of 94.475 and Kappa coefficient of 92.095 were selected as the most accurate classification method. These results show that the sampling of educational samples with proper precision of the classes in the images and dependency probability of each satellite images pixel can be useful in classifying group available in helpful area.

TI  - Geographic Patterns of Fire Severity Following an Extreme <i>Eucalyptus</i> Forest Fire in Southern Australia: 2013 Forcett-Dunalley Fire
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity is an important characteristic of fire regimes; however, global assessments of fire regimes typically focus more on fire frequency and burnt area. Our objective in this case study is to use multiple lines of evidence to understand fire severity and intensity patterns and their environmental correlates in the extreme 2013 Forcett-Dunalley fire in southeast Tasmania, Australia. We use maximum likelihood classification of aerial photography, and fire behavior equations, to report on fire severity and intensity patterns, and compare the performance of multiple thresholds of the normalised burn ratio (dNBR) and normalized difference vegetation index (dNDVI) (from pre- and post-fire Landsat 7 images) against classified aerial photography. We investigate how vegetation, topography, and fire weather, and therefore intensity, influenced fire severity patterns. According to the aerial photographic classification, the fire burnt 25,950 ha of which 5% burnt at low severities, 17% at medium severity, 32% at high severity, 23% at very high severities, while 22% contained unburnt patches. Generalized linear modelling revealed that fire severity was strongly influenced by slope angle, aspect, and interactions between vegetation type and fire weather (FFDI) ranging from moderate (12) to catastrophic (>100). Extreme fire weather, which occurred in 2% of the total fire duration of the fire (16 days), caused the fire to burn nearly half (46%) of the total area of the fireground and resulted in modelled extreme fireline intensities among all vegetation types, including an inferred peak of 68,000 kW.m(-1) in dry forest. The best satellite-based severity map was the site-specific dNBR (45% congruence with aerial photography) showing dNBR potential in Eucalyptus forests, but the reliability of this approach must be assessed using aerial photography, and/or ground assessment.

TI  - Modelling depth to groundwater level using SEBAL-based dry season potential evapotranspiration in the upper Molopo River Catchment, South Africa
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater has emerged to be a formidable poverty reduction tool in many developing countries because it can be distributed to poor communities far more cheaply, quickly and easily. This study investigated the applicability of dry season potential evapotranspiration (ETp) in modelling depth to groundwater level in the upper Molopo River catchment. Landsat-5 TM images for the years 1995 and 2005, and Landsat-8 OLI for the year 2015 were obtained from USGS website. Meteorological data for 1995, 2005 and 2015 were obtained from the South African Weather Services, and were integrated with satellite data for the corresponding years when estimating ETp. ETp for each year was estimated using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). Depth to groundwater level data, recorded in July 2015, were obtained from the Department of Water and Sanitation of South Africa. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between ETp and groundwater. The results revealed variations in spatio-temporal trends of ETp. A gradual decline in ETp was noted across the study area between 1995 and 2015. Variations in depth to groundwater level was also noted in the study area. Finally, high ETp was noted in sites of shallow water table and low ETp in sites of deep water tables. Therefore, the assessment of ETp and their changes on catchment scale is crucial to planning and management of groundwater of the particular catchment.

TI  - Regional Lymph Node Metastases in Groin Sarcomas <i>A Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge</i>
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The evaluation of lymph nodes and the role of groin dissection for groin sarcomas has been controversial where there have not been previous studies or guidelines published. In this study, we aim to first formulate a clinical approach in the evaluation of regional lymph nodal metastases. Second, we aim to also evaluate the role of regional lymphadenectomy in the setting of pathologically involved regional lymph nodes for groin sarcomas.Materials and Methods: In total, 43 consecutive patients with groin sarcomas underwent treatment at the National Cancer Centre Singapore between 2002 and 2015. Univariate comparisons were performed using the log-rank test. A Cox multivariate analysis was performed for disease-specific survival to identify independent prognostic factors.Results: The median disease-free survival was 18 months (range, 1 to 180 mo). The median overall survival (OS) was 28 months (range, 3 to 180 mo). In total, 28 patients underwent a groin dissection. Of the 28 patients who underwent groin dissections, 15 had negative lymph node involvement, 7 had positive lymph node involvement and 6 had lymphovascular invasion. On univariate analysis, grade (P= 0.047) and clinical and/or radiological involvement (P = 0.039) were significant for regional lymph nodal metastases. The 5-year OS for patients with positive lymph nodes was 31%.Conclusions: Our study suggests that the evaluation of lymph nodes via groin dissections in groin sarcomas in the Asian population should be based primarily on clinical and radiologic evidence. Regional lymph node dissection seems to confer OS benefit in patients with these high-risk tumors and can improve local control of disease.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Land-Use Types in Surface Urban Heat Islands for Developing Comfortable Living in Hanoi City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hanoi City of Vietnam changes quickly, especially after its state implemented its Master Plan 2030 for the city's sustainable development in 2011. Then, a number of environmental issues are brought up in response to the master plan's implementation. Among the issues, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect that tends to cause negative impacts on people's heath becomes one major problem for exploitation to seek for mitigation solutions. In this paper, we investigate the land surface thermal signatures among different land-use types in Hanoi. The surface UHI (SUHI) that characterizes the consequences of the UHI effect is also studied and quantified. Note that our SUHI is defined as the magnitude of temperature differentials between any two land-use types (a more general way than that typically proposed in the literature), including urban and suburban. Relationships between main land-use types in terms of composition, percentage coverage, surface temperature, and SUHI in inner Hanoi in the recent two years 2016 and 2017, were proposed and examined. High correlations were found between the percentage coverage of the land-use types and the land surface temperature (LST). Then, a regression model for estimating the intensity of SUHI from the Landsat 8 imagery was derived, through analyzing the correlation between land-use composition and LST for the year 2017. The model was validated successfully for the prediction of the SUHI for another hot day in 2016. For example, the transformation of a chosen area of 161 ha (1.61 km(2)) from vegetation to built-up between two years, 2016 and 2017, can result in enhanced thermal contrast by 3.3 degrees C. The function of the vegetation to lower the LST in a hot environment is evident. The results of this study suggest that the newly developed model provides an opportunity for urban planners and designers to develop measures for adjusting the LST, and for mitigating the consequent effects of UHIs by managing the land use composition and percentage coverage of the individual land-use type.

TI  - Estimation of the burden of flu-association influenza-like illness visits on total clinic visits through the sentinel influenza monitoring system in Senegal during the 2013-2015 influenza seasons
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the burden of influenza is helpful for policy decisions. Here we estimated the contribution of influenza-like illness (ILI) visits associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza among all clinic visits in a Senegal sentinel network. ILI data from ten sentinel sites were collected from January 2013 to December 2015. ILI was defined as an axillary measured fever of more than 37.5 degrees C with a cough or a sore throat. Collected nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza viruses by rRT-PCR. Influenza-associated ILI was defined as ILI with laboratory-confirmed influenza. For the influenza disease burden estimation, we used all-case outpatient visits during the study period who sought care at selected sites. Of 4030 ILI outpatients tested, 1022 were influenza positive. The estimated proportional contribution of influenza-associated ILI was, per 100 outpatients, 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3), 0.32 (95% CI 0.28-0.35), 1.11 (95% CI 1.05-1.16) during 2013, 2014, 2015, respectively. The age-specific outpatient visits proportions of influenza-associated ILI were higher among children under 5 years (0.68%, 95% CI: 0.62-0.70). The predominant virus during years 2013 and 2015 was influenza B while A/H3N2 subtype was predominant during 2014. Influenza viruses cause a substantial burden of outpatient visits particularly among children under 5 of age in Senegal and highlight the need of vaccination in risk groups.

TI  - Foxes (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) as sentinels for parasitic zoonoses, Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella nativa, in the northeastern Canadian Arctic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spp. have been recurring for decades among Inuit of Nunavik, northeastern Canada. Contact with wildlife has been identified as a risk factor for Inuit exposure to T. gondii, but reservoirs have yet to be confirmed based on direct detection of DNA or organism. Similarly, little is known about the occurrence of Trichinella spp. in wildlife species of Nunavik other than walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) and bears (Ursus americanus, Ursus maritimus). Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were targeted as possible sentinels for T. gondii and Trichinella spp. because of their high trophic position within the Arctic food chain as carnivorous scavengers. A total of 39 red foxes were sampled from four communities in southern and western Nunavik between November 2015 and September 2016. For the first time in wildlife, a novel magnetic capture DNA extraction and real-time PCR technique was used to isolate and detect T. gondii DNA from the heart and brain of foxes. A double separatory funnel digestion method followed by multiplex PCR was used to recover and genotype larvae of Trichinella spp. from tongues of foxes. Seroprevalence based on detection of antibodies to T. gondii was 41% (95% CI: 27-57%) using a commercially available modified agglutination test (MAT). Detection of DNA of T. gondii and larvae of Trichinella nativa (T2) occurred in 44% (95% CI: 28-60%) and 36% (95% CI: 21-51%) of foxes, respectively. Coinfection with both T. nativa and T. gondii occurred among 23% (95%CI: 13-38%) of foxes which can be attributed to co-transmission from prey and scavenged species in their diet There was only moderate agreement between T. gondii serology and direct detection of T. gondii DNA using the MC-PCR technique (Kappa test statistic: 0.321), suggesting that using both methods in tandem can increase the sensitivity of detection for this parasite. These findings show that foxes are good sentinels for circulation of parasitic zoonoses in terrestrial northern ecosystems since they are highly exposed, show measurable indicators of infection and do not serve as exposure sources for humans.

TI  - A GIS-based framework for quantifying potential shadow casts on lakes applied to a Danish lake experimental facility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a Python-based framework for analyzing and quantifying potential shadow casts on lake and reservoir surfaces from the surrounding terrain features. The framework is based on remote sensing data and in this case a detailed Danish nationwide digital elevation model (DEM), which renders not only the physical surface of the terrain, i.e. the topography, but also the elevation of, for instance, buildings and vegetation. We developed a methodological framework encompassing existing computational routines embedded in the open source QGIS platform as well as existing computational packages available for Python, which collectively enable calculation of shadow casts from all elements surrounding a lake or a reservoir surface. Our framework is demonstrated through application to a Danish lake experimental facility but may be used for lakes or reservoirs world-wide to evaluate if shadow casts need to be considered and accounted for in modelling studies by correction of e.g. radiation inputs.

TI  - Multiple Optimal Depth Predictors Analysis (MODPA) for river bathymetry: Findings from spectroradiometry, simulations, and satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote mapping of bathymetry can play a key role in gaining spatial and temporal insight into fluvial processes, ranging from hydraulics and morphodynamics to habitat conditions. This research introduces Multiple Optimal Depth Predictors Analysis (MODPA), which combines previously developed depth predictors along with additional predictors derived from the intensity component of the HSI color space transformation. MODPA empirically selects a set of optimal predictors among all candidates utilizing partial least squares (PIS), stepwise, or principal component (PC) regression models. The primary focus of this study was on shallow (< 1 m deep) and clearly flowing streams where substrate variability could have a pronounced effect on depth retrieval. Spectroscopic experiments were performed under controlled conditions in a hydraulic laboratory to examine the robustness of bathymetry models with respect to changes in bottom type. Further, simulations from radiative transfer modeling were used to extend the analysis by isolating the effect of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and by investigating the performance of bathymetry models in optically complex and deeper streams. The bathymetry of the Sarca River, a shallow river in the Italian Alps, was mapped using a WorldView-2 (WV-2) image, for which we evaluated the atmospheric compensation (AComp) product. Results indicated the greater robustness of multiple-predictor models particularly MODPA rather than single-predictor models, such as Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA), with respect to heterogeneity of bottom types, IOPs, and atmospheric effects. The HSI intensity component enhanced the accuracy of depth retrieval, particularly in optically-complex waters and also for low spectral resolution imagery (e.g., GeoEye). Further, the enhanced spectral resolution of WV-2 imagery improved bathymetry retrieval compared to 4-band GeoEye data.

TI  - Near infrared fluorescence light imaging for lymphatic flow toward para-aortic lymph node from the Calot's triangle: A prospective exploratory study
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes (PAN) in hilar malignancies is considered distant metastasis. Fluorescence imaging using near infrared fluorescence light and indocyanine green (ICG-NIR imaging) are widely employed for identifying the sentinel lymph node, which might be an ideal alternative procedure for whole excisional biopsy of PAN. However, there has been no report about ICG-NIR imaging in hilar malignancies. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal dose for indocyanine green to detect PAN and to reveal the detection rate of ICG-NIR imaging for lymphatic flow toward regional lymph nodes (RLN) or PAN from the Calot's triangle.Patients and methods: We enrolled 62 patients with hepato-pancreatic-biliary malignancies in this study. The dose of ICG was optimized in the first 15 patients and the detection rate for RLN and PAN was evaluated in the remaining 47. We observed that the optimal administered dose of ICG for detecting fluorescent signals in PAN was 5 mg/mL.Results: Using this dose, RLN and PAN fluorescence were detected in 29 of 42 patients. Fluorescent signals were recorded in the lymph nodes (LN) along the bile duct and the posterior surface of the head of the pancreas. We also detected PAN fluorescent signals on the right side of the aorta around the left renal vein. We recommend 5 mg/ml of ICG to visualize lymphatic flow from the hepatoduodenal ligament to PAN using ICG-NIR imaging. However, because detection rate of RLN and PAN were 69%, respectively, further improvement for this procedure will be necessary for clinical application.

TI  - Landsat time series analysis for temperate forest cover change detection in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) is the longest continuous mountain complex in Mexico and is characterised by high species diversity and a high proportion of endemism. The rate of deforestation is high in Mexico, as in other megadiverse countries, and protection of the country's biodiversity is a top priority. Quantification of changes in vegetation cover is essential for this purpose. Temporal information is required to enable classification of vegetation cover and change processes. In this study, the disturbances that occurred in the temperate forest of the SMO in the State of Durango (Mexico) during the period 1986-2012 were quantified using Landsat Time Series Stacks (LTSS) and the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm. The results obtained confirmed that land cover changes were detected with high overall accuracy (97.6%). In order to analyze the forest losses corresponding to the only official data available in Mexico, we retrieved land use and vegetation mapping (USV) data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The aridity index was established and fragmentation analysis was carried out in the study area, showing that forest pests and forest fires were the principal disturbance events in the SMO of Durango, and that the climate greatly influenced the occurrence of disturbances. The LTSS-VCT analysis revealed that for the period 1986-2012, about 34% of the temperate forest cover in the SMO in Durango was lost due to different types of disturbance, representing an annual rate of loss of forest cover of 1.3% and affecting 32,840 ha of land per year. The trend analysis of USV data showed very similar changes to those indicated by the LTSS-VCT analysis in terms of loss of temperate forest. However, differences were observed in regards to the absolute values of forest cover and vegetation loss, with analysis of the USV data indicating forest losses of 28% due to disturbances and an annual disturbance rate of 1%, affecting 49,940 ha of land per year. The LTSS-VCT approach proved efficient for mapping data on forest disturbance acquired by a medium spatial resolution (Landsat) sensor in the SMO in the State of Durango, providing satisfactory results and at low cost.

TI  - Cholinesterases as environmental biomarkers to address the putative effects of low, realistic levels of waterborne uranium
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To address the issue of potential cholinergic neurotoxic effects in exposed biota, including sentinel or indicator species, a biomarker approach using cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition as effect criterion has been proposed. Waterborne metals and complex metallic effluents (e.g. from mining) also seem to affect ChE activity of numerous aquatic species, although there is debate on the likelihood of this effect. Considering that environmental exposure to mine effluents is a complex phenomenon, complicated by other factors (such as pH), we intended to simulate a uranium rich effluent, to which test organisms were acutely exposed. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of waterborne uranium on ChE activity of the freshwater organisms Daphnia magna (crustacean), Corbicula fluminea (mollusc), and Carassius auratus (fish), in order to evaluate the feasibility of using this biomarker to diagnose chemical stress induced by waterborne uranium, resulting from mining activities. The obtained data showed that, despite the large body of evidence pointing to inhibitory effects on cholinesterases caused by metals, uranium was not causative of significant ChE impairment in vivo for any tested organism, at concentrations that represent a worst-case contamination scenario. Considering the obtained results, cholinesterase inhibition is not suited to be integrated into a battery of biomarkers to diagnose uranium exposure. Although our study is strictly laboratorial, it has implications in the use and interpretation of this environmental biomarker in biomonitoring studies, especially of uranium-impacted areas.

TI  - Contemporary Management of the Axilla in Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL ADVANCES IN HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The care of patients with breast cancer in the modern era involves a multimodal approach to treating locoregional and distant disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that the extent of surgical intervention in both the breast and axilla can be minimized through a personalized approach based on breast cancer stage, subtype, and planned adjuvant therapies. The older approach focused on complete removal of the axillary contents for appropriate staging and to determine the need for adjuvant systemic therapy and radiation. This approach has been replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy, which allows for axillary staging with the removal of only the nodes most likely to contain metastatic disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy obviates the need for complete axillary lymph node dissection in patients with node-negative disease. Clinical trials have also shown that axillary dissection can be avoided in those patients with low axillary disease burden in the sentinel nodes who are undergoing breast-conserving therapy. Radiation can also be used as an alternative to axillary dissection in patients with positive sentinel nodes, without increasing the risk for regional recurrence. Further studies are needed in patients undergoing mastectomy to determine the optimal strategy for axillary management in the setting of limited disease in the sentinel nodes. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows the ability to evaluate an individual tumor's response to therapy, thereby increasing the possibility of breast-conserving surgery and reduction in the extent of axillary surgery. This review will explore the evolution of management of the axilla in patients with clinically node-negative and node-positive disease, and will provide insights into future directions in breast cancer care.

TI  - Detection of forest canopy gaps from very high resolution aerial images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Europe, assessment of the ecological function of forests is increasingly important as evidenced by Natura 2000, which has seen the establishment of protected sites that are of ecological importance. The presence of canopy gaps has proved to be a useful indicator of the forest structure and biodiversity in these areas.Two methods - Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Image Texture Based Analysis (ITBA) - were assessed to detect and quantify canopy gaps and to investigate the influence of forest type on their performance. The research was undertaken in two Natura 2000 sites in Bulgaria. To estimate the gap fractions in the field, 100 square plots (150 m by 150 m) were established. Within each plot, 25 circular sub-plots were laid out in a regular pattern. Gap size within each sub-plot was estimated visually.The methods were assessed using very high-resolution (0.13 m ground resolution) aerial imagery. For the OBIA method, five parameter settings were tested and the gap fractions estimated on the imagery and compared with the field estimates. Likewise, for the ITBA method, five different settings were tested. In general, both methods overestimated canopy gap fraction relative to the field-based estimates, especially where the gap fractions were relatively small. Larger gaps were more accurately estimated by the OBIA method. Neither method performed well in broadleaved forest. Statistical comparison showed that, overall, the correlations of the estimates from the imagery with field data are only moderate and that there is no significant difference between the two methods.

TI  - Predictive genetic profiles for regional lymph node metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma: a case-matched pilot study
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma confers an estimated lifetime risk of one in 50 for 2016. Clinicopathologic staging and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) have been the standard of care for T2 and T3 lesions. Molecular biomarkers identified in the primary lesion suggestive of metastatic potential may offer a more conclusive prognosis of these lesions. Our purpose was to investigate molecular mutations in primary melanoma that were predictive for micrometastasis as defined by a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) in a case-controlled manner: nine patients with negative SLN and nine with positive SLN. The two cohorts were statistically identical as shown by a t-test for age (P = 0.17), race (P = 0.18), Breslow depth (P = 0.14), Clark level (P = 0.33), host response (P = 0.17), ulceration (P = 0.50), satellite nodules (P = 0.17), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.50), and mitotic activity (P=0.09). While no single gene was significantly associated with SLN status, multivariate analysis using classification and regression tree assessment revealed two unique gene profiles that completely represented regional metastases in our cohort as defined by a positive SLN: PIK3CA (+) NRAS (-) and PIK3CA (-) ERBB4 (-) TP53 (+) SMAD4 (-). These profiles were identified in 89% of the patients with positive SLN; none of these profiles were identified in the SLN-negative cohort. We identified two unique gene profiles associated with positive SLN that do not overlap other studies and highlight the genetic complexity that portends the metastatic phenotype in cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Quantifying the early snowmelt event of 2015 in the Cascade Mountains, USA by developing and validating MODIS-based snowmelt timing maps
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring snowmelt serves as the major hydrological contribution to many watersheds of the US West. Since the 1970s the conterminous western USA has seen an earlier arrival of spring snowmelt. The extremely low snowpack and early melt of 2015 in the Cascade Mountains may be a harbinger of winters to come, underscoring the interest in advancements in spring snowmelt monitoring. Target-of-opportunity and point measurements of snowmelt using meteorological stations or stream gauges are common sources of these data, however, there have been few attempts to identify snowmelt timing using remote sensing. In this study, we describe the creation of snowmelt timing maps (STMs) which identify the day of year that each pixel of a remotely sensed image transitions from "snow-covered" to "no snow" during the spring melt season, controlling for cloud coverage and ephemeral spring snow storms. Derived from the 500 m MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard snow map, MOD10A2, this new dataset provides annual maps of snowmelt timing, with corresponding maps of cloud interference and interannual variability in snow coverage from 2001-2015. We first show that the STMs agree strongly with in-situ snow telemetry (SNOTEL) meteorological station measurements in terms of snowmelt timing. We then use the STMs to investigate the early snowmelt event of 2015 in the Cascade Mountains, USA, highlighting the protected areas of Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake, and Lassen Volcanic National Parks. In 2015 the Cascade Mountains experienced snowmelt 41 days earlier than the 2001-2015 average, with 25% of its land area melting > 65 days earlier than average. The upper elevations of the Cascade Mountains experienced the greatest snowmelt anomaly. Our results are relevant to land managers and biologists as they plan adaptation strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change throughout temperate mountains.

TI  - High levels of the endocrine disruptors bisphenol-A and 17β-estradiol detected in populations of green mussel, <i>Perna viridis</i>, cultured in the Gulf of Thailand
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of the endocrine disruptors bisphenol-A (BPA) and 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) in cultured populations of green mussel (Perna viridis) and water samples collected from selected fresh and marine coastal environments along the eastern coast of Thailand were investigated. Analysis found high levels of BPA in mussel tissues that correlated with levels found in coastal (maximum 37.13 ng/L) and freshwater (50.7 ng/L) sites situated near industrial and densely populated areas. By comparison, high levels of E-2 (62.99 +/- 5.03 ng/L) were found in freshwater sites near to urban areas. Higher concentrations of BPA and E-2 were found in mature green mussels (> 6 mo. old; 6.40 +/- 0.52 cm shell length) than levels determined in juveniles (< 2-3 mo. old; 2.29 +/- 0.65 cm shell length). To evaluate the potential risks associated with the consumption of green mussels, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) for BPA was determined to be 1650 for adult bivalves and 283 for juveniles. As P. viridis can accumulate BPA from the environment, this raises concerns regarding the risks posed by consuming seafood sourced from zones near to major conurbations. Whether the high levels of E-2 found in green mussels is due to accumulation or to de novo synthesis as seen in other molluscs, requires further investigation. While industrial and domestic wastewater may be important sources of BPA, E-2 contamination within the eastern part of the Gulf of Thailand has been linked to domestic waste. The study highlights the importance of the temporal and spatial monitoring of sentinel species, such green mussels, for environmental contaminants, the results of which can lead to the construction of regional risk maps helping to inform national strategies regarding aquaculture zoning and aquatic food safety.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of and use dynamics and its potential indications on land surface temperature in Sokoto Metropolis, Nigeria
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is the main driving force of global environmental change and is considered as most central to various debates on sustainable development. Even though a large volume of literature materials is available on land use/ land cover change for many areas, very little work has been done on land use and its implications on land surface thermal characteristics over the Sokoto area of Nigeria, despite the strategic importance of the zone, including urbanization, increased population as well as the climate in the area, which is dominated by warm harmattan wind blowing Sahara dust inland. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the implications of urban growth on temporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques over Sokoto Metropolis, Nigeria between 1986 and 2016. The change detection of each land use class was carried out for each period using Landsat images obtained from the archives of the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The results revealed that the area has undergone a drastic transformation where built-up area witnessed changes at 10.77%, farmland and vegetation increased at the rate of 0.72% and 2.15%, respectively, for the period of study (1986-2016). While bare soil and water body decreased at the rate of 0.56% and 1.11%, respectively, during the study period. This shows that there exists a transformation from bare surface (desert) to vegetated surface especially between years 2009 and 2016. The LST of Sokoto Metropolis was calculated from the satellite data, and the land surface temperature of each land use class was assessed for the study period. The maximum LST of Sokoto was 30.6 degrees C, 32.8 degrees C and 34.6 degrees C for 1986, 1999 and 2016, respectively. This study has revealed the existence of a positive relationship between built-up area and LST over the area. This development might be as a result of anthropogenic activities through urban growth coupled with its potential impacts on urban climate. These are intensified by constant changes of the space, causing imbalance in the interactions between surface and atmosphere which may be extensively influenced or modified by various forms of land use.

T2  - BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, national official surveillance for influenza has been performed at about 5,000 sentinel hospitals/clinics by the National Official Sentinel Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NOSSID). Meanwhile, all electronic medical claims nationwide in the National Database of Electronic Medical Claims (NDBEMC) were recently disclosed b) the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. We compared the regional variation of influenza incidence among prefectures between the NOSSID and NDBEMC. The data were extracted from NOSSID and the NDBEMC for the 2010/2011 through 2013/2014 seasons. We compared the data of both datasets season by season by using Spearman's rank correlation in each season. Spearman's rank correlation values for the four seasons were 0.7823, 0.3907, 0.4961 and 0.4543, and their p-values were less than 0.00005, 0.0066, 0.0004 and 0.0013, respectively. Statistically, regional variation of influenza incidence in NOSSID is not imprecise, but its correlation with the NDBEMC dataset is not so high. It is important to note this fact when interpreting regional variation in NOSSID.

TI  - Visualization and quantification of significant anthropogenic drivers influencing rangeland degradation trends using Landsat imagery and GIS spatial dependence models: A case study in Northeast Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing countries must consider the influence of anthropogenic dynamics on changes in rangeland habitats. This study explores happened degradation in 178 rangeland management plans for Northeast Iran in three main steps: (1) conducting a trend analysis of rangeland degradation and anthropogenic dynamics in 1986-2000 and 2000-2015, (2) visualizing the effects of anthropogenic drivers on rangeland degradation using bivariate local spatial autocorrelation (BiLISA), and (3) quantifying spatial dependence between anthropogenic driving forces and rangeland degradation using spatial regression approaches. The results show that 0.77% and 0.56% of rangelands are degraded annually during the first and second periods. The BiLISA results indicate that dry-farming, irrigated farming and construction areas were significant drivers in both periods and grazing intensity was a significant driver in the second period. The spatial lag (SL) model (wi=0.3943, Ei=1.4139) with two drivers of dry-farming and irrigated farming in the first period and the spatial error (SE) model (wi=0.4853, Ei=1.515) with livestock density, dry-farming and irrigated farming in the second period showed robust performance in quantifying the driving forces of range-land degradation. To conclude, the BiLISA maps and spatial models indicate a serious intensification of the anthropogenic impacts of ongoing conditions on the rangelands of northeast Iran in the future.

TI  - Zonal mapping of sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer patients using fused SPECT/CT imaging and lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To define the anatomical location of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in penile cancer patients based on Daseler' s original zonal description using a combination of single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT), cross sectional imaging and lymphoscintigraphy and characterise the limits of Zone V.Materials and methods: Patients with primary penile cancer >= T1G2 were included in the study. A total of 113 groins with impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (cN0) underwent planar lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT. The sentinel lymph nodes were mapped on cross sectional imaging according to Daseler' s anatomical description. Using measurements from fixed anatomical landmarks, a custom-made software program mapped the SLNs. SLNs were mapped to the previously undefined Zone V using 3 approaches to avoid observational bias: (a) as perceived by the uroradiologist, (b) limiting Zone V to a 5 mm radius from the sapheno-femoral junction or (c) using a 10 mm radius from the sapheno-femoral junction.Results: Using SPECT-CT, drainage to the groins was seen in 109 of the 113 cN0 groins (96.5%). The majority of the SLNs were located in the central and superior quadrants with 38.2% lying within Zone I, 45% in Zone II and 13% in Zone V. More importantly, sentinel lymph nodes were still localised to the inferior zones with 3% located in Zone III and 0.8% in Zone IV.Conclusions: Using a hybrid of SPECT-CT, cross sectional imaging and lymphoscintigraphy we have demonstrated that SLNs may be located in the inferior zones. We also define the limits of Zone V as an area of 5 mm radius from the sapheno-femoral junction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - THE PERFORMANCE of hyperspectral (Hyperion) sensor to evaluate and propose potential vegetation indices and to discriminate land cover classes in arid and semi-arid areas was evaluated. The requirements for extracting indices from Hyperion images are to be first compensated for atmospheric correction using FLAASH model. The minimum noise fraction transformation was applied to reduce the data noise and for extracting the extreme pixels. Some pure pixel endmember for the target types and backgrounds was used in this study to account for the Spectral Angle Mapping and the arrived results were validated with field study. Different classes of vegetation wereidentified from the different images: plantation, grassland, crops and trees at initial and senescence stage. The spectral signature for the differentvegetation is identified and used for spectral library generationand image classification. Vegetation, which is in the senescence stage, can bedistinguished visually from the Hyperion image. The overall accuracy was 96%, 67%, and 91%, for the 177039 image, 177045 image, and 175042 image, respectively. Therefore, Hyperion data havehigh capability for crop types mapping and extraction of useful quantitative information for the purpose of crop monitoring and management. 30 vegetation indices have been assessed in this study. Four indices were proposed to support precision agriculture in an arid environment, which is vegetal cover density (VCDI), vegetal water content (VWCI), vegetal water stress (VWSI), and vegetal discriminating (VDI). Thermal imagery can help in the detection of different infection in different crops from the first hours of successful germination of conidiospores. The temperature difference allowed the discrimination between infected and healthy leaves before the appearance of visible necrosis on leaves.

AB  - Invasive aquatic macrophytes in Lake Victoria including water hyacinth (Eichhomia crassipes) exhibit periodic cyclical patterns of decline and proliferation with attendant ecological and economic impacts. This study aimed to monitor the extent of macrophytes and other invasive weeds on Lake Victoria to establish their impact on fisheries. The study employed a combination of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques to estimate the coverage of water hyacinth and other invasive macrophytes. Data on fish landings and their respective market values were acquired from the Electronic Fish Market Information Service (EFMIS) database, which is hosted by the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI). Analysis of consistent temporal satellite data showed that the weeds frequently cover sheltered bays and river mouths. These areas of Winam Gulf had higher coverage (average 5000 ha) of macrophytes than the open waters (<200 ha). The proliferation of the invasive weeds showed fluctuations over the study period reaching the highest peak between September and November 2016. Other aquatic plants that have invaded the littoral areas of Lake Victoria include Egeria densa, Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton spp. Increased coverage of macrophytes was found to be correlated inversely with the commercially important tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, but not with other species. The study concludes that there is a need for sustained monitoring of the invasive macrophytes alongside ecosystem modelling studies using the available time series data to clearly identify the ecological factors that drive water hyacinth dynamics and predict more precisely its impact on the fishery.

TI  - Assessment of bank erosion and channel shifting of Padma River in Bangladesh using RS and GIS techniques
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh is a riverine country. Every year it faces many natural hazards due to river. Bangladesh is mainly formed by alluvial deposits. It faces riverbank erosion frequently due to regular shifting of river channels. This research work provides an overview of the trend of riverbank erosion of Padma River of Munshiganj, Madaripur and Shariatpur district. It also shows the land cover change due to riverbank erosion. The riverbank erosion was calculated by using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques. Only secondary data have been used to reach the research goals. Various computer software such as Erdas Imagine, Arc GIS, Google Earth, Environment for Visualizing Images etc. have been used to process and analyze raw data. In this study, using seven selected images of Landsat TM and OLI acquired from 1988 to 2017, the riverbank migration patterns and land dynamics of Padma resulted from accretion/erosion processes for 29 years were investigated. The migration rates are based on the differences in 1988-1993, 1993-1998, 1998-2003, 2003-2008, 2008-2013 and 2013-2017. The average erosion and accretion rates are 1472.056 and 1610.152 ha/year of Padma, respectively. This study shows Padma got meandered and braided from almost straight channel in the time span.

TI  - Data exploration on diet, and composition, energy value and functional division of prey items ingested by White Storks <i>Ciconia ciconia</i> in south-western Poland: Dietary variation due to land cover, reproductive output and colonial breeding
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The dataset presented in this data paper supports "Linking land cover satellite data with dietary variation and reproductive output in an opportunistic forager: Arable land use can boost an ontogenetic trophic bottleneck in the White Stork Ciconia ciconia" (Orlowski et al. 2019) [1]. Analysis of data on diet and prey composition based on an investigation of 165 pellets of White Storks Ciconia ciconia sampled from 52 nests showed that their diet was based primarily on 'eurytopic prey' (embracing taxa from grassland and a variety of non-cropped habitats), the biomass contribution of which in the diet was disproportionately (3-4-fold) higher than the percentage of available corresponding habitats. Similarly, prey items from water/wetland sites prevailed over the availability of corresponding habitats. The opposite pattern characterized prey taxa from arable habitats and forests, the contribution of which was lower than the availability of the corresponding habitats. The total energy content per pellet (calculated by summing the energy content of all individual prey items across one specific prey group) was the most strongly correlated with the biomass of Orthoptera, thereafter with that of mammals, other vertebrates, earthworms and other invertebrates, but not with the biomass of Coleoptera. White Storks from nests of low productivity pairs (i.e. with 1-2 fledglings) consumed a significantly (up to twofold) higher biomass of Coleoptera, Orthoptera and all invertebrates, which also translated into a higher total biomass and a higher total energy content compared to the diet of high productivity pairs (i.e. with 3-4 fledglings). Our data, in particular those relating to energy content in a variety of invertebrate taxa, and their body mass and functional division in terms of habitat preferences should be useful for other researchers to calculate energy budgets of predatory animals living in agricultural landscapes in Europe.

TI  - Farmer Perception, Recollection, and Remote Sensing in Weather Index Insurance: An Ethiopia Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A challenge in addressing climate risk in developing countries is that many regions have extremely limited formal data sets, so for these regions, people must rely on technologies like remote sensing for solutions. However, this means the necessary formal weather data to design and validate remote sensing solutions do not exist. Therefore, many projects use farmers' reported perceptions and recollections of climate risk events, such as drought. However, if these are used to design risk management interventions such as insurance, there may be biases and limitations which could potentially lead to a problematic product. To better understand the value and validity of farmer perceptions, this paper explores two related questions: (1) Is there evidence that farmers reporting data have any information about actual drought events, and (2) is there evidence that it is valuable to address recollection and perception issues when using farmer-reported data? We investigated these questions by analyzing index insurance, in which remote sensing products trigger payments to farmers during loss years. Our case study is perhaps the largest participatory farmer remote sensing insurance project in Ethiopia. We tested the cross-consistency of farmer-reported seasonal vulnerabilities against the years reported as droughts by independent satellite data sources. We found evidence that farmer-reported events are independently reflected in multiple remote sensing datasets, suggesting that there is legitimate information in farmer reporting. Repeated community-based meetings over time and aggregating independent village reports over space lead to improved predictions, suggesting that it may be important to utilize methods to address potential biases.

TI  - Relationship between Africentric Worldview and Psychological Distress among GhanaianMothers of Children with Intellectual Disability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COUNSELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the relationship between an Africentric worldview and psychological distress among 55 Ghanaianmothers of children with intellectual disability. The study hypothesized the protective effects of an Africentric worldview on psychological distress, and their association with parenting stress. Results showed that an Africentric worldview was negatively associated with psychological distress and parenting stress, and that parenting stress was positively related to psychological distress. Further hierarchical regression analysis showed that an Africentric worldview did not moderate the relationship between parenting stress and psychological distress. However, parenting stress mediated the relationship between an Africentric worldview and psychological distress. These findings reveal the positive influence of an Africentric worldview on psychological functioning of mothers of children with intellectual disability. Additionally, the findings underscore the need to develop culturally relevant interventions to help improve the well-being of mothers of children with intellectual disability. Implications for clinical and counselling practice are discussed.

TI  - Change in hazard rates of recurrence over time following diagnosis of endometrial cancer: An age stratified multicentre study from the FRANCOGYN group
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Predicting the pattern of recurrence can aid in the development of targeted surveillance and treatment strategies. The objectives of this study were to identify patterns of recurrence in women with operable endometrial cancer (EC) and to identify high-risk periods for recurrence in function of age.Patients and methods: The data of 1153 women who received primary surgical treatment for stage I-Ill EC between January 2001 and December 2013 were abstracted from a prospectively maintained multicentre database. The time to first recurrence was calculated from the date of diagnosis, and the associated hazard function was examined to determine the peak risk period of recurrence. We categorized age at diagnosis as <65 and >= 65 years old and analysed the hazard rate (HR) by stratifying age groups.Results: Women with EC aged >= 65 years maintain a significant recurrence rate during follow-up whatever the stratification (locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO subgroup). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression showed that the increased risk of recurrence of EC was associated with advanced age, advanced disease ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO subgroup but not with initial treatment received.Conclusion: The annual HR of recurrence is not uniformly distributed over time but is dynamic and markedly determined by prognostic factors at diagnosis.

TI  - Predicting soil organic carbon concentrations in a low relief landscape, eastern Iran
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations in arid areas is necessary for the management of these regions. In the present study, the distribution of SOC concentrations was investigated using digital soil mapping for an area of similar to 41,000 ha in Zahak county, Sistan and Baluchestan province, eastern Iran. 417 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth across a 750 m by 750 m grid. Random Forest (RF) technique was used to model soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations. Topographic and remote sensing indices, and land use and soil texture fractions maps were used as environmental variables. 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate models. Results showed that the mean SOC concentration is very low with a value of 033%. The most important variables for predicting SOC concentration variations were the clay map, Landsat 8 bands 7, 4, 6, 3 and distance from the river. Remote sensed data showed high potential to predict SOC in this low relief region. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 021 and 0.16%, respectively. We concluded that soil clay content, agricultural management, and the processes of wind erosion and deposition determine the SOC distribution in Zahak region, eastern Iran. The predicted map is consistent with the realities of the study area These maps could be used in comprehensive planning to improve SOC in the study area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration into Multi-Objective Calibration of Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model (DHSVM) in a Humid Region of China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an approach that integrates remote sensing evapotranspiration into multi-objective calibration (i.e., runoff and evapotranspiration) of a fully distributed hydrological model, namely a distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM). Because of the lack of a calibration module in the DHSVM, a multi-objective calibration module using epsilon-dominance non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II (epsilon-NSGAII) and based on parallel computing of a Linux cluster for the DHSVM (epsilon P-DHSVM) is developed. The module with DHSVM is applied to a humid river basin located in the mid-west of Zhejiang Province, east China. The results show that runoff is simulated well in single objective calibration, whereas evapotranspiration is not. By considering more variables in multi-objective calibration, DHSVM provides more reasonable simulation for both runoff (NS: 0.74% and PBIAS: 10.5%) and evapotranspiration (NS: 0.76% and PBIAS: 8.6%) and great reduction of equifinality, which illustrates the effect of remote sensing evapotranspiration integration in the calibration of hydrological models.

TI  - Time Tracking of Different Cropping Patterns Using Landsat Images under Different Agricultural Systems during 1990-2050 in Cold China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid cropland reclamation is underway in Cold China in response to increases in food demand, while the lack analyses of time series cropping pattern mappings limits our understanding of the acute transformation process of cropland structure and associated environmental effects. The Cold China contains different agricultural systems (state and private farming), and such systems could lead to different cropping patterns. So far, such changes have not been revealed yet. Based on the Landsat images, this study tracked cropping information in five-year increments (1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2015) and predicted future patterns for the period of 2020-2050 under different agricultural systems using developed method for determining cropland patterns. The following results were obtained: The available time series of Landsat images in Cold China met the requirements for long-term cropping pattern studies, and the developed method exhibited high accuracy (over 91%) and obtained precise spatial information. A new satellite evidence was observed that cropping patterns significantly differed between the two farm types, with paddy field in state farming expanding at a faster rate (from 2.66 to 68.56%) than those in private farming (from 10.12 to 34.98%). More than 70% of paddy expansion was attributed to the transformation of upland crop in each period at the pixel level, which led to a greater loss of upland crop in state farming than private farming (9505.66 km(2) vs. 2840.29 km(2)) during 1990-2015. Rapid cropland reclamation is projected to stagnate in 2020, while paddy expansion will continue until 2040 primarily in private farming in Cold China. This study provides new evidence for different land use change pattern mechanisms between different agricultural systems, and the results have significant implications for understanding and guiding agricultural system development.

TI  - Outbreak of HIV Infection Linked to Nosocomial Transmission, China, 2016-2017
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - On January 25, 2017, a physician from ZC Hospital in Hangzhou, China, reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention that a potential HIV outbreak might have occurred during lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) performed at the hospital on December 30, 2016. We immediately began investigating and identified the index case-patient as an LIT patient's husband who donated lymphocytes for his wife's LIT and later screened HIV-reactive. Subsequent contamination by a technician resulted in the potential exposure of 34 LIT patients. Acute HIV infection was diagnosed in 5 persons. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the HIV-1 gag, pol, and env gene sequences from the index and outbreak-related cases had >= 99.5% similarity. Rapid investigation and implementation of effective control measures successfully controlled the outbreak. This incident provides evidence of a lapse in infection control causing HIV transmission, highlighting the need for stronger measures to protect patients from infectious disease exposure.

TI  - High overlap between traditional ecological knowledge and forest conservation found in the Bolivian Amazon
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been suggested that traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) may play a key role in forest conservation. However, empirical studies assessing to what extent TEK is associated with forest conservation compared with other variables are rare. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the spatial overlap of TEK and forest conservation has not been evaluated at fine scales. In this paper, we address both issues through a case study with Tsimane' Amerindians in the Bolivian Amazon. We sampled 624 households across 59 villages to estimate TEK and used remote sensing data to assess forest conservation. We ran statistical and spatial analyses to evaluate whether TEK was associated and spatially overlapped with forest conservation at the village level. We find that Tsimane' TEK is significantly and positively associated with forest conservation although acculturation variables bear stronger and negative associations with forest conservation. We also find a very significant spatial overlap between levels of Tsimane' TEK and forest conservation. We discuss the potential reasons underpinning our results, which provide insights that may be useful for informing policies in the realms of development, conservation, and climate. We posit that the protection of indigenous cultural systems is vital and urgent to create more effective policies in such realms.

TI  - An Analysis of Gravitational Gradients in Rotated Frames and Their Relation to Oriented Mass Sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many mass sources within the Earth and its fluid envelopes show elongated geometries, aligning with the orientations of plate boundaries and plate motions, coastlines, rivers, and drainage basins for instance. To enhance their identification and separation in global or regional gravity observations and models, a dedicated method based on gravitational gradients analysis is presented here. This approach provides a detailed description of the geographic pattern of the gravity variations, which are accurately mapped thanks to the regular spatial coverage of high-accuracy satellite data and arise from lateral density changes within the planet. First, gravity gradients are defined at different spatial scales in spherical frames, which are rotated along the radial axis according to the orientation of the source. The sensitivity of these gradients to the mass distribution inside a spherical Earth is described and analytical expressions relating the source to the observable are introduced. Then, the gravity gradients responses at different spatial scales to flat, elementary mass sources located at the surface and at increasing depth are studied. Specifically, the paper investigates how a source width and orientation can be determined, for localized and oscillatory mass anomalies with different width-to-length aspect ratios. This theoretical case study aims at providing a basis for the analysis of more complex mass structures, when applying the presented method to static or time-varying satellite gravity field models. It may help deciphering the nature of the gravity sources by the detection of meaningful geometries and orientations in the gravity field.

TI  - Potential of indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence imaging in experimental and clinical practice
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Visualization of lndocyanine Green (ICG) near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence is a promising technique for biomedical applications because of its deep tissue penetration, low autofluorescence, weak dependence on ambient light, safety for patients and medical staff.Methods: To apply this technique to animal studies and clinical practice, we developed multispectral NIR fluorescence imaging system FLUM-808, which can be used in experimental studies and clinical practice, in open and endoscopic surgery (fluorescence-guided surgery). The object is illuminated either directly or through an illumination channel depending on what optical instrument is used (camera lens, fiber endoscope, rigid endoscope, surgical microscope, etc.). The system is able to simultaneously display NIR images and images captured under white light.Results: This article provides examples of imaging techniques used during open and endoscopic surgery with ICG as an NIR fluorescent dye and photosensitizer, demonstrates applications of the technique for experimental and clinical purposes: for intraoperative imaging of blood and lymphatic vessels; for detection of tumors and sentinel lymph nodes; for assessment of tissue, organ, or anastomotic blood supply.Conclusions: This method significantly helps to accurately assign the areas of increased fluorescence to certain anatomical structures during surgery. NIR fluorescence diagnosis can be used in important experimental studies and in clinical practice. The described results of ICG studies can help in developing new fluorescence-based diagnostic and theranostic approaches employing more effective exogenous fluorophores and photosensitizers.

TI  - Biological endpoints in earthworms (<i>Amynthas gracilis</i>) as tools for the ecotoxicity assessment of soils from livestock production systems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the intensification and modernization of livestock farming practices, large amounts of trace metals, veterinary pharmaceuticals and pesticide residues are released to the soil along with animal feces. Hence, there is an increasing concern about the effects of pollutants derived from livestock activities on soil organisms. The objective of this study is to assess the ecotoxicity of soils from livestock production systems using a set of validated tissue and cellular biomarkers of non-native earthworms (Amynthas gracilis) exposed ex situ to real contaminated livestock soils.Overall, the results showed that livestock pollutants present clear environmental risks, since the exposure during 14 days to soils from livestock systems triggered significant sub-lethal effects in A. gracilis, revealed by the increase of acetylcholinesterase activity in earthworms' tissues (from 34.15 +/- 0.79 to 62.74 +/- 2.10 nmol of acetylthiocholine hydrolyzed min(-1) mg(-1) of protein), the decrease of antioxidant defense associated enzymes (superoxide dismutase activity, from 2.76 +/- 0.11 to 1.90 +/- 0.04 U mg(-1) of protein) and of lysosomal integrity (neutral red uptake, from 113.00 +/- 4.81 to 83.73 +/- 2.25%). Moreover, coelomocytes of earthworms exposed to the livestock soil displayed significantly higher DNA damage values (comet assay, from 126.67 +/- 8.67 to 199.67 +/- 23.15 GDI).This study validates the applicability of the tested biomarkers as early warning tools to assess sub-lethal toxicity to organisms inhabiting soil impacted by livestock pollutants. This study also highlights the relevance of A. gracilis as a suitable sentinel species to provide an integrative and more ecologically relevant response of soil ecosystem health in livestock production systems.

TI  - Seasonal Distribution of Mosquitoes According to Habitat Environment (2016-2018)
T2  - Korean Journal of Applied Entomology
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of mosquitoes collected in the Cheongju area from 2016-2018 were compared. The collection sites were established at a residential area, migratory bird sanctuary, and cowshed using black light (BL) and BG sentinel traps. Culex pipiens was the most collected species in the residential area, and Aedes vexans was the most collected species in the migratory bird sanctuary and cowshed in all years. The BG trap collected more individuals than did the BL trap in the residential area and migratory bird sanctuary. In total, 22,679 (10 species) mosquitoes were collected in 2016, and 6,502 (8 species) and 6,803 (9 species) mosquitoes were collected in 2017 and 2018, accounting for 3.49- and 3.33-fold decreases, respectively. The relationship between meteorological conditions and mosquito density, according to various variables, was not significant different. The Chaoyang virus was found in Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens collected at the cowshed in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Based on the results of this study, it is considered that continuous surveillance of mosquitoes should be performed for controlling mosquito populations and mediating diseases spread by this vector.

TI  - Tracing the Drift Ice Using the Particle Tracking Method in the Arctic Ocean
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed distribution and movement trends using in-situ observations and particle tracking methods to understand the movement of the drift ice in the Arctic Ocean. The in-situ movement data of the drift ice in the Arctic Ocean used ITP (Ice-Tethered Profiler) provided by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) from 2009 to 2018, which was analyzed with the location and speed for each year. Particle tracking simulates the movement of the drift ice using daily current and wind data provided by HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model) and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2009-2017). In order to simulate the movement of the drift ice throughout the Arctic Ocean, ITP data, a field observation data, were used as input to calculate the relationship between the current and wind and follow up the Lagrangian particle tracking.Particle tracking simulations were conducted with two experiments taking into account the effects of current and the combined effects of current and wind, most of which were reproduced in the same way as in-situ observations, given the effects of currents and winds. The movement of the drift ice in the Arctic Ocean was reproduced using a wind-imposed equation, which analyzed the movement of the drift ice in a particular year. In 2010, the Arctic Ocean Index (AOI) was a negative year, with particles clearly moving along the Beaufort Gyre, resulting in relatively large movements in Beaufort Sea. On the other hand, in 2017 AOI was a positive year, with most particles not affected by Gyre, resulting in relatively low speed and distance. Around the pole, the speed of the drift ice is lower in 2017 than 2010. From seasonal characteristics in 2010 and 2017, the movement of the drift ice increase in winter 2010 (0.22 m/s) and decrease to spring 2010 (0.16 m/s). In the case of 2017, the movement is increased in summer (0.22 m/s) and decreased to spring time (0.13 m/s). As a result, the particle tracking method will be appropriate to understand long-term drift ice movement trends by linking them with satellite data in place of limited field observations.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Algorithm for Calculation of Absorbed Shortwave Radiation at Surface Using Satellite Date
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Absorbed shortwave radiation at the surface is an important component of energy analysis among the atmosphere, land, and ocean. In this study, the absorbed shortwave radiation was calculated using a radiation model and surface broadband albedo data for application to Geostationary Earth Orbit Korea Multi-Purpose SATellite (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A; GK-2A). And the results (GWNU algorithm) were compared with CERES data and calculation results using pyranometer and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data to be selected as the reference absorbed shortwave radiation. This GWNU algorithm was also compared with the physical and statistical algorithms of GOSE-R ABI and two algorithms (Li et al., 1993; Kim and Jeong, 2016) using regression equation. As a result, the absorbed shortwave radiation calculated by GWNU algorithm was more accurate than the values calculated by the other algorithms. However, if the problem about computing time and accuracy of albedo data arise when absorbed shortwave radiation is calculated by GWNU algorithm, then the empirical algorithms explained above should be used with GWNU algorithm.

TI  - Evolution of Bias-corrected Satellite Rainfall Estimation for Drought Monitoring System in South Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought monitoring is the important system for disasters by climate change. To perform this, it is necessary to measure the precipitation based on satellite rainfall estimation. The data developed in this study provides two kinds of satellite data (raw satellite data and bias-corrected satellite data). The spatial resolution of satellite data is 10 km and the temporal resolution is 1 day. South Korea was selected as the target area, and the original satellite data was constructed, and the bias-correction method was validated. The raw satellite data was constructed using TRMM TMPA and GPM IMERG products. The GRA-IDW was selected for bias-correction method. The correlation coefficient of 0.775 between 1998 and 2017 is relatively high, and TRMM TMPA and GPM IMERG 10 km daily rainfall correlation coefficients are 0.776 and 0.753, respectively. The BIAS values were found to overestimate the raw satellite data over observed data. By using the technique developed in this study, it is possible to provide reliable drought monitoring to Korean peninsula watershed. It is also a basic data for overseas projects including the un-gaged regions. It is expected that reliable gridded data for end users of drought management.

TI  - Antenatal and Intrapartum Risk Factors for Hypoxic-lschemic Encephalopathy in a US Birth Cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) within a recent US birth cohort.Study design In a retrospective cohort study of 44 572 singleton infants >= 36 weeks of gestation born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2008-2015, we identified all infants with HIE based on the presence of 3 inclusion criteria: clinical signs of neonatal encephalopathy, NICU admission, and either a 10-minute Apgar of <= 5 or a base excess of <=-15mmol/L. Neonatal acidemia was defined as a base excess of <=-12mmol/L. We ascertained antenatal and intrapartum complications from electronic records. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression.Results There were 45 infants (1.0 per 1000) with HIE and 197 (4.4 per 1000) with neonatal acidemia. Of the infants with HIE, 64% had an intrapartum complication consisting of a sentinel event (36%). clinical chorioamnionitis (40%), or both (11%). Risk factors for HIE on multivariable analysis were sentinel event (relative risk [RR], 16.1; 95% CI, 8.4-33) and clinical chorioamnionitis (RR. 5.2; 95% CI, 2.7-9.9). After removing the 16 infants with HIE who were exposed to a sentinel event from multivariate analysis, maternal age of >= 35 years (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.6) and a urinary tract infection during pregnancy (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0-6.5) emerged as potential antenatal risk factors for HIE.Conclusions A significant proportion of HIE is preceded by a sentinel event, emphasizing the importance of developing improved methodologies to predict and prevent this perinatal complication. Strategies focused on reducing other complications such as clinical chorioamnionitis and/or maternal pyrexia may also improve our ability to prevent HIE.

TI  - A Different Way of Seeing the World
T2  - HUMAN ARENAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Western civilisation is generally presented as a journey from the world of many gods, to the world of one god, to the world of no god, i.e. from myth, to religion to science. This, we are told, is progress, the march of civilisation towards equality, hence Universal Human Rights, one that the rest of the world from Africa through India to China is expected to emulate. But is it? This paper asserts, but does not argue (for that would mean subscribing to the Western myth of one truth) that this view of the world is based on Western myth that tends to be universal, linear, singular, and objective-driven. There are other ways of seeing the world, shaped by different myths, the Indian myth, for example, that makes our worldview contextual, cyclical, plural and consequence-based (Pattanaik 2013a). Considering such non-Western worldviews will help the West realise how the West's current conflict with immigrants is not modern, or unique, but timeless, an integral part of its worldview.

TI  - High Resolution Drone Surveying of the Pista Geoglyph in Palpa, Peru
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, satellite images can be used to document historical or archaeological sites in areas that are distant, dangerous, or expensive to visit, and they can be used instead of basic fieldwork in several cases. Nowadays, they have final resolution on 35-50 cm, which can be limited for searching of fine structures. Results using the analysis of very high resolution (VHR) satellite data and super resolution data from drone on an object nearby Palpa, Peru are discussed in this article. This study is a part of Nasca project focused on using satellite data for documentation and the analysis of the famous geoglyphs in Peru near Palpa and Nasca, and partially on the documentation of other historical objects. The use of drone shows advantages of this technology to achieve high resolution object documentation and analysis, which provide new details. The documented site was the "Pista" geoglyph. Discovering of unknown geoglyphs (a bird, a guinea pig, and other small drawings) was quite significant in the area of the well-known geoglyph. The new data shows many other details, unseen from the surface or from the satellite imagery, and provides the basis for updating current knowledge and theories about the use and construction of geoglyphs.

TI  - Automated Detection Explosive Volcanic, Eruptions Using Satellite-Derived Cloud Vertical Growth Rates
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ash rich clouds, produced by explosive volcanic eruptions, are a major hazard to aviation. Unfortunately, explosive volcanic eruptions are not always detected in a timely manner in satellite data. The large optical depth of emergent volcanic clouds greatly limits the effectiveness of multispectral infrared-based techniques for distinguishing between volcanic and nonvolcanic clouds. Shortwave radiation-based techniques require sufficient sunlight and large amounts of volcanic ash, relative to hydrometeors, to be effective. Given these fundamental limitations, a new automated technique for detecting emergent clouds, produced by explosive volcanic eruptions, has been developed. The Cloud Growth Anomaly (CGA) technique utilizes geostationary satellite data to identify cloud objects, near volcanoes, that are growing rapidly in the vertical relative to clouds that formed through meteorological processes. Explosive volcanic events are shown to frequently be a source of rapidly developing clouds that, at a minimum, reach the upper troposphere. As such, the CGA algorithm is effective at determining when a recently formed cloud is possibly the result of an explosive eruptive event. While the CGA technique can be applied to any geostationary satellite sensor, it is most effective when applied to latest generation of meteorological satellites, which provide more frequent images with improved spatial resolution. Using a large collection of geographically diverse explosive eruptions, and several geostationary satellites, the CGA technique is described and demonstrated. A CGA-based eruption alerting tool, which is designed to improve the timeliness of volcanic ash advisories, is also described.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MOSQUITO TRAP COUNTS IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON: EFFECT OF TRAP TYPE AND OTHER COVARIATES ON COUNTS AND DIVERSITY
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient detection of multiple species of adult mosquitoes in various habitats using effective traps is a crucial 1st step in any disease prevention program. Novel trap types that target tropical vectors of human diseases require field testing in the habitat of the vector-disease system in question. This paper analyzes a series of mosquito trapping studies conducted at Mapacocha, San Juan Bautista District, Loreto, Peru, during August- September 2013 and April-May 2014. Six trap configurations were evaluated in forest and rural locations. Adult mosquito counts were analyzed using full Bayesian inference of multilevel generalized linear models and posterior probability point estimates of the difference of means of the combined trap catch by trap type comparisons of all species. Light traps (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] incandescent, white light-emitting diode [LED], and ultraviolet LED). caught greater numbers of mosquitoes compared with traps baited with yeast-generated CO2 and Biogents Sentinel (TM) traps (battery powered traps without light and passive box traps). However, diversity measures (species richness, evenness, and similarity) were consistently nearly equal among trap types. Arbovirus vectors were more common in forest locations, while malaria vectors were more common near human habitations. Location had a significant effect on trap effectiveness and mosquito diversity, with traps from forest locations having greater numbers and greater species richness, compared with traps set near human habitations. The results of this study will inform mosquito surveillance trap choices in remote regions of central South America, including regions with emerging tropical diseases, such and dengue and Zika virus.

TI  - Manipulating host resistance structure reveals impact of pathogen dispersal and environmental heterogeneity on epidemics
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how variation in hosts, parasites, and the environment shapes patterns of disease is key to predicting ecological and evolutionary outcomes of epidemics. Yet in spatially structured populations, variation in host resistance may be spatially confounded with variation in parasite dispersal and environmental factors that affect disease processes. To tease apart these disease drivers, we paired surveys of natural epidemics with experiments manipulating spatial variation in host susceptibility to infection. We mapped epidemics of the wind-dispersed powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis in five populations of its plant host, Plantago lanceolata. At 15 replicate sites within each population, we deployed groups of healthy potted 'sentinel' plants from five allopatric host lines. By tracking which sentinels became infected in the field and measuring pathogen connectivity and microclimate at those sites, we could test how variation in these factors affected disease when spatial variation in host resistance and soil conditions was minimized. We found that the prevalence and severity of sentinel infection varied over small spatial scales in the field populations, largely due to heterogeneity in pathogen prevalence on wild plants and unmeasured environmental factors. Microclimate was critical for disease spread only at the onset of epidemics, where humidity increased infection risk. Sentinels were more likely to become infected than initially healthy wild plants at a given field site. However, in a follow-up laboratory inoculation study we detected no significant differences between wild and sentinel plant lines in their qualitative susceptibility to pathogen isolates from the field populations, suggesting that primarily non-genetic differences between sentinel and wild hosts drove their differential infection rates in the field. Our study leverages a multi-faceted experimental approach to disentangle important biotic and abiotic drivers of disease patterns within wild populations.

TI  - MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND MUSCLE DAMAGE DURING SIMULATED RUGBY SEVENS MATCHES IN NATIONAL TEAM PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the match performance (i.e., distance covered in different intensities), signs of muscle damage (assessed by means of creatine kinase [CK] activity and rate of force development [RFD]), and neuromuscular fatigue (using linear sprint and vertical jump performances) after 3 single-day simulated matches performed by rugby sevens players from the Brazilian National team. Ten male rugby sevens players (25.2 +/- 3.6 years; 88.7 +/- 7.1 kg; 182.2 +/- 6.3 cm) participated in this study. On the day before the matches, the athletes performed a 40-m sprint, a vertical jump assessment, and a maximal isometric force test. In the morning of the match day, blood samples were collected to analyze the CK activity. Afterward, 3 simulated rugby sevens' matches were performed with 2-hour intermission periods. The match performance (encompassing total distance and distance covered in different velocity ranges and body loads [BLs]) was obtained from global positioning system units. The statistical analysis was performed using a mixed model approach and the effect sizes (ESs) of the differences. The statistical significance level was set at p <= 0.05. Players were capable of maintaining the match performance when comparing the first and last games. Large (ES>0.8) and significant (p <= 0.05) reductions were demonstrated in the total distance and BL when comparing the second with the first halves. Decrements in the explosive force capacity (assessed by means of RFD) and the squat jump (SJ) were noticed (ES varying from 0.55 to 1.14; p <= 0.05). The CK activity increased after the matches (ES = 1.29; p <= 0.05). The rugby sevens players were able to maintain the physical performance across 3 successive matches simulating the first day of a tournament. The augmented CK activity and the decreases in the SJ and RFD suggest that increased levels of muscle damage were experienced on the day after the matches. Therefore, the technical staff are encouraged to implement recovery strategies and planned substitutions during multiday tournaments to reduce the impact of accumulated fatigue and muscle damage on subsequent match performance. In addition, specific training strategies aimed at better simulating the match demands need to be implemented in the players' training routines.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of Landsat satellite imagery in land cover classification is affected by atmospheric and topographic errors, which have led to the development of different correction methods. In this study, moderate resolution atmospheric transmission (MODTRAN) and dark object subtraction (DOS) atmospheric corrections, and cosine topographic correction were evaluated individually and combined in a heterogeneous landscape in Zambia. These pre-processing methods were tested using a combination of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and Random Forests (RF) non-parametric classifier (hereafter referred to as OBIA-RF). This assessment aimed at understanding the combined effects of different pre-processing methods and the OBIA-RF classification method on the accuracy of Landsat operational land (OLI-8) imagery with different spatial resolutions. Here, we used pansharpened and standard Landsat OLI-8 images with 15 and 30 m spatial resolutions, respectively. The results showed that non pre-processed images reached a classification accuracy of 68% for pansharpened and 66% for standard Landsat OLI-8. Classification accuracy improved to 93% (pansharpened) and 86% (standard) when combined MODTRAN and cosine topographic correction pre-processing were applied. The results highlight the importance of pansharpening, as well as atmospheric and topographic corrections for Landsat OLI-8 imagery, when used as input in OBIA classification with the RF classifier.

TI  - Long Term Cosmetic and Functional Results of One Stage Reconstruction for Lower Eyelid Malignant Melanoma: A Single Centre Experience of Eleven Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAXILLOFACIAL & ORAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Eyelid malignant melanoma represents less than 1% of all skin melanomas and approximately 1% of all malignant neoplasms of the eyelid skin. Because of its relative rarity, there is a paucity of descriptive papers reporting only small series of reconstructed patients. The repair of eyelid defects represents a reconstructive challenge. Ideally, the reconstruction of the defect must guarantee function with tissue of the same color, texture, and thickness of that of the removed skin and at the same time avoid complications such as ectropion and lagophthalmos.Materials and Methods We describe a consecutive series of 11 patients affected by cutaneous melanoma of the lower lid who underwent full-thickness excision of the neoplasm and subsequent wide excision. All the patients were treated in one-stage reconstruction modality with a modified monopedicle myocutaneous flap, harvested from omolateral upper eyelid, tunneled under the lateral canthus skin and armed with a conchal auricular cartilage framework. Four patients underwent the sentinel lymph node biopsy during reconstructive procedure. No major complications were reported. In our experience, the proposed myocutaneous flap allows to obtain excellent results, both aesthetically and functionally.Conclusions This technique has the advantage of avoiding multi-staged procedures, with respect for the oncological excision indication for head and neck melanoma, decreasing the incidence of associated major complications.

T2  - NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: In this study we used a new technology for localization of non-palpable breast tumors using a small steel marker in conjunction of sentinel nodes (SLNs) detection through injection of SPIO nanoparticles; both detected through a magnetic probe. Materials& methods: Ten patients with biopsy-proven non-palpable invasive breast carcinoma or premalignant lesions eligible for SLNs biopsy were enrolled in this study. Results: All tumors were removed with safe surgical margins. The mean nodal detection rate was 3.4 nodes per patient. No interferences in magnetic probe measurements due to the presence of both markers in the same breast were observed. Conclusion: Simultaneous use of the magnetic method in localization of impalpable breast tumors and SNs detection makes breast surgery convenient.

TI  - Interannual and Intra-Monthly Fluctuations of the Wind Field and Sea Surface Temperature in the West African Upwelling Region Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative intensity of fluctuations of the sea surface temperature and wind field in the West African upwelling region within a month (intra-monthly) and from year to year were studied using highly resolved daily satellite data from the 1980s until 2015. It is shown that the interannual and intra-monthly variances are similar or the latter prevail throughout a year (for the wind field) and most of a year (for the sea surface temperature). This should be taken into account during the analysis of the upwelling characteristics (especially in the case of data with low spatio-temporal resolution) to prevent aliasing.

TI  - Long-Term Sea Surface Temperature Trends in the Canary Upwelling Zone and their Causes
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term trends in the sea surface temperature in the Canary upwelling zone and their causes are analyzed on the basis of satellite data from the 1980s until the present. It is shown that the wind activity has strengthened near the northwestern African coast during last 30 years, which is accompanied by local intensification of wind-driven upwelling. The northeastern trade wind weakens in the open Tropical Atlantic, along with the horizontal heat advection in the upper ocean layer, which leads to a decrease in the area of the upwelling waters. As a result, both tendencies partly compensate one another when the temperature is averaged over the region in the northeastern Tropical Atlantic (between 10 degrees-30 degrees N, 10 degrees-25 degrees W).

TI  - The Satellite Atmospheric Sounder IKFS-2: 2. Validation of the Temperature Sounding of the Atmosphere
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of measurements of vertical temperature profiles by the IKFS-2 instrument (the Meteor-M no. 2 satellite) in cloudless conditions was based on the comparison with radiosonde measurements and data from NCEP GFS analysis. Vertical resolution matching is shown to decrease the root-mean-square (RMS) difference between the results provided by the two measurement methods by 0.2-1 K depending on the altitude in the atmosphere. When the vertical resolution is matched the absolute values of the mean differences between the satellite and the radiosonde measurements do not exceed 1 K and the mean square differences vary from 1.2 to 1.8 K, except for the surface layer, where they reach 2 K and 4 K, respectively. The RMS differences between the satellite temperature measurements and NCEP GFS data show worse agreement over the ground (up to 2 K against 1.2-1.5 K for sounders). In the 300-600 hPa pressure interval, the RMS difference between satellite and NCEP GFS data is less than 1 K over water surface but increases to 1.5-2 K over land. In the cloudless cases, the accuracy of sounding over water surface by IKFS-2 (when compared with the analysis results) approaches the accuracy displayed by IASI, which is functionally similar to IKFS-2.

TI  - Determination of the Energy Properties of Wildfires in Siberia by Remote Sensing
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As applied to the conditions of wildfires in Siberia, remote sensing is adapted to record the radiation power from the active fire zone in the range of 3.929-3.989 m (Terra/MODIS data). The limits of variation of the detected values of heat radiation are evaluated. Sporadic peaks that exceed the mean value of heat radiation in the fire field by a value of 2.5 sigma were correlated with high-intensity fires, including crown fires. The probability of remote fire detection in crown stage was no less than 65%. The quantitative dependence of the Fire Radiative Power (FRP) on the area of the active zone was determined using a subpixel analysis. The fraction of forest fires in Siberia with areas of extreme heat radiation is shown to be 5.5 +/- 1.2% of the total wildfires. The total area of high-intensity wildfires including crown fires is at least 8.5% of the average annual wildfire area and reaches values of 15-25% during extreme fire seasons.

TI  - Trends on Axillary Surgery in Nondistant Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Treated Between 2011 and 2015 <i>A Dutch Population-based Study in the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS Era</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate patterns of care in axillary surgery for Dutch clinical T1-4N0M0 (cT1-4N0M0) breast cancer patients and to assess the effect of the American College for Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)-Z0011 and After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy Or Surgery (AMAROS) trial on axillary surgery patterns in Dutch cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node positive breast cancer patients.Background: Since publication of the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trial, omitting a completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in sentinel node positive breast cancer patients is proposed in selected patients.Methods: Data were obtained from the nationwide Nationaal Borstkanker Overleg Nederland breast cancer audit. Descriptive analyses were used to demonstrate trends in axillary surgery. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the omission of cALND in cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients.Results: Between 2011 and 2015 in cT1-4N0M0 breast cancer patients, the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy as definitive axillary staging increased from 72% to 93%, and (c)ALND as definitive axillary staging decreased from 24% to 6% (P < 0.001). The use of cALND decreased from 75% to 17% in cT1-2N0 sentinel node-positive patients (P < 0.001). Earlier year of diagnosis, lower age, primary mastectomy, invasive lobular subtype, increasing tumor grade, and treatment in a non-teaching hospital were associated with a lower probability of omitting cALND (P < 0.001).Conclusions: This study shows a trend towards less extensive axillary surgery in Dutch cT1-T4N0M0 breast cancer patients; illustrated by an overall increase of sentinel lymph node biopsy and decrease in cALND. Despite this trend, particularly noticed in cT1-2N0 sentinel node-positive patients after publication of the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trial, variations in patterns of care in axillary surgery are still present.

TI  - Ex vivo indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for the detection of lymph node involvement in advanced-stage ovarian cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives Methods The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging (FI) for the ex vivo detection of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in advanced stage ovarian cancer (AOC). Paraffin-embedded LNs from patients included in a previous ICG-FI study (Protocol NCT01834469) were further assessed for fluorescence. Intravenous injection of ICG was delivered intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated. Results Conclusions A total of 675 LNs from 19 patients were analyzed. The mean LN number per patient was 29.3 (median: 24; range 2-77). Seventy-three LNs were malignant (10.8%), 602 were benign (89.2%). The mean TBR of all LNs was 1.5 (SD 0.8). With a cut-off TBR of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of ICG-FI for retroperitoneal LNs were 80%, 41%, 2.8%, and 99%, respectively. On univariate analysis, only the fluorescence ratio (TBR >= 1.3) was correlated with malignancy at pathology (P = 0.03). No predictive factors of pathological LN status were found on multivariate analysis. Ex vivo ICG-FI of retroperitoneal LNs in AOC had good sensitivity but poor specificity. However, its high negative predictive value could make it an appropriate complementary tool to focus pathological analysis on fluorescent LNs.

TI  - Who are the smokers who never plan to quit and what do they think about the risks of using tobacco products?
T2  - ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Smoking cigarettes is the most harmful way to use tobacco. Smokers who do not plan to quit present a particular challenge in reducing the morbidity and mortality from tobacco use. Switching to a lower harm product might encourage them to end their use of combusted cigarettes. This study aimed to better understand smokers who do not intend to quit (including their demographic and worldviews as indicators of their social, cultural, and political dispositions) and their perceived risks of cigarettes and possible lower-risk products such as e-cigarettes.Methods: Participants were 2572 current smokers. Data were pooled from 2015 and 2016 cross-sectional surveys of national probability samples of U.S. adults and analyzed with multivariable logistic regressions.Results: Smokers who never plan to quit comprise 14.3% of current U.S. smokers and are more likely to be older (24.2% among 65 + years old vs. 9.8% among 18-24) and less likely to have ever used e-cigarettes. A one-unit increase in hierarchical worldview (measured on a 1-6 scale) was associated with a 20% increase in the odds of never planning to quit. Those who denied that cigarettes cause disease or death (aORs between 1.6 and 2.0) or were uncertain (aORs: 2.5-2.7) were more likely to never plan to quit compared to those who agreed. They did not view risks of e-cigarettes substantially different compared to smokers who plan to quit.Conclusion: One in seven U.S. smokers never plans to quit and might benefit from interventions which reflect their hierarchical worldviews and increase their risk perceptions of combustible cigarettes.

TI  - Tracking shoreline erosion of "at risk" coastal archaeology: the example of ancient Siraf (Iran, Persian Gulf)
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful heritage management requires a robust comprehension of the threats facing archaeological sites, at both current and future timescales. Siraf, on the Persian Gulf of Iran, is a site of national and international importance whose history stretches back to the Sassanid period (224-652 AD). In the present context of global change (drought and relative sea-level rise) and anthropogenic impacts (coastal artificialization and reduced sediment supply), the city's waterfront archaeology is undergoing significant erosion. Nonetheless, at present, the processes leading to the loss of Sirafs in situ archaeological remains are still poorly understood, including the rates, timing and drivers of coastal erosion. Here we use Landsat images to monitor shoreline changes along the Siraf coastline between 1973 and 2016. We spatially quantify the causes and impacts of surface changes along 244 transects. The results demonstrate that coastal erosion is responsible for widespread and archaeologically significant damage, with 48% of the studied transects showing erosion during the period 1973-2016. We elucidate significant temporal variations in the data and, most notably, demonstrate that continued drought since the early 2000s has impacted upon sediment supply to coastal areas, severely accentuating erosion. For instance, between 2003 and 2016, 70% of transects recorded shoreline retreat with worrying implications for the waterfront archaeology of Siraf. These quantitative results provide invaluable spatial information regarding the causes and impacts of erosion upon Sirafs waterfront heritage, in addition to furnishing a template for the protection of the city's internationally important cultural heritage.

TI  - Urban Slum Detection Approaches from High-Resolution Satellite Data Using Statistical and Spectral Based Approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new technique to detect the urban slums from urban buildings using very high resolution data. Many cities in the Global South are facing the development and growth of highly dynamic slum areas, but often lack detailed spatial information. Unlike buildings, vegetation and other features, urban slums lack in their unique spectral signatures. Thus, accurate detection of slums using remote sensing data poses real challenge to researchers and decision-makers. In this work, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, Tamura-based statistical feature extraction and wavelet frame transform-based spectral feature extraction techniques are proposed for detecting the urban slums from urban buildings. The very high resolution data of Madurai city, South India, acquired by Worldview-2 sensor (1.84m) proved the ability of the proposed approaches to identify urban slums from urban buildings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet frame transform-based approach can generate higher classification accuracy than other approaches.
