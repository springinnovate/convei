AB  - This work-in-progress study reports the first findings from an engineering curriculum design process in an East African context. The design of new programs and teaching practices involves three universities with local faculty designing a new engineering curriculum with external experts involved in the design process. Innovation is something that in addition to societies and industries also the global academia is striving towards, and not only in research but more and more so also in education [1]. The big question, however, is how to achieve this and how to make innovation happen inside the classroom when the faculty needs to push the boundaries of science while at the same time being transformative educators [2]. And all this in a global higher education environment, where well-established institutions are in the cross pressure of neoliberal worldview and the humboldtian ideal of the community of scholars [neoliberal]. On the other end innovation and creativity are argued to be products of co-creation and a non-controlled if not chaotic and emergent environment. Much different from tradition and critical thinking (devils advocate) driven scientific world or establishment that sees cultural change and societal pressure often as a threat to their independence. The empirical part for this study involved several co-creation workshops where students and faculty participated and where co-creative learning methods where tested in a local environment. Although the processes ran parallel and where not coupled together both workshops gave insight on the preconditions of curriculum design and design of learning methods in the context in question. The Northern European university in question was responsible for organizing the workshops in collaboration with East African partners. The results show that there are several constraints for curriculum design and the adoption of new learning methods. The first results using the co-creation model proved, however, useful. The process of curriculum design and implementation will go on for the next two years until year 2020.

TI  - THE REFLECTION OF THE TREE CULT IN THE TRADITIONAL WORLD OUTLOOK OF THE TURKS OF THE SAYAN-ALTAI.
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of natural conditions, geographical location of the Sayan-Altai at the crossroads of cultures influenced on a special attitude in the traditional culture to flora and fauna. Basing on the analysis and generalization of literature on the topic and the author's field materials the article specifically seeks to consider the place and role of the cult of the tree in the traditional worldview of the Altai, Tuva and Khakass people. The study shows that currently the Turks of the Sayan-Altai possess fairly complete knowledge about the ancestral character of the veneration of trees as totems. We can say that ideas about the cult of the ancestors are strong. Apparently, the cult of trees took place in the era of the tribal system. Totemic conception, evolving and transforming under the influence of changes in religious beliefs of the population has survived in modern times. This is evidenced by a variety of modern knowledge on the totem trees. The same sacred importance is attached to wooden attributes in ritual practice: the birch-bark dishes, meadowsweet whip, prickly bushes and sharp wooden objects. There exist similar views about the world tree. Apparently, the same stories in the outlook of the Turks of the Sayan-Altai: the Altai, Tuva and Khakassia, are explained by a common ancient history that resulted in a preserved close cultural heritage. Worldview universals are determined by natural and historical experience of peoples, which allows them to experience, evaluate and comprehend the world the same way. There are also distinctive features in the conditions of transformation of the traditional culture through which each ethnic group forms its own image of the world, expressing the unique view of the world. Thus, the emergence and expansion of Burkhanism in the Altai influenced the picture of the world of the Altaians: a special attitude to the birch as "light" wood, a ban on the use of archyn (juniper) in the funeral and commemorative rites. It can be concluded that in modern times archaic animistic ideas have been preserved in the basis of the cult of trees. Along with the usual simple trees there were special, sacred ancestral trees, shamanic and Burkhanist ones. The considered material shows the influence of the cult of the tree on the wedding and funeral-land-commemorative ritualism. Its preservation in one of the most conservative spheres of the traditional culture as in the family ritualism of the people indicates the stability of the tree

AB  - During the late Joseon period, various things changed in the historical narratives. It is said that the comprehension on the national narrative, especially on the ancient time period, had been reinforced since 17th century. New approaches were presented, which comprehend Korean history through the genealogy from Tan’gun(檀君), Kija(箕子), Wi Man(衛滿) to the Three Han States(三韓). The ‘legitimacy theory’ became significant basis in the historical narrative. This paper is an attempt to compare the two important works among diverse versions of legitimacy theory: ‘the three Han legitimacy theory’ asserted by Yi Ik and Dongsa Gangmok written by An Jeongbok. The latter being influenced by the former, comparison of the two would help to understand the progress of legitimacy theory.Yi Ik discovered the legitimacy of Mahan(馬韓) from periodical, genealogical, and historical dimension. An Jeongbok, availing the legitimacy theory, glorified Tan’gun and highlighted Mahan. Tan’gun and Mahan were recreated: Tan’gun as a moral monarch who had no choice but to accept the Chinese culture due to periodical and geographical reasons and Mahan as a state which passed the genealogy of Kija down to the southern part of the Korean peninsular and held the dignity of the legitimate state for long time. Legitimacy needed its opponent: the conducts of Wiman were defined as the first usurpation in the Korean history. The authors differentiated the legitimate succession from the usurpation of the throne, thereby establishing a basis of discerning where legitimacy was. While Yi Ik tried to explain his era through ‘the three Han legitimacy theory’, An Jeongbok attempted to describe Korean history based on the legitimacy theory in his work Dongsa Gangmok.The historians in the Late Joseon period were subject to both sino-centric worldview and historic understanding of Korea as a legitimacy. Yet it is hard to find their intention to replace the Chinese history. Nor did they deviate sharply from the sino-centric world view. Until recently, it was the center of academic attention to find the juncture at which Korean historical works broke bounds of sino-centric view. Yet the historians of late Joseon period did not attempt to escape from the real world where they lived: their object of ‘escaping’ from the sino-centric world view was to justify what they understood the world. In the progress of view of history, there existed a series of phases including chauvinism and nation-centrism. It is hard to find the such case among the historians of late Joseon period. We should remember the fact that the end of nation-centrism was not positive at all. Keeping it in mind, we need to ruminate orientation and attainment of the view of history in the late Joseon period.

AB  - DEM(Digital Elevation Model) being fundamental data in geospatial domain is produced from different data and using various methods. As they are derived their precision varies and altering derivative in application. In this work, we compare two widely used DEMs namely(Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D 30m and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Global 30m) around coastal islands in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea. First statistics of each DEM were calculated and later overlapped in Landsat image for visual comparison of areas below and above zero-meter elevation. As a result, it was found that DEMs were highly correlated with each other and had similar statistics. Besides having few high differences in hilly land area, they were able to represent the coastal lines. It has also been noted that they have many negative values and should carefully select study area covering full watershed in coastal regions to avoid negative elevation even after filling the sinks.

TI  - Surface measured solar radiation data and solar energy resource assessment of Pakistan: A review
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past decade, Pakistan has been facing a shortage of between 3000 MW and 6000 MW in the supply and demand of electricity, leading to several hours of power cut. Sixty-three percent of current electricity generation is based on fossil fuels, leading to cost vulnerability, whereas only one percent is based on renewable resources (non-hydroelectric). The geographical location and climatic conditions of the country offer a high solar energy potential, which signifies the need for solar resource assessment for the planning of solar energy projects. The article provides an overview of the solar resource assessment based on surface measured data and satellite data carried out by researchers. Various researchers have developed solar energy potential maps for the country based on solar insolation data measured by Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). The data measured by PMD reported in the previous literature have been compared with the long-term data from the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC), and both data show good agreement. The approximate annual mean daily global horizontal insolation for the whole country, based on surface measured data by WRDC, is 5.30 kW h/m(2) (19.0 MJ/m(2) or 221 W/m(2)). The government of Pakistan sought to exploit the solar and wind energy potential during the last decade with the help of international agencies. Based on satellite data, the solar resource assessment was done by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA (NREL) in 2007, and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) of the World Bank in 2015. The solar atlas prepared by NREL was not validated by the surface measured data, whereas the solar atlas prepared under ESMAP is to be validated in 2017. A comparison of NREL estimated data and WRDC data shows that NREL's atlas overestimates solar insolation up to 25% in some regions. The annual mean daily solar global horizontal insolation estimated under ESMAP is 5.67 kW h/m(2).

TI  - Geomagnetic field residuals from CHAMP satellite: <i>essential for revealing unmodelled sources</i>
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, due to more than a decade of magnetic measurements obtained from LEO (low Earth orbit) satellites, more robust global geomagnetic field models have been produced. Generally, these models are based on data selected on specific criteria, as night-side and quiet-time measurements to get the best possible description of the internal contributions and to minimise the ionospheric and magnetospheric effects. Despite recent efforts, the external fields contributions remain poorly modelled and clearly understood. Here, we propose to estimate the unmodelled signals mainly linked to the external magnetic fields. We compute residuals from the available daytime and night-time original CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) satellite data and GRIMM-3 model. The post-processing of residuals and the residuals distribution for all geomagnetic field components offer us the possibility to investigate some of their specific features, important to be considered when internal field models are computed.

AB  - In 2016 we first completed the global data processing of digital surface models (DSMs) by using the whole archives of stereo images derived from the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). The dataset has unprecedented 5 m grid spacing utilizing the optical stereo images in 2.5 m resolution while the accuracy was confirmed at 5 m (rms) in vertical and also at 5 m (rms) in horizontal. One year later from the first release of the dataset we updated it with additional calibrations of PRISM interior parameters to eliminate slight systematic height errors which appeared along track. In this paper we present additional updates of the dataset with applying the semi-global matching (SGM) for the DSM generation as well as corrections of mask data for sea areas.

TI  - WHO IS VASILY TRAVNIKOV? BETWEEN LITERARY HOAX AND LITERARY HISTORY
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lift of Vasily Travnikov (1936) by V. Khodasevich is a literary hoax that introduces a fictional poet, the predecessor of Pushkin, and plausibly tells about his life and work. This character is Khodasevich's twin of a kind who criticizes literature of the pre-Pushkin era and the initial period of Pushkin's literary career and claims to create a "Travnikov tradition" comparable to the "Pushkin tradition." Thus, The Life of Vasily Travnikov is an attempt at "myth creation" typical for the modernist literature. Though the image of Travnikov is not purely autobiographical, it gives an idea about Khodasevich, his poetic work and worldview better than, for example, his famous memoirs Necropolis.

AB  - In cloudy area of the Earth, MODIS limits the sensor's ability to quantify biophysical processes in heterogeneous landscape. A passive microwave sensor AMSR2 is not subject to cloud contamination although its spatial resolution is relatively coarse. In this paper, a new spatial and temporal adaptive data fusion model algorithm is presented and demonstrated to blend MODIS and AMSR2 to predict daily land surface water coverage. The MODIS 8 day composite 1km normalized difference water index (NDWI) and AMSR2 daily 16km normalized difference frequency index (NDFI) are used to map land surface water coverage (LSWC) which is effective to monitor agriculture and flood monitoring issues. It was found that the algorithm accurately predicts daily LSWC of AMSR2 at an effective fractional coverage close to that of MODIS.

AB  - Fusion becomes an important technique for improving resolution of satellite images. This importance is established from the ability of such technique to combine relevant information from several images, of a scene, into a single image. The constructed image is more informative than any one of the original images. This paper first presents a literature survey of the most recent fusion techniques concerned with satellite images. Then, it gives a performance evaluation of such techniques for enhancing resolution of color images considering full scene images of different regions with resolutions taken by Spot-4 and Landsat-8 satellites. Finally, it presents a comparison among the fusion techniques using different evaluation criteria.

AB  - Vulnerability plays an important role in risk assessment. For flood vulnerability assessment, the map and characteristics of elements-at-risk at different scales are strongly required depending on the risk and vulnerability assessment requirements. This study proposes a methodology to classify urban structure type by combining object-based image classification and different high resolution remote sensing data. In this study, a high resolution satellite image and LiDAR have been acquired over Kota Bharu, Kelantan which consists of highly heterogeneous urban structure type (UST) classes. The first stage is data pre-processing that includes orthorectification and pansharpening of Geoeye satellite image, image resampling for normalised Digital Surface Model (nDSM) and followed by image segmentation for creating meaningful objects. The second stage comprises of derivation of image features, generation of training and testing datasets, and classification of UST. The classification was based on three types of machine learning classifiers, i.e. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The results obtained from the classification processes were compared using individual omission and commission error, overcall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The results show that Random Forest classifier with all image features achieved the highest overall accuracy (93.5%) and Kappa coefficient (0.94). This is followed by CART classifier with overall accuracy of 93.7% and Kappa coefficient of 0.92. Finally, SVM classifier produced the lowest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient with 88.6% and 0.86, respectively. The UST classification result can be further used to assist detailed building characterisation for large scale flood vulnerability assessment.

TI  - REVITALIZATION OF THE STIGMATIZED ROOTS how sami yoik and shamanistic symbols appear in christian discourses from the early modern age
T2  - EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Yoiking is a vocal singing tradition of the Sami and involves many sacred and profane symbols. Its scope of application goes far beyond the usual connotations of folk songs or ritual songs. It has numerous functions: it is a means of communication; an expression of identity; an instrument of entertainment; it is, furthermore, a system to classify and identify the society and the environment of the Sami; it is a sort of summary of the experience and knowledge acquired of the world that reflects and expresses their worldview. The primary means of sacred communication was also the yoik. This practice is the one most often referred to by observers. Medieval and early modern sources (usually authored by travelers and missionaries) all mention the yoik without exception as a symbol of paganism, as a magical, diabolical song constituting part of the shaman's ritual ceremony. Visitors could not tell the difference between the ritual songs of the shamans and the common 'folk songs'. The stereotyping (external) label of 'shamanism' was easily applied to any yoik, regardless of it having anything to do with shamanism or not. Thereby one of the external categories, the stigmatizing concept of "pagan" became firmly embedded in the notion of yoiking over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These negative undertones regarding the Sami were accentuated by a new (political and scientific) discourse unfolding at the beginning of the twentieth century (as an offshoot of evolutionism and racial theory), separated from religious institutions, in which yoiking was described as an inferior, despicable and shameful custom along with any other phenomena associated with the traditional lifestyle of the Sami. Although the fear of punishment was very successful in repressing the practice of the yoik, the sermons of the much-respected and popular Laestadius, and the Christian Awakening movement that he had launched resulted in an even stronger repression of this vocal tradition. After that it was not out of fear that many Sami did not yoik, but because they were convinced that it was a sin and an instrument for 'conjuring the Devil'. Most of the Laestadians rejected the yoik also nowadays, but many among the Christian Sami youth desire to reconnect with their culture's music, while rejecting the pagan interpretation of yoik. Some of them not only try to relieve the yoik of its pagan connotations, but they specifically invest it with new, Christian meanings. The positive reception and the feasibility of this initiative have been thus far demonstrated by certain settlements or dioceses (mostly in Sweden). In some places, the yoik has already become part of the liturgy in spite of the reluctance of conservative Christians.

AB  - Seagrasses are distinct flowering plants which thrive underwater. They are part of a complex ecosystem that supports different forms of life. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more proficient in sequestering and storing carbon than terrestrial ecosystems. Although seagrasses occupy only 0.2% of the area of the oceans, they sequester approximately 15% of total carbon storage in the ocean. Several remote sensing techniques are available to map and monitor seagrasses but most of them focus only on extent and area coverage. To estimate the carbon sequestration of seagrass beds, aside from extent, other parameters are needed such as leaf area index, percent cover, density, biomass etc., However, there are limits in mapping seagrass parameters using remote sensing. The reflectance measured by sensors is affected by other factors such as water absorption, turbidity, dissolved organic matter, depth and phytoplankton which affects the backscattering of energy. In this study, different remotely sensed datasets and field data were used to measure the parameters needed to estimate the carbon sequestration. Multispectral satellite images such as Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope were utilized to map the distribution and percent cover. High-resolution RGB images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also utilized to correlate field data gathered parameters. Field data such as species, percent cover, leaf area index, canopy height and above ground biomass were gathered in situ. Data extracted from different remote sensing technologies were put together to support the estimation of carbon sequestration of seagrass beds.

TI  - Glycogen-rich clear cell breast carcinoma in a luminal-Her2 molecular subtype: is it only a pathologic feature or is there a gap in therapy?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Glycogen-rich clear cell carcinoma (GRCC) of the breast is a rare variant of primary breast carcinoma that is characterized by carcinoma cells containing an optically clear cytoplasm and intracytoplasmic glycogen. An ongoing debate exists whether it harbors aggressive clinical features. Case Report: The authors report the case of a 41-year-old Greek female patient, who had noticed a lump in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. The patient underwent a left radical mastectomy with sentinel lymph node excisional biopsy and the histopathological diagnosis revealed a pT3pN0cM0R0 luminal-HER2 GRCC invasive carcinoma of the breast. Although the patient received aggressive multimodal adjuvant chemoradiation, as well as hormone therapy, she recurred 31 months after the operation with cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph node metastasis on the left side. Conclusions: The biological behavior of GRCC is difficult to predict. According to the presented data, a gap in therapy might exist regarding the treatment of GRCC. Larger studies should be performed in order to refute or confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - The US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R Series (GOES-R) was launched on November 19, 2016 and was designated GOES-16 upon reaching geostationary orbit ten days later. After checkout and calibration, GOES-16 was relocated to its operational location of 75.2 degrees west and officially became GOES East on December 18, 2017. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is the primary instrument on the GOES-R series for imaging Earth's surface and atmosphere to significantly improve the detection and observation of severe environmental phenomena. A team supporting the GOES-R Flight Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center developed algorithms and software for independent verification of ABI Image Navigation and Registration (INR), which became known as the INR Performance Assessment Tool Set (IPATS). In this paper, we will briefly describe IPATS on top concept level, and then introduce the Landsat chips, chip registration algorithms, and how IPATS measurements are filtered. We present GOES-16 navigation (NAV) errors from flight data from January 2017 to May 2018. The results show a) IPATS characterized INR variations throughout the post-launch test phase; and b) ABI INR has improved over time as post-launch tests were performed and corrections applied. Finally, we will describe how estimated NAV errors have been used to assess and understand satellite attitude anomalies and scale errors etc. This paper shows that IPATS is an effective tool for assessing and improving GOES-16 ABI INR and is also useful for INR long-term monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - We report a case of a Singaporean who acquired Zika virus (ZIKV) during a visit to Cuba. The infection was confirmed using molecular and serological methods. This report highlights potential drawbacks of using IgG serology for diagnosis of flavivirus infections in endemic regions. The low viremia detected during the early phase of this case resulted in low mosquito infectivity rates, suggesting the possibility of ZIKV transmission prior to clinical onset. The report also emphasizes the challenges of public health interventions for Zika fever and the importance of sustaining a low vector population to reduce the risk of arbovirus transmission in vulnerable regions.

TI  - Adequacy of Semi-Analytical Water Reflectance Models in Ocean-Color Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF THE OPEN AND COASTAL OCEAN AND INLAND WATERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Open and Coastal Ocean and Inland Waters
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - Algorithms to retrieve ocean color from space, deterministic or statistical, often use a simplified water reflectance model, specified by a few parameters (e.g., chlorophyll concentration, backscattering and absorption coefficients at a given wavelength). The model, however, may not be representative of the worldwide ocean conditions, since many variables affecting reflectance are fixed at some average values. In this context, the semi-analytical model of Park and Ruddick (2005), PR05, used in the spectral matching POLYMER algorithm (Steinmetz et al., 2011), is examined in terms of its ability to represent properly water reflectance. The PROS model depends on chlorophyll-a concentration, a parameter specifying the contribution of algal and non-algal particles to the backscattering coefficient, and a parameter allowing different absorption coefficients for dissolved organic matter. Model estimates at MODIS wavelengths, obtained for a representative set of Case 1 and Case 2 waters, are compared with Hydrolight calculations that include fluorescence and Raman scattering and AERONET-OC measurements. The accuracy of retrieving inherent optical properties (I0Ps) using the reconstructed reflectance is also evaluated. The model parameters that give the best fit with the simulated data are determined. Agreement is generally good between the two- or three-parameter model results and Hydrolight/AERONETOC values, even in optically complex waters, with discrepancies much smaller than typical atmospheric correction errors. Significant differences exist in some cases, but having a more intricate model (i.e., using more parameters) might not guarantee convergence of the inversion scheme. The trade-off is between efficiency/robustness and accuracy. Significant errors are observed when using the model estimates to retrieve IOPs. Importantly, the model parameters that best fit the input data, in particular chlorophyll-a concentration, may not represent adequately actual values. The reconstructed water reflectance, not the retrieved model parameters, should be used in bio-optical algorithms.

AB  - As a new data source, night light remote sensing data are more suitable for the background of rapid urbanization in China. Therefore, in recent years, many scholars have used the night light remote sensing data to extract and study the expansion of urban construction land. However, researchers are still trying to find better methods to avoid the internal defects of night light data. This study assessed the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods for extracting urban construction land using night light data through actual applications. The results indicated that the areas of urban construction lands extracted using threshold methods were much closer to the authoritative data, and the shape coincidence degrees were also better, while the shape similarity degrees of urban construction lands extracted using the neighborhood analysis method were much better. Further analyses revealed that we may find a better method for extracting urban construction land by considering both the intensity of night light data and the natural boundaries of cities and towns.

TI  - Comparisons of cloud detection among four satellite sensors on severe haze days in eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is very important to obtain a variety of cloud properties. However, the data quality from satellites varies with different satellite characteristics. From December 2015 to January 2016, ground-based air quality index (AQI) data showed severe haze events occurred successively in eastern China, particularly in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. During those days, a red alert (the most serious level), orange alert (the second-highest level), and yellow alert (the third-highest level) for haze, were issued in Beijing. Cloud detection from four sensors onboard the 'A-Train' satellite constellation were compared for two severe haze episodes, on 21 and 30 December 2015 respectively. Results showed that the MODIS sensor onboard the Aqua satellite misclassified aerosol as cloud, while the other three sensors-AIRS onboard Aqua, the cloud profiling radar onboard CloudSat, and CALIOP onboard CALIPSO-did not observe cloud over the same location. Through the high-AQI haze region in the CALIPSO and CloudSat orbit track, MODIS marked cloud close to the surface, while the MODIS true-color image and CALIOP observed an aerosol layer over the same location, suggesting MODIS falsely observed cloud there. Over the haze region in eastern China, MODIS observed 36% on average greater cloud fraction than AIRS, suggesting haze pollution induces a greater MODIS cloud amount.

AB  - In the field of remote sensing, data acquired from a single sensor usually can't meet the needs of some special applications, because the information extracted from the data are often incomplete and limited. Data fusing can solve this problem, but it will lead to the redundant information. In this paper, we proposed a novel manifold learning approach to perform dimensionality reduction for the fusing optical and SAR data. And three typical manifold learning models, namely, ISOMAP, local linear embedding (LLE) and principle component analysis (PCA), were utilized to test the robustness of our method by comparing with the land cover classification results. Our experimental results showed that our proposed method obtained the best land cover classification results among these approaches for the fusing optical and SAR data.

TI  - DGKζ ablation engenders upregulation of p53 level in the spleen upon whole-body ionizing radiation
T2  - Advances in Biological Regulation
M3  - Article
AB  - The tumor suppressor gene product p53, which coordinates the cellular response to various stresses, is subject to tight regulation by a complex network of signal transduction. The DGK family metabolizes lipidic second messenger diacylglycerol to produce phosphatidic acid. Our earlier studies showed that one isozyme, DGK zeta, is involved in the regulatory mechanism of p53. In a cellular model of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, overexpression of wild-type DGK zeta suppresses p53 protein induction and reduces apoptosis, whereas knockdown of DGK zeta upregulates p53 protein level and promotes apoptosis. Further examination reveals that DGK zeta facilitates p53 degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytoplasm. However, it remains undetermined whether the regulatory mechanism of DGK zeta on p53 function found in cell-based experiments is also functional at the animal level. This study was conducted to elucidate this point using an experiment with DGK zeta-KO mice under DNA damage induced by whole-body ionizing radiation. Our results reveal that p53 protein is induced robustly in the spleen of DGK zeta-KO mice upon exposure to ionizing radiation, thereby promoting apoptosis in this organ. Taken together, the results demonstrate that DGK zeta plays a sentinel role in p53 expression at the cellular and organismal levels after DNA damaging stress conditions.

AB  - Increased device connectivity and information sharing in wireless IoT networks increases risk of cyber attack by malicious nodes. In this paper, we present an effective and practical scheme for detecting data integrity and selective forwarding attacks launched by malicious relays in wireless IoT networks. The proposed scheme exploits the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and provides a sentinel based approach to intrusion detection. Our detection scheme assumes a general noise model for the network where different wireless links may have different packet error probability (PEP). Further, our detection scheme is effective even in scenarios where different wireless links in the network employ distinct modulation and coding schemes at the physical layer. This detection scheme has application in practical wireless IoT networks, such as those based on the recently introduced IEEE 802.11ah standard.

AB  - This work addressed the estimation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite Thermal Infrared (TIR) data, using a Generalized Split-Window (GSW) algorithm. The numerical values of the GSW coefficients were obtained using a statistical regression method from synthetic data simulated with an accurate atmospheric radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5 over a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions. The LST, mean emissivity, and atmospheric Water Vapor Content (WVC) were divided into several tractable sub-ranges to improve the fitting accuracy. The experimental results showed that the combination of two adjacent channels CH8.20 (centered at 8.20 mu m) and CH8.63 (centered at 8.63 mu m) was comparable with the combination of two adjacent channels CH10.80 (centered at 10.80 mu m) and CH11.95 (centered at 11.92 mu m) for estimating LST using the GSW algorithm, with Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) below 0.8 K, provided that the Land Surface Emissivities (LSEs) are known. Particularly, for the high emissivity surfaces under wet and hot atmospheric conditions (WVC>3.0g/cm(2)), two not adjacent channels combination of CH8.63 and CH11.95 could also be used to estimate LST with RMSEs within 0.5 K.

TI  - Application of Data Mining Technology on Surveillance Report Data of HIV/AIDS High-Risk Group in Urumqi from 2009 to 2015
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Urumqi is one of the key areas of HIV/AIDS infection in Xinjiang and in China. The AIDS epidemic is spreading from high-risk groups to the general population, and the situation is still very serious. The goal of this study was to use four data mining algorithms to establish the identification model of HIV infection and compare their predictive performance. Method. The data from the sentinel monitoring data of the three groups of high-risk groups (injecting drug users (IDU), men who have sex with men (MSM), and female sex workers (FSW)) in Urumqi from 2009 to 2015 included demographic characteristics, sex behavior, and serological detection results. Then we used age, marital status, education level, and other variables as input variables and whether to infect HIV as output variables to establish four prediction models for the three datasets. We also used confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to evaluate classification performance and analyzed the importance of predictive variables. Results. The final experimental results show that random forests algorithm obtains the best results, the diagnostic accuracy for random forests on MSM dataset is 94.4821%, 97.5136% on FSW dataset, and 94.6375% on IDU dataset. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm came out second, with 91.5258% diagnostic accuracy on MSM dataset, 96.3083% diagnostic accuracy on FSW dataset, and 90.8287% diagnostic accuracy on IDU dataset, followed by support vector machine (94.0182%, 98.0369%, and 91.3571%). The decision tree algorithm was the poorest among the four algorithms, with 79.1761% diagnostic accuracy on MSM dataset, 87.0283% diagnostic accuracy on FSW dataset, and 74.3879% accuracy on IDU. Conclusions. Data mining technology, as a new method of assisting disease screening and diagnosis, can help medical personnel to screen and diagnose AIDS rapidly from a large number of information.

AB  - This Application of maximum synthesis method (MVC), regression analysis in mathematical statistics, based on time resolution of 16 days, spatial resolution of 250m MODIS_NDVI/EVI annual, seasonal and monthly vegetation index image analysis The Time Series Evolution of Vegetation in Xi'an Region from 2010 to 2016. It is opined that: 1. The trend of NDVI/EVI changes from 2013 to 2014 in Xi'an Region has a significant drop, with the rate of decline being 2.83%/a and 3.75%/a, respectively, and then rising. The growth rate of NDVI/EVI in 2014-2016 They were 3.25%/a and 3.95%/a, respectively. 2. The average monthly NDVI/EVI trend during the year in Xi'an shows a bimodal pattern, and the trend of the different phases of the monthly phase curve is similar. It can be seen that the overall NDVI/EVI changes in Xi'an during the 7 years show obvious phenological cycle changes. 3. For the same ground cover, the sensitivity of NDVI / EVI is not the same. By fitting the NDVI / EVI of the 7-month time series image of 7 years, the equation is obtained: y = 0.0556e3.0404x, R2 = 0.9511, indicating when When NDVI > 0.6, EVI is more sensitive to vegetation changes than NDVI. 5. According to the bipartite principle, the vegetation coverage of Xi'an was calculated. The results showed that the vegetation coverage in Xi'an Region has a strong regularity in spatial distribution. The high vegetation coverage area is mainly concentrated in the Qinling area south of Xi'an, and the low vegetation coverage area. Focusing on the downtown area centered on the clock tower, the contrast between the EVI and NDVI images shows that NDVI is easily saturated in high vegetation areas, and the spectral resolution of vegetation in high vegetation areas is less than that of EVI. 5. Selecting five regions of interest for block analysis, the vegetation coverage in the inner city, the second ring, and the surrounding city shows an increasing trend, and with the narrowing of the range, the growing trend becomes more obvious. The results indicate that, in the Xi'an Region, the overall changes in both NDVI and EVI are insignificant. The big reason is the effect of regional compensation, the construction of the city is saturated, the green vegetation is no longer destroyed, and along with vegetation growth and the city Greening, vegetation coverage develops in a good direction. Because the area around the county seat of HuXian County is still in the urbanization stage, the vegetation coverage in the area has been declining over time. Since there are many ecological parks located in the ecological area, the vegetation coverage in the area has fluctuating trends. The overall remains unchanged.

AB  - In order to explore the disturbance effect of mining subsidence on the vegetation and soil moisture in mining area, using the remote sensing data of the 2007-2017 years in Shaanxi Bin Chang mining area, this paper builds the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index model by establishing the characteristic space, and the changes of vegetation and soil moisture in the mining subsidence area and no-mining affected area were monitored and analyzed. According to the subsidence range and damage degree during the 2007-2017 years in the study area, the depth of crack and the area of crack area in the mining subsidence area are determined, and the disturbance effect of soil moisture change caused by mining subsidence is discussed. The analysis shows that due to the loose surface layer caused by surface cracks, the absorption and evaporation effect of surface water is aggravated, and the soil moisture in the subsidence area is higher than that in the non-subsidence area in the low temperature season of January. In the high temperature season of July, the evaporation degree of the subsidence area is higher than that in the non-subsidence area, and the relative soil moisture is lower than that in the non-subsidence area. This fully reflects the change of surface soil environment caused by coal mining subsidence. The above research results have guiding significance for land evaluation and environmental improvement in coal mining subsidence area in Western China.

AB  - Although vessel-based acoustic sounding technique is accurate, however it is typically constrained by high operating costs, logistic difficulties and limited spatial coverage. It seems it is necessary to employ an alternative approach that can reduce the aforementioned high operation cost. The development of the imagery-derived bathymetry has brought in the new revolution in hydrography. The paper highlights the application of incorporating satellite remote sensing techniques to extract bathymetry information from the freely downloadable Landsat-8 satellite images. In this study, two different band ratio transform empirical models have been utilised to transform the reflected radiances of green and blue bands into bathymetry depths at the coastal region adjacent to Tanjung Kupang, Strait of Johor, Malaysia. The inland swampy area is vegetated by lavish mangroves while the shoreface is fronted by flat slopes with turbid suspended sediment. In the course of experiment, the results from Stumpf et al.'s model and Dierssen et al.'s model show a reasonable agreement, with similar correlation coefficient (r) of 0.76 between the imagery-derived depths and in-situ bathymetry depths from vessel-based sounding. The Stumpf et al.'s model has achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.885 metres and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.631 metres; while Dierssen et al.'s model delivers RMSE of 0.878 metres and MAE of 0.629 metres respectively. Although these two algorithms are slightly different, however the end results produced are quite close in this study. The results show that both empirical models represent a promising outcome and can be used to complement data from vessel-based single beam sounding, which is normally obtained at medium to course profiling resolution for the purpose of survey reconnaissance and survey planning.

M3  - Article
AB  - The existing approaches used to detect a tumor-induced sentinel lymph node and treat metastasis have limitations. In this study, by encapsulating perfluoropentane (PFP), magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4) and the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (PTX), we fabricated novel polymer nanoparticles (NPNs) that can effectively absorb heat after irradiation by near-infrared irradiation (NIR), thereby synergistically enhancing tumor therapy via a phase-shift thermoelastic expansion effect. These NPNs can be used for dual-modal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to treat metastasis in lymph nodes under NIR irradiation-triggered drug delivery. The enhancement of US/MR imaging proved effective in vitro and in vivo, and NIR irradiation proved valid, promoting PTX release at the target site. A lower proliferation index and density and a higher tumor cell apoptotic index in the histopathology results confirmed the effectiveness of NPN chemotherapy for lymph nodes.

TI  - The grandmaster of snow: Martial arts, particle systems and the animist cinema
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE CINEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - By looking at selected sequences from Wong Kar-wai's 2013 The Grandmaster in which characters, especially Gong Er (played by Zhang Ziyi), interact with the ubiquitous falling snow created by particle systems, this essay argues that the film's effects work visualizes the invisible flow of energy in traditions of Chinese visual culture, medicine and martial arts - all prominent or related motifs in the film's narrative. Moreover, such energy gets to be envisaged because of the very medium of the particle system, with its ideology closely related to a worldview based on animism and animation. Growing out of Wong's use of visual effects - specific to the cultural-historical context of the film - and the animist concept behind its technology, I offer a relational perspective for contemporary studies of visual effects to conceptualize the interactions between martial arts actions performed in front of the camera and digital work in the postproduction stage.

AB  - This article proposed a modified vegetation backscattering model to retrieve soil moisture using C-band RADARSAT-2 images and field measurements over agricultural study sites in Shaanxi province of China The effects of vegetation and soil on radar signals were separated at pixel level by introducing vegetation coverage in the modified model. The direct scattering contribution from the underlying ground surface was considered as an important component in the total backscattering at agricultural sites. The results indicated that the modified model could be effectively applied to a variety of surface cover types ranging from sparse to full vegetation cover. The accuracy of soil moisture retrieval was significantly high with R-2 and RMSE of 84.3% and 0.028 m(3)/m(3), respectively. Therefore, the modified model was suitable for soil moisture retrieval at large scales by combining the advantages of SAR and optical remote sensing data.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important factor that affects the changes of marine fishery resources. In this paper, the characteristics of distribution and variation in sea surface temperature was retrieved in northwestern Pacific Ocean by MODIS from 2008 to 2017. The results showed that the distribution of SST in northwestern Pacific Ocean was found to be characterized by regional and seasonal changes. Annually, periodical changes in SST was found unconspicuously, and spatially, the SST high value area showed a trend of moving from high-latitude to low-latitude. In August each year, there seemed to be a temperature boundary at 40 degrees N, and the boundary will move south in September. Finally, we analyzed the SST distribution of the two main fishing periods of Cololabis saira in August and September each year, and preliminarily explained the cause of the "fish shortage" of saury recently years in Japan. The long-term variations in SST were discussed macroscopically in this paper, and this could give a new insight into fishing industry research in the Northwest Pacific.

AB  - Solar irradiance forecasting is critical to balancing solar energy production and energy consumption in the electric grid; however, solar irradiance forecasting is dependent on meteorological conditions and, in particular, cloud cover, which are captured in satellite imagery. In this paper we present a method for short-term solar irradiance forecasting using gridded global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data estimated from satellite images. We use this data to first create a simple linear regression model with a single predictor variable. We then discuss various methods to extend and improve the model. We found that adding predictor variables and partitioning the data to create multiple models both reduced prediction errors under certain circumstances. However, both these techniques were outperformed by applying a data transformation before training the linear regression model.

AB  - A crucial challenge among remote sensing communities is the availability of open data. Several European and international programs address this aim offering a useful support to many applications. The detection of changes in ecosystems for the monitoring of biodiversity is one of the main goal for the commitments undertaken not only by the European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) but also the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This work aims to show the usefulness of free available data for the detecting of changes in (semi-) natural grasslands ecosystem for three different test site in Italy and Portugal. Due to its request for only one multispectral remote sensed image at time T2 and a land cover map at time T1, the Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) algorithm was preferred for the detection of changes from (semi-) natural grasslands to other land cover. A Sentinel-2 image as T2 and the (semi-) natural grasslands Copernicus layer as T1 were considered. The accuracy assessment of the change maps was based on stratified random sampling weighting the Overall Accuracy (OA) by the proportions of the study area represented by the map classes. The reported finding for OA% of 94.21 0.10, is encouraging and promising as a support to policy makers.

AB  - Since the contingency factor in education forces the researchers and practitioners from around the world to unite their efforts in scheming as many educational strategies as possible, it is important to outline the project of building the higher education program on art culture ideals. Art can be an insatiable resource for educational techniques on all stages of education, but in the higher education system it may be especially important in shaping the students personal and professional worldview. The investigation of possibilities to model students' world outlook in educational situations of higher school by means of realization ideal-creating mechanisms of art culture is undertaken in the research. The author of the article explores the possibilities to extrapolate art culture mechanisms on the educational field of universities. The role of visual thinking in higher education is examined. The art image is determined as an educational space and as an educational instrument. The rules of constructing an educational model are revealed based of the same principles as those that bring the art image to existence. One of main hypotheses introduced in the text is that the rules of art communication should be understood as a method to model students' world outlook.

AB  - Forests are at risk of extinction due to increased competition for land in urban areas due to expansion of cities. Forests are important as they act as heat and carbon sinks hence the need to monitor their spatial and temporal changes. We investigated the link between forest cover changes and land surface temperature dynamics in Freetown and Bo town Sierra Leone between 1998 and 2015 using Landsat data. Results showed that forests are expanding in Freetown while diminishing in Bo town. As a result, land surface temperatures warmed faster in Bo town than in Freetown where the land surface temperature moderation value of dense forest increased with time. Surface temperature increased by 4 degrees C in Bo town while it increased by less than 2 degrees C in Freetown due to differences in forest changes between the cities. The results showed that increasing tree density in forests is strong land surface temperature moderation measure. Future urban growth must consider impact of forest cover in order to ensure sustainability.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Responses of Land Surface Temperature to Long-Term Land Use/Cover Changes between a Coastal and Inland City: A Case of Freetown and Bo Town in Sierra Leone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth and its associated expansion of built-up areas are expected to continue through to the twenty second century and at a faster pace in developing countries. This has the potential to increase thermal discomfort and heat-related distress. There is thus a need to monitor growth patterns, especially in resource constrained countries such as Africa, where few studies have so far been conducted. In view of this, this study compares urban growth and temperature response patterns in Freetown and Bo town in Sierra Leone. Multispectral Landsat images obtained in 1998, 2000, 2007, and 2015 are used to quantify growth and land surface temperature responses. The contribution index (CI) is used to explain how changes per land use and land cover class (LULC) contributed to average city surface temperatures. The population size of Freetown was about eight times greater than in Bo town. Landsat data mapped urban growth patterns with a high accuracy (Overall Accuracy > 80%) for both cities. Significant changes in LULC were noted in Freetown, characterized by a 114 km(2) decrease in agriculture area, 23 km(2) increase in dense vegetation, and 77 km(2) increase in built-up area. Between 1998 and 2015, built-up area increased by 16 km(2), while dense vegetation area decreased by 14 km(2) in Bo town. Average surface temperature increased from 23.7 to 25.5 degrees C in Freetown and from 24.9 to 28.2 degrees C in Bo town during the same period. Despite the larger population size and greater built-up extent, as well as expansion rate, Freetown was 2 degrees C cooler than Bo town in all periods. The low temperatures are attributed to proximity to sea and the very large proportion of vegetation surrounding the city. Even close to the sea and abundant vegetation, the built-up area had an elevated temperature compared to the surroundings. The findings are important for formulating heat mitigation strategies for both inland and coastal cities in developing countries.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play a major role in atmospheric solar radiation budget, air quality degradation and climate change. In order to accurately evaluate aerosols effects, we require an in-depth knowledge of spatio-temporal distributions of their parameters. The focus of this paper is to analyze spatio-temporal distributions and trends of aerosol parameters over Pakistan. In present study, Terra-MODIS data have been used during April 2000-March 2014 to analyze AOD (550 nm), Angstrom exponent (470-660) (AE(470-660)), small mode fraction (SMF) and mass concentration (MC). Values of coefficient of determination (R-2) between Terra-AOD and AERONET-AOD are found to be 0.718 and 0.745 for Lahore and Karachi respectively. Terra-AOD has also been compared with other satellite-based observations obtained from Aqua, MISR and SeaWiFS. A notable spatial variability in mean annual Terra-AOD values (0.15-0.87) has been observed with high values (similar to 0.8) over northeastern and southern Pakistan. AE(470-660) ranges from 0.56 to 1.44 showing high values (greater than 0.8) over northern Pakistan and relatively low values (less than 0.8) over southern Pakistan. MC is found to be in the range from 7.6 mu g/cm(2) to 56.2 mu g/cm(2) with spatial distribution quite similar to AOD. Overall mean values of AOD, AE(470-660), SMF and MC are found to be 0.43 +/- 0.16, 0.68 +/- 0.06, 0.11 +/- 0.05 and 28.2 +/- 9.71 mu g/cm(2) respectively.

Mosaic of image segmentation band 4 TM sensor aided as comparative reference edge of the Sobradinho reservoir in relation to other images, and it was observed that the closest was the SRTM-SWBD edge of the NASA/NGA. Altimetry profiles were developed between MDE-SRTM edges, and also radiometric profiles, on the targeted band B4. It was found: low penetration of MDE-SRTM imaging in recessed edges of the reservoir, and discrepancies between the SRTM-SWBD edge (SWB) and the segmentation of the band 4. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF DROUGHT IN THE ZAYANDEHROUD BASIN DURING 2000-2015 USING NDDI AND SPI INDICES
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - For the management of Iranian water resources, especially with its dry and semi-dry conditions, identification of drought and its monitoring are two important issues. Isfahan province and the Zayandehrood river basin have experienced two periods of drought over the last decades. In the first period, which occurred between 1998 and 2001, in addition to considerable damage to different parts of the province, the Zayandehrood river in Isfahan city dried up for the first time following the construction of the Zayandehrood dam. The damage caused in that drought period was still evident when another drought period began in 2007, continuing till now. The aim of this study is the assessment of the drought in the Zayandehrood river basin using Standardized Percipitation Index (SPI) and Normalized difference drought index (NDDI) indices. For the estimation of drought damage, remote sensing technology and Landsat images of the years 2000 and 2015 were employed. To obtain Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized difference water index (NDWI), and Normalized difference drought index (NDDI) indices, Landsat spectral 3,4,5,6 bands and Idrisi Taiga software were used. For calculating SPI (standard precipitation index), historical daily precipitation records from seven hydrometric stations for 15 years from 2000 to 2015 were collected within three- and sixmonth as well as one-year intervals, and SPI was calculated by DIP software. Based on the results obtained from SPI index, the drought at Isfahan was of the near normal and moderately dry types. The investigation of NDDI index indicated an ascending trend in the drought within the 15-year period. The result of this study provides useful information for drought management plans and plays an important role in reducing the impact of drought periods.

TI  - Achievements of an eradication programme against caprine arthritis encephalitis virus in South Tyrol, Italy
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Small ruminant lentivirus infections in goats affect both production and animal welfare. This represents a threat to the qualitative and quantitative growth of goat farming, recently observed in mountainous regions such as the Autonomous Province of Bolzano - South Tyrol (Italy). To monitor and eradicate the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus in this goat population, a compulsory eradication campaign was launched, based on a strict census of small ruminants and yearly serological testing of all animals, followed by the consequent culling of seropositive individuals. The campaign succeeded in completely eliminating cases of clinical disease in goats, while drastically reducing the seroprevalence at the herd as well as individual animal level. The serological outcome of the introduced control measures was determined using commercially available ELISA kits, demonstrating their suitability for use in this type of campaign, aimed at reducing seroprevalence as well as clinical manifestations of these infections. However, this clear success is diminished by the failure to achieve a complete eradication of these viruses. The reasons leading to the observed tailing phenomenon and the occurrence of new infections in already sanitised flocks are discussed and implementation of further measures are proposed.

TI  - Bonhoeffer and the Benedict Option: The Mission of Monasticism in a Post-Christian World
T2  - ECCLESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article brings Bonhoeffer into conversation with the Benedict Option in order to analyse the inner logic of neo-monasticism. Both contend that missional faithfulness in a post-Christian context requires the church to abandon the pursuit of power, a task that lies at the heart of the neo-monastic posture. But Bonhoeffer does so while remaining alert to the great temptation of monasticism. The temptation is not merely that the church becomes sectarian. The more serious problem has to do with the way the church's separation from culture is theologically construed. This article suggests that whereas the Benedict Option is grounded in a Christ-idea, Bonhoeffer's neo-monasticism is grounded in Christ himself. The temptation, in other words, is that ideology becomes confused with Christology. Following Bonhoeffer, this article claims that confusion on this point risks embroiling the church in the very power games that neo-monasticism attempts to avoid. Whereas ideologically grounded neo-monasticism must confront the world in the mode of conflict, Christologically grounded neo-monasticism is free from the temptation of power, and from this posture authentic witness becomes possible.

TI  - Utility of fur as a biomarker for persistent organic pollutants in Australian fur seals (<i>Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus</i>)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) can cause toxic effects in many species which include endocrine dysfunction, immunotoxicity, developmental defects and neoplasia. Species dominating the upper trophic level are vulnerable to these effects due to bioaccumulation. In Bass Strait, the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) is an important top order predator and sentinel species for ecosystem health. An alopecia syndrome is seen at high prevalence in juvenile, female Australian fur seals at Lady Julia Percy Island, Victoria, Australia. Previous investigations suggest causality could be due to an endocrine-like toxicant. The alopecia syndrome has significance for thermoregulation and is a likely risk factor for mortality. Fur collected from case (alopecic) and control (unaffected) seals sampled at Lady Julia Percy Island were analysed for POPs. To investigate the utility of fur for monitoring POPs concentrations in pinnipeds, a comparison of POPs concentrations in the fur and blubber of Australian fur seals stranded along the Victorian coast was undertaken.The concentration of selected POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate/perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOS/PFOA) were determined in fur using either High Resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Results indicate detectable, and in some individuals, elevated levels of dl-PCBs, PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in juvenile fur seals sampled on Lady Julia Percy Island, with significantly higher levels of dl-PCBs in case compared to control seals. Elevated levels of dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs were found in blubber samples collected from stranded fur seals with significant correlations between blubber and fur concentrations seen, particularly for dl-PCBs. This study discusses the significance of POPs concentrations in relation to the causality of an alopecia syndrome in the Australian fur seal, and assesses the utility of fur as a non-invasive biomarker to monitor POPs exposure in this sentinel species.

AB  - In this paper, we extended our investigation on an optimal algorithm for removing the thin cloud cover from remote sensing images by using a level set based approach on an image such as on the multitemporal LANDSAT 8 OLI images. Here, we use the K-means clustering method to divide the cloud-free images into several homogeneous regions. And then, we employed the level set method to determine the cloud thickness level in each pixel in a cloudy image. After that, we reconstructed the area under the thin cloud under the assumption that the homogeneous regions from both cloud-free and cloudy images are similar. The experiments showed that the method can address this problem with the satisfying result.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Zone (BMCZ), based on spectroradiometric MODIS-AQUA chlorophyll-<i>a</i> observations
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Zone (BMCZ) is characterized by high environmental variation, which could be reflected in several optical types of water, from one containing only phytoplankton and sea water to other optically more complex. In this paper, we analyze the spatio-temporal variability of the Chlorophyll-a detected by the ocean color sensor (CHLA(sat)) in BMCZ in order to understand its environmental variability. We use the MODIS-Aqua CHLAsat monthly composites imagery from 2002 to 2015, and applied two statistical methods: the correlogram-based robust periodogram to identify, over a broad spectrum of temporal, the most significant periodicities, and the pixel gradient distribution to study the spatial-temporal gradients within the BMCZ and variations over the continental shelf and coastal waters. Our results point out to the predominance of the annual cycle over most of the investigated area, although an area from latitude 37 degrees S in direction NE, alongshore of Uruguay to Brazil, evidences interannual periodicities, possibly related to variations in the discharge of the Rio de la Plata associated with the El Nino phenomena. The ocean color spectroradiometric signature in terms of pixel gradient presents a relatively high variability (similar to 0.0 to 0.65 mg m(-3)); in particular the high values of the pixel gradient correspond to saline front of the estuarine system of Rio de la Plata, and to the strip of the platform that extends along the isobaths of 80 m (coast of Uruguay), especially in the center and south of the study area.

T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out in the teaching and research forest of the University of Dschang in Belabo, with the aim of analysing land-cover and land-use changes as well as carbon stocks dynamic. The databases used are composed of three Landsat satellite images (5TM of 1984, 7ETMthornof 2000 and 8OLI of 2016), enhanced by field missions. Satellite images were processed using ENVI and ArcGIS software. Interview, focus group discussion methods and participatory mapping were used to identify the activities carried out by the local population. An inventory design consisting of four transects was used to measure dendrometric parameters and to identify land-use types. An estimation of carbon stocks in aboveground and underground woody biomass was made using allometric models based on non-destructive method. Dynamic of land-cover showed that the average annual rate of deforestation is 0.48%. The main activities at the base of this change are agriculture, house built-up and logging. Seven types of land-use were identified; adult secondary forests (64.10%), young secondary forests (7.54%), wetlands (7.39%), fallows (3.63%), savannahs (9.59%), cocoa farms (4.28%) and mixed crop farms (3.47%). Adult secondary forests had the highest amount of carbon (250.75 t C ha(-1)). This value has decreased by more than 60% for mixed crop farms (94.67 t C ha(-1)), showing the impact of agricultural activities on both forest cover and carbon stocks. Agroforestry systems that allow conservation and introduction of woody species should be encouraged as part of a participatory management strategy of this forest.

AB  - An End-to-end simulator (E2ES) is a tool to evaluate the performance of a satellite mission. Once a mission is approved for operation, E2ES evolves during Phase C/D to become a supporting tool for the development and validation of the ground data processor, as well as for simulating data sets to test the Prototype and Operational Processors. FLEX-E is the E2ES of the FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission, which was selected in 2015 as ESA's eighth Earth Explorer. The FLEX-E evolution implies the consolidation of all the retrieval algorithms (e.g. fluorescence, reflectance, biophysical variables), the implementation of new scientific developments, as well the improvement of the co-registration process, the atmospheric correction, and the retrieval of the Level-2 products. The high-level modular design of the improved Level-2 retrieval module will permit a detailed analysis of the errors propagating through the processing chain.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data and Image Classification Algorithms in the Identification of Beach Patterns
T2  - BEACH MANAGEMENT TOOLS - CONCEPTS, METHODOLOGIES AND CASE STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Remote sensing data and image classification algorithms can be very useful in the identification of beach patterns and therefore can be used as inputs in beach classification models. In this work, one aerial photograph, one IKONOS-2 image and one FORMOSAT-2 image were applied to a part of the northwest coast of Portugal. Several image processing algorithms were employed and compared: pixel-based approach, object-based approach, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Trees (DT). The ANN and DT algorithms employed conduced to better results than the traditional classification methodologies (pixel-based, object-based and PCA), allowed a more accurate identification of rip currents. Regarding the data used, the high spatial resolution of aerial photograph allows for the better discrimination of different micro patterns. The FORMOSAT-2 image presents a lower spatial resolution, which did not allow for the identification of small microforms. Concluding, the conjugation of better spatial and spectral resolution of IKONOS-2 data and the data mining algorithms seems to be the better approach to accurately identify beach patterns through remotely sensed data.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Open and Coastal Ocean and Inland Waters
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - The Northwest Pacific region, which includes parts of northeast China, Japan, Korea and southeast Russia, is one of the most densely populated areas of the world. Eutrophication is an emerging environmental problem in this region, where a significant number of red tides and hypoxic conditions have been reported in coastal waters - possibly due to anthropogenic influences such as extensive chemical fertilizer use and sewage effluent. To assess this problem, NOWPAP CEARAC, the Special Monitoring and Coastal Environment Assessment Regional Activity Centre of the Action Plan for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Northwest Pacific Region of the United Nations Environmental Programme, has developed "Procedures for assessment of eutrophication status including the evaluation of land based sources of nutrients for the NOWPAP region" (NOWPAP Common Procedures). The NOWPAP Common Procedures include the screening procedure to detect symptoms of eutrophication with selected parameters. One of the selected parameters is remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentration (satellite Chl-a). To prepare a long-term consistent satellite Chl-a from 1998 to 2016, regression analysis was conducted by pixel to pixel using the daily composites of SeaWiFS and MODIS Remote Sensing Reflectance for overlapping period (July 2002 to December 2004). Two different empirical in-water algorithms, a NASA standard and a regionally developed one for turbid water, were applied to estimate Chl-a in the eastern and western parts of the Northwest Pacific region, respectively. The assessment of eutrophication was then conducted by the level and trend of satellite Chl-a.

TI  - THE CONCEPT <i>HAAN</i> IN THE DUTCH PHRASEOLOGICAL WORLDVIEW
T2  - SKANDINAVSKAYA FILOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the conceptual attributes of the zoonym haan 'rooster' in Dutch phraseology, using Dutch newspapers and fiction as source material. Based on the analysis, the main conceptual attributes of the zoonym "rooster" that are inherent in the Dutch phraseological worldview have been distinguished. They primarily include attributes of leadership, along with militancy, an association with masculinity and virility, and self-aggrandizement. A rooster is also connected to its morning song, seen as the exposure of injustice and crime, and is associated with ancient religious practices, including the Sun and fire cults. These attributes of the concept are divided into two groups. On the one hand, the concept of haan includes the features of an anthropocentric worldview, containing attributes that can be blended with the concept of a human. Thus the concept reflects the Dutch national specific view on a human being. On the other hand, the concept haan contains attributes which can be seen as socially important: the bird can act as a designation of a change, for example, the ending of a harvest season. Such overview of the concept haan can be useful for the more structural understanding of the concepts of animals and birds in Dutch.

TI  - Field spectroradiometer and simulated multispectral bands for discriminating invasive species from morphologically similar cohabitant plants
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the challenges in fighting plant invasions is the inefficiency of identifying their distribution using field inventory techniques. Remote sensing has the potential to alleviate this problem effectively using spectral profiling for species discrimination. However, little is known about the capability of remote sensing in discriminating between shrubby invasive plants with narrow leaf structures and other cohabitants with similar ecological niche. The aims of this study were therefore to (1) assess the classification performance of field spectroradiometer data among three bushy and shruby plants (Artemesia afra, Asparagus laricinus, and Seriphium plumosum) from the coexistent plant species largely dominated by acacia and grass species, and (2) explore the performance of simulated spectral bands of five space-borne images (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2A, SPOT 6, Pleiades 1B, and WorldView-3). Two machine-learning classifiers (boosted trees classification and support vector machines) were used to classify raw hyperspectral (n=688) and simulated multispectral wavelengths. Relatively high classification accuracies were obtained for the invasive species using the original hyperspectral bands for both classifiers (overall accuracy, OA=83-97%). The simulated data resulted in higher accuracies for Landsat 8, Sentinel 2A, and WorldView-3 compared to those computed for bands simulated to SPOT 6 and Pleiades 1B data. These findings suggest the potential of remote-sensing techniques in the discrimination of different plant species with similar morphological characteristics occupying the same niche.

AB  - The data coming from remote sensing, in particular Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR), have great potential in the study of snow since they provide information regardless of weather conditions. In this work, the capacity of the C band in wet snow detection is investigated, in the Tupungato river basin, province of Mendoza, Argentina. To this scope, Sentinel 1 images were used, processed following the methodology developed by Nagler and Rott (2000), which adopts a change detection technique by considering an image taken as a reference, in a snow-free or dry snow condition. This algorithm requires the adaptation of parameters according to the particular characteristics of the study area. The analysis carried out in this basin indicates that the optimal threshold to identify wet snow is -2dB. The results were validated indirectly by using information of surface temperature and snow cover area, obtained with LANDSAT 8 optical images. In this way, it was verified the correct classification with SAR of pixels corresponding to wet snow. Wet snow maps generated with SAR data are very useful to nourish hydrological models for the forecast of flow in mountain areas dominated by snow regime.

AB  - The existence of the value of depth variation in the study area is also a requirement in the application of this algorithm. The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of the use of algorithms in the mapping of seagrass by comparing the results of classification between imagery using the Lyzenga's algorithm with imagery without using the Lyzenga's algorithm. The result of imagery classification applying the Lyzenga's algorithm shows the visibility of baseline water objects that are more easily recognizable using Depth Invariant Index (DII) value format as evidenced by the increase of 2 classes of seagrass cover. In this study there are five seagrass cover classes of shallow water in Pajenekang Island, Spermonde-Indonesia Islands using Lyzenga's algorithm, namely class are 1) Very good: > 75%; 2) Good: 50,5-75,4%; 3) Rather Good: 25,5-50,4%; 4) Bad: 5,5-25,4%; and 5) Very Bad: <5.5%.

TI  - Testing two methods for mapping water hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) in the Greater Letaba river system, South Africa: discrimination and mapping potential of the polar-orbiting Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection and mapping of the spatio-temporal distribution of invasive water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in inland hydrological systems are vital for a number of water resource management-related reasons. Field surveys and current climate change projections (associated with longer dry spells, and shortened rain seasons) have shown that climate change and the rapid spread of aquatic invasive species are increasingly affecting inland surface water availability in semi-arid regions of Southern Africa. It is upon this premise that accurate, reliable, and timely information on the spatio-temporal distribution and configuration of water hyacinth is required in tracing their evolution and propagation in affected areas as well as in potential vulnerable areas. This work, therefore, attempts to test two robust push-broom multispectral sensors: Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) in identifying, detecting, and mapping the spatial distribution and configuration of invasive water hyacinth in a river system. The results of the study show that water hyacinth in small reservoirs can be mapped with an overall accuracy of 68.44% and 77.56% using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. The results further demonstrated the blue, red, red edge (RE) 1, short-wavelength infrared (SWIR)-1, and SWIR-2 of both satellite data sets as the critical and outstanding spectral regions in detecting and mapping water hyacinth from other land-cover types. Overall, the study highlights the unexploited prospects of the new noncommercial multispectral sensors in monitoring invasive species infestation from inland surface water-bodies in semi-arid regions (i.e. smaller reservoirs).

AB  - American citizens, businesses and communities rely on NOAA's environmental intelligence information to make decisions that impact lives and livelihoods. The foundation for all NOAA does is its ability to measure with accuracy and precision environmental parameters from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun. Collectively, these measurements, related instruments and platforms, and associated data processing, product generation, and dissemination systems comprise NOAA's observing system portfolio which constitutes approximately half of NOAA budget. NOAA observation is to produce critical information services for healthy oceans, resilient coast and robust commerce and national security.Over the last several years, the NOAA Observing Systems Council (NOSC) has developed a systematic approach for managing NOAA's observing systems portfolio. This paper will introduce the development of governance structure, principles, policies, procedures and competencies used to manage the agency's complex observation systems. This information may help scientists, technology developers, educators and others to better collaborate and/or work with NOAA in future.Division of Technology Planning and Integration for Observation (TPIO).

AB  - BackgroundEstimates of influenza-associated hospitalization are limited in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Africa.ObjectiveTo estimate the national number of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalization in Zambia.MethodsWe conducted active prospective hospital-based surveillance for SARI at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) situated in Lusaka Province during 2011-2014. Upper respiratory tract samples were tested for influenza virus using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. We estimated age-specific rates of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations for the UTH using census and secondary data on respiratory hospitalizations following estimation approaches recommended by the World Health Organization. We used the UTH hospitalization rates as a proxy for Lusaka Province. These rates were adjusted for each of the remaining 9 provinces based on their prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia and healthcare-seeking behavior. Rates were expressed per 100,000 population.ResultsSARI cases accounted for 77.1% (13389/17354) of respiratory admissions at the UTH; 82.7% (11859/14344) and 50.8% (1530/3010) among individuals aged <5 and 5years, respectively. Among SARI cases tested, the influenza virus detection rate was 5.5% (152/2734), 4.8% (48/998), and 6.0% (104/1736) among individuals aged <5 and 5years, respectively. The mean annual national number of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations was 6181 (95% CI: 4321-8041rate: 43.9; 95% CI: 30.7-57.1); 4669 (95% CI: 3287-6051rate: 187.7; 95% CI: 132.1-243.3) among children aged <5years; and 1512 (95% CI: 1037-1987rate: 13.1; 95% CI: 9.0-17.2) among individuals aged 5years.ConclusionsThe burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations was substantial and was highest among children aged <5years.

TI  - GEOINFORMATICS TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION FOR OPTIMUM FOREST AND LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION AND ABOVE GROUND BIOMASS ESTIMATION
T2  - SURANAREE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification is a prerequisite for remote sensing applications, such as thematic mapping, environment monitoring, and forest management. The main objectives of the study were (1) to classify forest and land cover using the optimum classification and regression trees (CART) model and (2) to estimate the above ground biomass (AGB) of forest types and plantations with the optimum AGB estimation model. The research methodology consisted of 3 main components: (1) data collection and preparation, (2) the optimum CART model development for forest and land cover classification, and (3) the optimum AGB estimation model development. From the results, an optimum CART model was developed using 10 independent variables consisting of blue, red, near infra- red (NIR), shortwave infra- red (SWIR)-1, SWIR-2, simple ratio (SR), normalized difference water index (NDWI), wetness, elevation, and slope. The classified forest and land cover map provided strong agreement between the classified and the ground reference information with an overall accuracy of 91.18% and a kappa hat coefficient of 89.06%. Meanwhile, for the AGB estimation models, a simple linear model of dense dry evergreen forest (DDEF) with NIR provided a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.2449 and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.94 while the exponential model of moderate dry evergreen forest (MDEF) with the forest canopy density (FCD) provided a NRMSE of 0.5097 and R-2 of 0.82. Likewise, the simple linear model of mixed deciduous forest (MDF) with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provided a NRMSE of 1.0835 and R-2 of 0.85, while the logarithm model of forest plantation (FPT) with the FCD provided a NRMSE of 0.8039 and (R-2) of 0.75. In conclusion, it can be concluded that geoinformatics technology, particularly remote sensing and GIS, can be efficiently used as tools to classify forest and land cover with a CART model and to estimate the AGB of forest type and plantation with simple linear and non-linear regression analysis.

T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - vertical bar Xam !gi:ten (shamans) accomplished much of their supernatural work by 'dreaming', in which thought played a pivotal role. According to the vertical bar Xam worldview; thought was generated by the throat arteries or 'thinking strings'. Moreover, thoughts generated by thinking strings were conceptually similar to the blood that !gi:ten used to cure illness; both were a means of 'working magic'. Thus, the healing power of blood was part of a conceptual system that imbued thinking strings with the capacity to facilitate various kinds of supernatural work. Thinking strings lived on as spirits after death. This conceptual system has interpretative implications for the long and often sinuous painted red lines that occur in the rock art of the Maloti-Drakensberg and in the Cederberg of southern Africa. These thin red lines probably represent the thinking strings of !gi:ten.

AB  - In recent years, with the improvement of the stability and mobility of optical remote sensing satellite platforms, the field of view and the width of remote sensing satellites have also increased dramatically. The wide-range and large-field-of-view remote sensing make the effect of topography fluctuations on the geometric positioning accuracy of remote sensing satellites from linear to nonlinear. It is of great significance to analyze the effect of topographic relief on the geometric accuracy of push-scan optical remote sensing satellites for improving the geometric positioning accuracy of optical remote sensing satellites. Firstly, this paper analyzes how the topographic relief affects the geometric positioning accuracy in optical remote sensing satellite geometry imaging links, through the analysis it is concluded that the image shift of satellite remote sensing image caused by topographic relief is related to the ground elevation, focal length and side-swing angle; Secondly, Using the parameters of the Worldview-2 and ZY-3 satellites to simulate and verify the image shifts of remote sensing images under different satellite focal lengths, side-swing angles and ground elevation conditions; Finally, Gaussian synthesis surface model is used to simulate different terrains (plains, hills, mountains, high mountains) to obtain satellite remote sensing simulation images, and the direct positioning method is used to get the geometric positioning deviation of remote sensing satellites caused by different terrain relief conditions.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas and spatial distribution information of paddy rice are important for managing food security, water use, and climate change. However, there are many difficulties in mapping paddy rice, especially mapping multi-season paddy rice in rainy regions, including differences in phenology, the influence of weather, and farmland fragmentation. To resolve these problems, a novel multi-season paddy rice mapping approach based on Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 data is proposed. First, Sentinel-1A data were enhanced based on the fact that the backscattering coefficient of paddy rice varies according to its growth stage. Second, cropland information was enhanced based on the fact that the NDVI of cropland in winter is lower than that in the growing season. Then, paddy rice and cropland areas were extracted using a K-Means unsupervised classifier with enhanced images. Third, to further improve the paddy rice classification accuracy, cropland information was utilized to optimize distribution of paddy rice by the fact that paddy rice must be planted in cropland. Classification accuracy was validated based on ground-data from 25 field survey quadrats measuring 600 m x 600 m. The results show that: multi-season paddy rice planting areas effectively was extracted by the method and adjusted early rice area of 1630.84 km(2), adjusted middle rice area of 556.21 km(2), and adjusted late rice area of 3138.37 km(2). The overall accuracy was 98.10%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.94.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances provide an important reference and a basis for studying the carbon cycle, biodiversity, and eco-social development. Remote sensing is a promising data source for monitoring forest ecosystem dynamics and detecting disturbance areas. This research used a seasonal trend method to model Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from 2007 to 2011 recursively with a fixed-size temporal sliding window and a step length of 1 (i.e. 16days). Model parameter variations were monitored to detect changes in the structure of the time-series data. Significant changes in the time-series structure were captured as disturbance signals. The method was applied to the 2009 Minto Flats fire in Alaska, USA, and the forest-disturbance detection results obtained using the proposed method essentially agreed with the Monitoring Trends of Burned Severity data set. This result indicates that the proposed method can reliably reveal the occurrence of forest fire disturbances. Moreover, because the model parameter variations reflect the disturbance signal, and the modelling and detection process requires only MODIS NDVI time-series data without any other ancillary ground information, the disturbance area can be detected effectively and automatically.

AB  - Beibu Gulf is the main mangrove growth district in Guangxi province of China. Tieshan Harbor in the Beibu Gulf was chosen as the study area for this research. Based on the pixel spectral reflectance angle formed by the VIS/NIR bands in the multispectral remote sensing images of HJ-1A satellite, a red band angle vegetation index (RAVI) was proposed, which would be beneficial for separating vegetation on land and water. The mangrove judging standard was formed using a combination of RAVI and pixel band reflectance standard deviation (BStdev). Based on the indices analysis and growth area generation, the mangrove extraction mode was established, which effectively captured the mangrove spatial distribution from sparse to dense coverage and in different shapes along the coastline of Beibu Gulf.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass of a mangrove plantation on the Northern coast of Vietnam using machine learning techniques with an integration of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangrove forest plays a crucial role in global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change impacts. Monitoring mangrove forests biomass accurately still remains challenging compared to other forest ecosystems. We investigated the usability of machine learning techniques for the estimation of AGB of mangrove plantation at a coastal area of Hai Phong city (Vietnam). The study employed a GIS database and support vector regression (SVR) to build and verify a model of AGB, drawing upon data from a survey in 25 sampling plots and an integration of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) dual-polarization horizontal transmitting and horizontal receiving (HH) and horizontal transmitting and vertical receiving (HV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral data. The performance of the model was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. Usability of the SVR model was assessed by comparing with four state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, i.e. radial basis function neural networks, multi-layer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The SVR model shows a satisfactory result (R-2 = 0.596, RMSE = 0.187, MAE = 0.123) and outperforms the four machine learning models. The SVR model-estimated AGB ranged between 36.22 and 230.14 Mg ha(-1) (average = 87.67 Mg ha(-1)). We conclude that an integration of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A data used with SVR model can improve the AGB accuracy estimation of mangrove plantations in tropical areas.

AB  - Introduction Now days it is noticed several occurrences about water shortage in agriculture, decreasing yield crops and profits. The irrigation system is a resource to aid the farmers to manage the system production to achieve a reasonable yield. Among several variables for a irrigation management, there are two of them with a major importance, the crop coefficient (kc) and Reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) (Gondim, Teixeira, and Barbosa 2005). In the last decades the remote sensing techniques has been used to identify landscapes, soil classes, and water energy balance as well, providing conditions to analyze data in a regional scale. By means orbital sensors and algorithms to convert digital numbers to reflectance and radiation flux, remotesensing methods to predict the evapotranspiration is a important tool to handle the hydrological cycle (Bernardo, Soares, and Mantovani 2006). The SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) uses the surface energy balance to predict some hydrological features (evapotranspiration, water deficit, etc) and Its main creator is Professor Wim G. M. Bastiaanssen (W G M Bastiaanssen et al. 1998). That method has been validated under several conditions for different locations ((W G M Bastiaanssen 2000),(Wim G. M.

There are several available algorithms to evapotranspiration prediction ((Wolff 2016), (Cavalcante et al. 2016), (Hessels et al. 2017)). However is missing a specific code to run on python 3 and GRASS 74.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)
CL  - Fortaleza, BRAZIL
AB  - This article describes how a detectability model can be trained in the form of a binary classifier from a data set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of ship wakes, augmented by automatic identification system data. While detectability models for ship signatures exist, ship wake detectability models are only available for simulated data. In order to improve existing ship wake detection algorithms on SAR imagery, there is a need for building a data-driven detectability model which may provide useful a-priori information. A binary L2-regularized logistic regression classifier is trained for each investigated data subset. The dependency on the SAR working frequency is evaluated by analysing a large number of X- and C-band images. In the X-band, the probability of detecting a wake shows dependencies on vessel size and velocity as well as prevailing wind speed. In the C-band, these dependencies are maintained, but with a general reduction in the correlation. This fact led us to the conclusion that, for our data set, ship wakes are more easily imaged in the X-band rather than in the C-band. This is an important outcome, which is supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of a large data set of TerraSAR-X and two independent C-band sensors, specifically RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1.

T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Response of a river flow in a winter low-water period to the climate changes is analyzed by the example of the Oka River (245 thousand km(2)). The analysis was done for each individual month from December to March during the period 1980-2015. The data were obtained for the hydrometric section Oka-Gorbatov. The following climatic characteristics were used for the analysis: 1) the number of days with positive air temperatures; 2) the temperature of the upper soil layer; 3) the sum of precipitation (data of meteorological station); 4) water equivalent of snow (the data from the satellite ESA GlobSnow, SWE version 2). Accuracy of the satellite data was estimated with respect to the observational data. In 1981-2010, significant increase in winter runoff occurred in December and March. This period was divided into two phases: 1) the end of the 20th century which was characterized by increasing of precipitation, the soil temperature, number of days with positive temperatures, and that resulted in the growth of the water equivalent of snow; 2) the beginning of the 21st century - by significant fluctuation in precipitation, number of days with positive temperatures as well as by a drop in the soil temperature and water equivalent of snow. The runoff volume was found to be in a direct relationship with the number of days with positive temperatures, the soil temperature, the precipitation sum, and in the inverse relationship with the water equivalent of snow. Both, the regression and dispersion analyses indicated that the above set of climatic characteristics was sufficient to explain changes in the winter runoff. According to the degree of influence on the winter runoff, these characteristics can be ranked as follows: the number of days with positive temperatures; the average soil temperature; the water equivalent of snow; the precipitation sum. The effect of the water equivalent on the runoff becomes significant from midwinter and remains the most significant factor by the end of snowmelt.

TI  - GENRE NATURE OF NARRATIVE STRATEGIES
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to applying contemporary narratological studies to the epic genres research. It discusses the main historically productive types of artistic utterances that form the sphere of literary epic. They are an epic, a novel, a story, an essay and a short story. These basic genre elements differ, primarily, in their narrative strategies. The article defines the concept of narrative strategy. The author introduces a fundamental category of "narrative worldview" that defines the nature of events in fictional world. Thus, a narrator may proceeds from the point that everything has already happened in the world and it will repeat like seasons change. However, the original event is the first one that is the precedent for subsequent similar events. There is a precedent world image, which is the basis of the heroic epic narrative strategy and the literary fictional epic. The narrative can be based on the initial assumption that life is not a cyclic repetition, but it is rather a supreme world order, that follows the justice of heaven. This is the imperative worldview, which the narrative strategy of the parable and the literary genre of the story are based on. Thus, life can be conceived as an adventurous stream of accidents, where the most incredible combinations are possible. Such is the occasional worldview, which the narrative strategy of an anecdote and a novel are based on.In order to give a more detailed description of genre strategies, this category is supplemented by concepts of the strategic "form of the character" (type of narrative character identity) and "form of authorship" (type of narrative word). Particular attention is paid to the genres of a story and an essay, little described in contemporary literary theory. Both are postnovel genre constructs. The genre strategy of artistic essays, formed in the natural school, is similar to the precedent strategy of a legend. The narrative strategy of a story, as an independent genre formed in the works of Chekhov, is based on the probabilistic worldview, formed by the complementarity of the parable imperative and the occasional anecdote.

TI  - ARIA 2016 executive summary: Integrated care pathways for predictive, preventive and personalized medicine across the life cycle
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CRITICAL CARE AND SLEEP MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative commenced during a World Health Organization (WHO) workshop in 1999. The initial goals were (i) to propose a new allergic rhinitis classification, (ii) to promote the concept of multi-morbidity in asthma and rhinitis and (iii) to develop guidelines with all stakeholders for global use in all countries and populations. ARIA - disseminated and implemented in over 70 countries globally - is now focusing on the implementation of emerging technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK (MACVIA (Contre les MAladies Chroniques pour un VLeillissement Actif)-ARIA Sentinel NetworK) uses mobile technology to develop care pathways in order to enable the management of rhinitis and asthma by a multi-disciplinary group or by patients themselves. An App (Android and iOS) is available in 20 countries and 15 languages. It uses a visual analogue scale to assess symptom control and work productivity as well as a clinical decision support system. It is associated with an inter-operable tablet for physicians and other health care professionals. The scaling up strategy uses the recommendations of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. The aim of the novel ARIA approach is to provide an active and healthy life to rhinitis sufferers, whatever their age, sex or socio-economic status, in order to reduce health and social inequalities incurred by the disease.

AB  - Only a handful of research work has been carried out to understand how microwave backscatter coefficient interacts with oil palm which limits the potential of using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging data in the remote sensing of oil palm plantation. In this study, we present results of acquired L band SAR image with respect to oil palm biophysical parameters. Oil palm biophysical parameters were first collected together on the ground with the acquisition of SAR image. We then performed unsupervised Wishart classification with Entropy Decomposition on the SAR image to have an initial understanding of the data and scattering mechanisms involved. After that, the microwave backscatters of palms are then compared with their respective plot Leaf Area Index (LAI) which is traditionally used by oil palm plantations in evaluating the health and growth of oil palm when microwave remote sensing technology is not utilized, however it was found that leaf area index was not a suitable candidate for parameter inversion due to saturation. With the aid of modelling, we then proceed in correlating backscatter coefficient with petiole cross section area which yields results with good correlation.

AB  - OBJECTIVEThe cardiovascular safety of saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor, compared with other antihyperglycemic treatments is not well understood. We prospectively examined the association between saxagliptin use and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe identified patients aged 18 years, starting from the approval date of saxagliptin in 2009 and continuing through August 2014, using data from 18 Mini-Sentinel data partners. We conducted seven sequential assessments comparing saxagliptin separately with sitagliptin, pioglitazone, second-generation sulfonylureas, and long-acting insulin, using disease risk score (DRS) stratification and propensity score (PS) matching to adjust for potential confounders. Sequential testing kept the overall chance of a false-positive signal below 0.05 (one-sided) for each pairwise comparison.RESULTSWe identified 82,264 saxagliptin users and more than 1.5 times as many users of each comparator. At the end of surveillance, the DRS-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) were 1.08 (0.90-1.28) in the comparison with sitagliptin, 1.11 (0.87-1.42) with pioglitazone, 0.79 (0.64-0.98) with sulfonylureas, and 0.57 (0.46-0.70) with long-acting insulin. The corresponding PS-matched HRs were similar. Only one interim analysis of 168 analyses met criteria for a safety signal: the PS-matched saxagliptin-pioglitazone comparison from the fifth sequential analysis, which yielded an HR of 1.63 (1.12-2.37). This association diminished in subsequent analyses.CONCLUSIONSWe did not find a higher AMI risk in saxagliptin users compared with users of other selected antihyperglycemic agents during the first 5 years after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug.

AB  - This work evaluated the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the temporal generalization of the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes in the surroundings of the Salto Grande reservoir, located in a highly urbanized region of the Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) multispectral images acquired in 2015, 2016 and 2017 were submitted to an ANN supervised classification. The ANN was trained with the image acquired in May 2015 to recognize five types of land cover (continental waters, forest, bare soil, agricultural area and urbanized area), using a learning rate of 0.1 and momentum of 0.5. As a classifier, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ANN was used and the training algorithm was the backpropagation. To estimate classifications accuracies, checkpoints were randomly selected, and the error matrix was constructed for each date. The measures used in accuracy assessment were kappa, overall accuracy and the commission and omission errors per class. The results show that the image classification of 2015, the same year as the training data, resulted in a kappa index of 0.96, while the 2016 and 2017 classifications had kappa values of 0.72 and 0.74, respectively. Therefore, the experiments carried out to LULC classification from multitemporal scenes using a single-date trained ANN indicate the ANN's generalization capability and its potential in multitemporal analyzes. In addition, the 2016 classification, however, indicates the need to add non-spectral input data, which allows separate types of coverage of the body of water and landfill to be present when similar spectral responses.

AB  - In this study, an analysis of the November 12, 2017 northwestern Iran earthquake (Mw 7.3) is presented. A multi-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) approach was adopted to retrieve the ground deformation due to the mainshock. Then, InSAR results were used as input for the source modeling of the seismic event. C-Band Sentinel-1 (IW TOPSAR acquisition mode) and L-Band ALOS-2 (Wide Swath) SAR data along both the ascending and descending orbits were processed. InSAR results show a displacement pattern in the epicentral area, with a maximum value up to similar to 1.0 meter. Preliminary analytical and numerical models suggest that the retrieved InSAR ground displacements are due to a slip dislocation (over 3.8 meters) on the causative fault and that dips to the east with a shallow angle of 16 degrees.

TI  - Straylight measurements on gratings: challenges and limitations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE OPTICS-ICSO 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO)
CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - The measurement of the bi-directional scatter distribution function (BSDF) is a well established process on reflective surfaces and largely also on transmissive optical elements. Such measurements are crucial and frequently used as input to assess the straylight performance of optical space instruments. The straylight performance of grating based spectrometers, such as used in Sentinel-5 or FLEX, is to a large extent driven by the grating itself. Thus, a BSDF characterization of gratings for such spectrometers is necessary early in the spectrometer development. However, performing such measurements on gratings turn out to be challenging for a number of reasons that will be presented and addressed in this paper.In this paper we address some of the challenges experienced when measuring BSDF at different wavelengths from UV up to SWIR for several type of gratings. Scatterometers are usually designed to measure the BSDF of a single flat optical surface. The particular form or construction of such gratings, for example transmissive gratings with at least two optical interfaces or gratings with optical power, requires a reconfiguration of the classical measurement set-up to minimise the errors in the BSDF characterization. Additionally, there is a difficulty of measuring the near-specular scatter of those components due to the inherent optical aberrations and potentially their curvature. The dispersive property of gratings imposes the use of a very stable and spectrally pure light source for the measurement. We suggest some strategies and configurations to mitigate the above-mentioned difficulties.Some BSDF measurements on curved and immersed gratings are presented in this paper for illustration.

TI  - Multi-track extraction of two-dimensional surface velocity by the combined use of differential and multiple-aperture InSAR in the Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and ice streams drain the ice from the ice sheets to the ice shelves, and contribute to global sea-level changes. Therefore, ice velocity is an essential parameter for the assessment of mass balance. In this paper, we propose an approach for the multi-track extraction of two-dimensional ice surface velocity by the combined use of multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). The azimuth and ground range ice movements of each individual track are first estimated by the use of MAI and DInSAR, respectively. A seamless two-dimensional ice velocity map is then achieved by calibration andmosaicking of the estimated velocity of the multi-temporal and multi-track measurements over a large area. Finally, the dynamic behavior of the Amery Ice Shelf is analyzed by formulating a long-term series of ice flow velocities consisting of historical surface velocities (1968-1990), the estimated surface velocity by the proposed method with ERS-1/2 data (1996), existing surface velocity products such as the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) velocities (1997-2000) and Rignot's results (2007-2010), as well as the estimated velocities obtained by the use of the offset tracking method from Landsat 8 images (2013-2014). The results show that the estimated velocity obtained by the use of the proposed method is superior to the other methods, and the long-term series of ice velocity measurements shows that the ice velocity in the Amery Ice Shelf has hardly changed over the past 45 years (1968-2014). We conclude that the ice flow velocity of the Amery Ice Shelf has showed a slight deceleration over the past 45 years.

AB  - Many significant applications need land cover information of remote sensing images that are acquired from different areas and times, such as change detection and disaster monitoring. However, it is difficult to find a generic land cover classification scheme for different remote sensing images due to the spectral shift caused by diverse acquisition condition. In this paper, we develop a novel land cover classification method that can deal with large-scale data captured from widely distributed areas and different times. Additionally, we establish a large-scale land cover classification dataset consisting of 150 Gaofen-2 imageries as data support for model training and performance evaluation. Our experiments achieve outstanding classification accuracy compared with traditional methods.

AB  - Grassland NPP is an important component of the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems, which can directly measure the carrying capacity of grassland ecosystem. Considering the disadvantages of the existing NPP estimated models, this study adopt BP neural network model to estimate the NPP for XilinGol grassland based on the meteorological, field sample, DEM and remote sensing data. Our results showed that: (1) The trained BPNN not only has excellent performance for estimating NPP for the trained dataset, but also has good generation and portability, which can be applied for other pixels; (2) The spatial pattern of the grassland NPP has obviously horizontal zonal regularity, which rises from 0 to >300gC/m2 from west to east.

TI  - Pre-operative Axillary Ultrasound-Guided Needle Sampling in Breast Cancer: Comparing the Sensitivity of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology and Core Needle Biopsy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-operative ultrasound-guided needle sampling (UNS) of abnormal axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer can identify patients with axillary metastases and therefore rationalize patient care and inform decision-making. To obtain tissue diagnosis, UNS can be performed by either fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB). However, few studies have compared the sensitivity of these techniques and the majority show no difference.All node-positive patients (those with micro- and macrometastases but not isolated tumor cells) treated at a tertiary referral center between January 2012 and December 2015 were retrospectively identified from pathology records. The result of the first axillary UNS performed on each patient was compared with postoperative histopathology results. The UNS method used was according to individual radiologist preference.A total of 215 patients underwent FNA (1 patient had bilateral breast cancer and underwent bilateral FNA), and 92 underwent CNB. Sensitivity of CNB was significantly higher than FNA (83.7 vs. 69.0%, P = 0.008). The false-negative rate in the FNA group was therefore higher than in the CNB group by a factor of 2.5. There was no difference in inadequacy rate between the two techniques. There were no complications in the FNA group, and only one hematoma (which did not require operative intervention) in the CNB group.CNB is safe and should be the preferred technique for UNS to improve sensitivity.

TI  - Assessing Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms as Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
T2  - NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Reoccurring seasonal cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) persist in many waters, and recent work has shown links between CHAB and elevated risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Quantifying the exposure levels of CHAB as a potential risk factor for ALS is complicated by human mobility, potential pathways, and data availability. In this work, we develop phycocyanin concentration (i.e., CHAB exposure) maps using satellite remote sensing across northern New England to assess relationships with ALS cases using a spatial epidemiological approach. Strategic semi-analytical regression models integrated Landsat and in situ observations to map phycocyanin concentration (PC) for all lakes greater than 8 ha (n = 4117) across the region. Then, systematic versions of a Bayesian Poisson Log-linear model were fit to assess the mapped PC as a risk factor for ALS while accounting for model uncertainty and modifiable area unit problems. The satellite remote sensing of PC had strong overall ability to map conditions (adj. R2, 0.86; RMSE, 11.92) and spatial variability across the region. PC tended to be positively associated with ALS risk with the level of significance depending on fixed model components. Meta-analysis shows that when average PC exposure is 100 mu g/L, an all model average odds ratio is 1.48, meaning there is about a 48% increase in average ALS risk. This research generated the first regionally comprehensive map of PC for thousands of lakes and integrated robust spatial uncertainty. The outcomes support the hypothesis that cyanotoxins increase the risk of ALS, which helps our understanding of the etiology of ALS.

AB  - Over the last two decades, Worldview Approach has been mentioned in the field of religious education and spirituality. This article aims to determine the effects of creative drama on teaching worldviews and religions. The main purpose of Worldview Education is to assist individuals to have a broader and deeper understanding on self-identity, worldviews of others, and on the meaning and purpose of life. It also helps individuals to think on ontological, epistemological and ultimate questions about life, values and beliefs. The spiritual development of individuals has a need for several guidelines from the fields of philosophy, theology, and education. As an educational tool, creative drama increases imagination, creativity, problem-solving and critical thinking skills and assists students' personal and emotional development. Combining Worldview Education with creative drama creates a multidimensional educational environment for a meaningful learning on religions, worldviews, and spirituality.

AB  - The continuity of the SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V time series is important for a wide range of users. In order to assess the possible extension of the SPOT/VGT - PROBA-V data with Sentinel-3, the consistency between PROBA-V and Sentinel-3 Synergy products is evaluated. This analysis is based on intermediate Sentinel-3 Level 2 synergy products, made available to expert users in 2017. Preliminary consistency checks on S3A_SY_2_VGP and PROBA-V Level 2A shows a relatively good consistency for Blue, Red and NIR, but bad consistency for SWIR, with systematic differences up to 17%, depending on the segment.

AB  - ALOS-2-PALSAR is equipped with an experimental Compact mode (CP), which can collect CP images at various incidence angles. PALSAR2-CP transmits a circular polarization and measures the received signal at the horizontal and vertical antenna polarization. Recently, it was brought out that the actual SAR technology does not permit the generation of a perfectly circular polarization and this may significantly affect CP information [1]. Since all the calibration methods assume that the transmitted polarization is perfectly circular, there is an immediate need for a new CP calibration model that is more suitable to actual CP SARs. In this study, a new CP calibration model that takes into account the non circularity of transmitted polarization, in addition to conventional SAR transmitter and receiver distortion matrices, is introduced. The CP calibration model is used as the basis for the development of an efficient method that permits the measurement of transmitted polarization axis ratio, and its variations with incidence angle. The method is validated using PALSAR2-CP data collected at various incidence angles on the Amazonian forests. It is shown that the transmitted polarization axis ratio varies with PALSAR2-CP beam, and can reach up to 1.1 dB for the CP mode (H2-8) (at about 37. incidence angle).

AB  - The complementarity of the "scattered" and " received" wave polarization signatures is demonstrated for enhanced characterization of peatlands and surrounding upland forest scattering. Polarimetric L-band ALOS-PALSAR collected in the Athabasca oil sand exploration region, with peatlands and upland forests partially affected by multiple wildfire, are used. It is shown that the scattered wave polarization signature [1], which represents the explicit variations of the degree of polarization (DoP) and the total scattered intensity R0 with transmitted polarization, permits enhanced discrimination of treed bogs from upland forests, and improved identification of fire damages in peatlands and surrounding forests. The technique introduced in [2] for scattered wave optimization is used as a convenient method for efficient exploitation of the scattered wave polarization signature. The Touzi decomposition [3] is adopted for the optimization of the received wave polarization signature. The unique potential of the scattering type phase generated with the Touzi decomposition is confirmed for enhanced discrimination of poor fens from bogs. These two important pealand classes cannot be separated with the scattered wave optimization, the conventional multi-polarization (HH-HV-VV) channels, the Freeman and Cloude-Pottier decompositions [4], [5]. Finally, the Touzi decomposition is combined with the extrema of the scattered wave main parameters (DoP and R0) for optimum extraction of polarimetric PALSAR information. The comparison with optical Landsat-TM confirms the valuable added information that long penetrating polarimetric L-band PALSAR can provide for enhanced peatland classification and efficient assessment of peat health in burned peatlands.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sosnowsky's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden.) is one of the most dangerous invasive plant species, common in the European part of Russia and some European countries. Its spread threatens the biological diversity of natural ecosystems. The danger of H. sosnowskyi for the human health lies in its ability to cause skin burns. Large populations of H. sosnowskyi can be found in uncultivated fields, meadows, on the banks and in the vicinity of watercourses and reservoirs, on the outskirts of forests, and along roads. Currently in Russia, in connection with the massive spread of H. sosnowskyi, the question is raised about the need to create a special federal target program to control this dangerous species. The data of the Earth remote sensing can provide essential assistance in planning the measures to control the spread of H. sosnowskyi. Satellite imagery provide information about localization and areas of plant communities in large areas. To monitor the distribution of H. sosnowskyi, it is possible to use multispectral as well as monochrome satellite images of high and medium resolution. In our study we used images from the Sentinel-2 satellite with a resolution of 10 m. The detection of the foci was carried out on the territory of certain districts of the Kirov region of Russian Federation. The populations of Sosnowsky's hogweed are well recognized visually on synthesized color images using either three channels of the visible range (blue, green, red), or two visible (blue and green) and near infrared channel. Both variants give very close results, providing reliable identification of thickets of the hogweed.

TI  - EFFECT OF LAND-USE CHANGES RESULTING FROM SHRIMP FARMING ON ACID SULFATE SOILS IN THE CAN GIO COASTAL WETLAND AREA (VIETNAM)
T2  - Polish Journal of Soil Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Acid sulfate soils in coastal wetland areas arc particularly vulnerable to land-use changes. We identified the potential impacts of land-use changes in the Can Gio coastal wetland area in Vietnam due to the reclamation of acid sulfate soils from shrimp farms. Our study applied the support of vector machine algorithm in ENVI software to observe land-use changes from 1995 to 2015, using Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager data. We classified the land use of the study area into four major classes including vegetation, bare land, dedicated land and aquaculture land. Our study successfully met the overall classification accuracy requirement above 95% and kappa statistics above 0.95. Between 1995 and 2006, about 2,938.05 ha of bare land and 1,464.66 ha of vegetation (mangrove forest) were converted to aquaculture land. In contrast, between 2006 and 2015, 2,423.88 ha of aquaculture land converted back to bare land, mainly related to the abandonment of shrimp ponds due to crop failure and disease. The disturbance of acid sulfate soils through initial soil reclamation and subsequent fallowing is considered a key reason for hastening and extending soil acidification in the study area. We collected 144 topsoil samples from 17 fallowed ponds in two batches, and 142 of these were acidic: 128 samples were extremely and strongly acidic (pH < 5.5), 14 samples were moderately and slightly acid (pH between 5.5 and 6.5), and only two samples were neutral (pH over 6.5).

AB  - This article presents a cloud-free snow cover dataset with a daily temporal resolution and 0.05° spatial resolution from March 2000 to February 2017 over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The dataset was developed by completely removing clouds from the original NASAs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow Cover Area product (MOD10C1) through a series of spatiotemporal filters followed by the Variational Interpolation (VI) algorithm; the filters and VI algorithm were evaluated using bootstrapping test. The dataset was validated over the period with the Landsat 7 ETM+ snow cover maps in the Seattle, Minneapolis, Rocky Mountains, and Sierra Nevada regions. The resulting cloud-free snow cover captured accurately dynamic changes of snow throughout the period in terms of Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR) with average values of 0.955 and 0.179 for POD and FAR, respectively. The dataset provides continuous inputs of snow cover area for hydrologic studies for almost two decades. The VI algorithm can be applied in other regions given that a proper validation can be performed. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - The Control of Typhoid Fever in Vietnam
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is a diminishing public health problem in Vietnam, and this process may represent a prototype for typhoid elimination in Asia. Here, we review typhoid epidemiology in Vietnam over 20 years and assess the potential drivers associated with typhoid reduction. In the 1990s, multidrug resistant S. Typhi were highly prevalent in a sentinel hospital in southern Vietnam. A national typhoid incidence rate of 14.7/100,000 population per year was estimated around the new millennium. The Vietnamese government recognized the public health issue of typhoid in the 1990s and initiated vaccine campaigns to protect the most vulnerable members of the population. At their peak, these campaigns immunized approximately 1,200,000 children in 35 provinces. Concurrently, Vietnam experienced unprecedented economic development from 1998 to 2014, with the gross national income per capita increasing from $360 to $1,890 over this period. More recent typhoid incidence data are not available, but surveillance suggests that the current disease burden is negligible. This trajectory can be considered a major public health success. However, a paucity of systematic data makes it difficult to disaggregate the roles of immunization and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in typhoid reduction in Vietnam. Given the limitations of typhoid vaccines, we surmise the practical elimination of typhoid was largely driven by economic development and improvement in general population living standards. Better designed WASH intervention studies with clinical endpoints and systematic incidence data are essential to glean a greater understanding of contextual factors that impact typhoid incidence reduction.

AB  - This paper presents the impact of machine learning in precision agriculture. State-of-the-art image recognition is applied to a dataset composed of high precision aerial pictures of vineyards. The study presents a comparison of an innovative machine learning methodology compared to a baseline used classically on vineyard and agricultural objects. The baseline uses color analysis and can discriminate interesting objects with an accuracy of (89:6%). The machine learning, an innovative approach for this type of use case, demonstrates that the results can be improved to obtain 94:27% of accuracy. Machine Learning used to enrich and improve the detection of precise agricultural objects is also discussed in this study and opens new perspectives for the future of high precision agriculture.

TI  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast, 20 years of experience in a single center with review of literature
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast is a rare type of breast cancer, which presents inconsistencies in the optimal management strategy.A retrospective review of prospectively collected data, spanning the last 20 years, was performed using the cancer registry database at our institution.Six patients were diagnosed with ACC of the breast, out of 5,813 total patients diagnosed with breast cancer (0.1%). Our identified patients had a median age of 66, all with the early stage cancer (Stage I/II). The average size of the breast lesion was 1.62 cm, and nodal status was negative for all cases. All patients had resection as primary therapy (partial or total mastectomy), with one patient also undergoing external beam radiation and tamoxifen hormonal therapy. Median follow-up was 85 months, with all patients being disease-free at last follow-up.ACC of the breast has an indolent course, despite triple negative status. Our study suggests that radiation may not be warranted and confirms the rarity of axillary node metastases, indicating that sentinel node excision may also not be necessary. Ultimately, the hope is that our findings along with the reviewed literature will aid in determining the most appropriate options for management of ACC of the breast.

TI  - Parasitoid guild and parasitism rate of the obliquebanded leafroller in IPM orchards and adjacent woodlands
T2  - PHYTOPROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The obliquebanded leafroller (OBLR), Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) [Lepidoptera: Tortricidae], a primary pest in Quebec apple orchards, can be naturally parasitized. Knowing that habitats around crop's peripheries are reservoirs for natural enemies of pests, the objective of the present investigation was to assess parasitism and parasitoid guild composition associated with the OBLR. The two-year study included orchards under integrated pest management, their edges, and adjacent woodlands. Parasitism was assessed using sentinel OBLR larvae and considered spring, early summer and late summer. Parasitism rates between regions with different vegetation composition were not significantly different. The first year, late summer larvae showed higher parasitism in orchards (27%), compared to edges (7%) and woodlands (11%). The following year, larvae exposed in early summer had higher parasitism rate in edges (28%) compared to orchards and woodlands (17% in both zones). Nineteen parasitoid species parasitized sentinel larvae. The tachinid Actia interrupta (Curran), the most abundant species, represented 28 and 62% of species the first and the second year respectively. Our research demonstrates that natural biological regulation of the OBLR is the result of a highly diversified parasitoid guild and this should be taken into account in any Integrated Pest Management program.

AB  - ABSTRACT The objective of this work was to analyze and compare spectral indexes in eucalyptus plantations and correlate them with precipitation data for the period from 2003 to 2012, in order to assess whether climate change has an influence on vegetation phenology. The methodology entailed obtaining the mean spectral indexes (NDVI, EVI and GPP) of MODIS images and elaborating the temporal profiles of the eucalyptus vegetation, for both cloned seedlings and those grown from seeds. These profiles were correlated with TRMM precipitation data. The results showed NDVI values higher than the EVI, although a clearly de fined seasonality was not present, whereas the GPP demonstrated a well-defined seasonal behavior in all of the years. The correlation between the spectral indices and the precipitation had representative results for some years, including El Nino and La Nina periods. It was concluded that MODIS products allow the evaluation of phenological cycles in eucalyptus plantations, principally for the planting and cutting phases. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Multi-sensor forest vegetation height mapping methods for Tanzania
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new method for mapping of forest cover in Tanzania, in the form of yearly estimates of average vegetation height from time-series of Landsat and ALOS PALSAR satellite images. By using airborne laser scanning data and Landsat-8 data from 2014, a regression between average vegetation height and the specific leaf area vegetation index is established. By using all available Landsat acquisitions of the same area within 1 year, and producing a yearly estimate of vegetation height, the estimation error variance is reduced. The variance is further reduced by Kalman filtering the sequence of yearly estimates. A multi sensor version of the method comprises application of the radar backscatter when L-band SAR data is available. To conclude, we have demonstrated that estimation of mean vegetation height is possible from dense time series of optical and SAR satellite data. Change detection was able to detect areas with total loss of biomass.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture RADAR Remote Sensing technique has widely used in mapping and monitoring of cultural and natural heritage sites. In today's scenario, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) is being used to measure the elevation and displacement of man-made and natural features. This study was focused on phase filtering to detect displacement in cultural heritage site using space borne repeat pass SAR Interferometry. Rohtasgarh fort, was chosen as study site and Sentinel -1, C-Band interferometric pairs of March and April 2017 were used. Interferometric processing for interferogram generation, coherence and phase unwrapping was performed to generate a displacement map. It was however noticed that phase noise greatly affects and deteriorates the quality of interferogram which in turn affects the phase unwrapping and geophysical measurements such as displacement mapping. In this work, Modified Goldstein filter was used for phase noise suppression and preserving the fringe edges. Using a threshold of 0.3 for coherence, displacement map was generated, and Modified Goldstein Filtering was applied on it. Most of the areas in and around the fort showed no displacement but there was an upliftment seen at few places inside the fort with maximum value of 10mm. Subsidence with maximum value of 10mm was also seen in areas outside the fort. Upliftment could have been due to water accumulation inside the fort or dust storm while subsidence could be possible due to lose debris washed off by rain water.

AB  - Urban areas due to their dynamic nature often pose serious threats to environment causing overutilization of resources like ground water. The depleting ground water table often causes land subsidence leading to cracks in buildings. This subsidence can be easily mapped using PSInSAR (Persistent Interferometric Synthetic Aperture RADAR). In urban areas, there are many buildings per square kilometer which give permanent scatter and act as good corner reflectors at boundaries right angle to ground and walls. Rudrapur city, which is the headquarters, of Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand state in India, is also a major industrial hub and attracts skilled and unskilled labour force from the adjoining areas and this is leading to an unprecedented growth of urban sprawl. The city shows sprawling dense urban settlements and huge industrial setups on the outskirts, surrounded by agricultural fields and orchards. Main source of water supply is through bore wells and tube wells. Here, it was found that over the years, ground water has been harnessed for not only household supplies but also for agriculture and industrial purposes which has led to lowering of water table down from around 33.5 m to 45.7 m. This is leading to cracks developing in buildings particularly around the industrial area. The changes over a period of a year from 4th December 2014 till 2nd December 2015, were mapped using PSInSAR technique, with X-band TerraSAR-X datasets.

AB  - The Earth's surface is live and dynamic due to natural and manmade events. Tracking and visualizing Earth-features (e.g. water, snow, and vegetation) is an important problem. Earth observation satellite imagery like Landsat 8 makes the tracking feasible by providing detailed multispectral imagery at regular intervals. In this paper, we explore a single image summary approach to detecting changes in Earth-features by using the Landsat 8 dataset. In our system, we use appropriate thresholds for spectral indices to identify features, reference datasets, and combine multiple images using predefined color palettes to generate a single image summary of features for a region. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefit of our method over traditional visualizations with case-studies for the Lake Urmia, the Amazon Rainforest, and the Bering Glacier.

AB  - Proper groundwater recharging may drastically change the scenario of groundwater availability of the area. It needs appropriate groundwater recharge locations, which can be prepared by using satellite data and GIS. Eight blocks of five districts including Bemetara in Chhattisgarh are reported to be semi-critical. Average groundwater development of Bemetara district is reported to be 63.24%. Looking to the need of groundwater recharge plan for Bemetara district a study on groundwater recharge planning was carried out in the Department of Soil and Water Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering, IGKV, Raipur. Accordingly, thematic maps were superimposed to identify the appropriate locations for artificial groundwater recharge structures. Various thematic maps including district and block boundaries, drainage, slope, soil texture, lineaments, geology and water level depth were generated in the environment of GIS. A satellite image, IRS P6 LISS IV, was classified using supervised classification method to generated land use map of the area. Different structures and their sizes were decided on the basis of topography and drainage pattern. The upper, middle and lower reaches of drainage lines were considered for different sizes of check dam. The site for percolation tank was identified for groundwater recharge. The field survey of study areas was also carried out to find out the suitability of proposed artificial groundwater recharge structures. It is concluded that suitable sites for artificial recharge structures in these districts were found to be 68%. Finally, 130 locations for check dam and 59 locations for percolation tank in Bemetara district were identified. The subsurface storage space was estimated on the basis of thickness of available vadose zone. The vadose zone of 285 Mm(3) is available for artificial recharge in the Bemetara district. The volume of water required for artificial recharge was found to be 379 Mm(3) for this district. It was found that sufficient volume of water required for artificial recharge is available. Availability of source water to recharge the subsurface reservoir were found to be 1099 Mm(3) in the form of non-committed surplus run-off out of which 30% (329.67 Mm(3)) is considered as surplus monsoon run-off which is available for artificial recharge.

AB  - The development of snow and ice probability maps at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) from the MODIS and VIIRS sensors is described. Time series are generated for each warm season (April-September) since 2000 at 250m spatial resolution over the Northern latitudes that cover Canada and neighboring regions. These data are valuable for characterization of fresh water resources, such as snow and land ice, which are very sensitive to climate variations. Comparison of CCRS data against several land cover schemes revealed large discrepancies in the permanent snow/ice extent that can reach nearly 200% over the Canadian Arctic region. CCRS results are very consistent with the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) and can be used for the RGI validation and updates. Data are publicly available from the Canadian Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP) data archive.

AB  - The approach, sensitivity analysis and evaluation results are presented in this study for application of MODIS 250-m imagery to assess the VIIRS/S-NPP image geolocation accuracy at subpixel level. The method employed is based on 4th degree polynomial fitting of the correlation matrix between VIIRS and MODIS reference images in the swath (pixel-line) projection. Sensitivity analysis has shown that the uncertainty from this method is better that +/- 0.04 of the VIIRS I-band pixel size. Analysis of geolocation accuracy conducted over the 2017 period at semi-monthly intervals has shown that the average geolocation bias for VIIRS/S-NPP band I2 was 0.055 (0.003) along (across) the scan directions. Corresponding numbers are 0.028 (-0.003) for band M7.

AB  - This study analyzed the mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) over the Indonesian Maritime Continent (IMC) during the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events for the the15-year period from 2001 to 2015. The MCCs identified by infrared satellite imagery that obtained from the Himawari generation satellite data. This study has reported that the frequencies of the MCC occurrences at the El Nino and La Nina were higher than that of neutral conditions during DJF. Peak of MCC occurrences during DJF at La Nina and neutral condition is in February, while El Nino is in January. ENSO strongly affects the occurrence of MCC during the DJF season. The existences of the MCC were also accompanied by increased rainfall intensity at the locations of the MCC occurrences for all ENSO events. During JJA seasons, the MCC occurrences are always found during neutral conditions, El Nino and La Nina in Indian Ocean. MCC occurring during the JJA season on El Nino and neutral conditions averaged much longer than during the DJF season. In contrast, MCCs occurring in La Nina conditions during the JJA season are more rapidly extinct than during the DJF. It indicates that the influence of MCC during La Nina during the DJF season is stronger than during the JJA season.

AB  - This study explains the comparison of mesoscale convective complexes (MCC) characteristics in the oceans, land and in the coast over Indonesian maritime continent (IMC). MCCs were identified and tracked during 15-years (2001-2015) over IMC by infrared satellite imagery using an algorithm that combines criteria of cloud coverage, eccentricity, and cloud lifetime. Infrared satellite imagery was obtained from Himawari generation satellite data. This study showed most of the continental MCC found near the mountains and the high elevation areas. The frequency of MCC occurrences was larger over the land than over the ocean. The oceanic MCCs, which lasted for more than 12 hours, were longer-lived than the continental MCCs. The MCCs with small size most frequently occurred in the continent, in contrast, the MCC with the medium and large size were most concentrated over the ocean. Generally, the continental and coastal MCC initiation occurs in the late afternoon and reach maximum size around midnight before decaying the next morning. In contrast, the oceanic MCC dominantly develops in midnight, and reach maximum size in the morning and then MCC decayed and dissipated from noon until afternoon. The evolution of MCC development in the ocean, land, and in the coast has almost the same stages and ways.

TI  - An optimized electroporation approach for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in murine zygotes
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.

AB  - According to the safety requirements, all protective devices of tractor units are subject to obligatory certification. One of the main means of protecting the operator during overturning is ROPS system. In accordance with GOST (National State Standard), a performance check of ROPS protective structures is carried out on basis of full-scale tests. The purpose of the presented study is to develop the experimental procedure and to obtain the performance check result of ROPS protective device of the tractor unit's cabin using B10 bulldozer manufactured by the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant as an example. The tests were carried out at the Ural Test Center NATI. For this purpose, a special bedplate was used, allowing to test the protective cabins of tractors with the total mass of up to 110 tons. The hydraulic system of the bedplate allowed to carry out the process of lateral loading of ROPS step by step, where each step corresponded to the 10 mm structure deformation. The applied load and structure deformation were recorded at each step. The energy accumulated by the structure was calculated as the area under the stress-strain curve. The energy U = 40867 J, which was required according to GOST, was accumulated during lateral deformation square = 270 mm. The force constituted Fy = 243 kN. After removing the lateral load, the structure was subjected to the vertical static and longitudinal loading. During the whole experiment of ROPS protective device, repairs, deformation corrections and adjustments were not allowed. The test results of ROPS structure of B10 bulldozer cabin showed compliance with the GOST safety requirements. During ROPS deformation, penetration of the protective structure elements into the driver's limited zone was not observed.

AB  - Oceanographic investigations have significantly benefited from multispectral satellite products that simplify monitoring in coastal regions thanks to their high spatial-temporal resolution. The surface Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is an important water quality parameter which can be derived from empirical or analytical algorithms by using the atmospherically-corrected remotely sensed reflectance R (2.) retrieved from satellite imagery. In this study, in situ SPM and R (2.) data were collected in the Gulf of Alexandroupolis, Northeastern Aegean Sea in Greece (Eastern Mediterranean Sea) during low discharge period (June 2016). We attempt to compute remotely sensed reflectance from Landsat OLI8 imagery, in order to quantify surface SPM concentrations via both a Semi-Analytical and a Multi-Band Empirical Algorithm. When comparing the satellite estimations against the field measurements, both algorithm approaches provide a non absolute correlation with in situ R (-20-30 % offset). As a result, a generic semi-analytical equation for Alexandroupolis Gulf is developed, following algorithm calibration in low turbidity waters. The proposed algorithm can be then equally implemented to the new Sentinel-2A sensor, in order to assess its variations against Landsat 8 and to determine the applicability extend of our approach.

TI  - Spatial distribution, abundance and habitat use of the endemic Mediterranean fan mussel <i>Pinna nobilis</i> in Gera Gulf, Lesvos (Greece): comparison of design-based and model-based approaches
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An important population of the endemic Mediterranean fan mussel Pinna nobilis thrives in the marine protected area of Gera Gulf (Lesvos island, north-eastern Aegean Sea, Greece), and was assessed for the first time. To estimate the abundance, spatial distribution and habitat use of fan mussels in Gera Gulf, a distance sampling underwater survey was conducted. Detectability was modelled to secure unbiased estimates of population density. Two approaches were applied to analyze survey data, a design-based and a model-based approach using generalized additive models. The first approach was based on stratified random sampling on two strata, an assumed 'preferable' zone close to the coastline and an assumed unsuitable habitat, with predominantly muddy sediments. in which low sampling effort was applied. For the needs of the model-based approach, a dedicated cruise was conducted to collect bathymetric data with a single-beam echo-sounder and map the bathymetry of the study area. A very high-resolution image from the Worldview-3 satellite was processed, based on an object-based image analysis, for mapping all main habitat types in the study area. The estimated abundance using the design-based approach was low-biased as the stratum of pre-assumed unsuitable habitat proved to include patches of suitable habitats with high population densities that were missed by sampling. The model-based approach provided an abundance estimate of 213300 individuals (95% confidence interval between 97600-466000 individuals), which renders the fan mussel population of Gera Gulf the largest recorded population in Greece. Population density peaked between 1.5-8 m depth and became practically zero at depths >15 m. A bathymetric segregation of fan mussel size classes was noted, with the density of small individuals peaking in shallow waters, while that of large individuals peaked deeper. The highest population densities were observed in Posidonia oceanica meadows, followed by mixed bottoms (with reefs, rocks and sandy patches), while densities were very low on sandy and zero on muddy sediments. The current assessment provides a baseline for future monitoring of the fan mussel population in Gera Gulf. In view of the current (2017-2018) ongoing mass mortality of the species in the western Mediterranean, continuous monitoring of the main fan mussel populations, such as the one in Gera Gulf, is of utmost importance.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire events are an annual phenomenon in Greece with damages and even casualties, making their understanding and management important. In this paper, we present fire events provided by NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System and place them along a number of spatial types defined by relief and land cover classes. Results demonstrate that the occurrence of fire events is related more to some land cover classes than others. The most important in terms of overall frequency in all types of terrain is Agricultural Areas', as a result of farming practices that involve fire. The second more important type of areas is Artificial Surfaces', especially in low lying areas. These events are related to urban growth and sprawl and are very often a direct outcome of speculation practices with land properties, encouraged by the absence or poor implementation of spatial planning.

TI  - Evidence of the impact of monovalent rotavirus vaccine on childhood acute gastroenteritis hospitalization in Togo.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) was introduced in the immunization schedule of Togo in June 2014. We evaluated the impact of rotavirus vaccines on acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and rotavirus-associated hospitalizations in Togolese children.METHODS: Sentinel surveillance for AGE (defined as ≥3 liquid or semi-liquid stools/24 h lasting <7 days) hospitalizations among children <5 years of age was conducted in two sites in the capital city, Lome. ELISA was used for diagnosis of rotavirus infection in children with AGE. Additionally, review of hospitalization registers was performed at five hospitals to assess trends in AGE hospitalizations among children aged <5 years. For the vaccine impact assessment, pre-rotavirus vaccine introduction (July 2010-June 2014) and post-rotavirus vaccine introduction (July 2014-June 2016) periods were compared for annual changes in proportions of hospitalizations associated with AGE and rotavirus.RESULTS: During the pre-vaccine period, sentinel surveillance showed that 1017 patients were enrolled and 57% (range, 53-62%) tested positive for rotavirus, declining to 42% (23% reduction) in the first post-vaccine year and to 26% (53% reduction) in the second post-vaccine year; declines were most marked among infants. The patient register review showed that, compared with pre-vaccine rotavirus seasons, declines in hospitalizations due to all-cause AGE during post-vaccine rotavirus seasons were 48% among <1 year age-group in both first and second years following vaccine introduction. Among 1-4 year olds no reduction was noted in the first year and a 19% decline occurred in the second year.CONCLUSIONS: We report rapid and marked reduction in the number of AGE hospitalizations and the proportion of AGE hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus in the first two years post- RV1 implementation in Togo. It is necessary to monitor long-term vaccine impact on rotavirus disease burden through continued surveillance.

AB  - The article consecutively examines the evolution of main themes in South Korean fiction since the foundation of the Republic of Korea until the present time. The author outlines three major periods of its development set in historical context: first, the appearance of new themes and problematics in national fiction after Liberation (1945-1951); second, the trauma of Korean war and its overcoming (1951-the first part of the 1960s); third, gradual decline of political and ideological themes, writers are getting more interested in individual life and personal issues of their characters (from the 1970s until today). Special attention is given to the transformation of the topic of family that historically played an important role in Korean worldview as well as in classical literature. The article concludes with the overview of the most recent trends in South Korean fiction's themes such as the future of consumer society, feminism, the impact of technology and artificial intelligence on human life.

AB  - The article is devoted to the description of the mental component of the culture of the local ethnic group of Buryats living in China. The project used records of field research that were made in the IMAR of PRC over several years. Based on the analysis of this data, the main mental-spiritual aspects of Buryat culture were revealed. The oral folklore tradition of the ethnic group of the Buryats of Inner Mongolia allows to reveal, to a certain extent, the mentality of the entire Buryat people, to characterize social experience and knowledge accumulated in the past by previous generations. Despite being isolated from the maternal ethnos, the Buryat diaspora in China managed to preserve its cultural potential, not to lose its language and traditions. The ethnopsychology of the pastoralists outside the native nomadism was based on the idea of the need for homecoming, which contributed to the formation of mental attitudes and shaping a special way of thinking, regulating the livelihoods of several generations of migrants.The main stereotypes of the national character of the Chinese Buryats are rooted in indissoluble ties with the mother ethnic group and adherence to the traditional values of ancestors, which are based on a certain way of life - the traditional form of husbandry (cattle breeding), nomadic lifestyle, natural habitat (endless steppes). This explains their characteristic behavioral features: extreme restraint in expression of emotion, deliberation in everyday life, balance of actions, deliberation of action, philosophical perception of the world, special mental makeup in terms of time and distance - they are vague, spaced out, non-concrete. The mentality of the Buryat Diaspora in China is closely associated with belonging to the Buddhist religion, determining the basis of education and worldview - compassion for all living things, observance of moral and mental purity, respect for family customs and traditions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the interannual variability of the Black Sea suspended matter concentrations based on satellite data. The spatial and temporal variability of the bio-optical parameters are investigated by satellite data analysis. To analyze the interannual variability of suspended matter concentration on the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea, the combined monthly fields of the backscatter factor (BBP) for the period 1998-2010, obtained from the data of the SeaWiFS scanners, MODIS, MERIS are presented in a uniform spatial resolution grid of 4.6 km. empiric orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is applied to these data arrays with the aim to classify the spatial variability of BBP signal. As a result, the characteristics of the interannual spatial-temporal variability of the suspended matter concentration are given by four Empiric orthogonal function maps. They describe around 52% of summary suspended matter variance on the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea and thus its define the main regions (sources) of matter input. The influence of the Danube water inflow and suspended matters transport on the northwestern part of the Black Sea are discussed. The relationship between interannual variability of the suspended matter concentrations and large-scale atmospheric circulation processes was compared via North Atlantic Oscillation index.

TI  - SAR-based detection of flooded vegetation - a review of characteristics and approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The ability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to detect flooded vegetation (FV) (the temporary or permanent occurrence of waterbodies underneath vegetated areas) offers a great benefit in the research fields of flood and wetland monitoring. The growing demand for near real-time information in flood monitoring and an increased awareness of the importance of wetland ecosystems are strong drivers for the ongoing research in these fields, where FV constitutes an essential part. This study reviewed 128 publications summarizing the knowledge about the relationships between the SAR parameters and the environmental conditions for the detection of FV. An advanced review of 83 studies was carried out to gain insights about applied classification techniques and SAR data for the extraction of FV. Although some trends emerged about which wavelengths, polarisations, or incidence angles to use, there is variation in the application of different classification techniques or using SAR-derived information depending on the data sets and the study area. Notable throughout the analysed articles is the growing demand for unsupervised and computationally efficient methods of higher accuracy for the extraction of FV. Based on the advances in SAR with regard to spatial and temporal resolution, the development of robust approaches for the extraction of FV from various and complex environments has to be further pursued.

TI  - Portraying Urban Functional Zones by Coupling Remote Sensing Imagery and Human Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Portraying urban functional zones provides useful insights into understanding complex urban systems and establishing rational urban planning. Although several studies have confirmed the efficacy of remote sensing imagery in urban studies, coupling remote sensing and new human sensing data like mobile phone positioning data to identify urban functional zones has still not been investigated. In this study, a new framework integrating remote sensing imagery and mobile phone positioning data was developed to analyze urban functional zones with landscape and human activity metrics. Landscapes metrics were calculated based on land cover from remote sensing images. Human activities were extracted from massive mobile phone positioning data. By integrating them, urban functional zones (urban center, sub-center, suburbs, urban buffer, transit region and ecological area) were identified by a hierarchical clustering. Finally, gradient analysis in three typical transects was conducted to investigate the pattern of landscapes and human activities. Taking Shenzhen, China, as an example, the conducted experiment shows that the pattern of landscapes and human activities in the urban functional zones in Shenzhen does not totally conform to the classical urban theories. It demonstrates that the fusion of remote sensing imagery and human sensing data can characterize the complex urban spatial structure in Shenzhen well. Urban functional zones have the potential to act as bridges between the urban structure, human activity and urban planning policy, providing scientific support for rational urban planning and sustainable urban development policymaking.

AB  - Biocompatible gold nanostars (GNS) with tip-enhanced electromagnetic and optical properties have been developed and applied for multifunctional cancer diagnostics and therapy (theranostics). Their multiple sharp branches acting like "lightning rods" can convert safely and efficiently light into heat. As with other nanoparticles, GNS sizes can be controlled so that they passively accumulate in tumors due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of tumor vasculature. This feature improves tumor-targeting precision and permits the use of reduced laser energy required to destroy the targeted cancer cells. The ability to selectively heat tumor areas where GNS are located while keeping surrounding healthy tissues at significantly lower temperatures offers significant advantages over other thermal therapies. GNS-mediated photothermal therapy combined with checkpoint immunotherapy was shown to reverse tumor-mediated immunosuppression, leading to the treatment of not only primary tumors but also cancer metastasis as well as inducing effective long-lasting immunity, i.e. an anticancer 'vaccine' effect.

AB  - Generalka 2 is the new complex of Yamnaya culture located on the Khortitsa island (river Dnieper, Zaporizhzhya region, Ukraine). System analysis of site excavations allows to draw parallels with European monuments of causewayed enclosures type. Thus, Generalka 2 expands the pan-European causewayed enclosures issue on the territory of Ukrainian steppes. Viewed features of architecture and material culture of site gives the opportunity to study it from the cultural positions, using, among other things, carnival theory. It also allows to make a conclusion about metaphors contained in the inherent to the monument architectural forms. Main architectural parameters of Generalka 2 and other European causewayed enclosures were connected with the reflection in them of social and cultural models of existence of ancient society.

AB  - Land degradation has been highlighted as a key development challenge by numerous international bodies, including the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification or the UNCCD, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and is one of the so-called Sustainable Development Goals. The UNCCD aims to avoid, reduce, and reverse land degradation, especially desertification and deforestation, by providing support to sustainable land management. Sustainable land management implements practices that maintain vegetative cover, build soil organic matter, make efficient use of inputs, such as water, nutrients and pesticides, and minimize off-site impacts. In the context of Land Degradation Neutrality or Sustainable Development Goal 15.3, three indicators have been identified to quantify land degradation: trends in land cover; trends in carbon stocks above and below ground; and trends in land productivity.

AB  - Remote sensing data analysis is knowing an unprecedented upswing fostered by the activities of the public and private sectors of geospatial and environmental data analysis. Modern imaging sensors offer the necessary spatial and spectral information to tackle a wide range problems through Earth Observation, such as land cover and use updating, urban dynamics, or vegetation and crop monitoring. In the upcoming years even richer information will be available: more sophisticated hyperspectral sensors with high spectral resolution, multispectral sensors with sub-metric spatial detail or drones that can be deployed in very short time lapses. Besides such opportunities, these new and wealthy information sources also come with a price: the analysts are confronted with data showing large and complex feature characteristics. To deal with these new challenges, kernel methods have emerged as a valid, robust and successful framework. The intrinsic regularization implemented in these methods and their low sensitivity to data dimensionality make them natural candidates to solve current remote sensing problems. The flexibility offered by kernel methods allows us to treat heavily nonlinear tasks with elegant methodologies, while still using linear algebra. In the last decade, kernel methods in general, and support vector machines for classification and Gaussian processes for regression in particular, have become standard tools for geospatial data analysis. In this chapter, we first review the main concepts about kernel methods and their use in remote sensing. Then, we review examples of kernel methods for remote sensing image classification and biophysical parameter retrieval.

AB  - Sediment delivery into water sources and bodies results in the reduction of water quantity and quality, increasing costs of water purification whilst reducing the available water for various other uses. The paper gives an analysis of sedimentation in one of Zimbabwe's seven rivers, the Mazowe Catchment, and its impact on water quality. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was used to compute soil lost from the catchment as a result of soil erosion. The model was used in conjunction with GIS remotely sensed data and limited ground observations. The estimated annual soil loss in the catchment indicates soil loss ranging from 0 to 65 t ha yr(-1). Bathymetric survey at Chimhanda Dam showed that the capacity of the dam had reduced by 39% as a result of sedimentation and the annual sediment deposition into Chimhanda Dam was estimated to be 330 t with a specific yield of 226 t km 2 yr(-1). Relationship between selected water quality parameters, TSS, DO, NO3, pH, TDS, turbidity and sediment yield for selected water sampling points and Chimhanda Dam was analyzed. It was established that there is a strong positive relationship between the sediment yield and the water quality parameters. Sediment yield showed high positive correlation with turbidity (0.63) and TDS (0.64). Water quality data from Chimhanda treatment plant water works revealed that the quality of water is deteriorating as a result of increase in sediment accumulation in the dam. The study concluded that sedimentation can affect the water quality of water sources.

AB  - Landslides bring damage to urbanization and cause negative effects on the quality of agricultural and forest areas and rivers. Therefore, it is of vital importance to detect displacements in landslide areas causing the loss of life and property. Different measurement methods such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements, remote sensing etc. are used for monitoring movements in landslide areas and revealing surface deformations. Co-Registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (Cosi-Corr) method (Remote sensing method) is one of these methods.Although the Cosi-Corr method is used commonly to determine the displacements in dune, glacier, and earthquake areas, there are very few studies related to its use in landslide areas. In this study, the mass movements occurring in the study area were determined by the Cosi-Corr method and the use of very high resolution optical satellite images. General geomorphologic evaluations were performed related to the mass movements in the study area. Consequently, this study shows to be applicable of the Cosi-Corr method in determining the mass movements associated with slow-motion landslides.

AB  - Based on land cover data of 2015, Sumatra is dominated by shrubs, bushes, plantations with hardwoods, and plantations. It is the island with the largest peat distribution in Indonesia. Peatland forest map provided by Ministry of Environment and Forestry in 2015 represent that the total area of peatland in Sumatra is about 9.6 million hectares, mostly located in Riau, Jambi, and South Sumatra Province. Fire incidents can be indicated through hot spots distribution data. The data used is the distribution of hot spot of Sumatra in 2005-2016. The purpose of this study was to analyze the pattern of hot spot distribution and its relations with land cover changes. Overlay results indicate that 31.75% fires occur in shrubs and bushes, 20.87% in plantations with hardwoods, 16.60% in other natural cleared areas, 14.55% in forest crops, and the rest spreads in lowland crops, dry season crops, and swamp / peat forests. The highest hot spots are in 2005 and 2015 due to the El Nino effect that causes prolonged drought. Available land cover data indicates a change during 1990 through 2011. Most of peat land turn into plantation between 1990 to 2000. The result of overlay of hot spot distribution with land cover data from 2006-2015 shows that forest fires mostly occur in industrial plantation forest. This can be seen from the land cover classification where previously a plantation forest, then it is burned into a field and become an industrial plantation forest. Nevertheless, this analysis still need to be validated through ground truth to check the actual land cover and land use in field.

AB  - The MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft are cross-track scanning radiometers that view the Earth scene, a space view port, and the on-board calibrators using a two-sided scan mirror. The reflectivity of the scan mirror varies with the angle of the incident light, and changes in this response versus scan angle (RVS) need to be tracked on orbit in order to maintain accurate calibration. In this paper, we review various methods of RVS calibration of the reflective solar bands using pseudo-invariant desert targets and discuss potential advantages and disadvantages for use in future calibration.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Calibration of the on-orbit gain changes of the narrow bandwidth reflective solar bands (RSB) of Terra and Aqua MODIS is usually based on the band center wavelength. The relative spectral response (RSR) of each band is assumed to be constant on orbit and the time dependence of an overall gain factor is calculated. Any on-orbit changes to the RSR of the MODIS bands will introduce some error into the calibration and may also have an impact on the Earth scene radiance retrieval. We consider two different ways to track how the RSR of the MODIS RSB may be changing on orbit, and the effect that these changes will have on the calibration. First, we examine in band RSR measurements from the spectro-radiometric calibration assembly (SRCA) carried on-board both MODIS instruments. Second, we study the broadband degradation of the MODIS scan mirror and how it may be changing the effective out-of-band response of the RSB. We find that RSR changes have a small effect on the radiance calibrated using the on-board solar diffuser, generally less than 0.5% in all cases at any time in the missions, with bands 1, 8, and 9 impacted the most.

AB  - The INSAT-3D imager (4 km) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on-board Aqua and Terra space-platforms level-2 (1 km) sea surface temperature (SSTskin) product accuracy has been analysed over waters surrounding the Indian subcontinent by indirect comparison method using collocated bulk in-situ measurements (SSTdepth) for 3 years (October 2013-October 2016). Statistical results show that root mean square error of all the three satellites is in range of around 0.600.70 degrees C. Retrieval error is found to be slightly more in case of validation against iQuam data set. INSAT-3D is showing more underestimation with bias ranging from about -0.16 degrees C to -0.20 degrees C than MODIS sensor having bias in range of about 0.06 degrees C to -0.12 degrees C. All the three missions are slightly underestimating over open-ocean with bias ranging in 0-0.17 degrees C. INSAT-3D is significantly underestimating in-situ observations over the Arabian Sea (approximate bias = 0.27 degrees C). Seasonal validation analysis reveals relatively high retrieval error during monsoon season than premonsoon and post-monsoon seasons. MODIS sensor is showing significant underestimation during monsoon with bias ranging from approximately -0.29 degrees C to -0.58 degrees C. Overall, all the three missions are performing similarly well over the study area.

They are also used as markers of animal fecal contamination of human foods and are employed as sentinel organisms for tracking trends in resistance to antimicrobials with Gram-positive activity. As part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), we evaluated several retail meat commodities for the presence of enterococci from 2002 to 2014, and we found 92.0% to be contaminated. The majority of isolates were either Enterococcus faecalis (64.0%) or Enterococcus faecium (28.6%), and the antimicrobial resistance of each isolate was assessed by broth microdilution. The resistance prevalences for several drugs, including erythromycin and gentamicin, were significantly higher among poultry isolates, compared to retail beef or pork isolates. None of the isolates was resistant to the clinically important human drug vancomycin, only 1 isolate was resistant to linezolid, and resistance to tigecycline was below 1%. In contrast, a majority of both E. faecalis (67.5%) and E. faecium (53.7%) isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Overall, the robust NARMS testing system employed consistent sampling practices and methods throughout the testing period, with the only significant trend in resistance prevalence being decreased E. faecium resistance to penicillin. These data provide excellent baseline levels of resistance that can be used to measure future changes in resistance prevalence that may result from alterations in the use of antimicrobials in food animal production.IMPORTANCE Enterococci, including E. faecalis and E. faecium, are present in the guts of food-producing animals and are used as a measure of fecal contamination of meat. We used the large consistent sampling methods of NARMS to assess the prevalence of Enterococcus strains isolated from retail meats, and we found over 90% of meats to be contaminated with enterococci. We also assessed the resistance of the Enterococcus strains, commonly used as a measure of resistance to agents with Gram-positive activity, in foods. Resistance prevalence was over 25% for some antimicrobials and sample sources but was less than 1% for several of the most important therapeutic agents used in human medicine.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article investigates Vietnamese phraseological units with components related to the everyday empirical experience of the Vietnamese people. On the materials of lexicographic and phraseological dictionaries there are revealed and considered phraseological units, which include the names of household items, dishes of national cuisine, monetary units, measurement measures, etc., which are included in the main vocabulary of the language, reflecting its characteristic processes and national originality. Allocated two main types of phraseological units - tuc ngu and thanh ngu, established their specificity. It is shown that in lexical composition tuc ngu and thanh ngu, contains non-equivalent Lexis of the Vietnamese language, shaped the Foundation of which is associated with cultural and ethnic worldview. The relevance of the study is determined by two factors: first, the need to further develop the problem of the relationship between language and human consciousness and culture in General cultural and linguistic research, and secondly, the need to study the ethno-cultural components of the Vietnamese language. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that the ethno-cultural component of Vietnamese phraseological units was studied for the first time. The theoretical foundations of our study are the ideas contained in works on linguistics of Russian and Vietnamese scientists. The General methods of linguoculturological researches were taken as the methodological basis of the research.

TI  - Cosmogonic Motives in the Prologue of the Epos "Dzhangar"
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the cosmogonic motives of an epic prologue, reflecting the ancient representations of the Kalmyks's worldview. In three prologues of early songs of the Bagatsokhurovsky cycle "Dzhangar" such constant motives are defined: a world tree, a world mountain, a world column and a construction of the palace, ascending to the so-called mythological "tryokhmiriye". The tree, the mountain, the column, the palace, all these symbols reflect "a world axis" and are accurately presented in the prologue of a cycle to show the classical division of the "vertical" world. In the Kalmyk epos, Dzhangar-han a priori is the center of the Universe and the center of the power. The real cycle shows Dzhangar-han also the hero of godless motives which are typical of the most archaic forms of the epos. The safety and plurality of transformations of cosmogonic motives reflects classical creation of prologues / beginnings of the tyurko-Mongolian epics connected with the creation of the world in the Bagatsokhurovsky cycle of the epos "Dzhangar" A Distinctive, autochthonic feature of the cycle is the association of the Water world with the world of Nizhny Novgorod. Here the domination is by the area of accommodation of the subethnos broadcasting this cycle. The prologues of songs of the Bagatsokhurovsky cycle are saturated with a deeply archaic layer of motives reflecting the ancient beliefs of Kalmyks bound with certain elements from Buddhist mythology.

CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - The beginning of the Communist totalitarian era in then Czechoslovakia brought with it political declarations of a new historical epoch and a new worldview, one whose rise was to be facilitated, among other ways, by a retooling of culture. The ideologists of the period saw folk culture as an ideal platform: as the artistic expression of the 'suppressed', stripped of any exclusivity or individualism - 'art created by people for people'. Folklore was misused more than other areas because the folk revival movement was transformed into a strong propaganda tool. 'New folk art' in the spirit of socialist realism demanded new songs that would reline traditional forms with contemporary content, oftentimes with political or propaganda undertones. Songs of love and the joys of working in collective fields, of the wonders of the tractor and the harvester, may seem comical today, but they are a sad memento of the time. As contemporary folklore research indicates, these propaganda 'folksongs' were composed primarily by members of politically active folk ensembles. Despite this, these were creative individuals closely tied to the live tradition, and their composition took place within that framework.(1)

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the philosophy of Seo Kyung Deok, Park Sun. Park's philosophy is difficult to grasp because of the lack of existing data. However, I can only grasp the outline through the three roundtrip books which are seen in the 『思菴集』and the 『 栗谷全書』. However, the philosophical discourse in this round-trip book suggests that his academic world is original. Unfortunately, it is unfriendly because it tells only the core of the authorities in the round trip book as opposed to the original claim. For this reason, after asking his philosopher world of Seo Kyung-duk, he has to look at Park Sun's claim. There is also room for distortion or distortion in this process. However, this research has enough value for putting together the philosophy of Park Sun. This study has analyzed the contents of Park Sun and Lee 's claim in three roundtrip books after developing the philosophy of Seok Kyung Deok. Especially, we are analyzing the conflicts and logic structure between them based on the concept of Taoist Raws. In this process, we can naturally see Park's philosophical worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was designed to analyze the concentration of tropospheric NO2 over Saudi Arabia for a decade from 2005-2014 based on observations from satellite borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The spatial analysis has identified two hotspots: Jeddah and Riyadh. The result of temporal analysis shows increase of 1.45%, 3.15% and 3.10% per year over Saudi Arabia, Jeddah and Riyadh respectively. The Linear Regression analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) have been performed to analyze the relationship between meteorological parameters, seasons, years and concentration of NO2. The results show that temperature and NO2 are moderately correlated whereas wind and humidity give negative correlation. The major causes of elevated NO2 over the hotspots are road traffic and the fossil fuel combustion for electrical power generation.

AB  - Multiresolution optical remote sensing systems often have a spatial resolution that varies between bands. An example is the Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation which has three levels of spatial resolution 10m, 20m, and 60m. Recently, researchers have exploited the spectral/spatial correlation inherent in multispectral data to sharpen the lower resolution S2 bands. In this paper, we propose a low-rank method that formulates the sharpening process as a solution to a cost function. We develop an iterative algorithm based on cyclic descent and call it S2Sharp-CD. We evaluate the method on a simulated dataset and compare it to a state-of-the-art approach.

AB  - This study rely on open access data as well as open software, both provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the Copernicus program. In particular, data from Sentinel-1 radar satellite mission and SNAP software have been used. The availability of such data and software is relevant for public institutions that can produce valuable information at almost no charge. Main aim of the authors has been to produce a review paper, a kind of tutorial, where main characteristics of Sentinel-1 data and SNAP processing tools are presented and discussed. It's important to underline that SNAP is not an easy tool and needs a deep knowledge of electromagnetic aspects to result into reliable results. Together with Sentinel-1 data, interferometry techniques have been employed to get from phase difference information a measure of ground displacements. The Ischia island has been chosen as Case Study because it was affected by a severe earthquake in August 2017. In the days following the earthquake, the area was subject to many topographic surveys. Some of them, carried out by CNR-IREA researchers [1], working in collaboration with INGV, have used DInSAR technique applied to Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed images, showing a lowering of the soil around the epicenter up to 4 cm [2], [3]. These data have been used in our processing for comparison and validation as explained later in the paper.

AB  - This paper deals with ground displacement measurements with Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique. These ground modifications often occur as a consequence of an earthquake. The island of Ischia (Southern Italy) has been chosen as case study since it was hit by a severe earthquake on the 21st of August 2017. The National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and the Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA) of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) provided the displacement maps considering interferometric pairs close to the main shock event. In this work, a further interferometric pair, which also includes some aftershocks, has been used to calculate ground modifications. The results confirmed a ground subsidence up to 4 centimeters in the epicenter area, in agreement with the reference data. This study rely on open access data as well as on open software, both provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the Copernicus program. In particular, data from Sentinel-1 radar satellite mission and SNAP software have been used. The availability of such data and software is relevant for public institutions that can produce valuable information at almost no charge.

AB  - This paper presents an introductory synthesis for mapping potential habitats of arthropod vectors responsible for animal trypanosomiasis diseases in Northern Nigeria, where there is high production of livestock. Animal trypanosomiasis is considered an arthropod-borne viral disease which is endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa and particularly in northern Nigeria. The disease which is transmitted by the vector tsetse fly remains a threat to both humans and livestock in many rural communities of Nigeria. The outbreak of the disease is known to occur as a result of the changing climate which relates to changes in sea surface temperatures otherwise known as 'El Nifio Southern Oscillations' (ENSO). Trypanosomiasis is mainly experienced whenever there are changes in global precipitation as a result of the changing climate. Monthly Satellite data of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 2.5 spatial resolution was sourced from NASA- MODIS/CMD and subjected to principal component analysis using standardized principal components of GIS with a digital elevation model (DEM) supplemented in the analysis. Results revealed pockets of probable habitats of arthropod vectors to be around forest islands characterized by dry woodland and savanna, and in other cases around gallery forests and few lowland and riverine areas. This study demonstrates that geospatial technology is a cost effective tool in mapping of the arthropod vector habitats for Northern Nigeria.

TI  - Use of multispectral satellite remote sensing to assess mixing of suspended sediment downstream of large river confluences
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although past work has noted that contrasts in turbidity often are detectable on remotely sensed images of rivers downstream from confluences, no systematic methodology has been developed for assessing mixing over distance of confluent flows with differing surficial suspended sediment concentrations (SSSC). In contrast to field measurements of mixing below confluences, satellite remote-sensing can provide detailed information on spatial distributions of SSSC over long distances. This paper presents a methodology that uses remote-sensing data to estimate spatial patterns of SSSC downstream of confluences along large rivers and to determine changes in the amount of mixing over distance from confluences. The method develops a calibrated Random Forest (RF) model by relating training SSSC data from river gaging stations to derived spectral indices for the pixels corresponding to gaging-station locations. The calibrated model is then used to predict SSSC values for every river pixel in a remotely sensed image, which provides the basis for mapping of spatial variability in SSSCs along the river. The pixel data are used to estimate average surficial values of SSSC at cross sections spaced uniformly along the river. Based on the cross-section data, a mixing metric is computed for each cross section. The spatial pattern of change in this metric over distance can be used to define rates and length scales of surficial mixing of suspended sediment downstream of a confluence. This type of information is useful for exploring the potential influence of various controlling factors on mixing downstream of confluences, for evaluating how mixing in a river system varies over time and space, and for determining how these variations influence water quality and ecological conditions along the river.

CL  - Chiang Mai, THAILAND
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is one of active type sensors, allows us to obtain satellite images regardless day or night. In addition it has a feature of all-weather observation because it emits L-band microwave which is less affected by clouds and rain. The PALSAR-2 aboard the ALOS-2, which achieves high-resolution (3m) observation, is now in operation as the satellite L-band SAR in Japan. The utilization of advantage of the satellite SAR image for monitoring the occurrence of a natural disaster has been tried. The PALSAR-2 emits microwave obliquely downward and receives the back-scattered portion of the incident microwave on the surface of the earth as the observed data. Accordingly, it is quite difficult to decide the occurrence of disaster only with the satellite SAR image by just glancing unlike using a satellite photograph taken from the zenith. In addition, since the satellite SAR image is geocoded image, the actual position on the earth is affected by the location of the satellite corresponding to the time it was observed. Therefore, the process deciding the occurrence of natural disaster using plural information is required to be carried out after a process assigning a correct data based on the obtained satellite SAR image. This process is called orthorectification. However, since the size of the satellite SAR image which is used for detecting occurrence of natural disaster is quite large (larger than 1 GB), an efficient orthorectification process is required to rapidly provide an input data to the detecting process of natural disaster. In this paper we propose a method for an efficient orthorectification process.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Natural landscapes provide ecosystem services that are critical to human health and society. However, as landscapes are threatened by urban development, climate change, intensive agriculture, and altered fire regimes, this negatively affects the condition of natural ecosystems and reduces the provision of these services for which there may not be viable alternatives. We report on a project to map the value of national forest lands in southern California for ecosystem service provision. Our focus is on quantifying five types of ecosystem services, water runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment erosion retention, carbon storage, and biodiversity, across an area that encompasses the four southern national forests-the Angeles, Los Padres, San Bernardino, and Cleveland. We first develop environmentally and climatically driven ecological units as a practical way to summarize information on services for resource managers. Second, we map the spatial distribution of the five services under current climate conditions and assess the spatial concordance between the five services. Third, using a conceptually straightforward approach, we prioritize the ecological units that provide the highest amount of each service and identify hotspots of ecosystem services where ecological units contain multiple services. By providing results to resource managers and the means to access and query the data, information can be used to guide decision making (e. g., prioritizing areas for conservation and restoration activities), assess the impacts of proposed activities (e. g., the impact of fuel management on ecosystem service provision), provide estimates of the value of chaparral shrublands for fire damage assessments, and help secure the long-term provision of ecosystem services across the landscape. The maps and data generated in this project provide the foundation for the next step that is calculating the economic value of these services.

AB  - The emergence of machine learning algorithms enhanced the effectiveness of satellite image applications. On account of the high variability in-born in satellite data, a large portion of the present classification proposals are not sensible for handling satellite datasets. In this paper, we assessed profound learning systems in view of Convolutional Neural Networks for the precise order of multispectral remote sensing information. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a solitary parameter for detecting landcover by utilizing the red and near-infrared band (NIR) information of the electromagnetic spectrum. NDVI is used to break down remote detecting images and survey the presence or absence of live green vegetation. The experiment is conducted on new publicaly available SAT-4 dataset, where the classes involved are types of vegetation. As NDVI computation require just two band data, it takes the benefit of both RED and NIR band information to classify diverse land covers. In the present work, the AlexNet architecture with two band information along with the reduced number of filters were trained and high-level features obtained from tested model managed to classify different land cover classes in the dataset. The proposed architecture is compared against the benchmark and results are estimated in terms of accuracy, precision and total number of trainable parameters. The proposed design brings about the aggregate diminishment of trainable parameters, while retaining high accuracy and precision, when compared against the existing architecture, which utilizes four bands.

AB  - Multispectral imagery can be used for estimating production of oil palm fruit in a plantation. One of the multispectral imagery that capable for production estimation is Sentinel 2. Sentinel 2 is a free imagery that have great 10 m medium spatial resolution bands, which are red, green, blue, and near-infrared. These bands can be used to generate several generic vegetation index such as Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) also non-generic vegetation index such as modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) and atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI). Those vegetation index applied for estimating the production of oil palm fruit in PT. Perkebunan Nusantara VII's plantation at Rejosari, Natar. By-age separation method demonstrate that it has a better accuracy which is 87.5 % rather than normal method that fully transformed without being separated by-age. The fully transformed method accuracy are 61.1 % for RVI, 59.1 % for NDVI, 55.3 % for MSAVI, and 62.1 % for ARVI.

AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard S-NPP provides global coverage once per day for the reflective solar bands. With the successful launch of NOAA-20, the global coverage of VIIRS has now been doubled. In order to use NOAA-20 VIIRS data for environmental related studies, the radiometric performance of VIIRS needs to be independently validated. In addition, for long term studies that use data from multiple satellites instruments, it is imperative to have radiometrically accurate and consistent data products from all the instruments. This study uses SNO (Simultaneous Nadir Overpass) and extended SNO over Saharan desert to assess the radiometric performance of NOAA-20 VIIRS relative to S-NPP VIIRS. Since direct SNO doesn't exist between NOAA-20 and S-NPP, the study uses MODIS as a transfer radiometer. Both NOAA-20 and S-NPP have SNOs with MODIS. Double differencing technique is used to estimate the radiometric bias between the two VIIRS instruments. The study suggests that NOAA-20 VIIRS reflective solar bands are consistently lower in reflectance than that from S-NPP VIIRS by about 2%. Larger bias is observed for bands M5 (0.67 mu m) and M7 (0.86 mu m) bands mainly because S-NPP VIIRS absolute calibration for these bands is biased high by about 2%. The impact on bias due to spectral differences between the two VIIRS instruments is quantified using hyperspectral measurements from Sciamachy.

AB  - In this work we estimated Mexican forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data and two different reference data: (1) extensive national forest inventory (NFI) and (2) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. For the second modelling scenario, we applied a two-stage up scaling approach: firstly AGB for the LiDAR transects were estimated and used then to calibrate satellite imagery. Furthermore, we propagated uncertainties from field measurements to LiDAR-derived AGB and to the national wall-to-wall forest AGB maps. The estimated AGB maps (NFI- and LiDAR-calibrated) showed similar goodness-of fit statistics compared to the independent validation dataset. However, the AGB map based on two-stage up-scaling method (i.e., from field AGB to LiDAR and from LiDARAGB to satellite imagery) showed much higher uncertainties compared to the traditional field to satellite up-scaling.

AB  - Three case studies of Saharan dust intrusions over southern Romania were performed. For these studies the database from the ceilometers located at Magurele and Strejnic was used. In addition, the meteorological conditions were analyzed using the WLK Catalogue based on the Objektive Wetterlagenklassifikation classification of the weather types [1]. This catalogue uses information from three basic tropospheric levels: 925, 700 and 500 hPa, and information on the precipitable water content over the entire atmosphere column Geopotential fields at 925hPa and 500hPa are used for establishing the cyclonicity or anticyclonicity, while the U and V components of wind at 700hPa for establishing the dominant direction of the wind flow. For better understanding of the atmospheric parameters we performed HYSPLIT dispersion and trajectories analysis in conjunction with DREAM model output data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Conference on Internet of Things: Systems, Management and Security (IoTSMS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as an emerging technology with considerable potentialities. Its paradigm of everything connected together invaded the real world, with smart objects located in several daily appliances able to communicate autonomously through already existing network infrastructures. On the downside, the great advance carried by IoT in our life brings at the same time serious security issues, since the information flow among the objects remains mainly unprotected from malicious attackers. The paper at hand proposes TRIS, a novel sentinel to protect smart environments from cyber threats. Our sentinel shields the IoT devices using three defense rings, resulting in a more accurate protection. Additionally, we discuss the actual deployment of the sentinel using open-source tools. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the sentinel, showing that the deployed sentinel performs meticulously even in heavily stressing conditions, thus demonstrating the applicability of TRIS in a distributed and dynamic scenario such as IoT.

AB  - In this study, the classification accuracies of four different classification methods with two balanced and two imbalanced data sets for the classification of Sentinel-1B SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data were comparatively evaluated and the impacts of training data sets into the accuracy were investigated. In some circumstances, it is possible to collect high number of ground truth samples for some classes however not possible for some other classes which are represented by less number of ground truth samples. In such cases, the imbalanced data set is the issue. Supervised classifiers, by its nature, employ many different input parameters in consideration of the decision surface separating the two classes. More than the classification model itself, purity, size and allocation of ground truth samples as well as the adaptation between the training data and adopted classifier are of key importance in accuracy of image classification. In our study, two parametric (Naive Bayes and Linear Discriminant Analysis) and two non-parametric (Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) supervised classification methods were implemented. Our experimental results demonstrated that there were not any significant change in classification accuracies of parametric classifiers and support vector machines however an increase in classification accuracy of random forest with imbalanced dataset. Furthermore, highest classification accuracy of this study (89.94%) was obtained by Support Vector Machines classification.

AB  - Karawang, a suburban area of Greater Jakarta, is known as the second largest rice-producing region in West Java, Indonesia. However, expansion of urban sprawl and industrial area from Greater Jakarta have created rapid agricultural land use/cover changes, especially paddy field, in Karawang. This study analyzed the land use/cover changes of paddy field from 2000 to 2016. Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images were acquired from USGS Earth Explorer, UTM zone 48 south. Satellite image pre-processing, ground truth data collection, supervised maximum likelihood classifications, and Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) were performed in ArcGIS 10.3 (R). It was observed between 2000 and 2016, urban area increased 4.46% (8530 ha) from initial area of 10,004 ha. Meanwhile paddy field decreased 3.18% (6091 ha) from initial area of 115,720 ha. The spatial analysis showed that paddy field in the fringe of urban area are more susceptible for changes.

TI  - The Role of Basin Morphometric Features in Flood Output: A Case Study of the Biga River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the causes behind the constant flooding in the Biga River basin. It aims to determine if the river sub-basins's morphometric features was the reason behind the floods. Historical data from previous floodings were used to create the linear (one-dimensional), areal (two-dimensional), and relief (three-dimensional) morphometric properties of the sub-basins. These parameters were then evaluated quantitatively and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 10 m resolution produced from 1:25000 scale topography maps as the base data. The D8 flow and Strahler methods were alos used as part of this study.The values obtained from the sub-basins of the Biga River were then weight and the potential to generate floods on the main stream of the sub-basins were evaluated. Our final conclusion indicates that the Biga sub-basin has indeed a major effect on flooding of the main channel of the Biga River.Changes in the frequency and severity of precipitation, due to climate change has led to the increase the occurrence of flood disasters worldwide. Because of this flood investigation is becoming more important as it can help determine how flooding occurs and how to prevent or minimize its impact. There are many different methodology are now being used to determine how flooding occurs, one of which is the basin morphometry parameter. This is one of the more practical methods and effective methods used to predict floods.For this study we use this methodology to study the Biga River Basin. This is one of the southern Marmara Sea basins on the Biga peninsula, and it includes can and Biga provinces within the borders of canakkale province. The basin covers about 2311 km(2) and there are four sub-basins included in the main branch. People of the region have been affected socially and economically by massive flooding of the Biga River, which is now a yearly occurence. Using basin morphometry parameters, we focus on the river's sub-basins. We used the one-dimensional linear morphometry (1D: Bifurcation ratio, R-b; stream length ratio, R-l ; texture ratio, T; drainage texture ratio, R-t), two-dimensional areal morphometry (2D: Drainage density, D-d; stream frequency, F-s; form factor, R-f; gravelius index, K-g ; elongation ratio, R-e), and three-dimensional relief morphometry (3D: Basin relief, B-h; times of concentration, T-e; relief ratio, R-h; hypsometric curve, H-e; and hypsometric integral, H-i). Using these parameters, the Biga River sub-basins were examined to determine their effects when they overflow into the main channel.The basic subdivision used in calculation and mapping of the morphometric parameters through Geographic Information Systems. The DEM is used to determine four different basins comprising the main cove in the Biga River basin. Several steps have been taken to determine the Biga River basin and sub-basin boundaries on the DEM. They are filled DEM, flow direction, flow accumulation, extraction drainage network, pour point, and watershed creation stages. In the extraction of the drainage process from flow accumulation, a threshold is given for the smallest stream unit. The Strahler method was used to classify stream indexes. ArcGIS 10.x software and the Spatial Analysis extension tool were used to calculate the morphometric parameters, i.e., drainage network properties, basin geometry, and basin relief properties and to determine basin boundaries. The general slope characteristics of the basin vary between 0 and 54.1 degrees. The distribution of basin relief features at different rates in the lower basins has different drainage densities and stream ratios as well as different erosion activities. The highest values of relief are in the Kocadere sub-basin, and the lowest values are in the Kocabas sub-basin. In the regional distribution of the lower basins, the Biga sub-basin has the highest spatial distribution and is observed in the lower basin of the Kocaba River. Basin drainage has a dendritic river apex. The rate of bifurcation varies. Fishing rate value ranges from 3.92 to 4.49, indicating that the watershed has a homogeneous structure. The drainage density of the basin is between 2.64 and 3.01, and the river density vary between 6.16 and 7.1. These ratios indicate that the infiltration surface runoff is high and that the infiltration values are low. The relief ratio shows that the surface runoff of the basin is very high, and the groundwater potential is moderate. The drainage texture of the sub-basin with the lowest value-the Kocabas sub-basin-is 6.16, and the highest value- Kocadere sub-basin-is 7.1, which indicates coarse and very coarse textures. Kocadere, Kirazhdere, and Biga sub-basins validate that these subwatershed are located under non-dense vegetation cover. Form factor results show that some of the basin has high and short duration peak during flood events depends on geometric character of basin. All the morphometric parameters analysis results show a good relationship of the basin geometry. According to the morphometric results of all sub-basins, the shape, linear, and relief characteristics identified in the Biga subbasin are more susceptible to flood events than the Kocaba, Kirazlidere, and Kocadere sub-basins. Applying geomorphic indices to understand the flood process of sub-basins into the main channel is very useful for planning and creating mitigation strategies before flood events. To understand the flooding process, characteristics such as geomorphology, climate, and land use must be considered.

AB  - The sensitivity of radar backscatter to the amount of intercepted rain in a Douglas-fir and a beech stand was analyzed to determine the feasibility of retrieval canopy storage capacity from Sentinel-1 (C-band). On average, backscatter of a wet Douglas-fir canopy is similar to 1.5 dB and similar to 1 dB higher than the backscatter when the canopy is dry at VH and VV polarization respectively. No consistent differences were found in the case of the beech stand between wet and dry conditions. It is argued that the use of Sentinel-1 to retrieve the amount of intercepted rainfall is limited at best to a reliability of 50% and to canopies with large storage capacity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR ACCESS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Introduction: Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF)-associated reactive angioendotheliomatosis (RAE) is a very rare entity (three previously reported cases in the literature) that can manifest as extremity wounds. RAE's etiopathology is unknown.Case description: We report a case of severe limb-threatening upper extremity wound with pathology-proven RAE. This lesion was previously refractory to standard wound care. There was no evidence of limb ischemia or steal syndrome, previously deemed to be the underlying cause of AVF-associated RAE in other reports.Conclusions: Successful endovascular treatment of an ipsilateral innominate vein stenosis led to reduction of venous hypertension, resolution of associated arm edema, and subsequent wound healing. We therefore propose that venous engorgement and hypertension from central venous stenosis is the likely underlying cause for AVF-associated RAE. If this rare entity is encountered in the setting of AVF, there is utility in treating the wound as a sentinel lesion and venography should be conducted to rule out central venous pathology. Vascular intervention complements aggressive local wound management and biopsy is requisite for prompt diagnosis.

TI  - Self-Affirmation Attenuates Death-Thought Accessibility After Mortality Salience, But Not Among A High Post-Traumatic Stress Sample
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: According to anxiety buffer disruption theory (ABDT), people function effectively in the world, in part, by relying on anxiety-buffer systems to protect against death awareness; however, traumatic experiences can overwhelm and disrupt those anxiety-buffer systems, leaving people unprotected from death awareness and at increased risk for the major symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Based on that idea, it was hypothesized that (a) when posttraumatic stress symptoms are low, self-affirmation (a known worldview/self-esteem based anxiety-buffer) should prevent mortality reminders from causing increased death-thought accessibility (DTA); but that (b) when posttraumatic stress symptoms are high (indicating anxiety-buffer disruption), self-affirmation should fail to prevent mortality reminders from increasing DTA. Method: To test these hypotheses, participants identified in a general population prescreen assessment as "low posttraumatic-stress symptom" (n = 222) and "high posttraumatic-stress symptom" (n = 210) were reminded of death (vs. control topic), prompted to engage in a self-affirmation (vs. nonself-affirmation) task, and then asked to complete a standard assessment of death-thought accessibility (DTA). Results: The hypotheses were confirmed, revealing that posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with the ineffectiveness of anxiety-buffer system in protecting against increased death awareness. Conclusion: The present findings support of a foundational concept of ABDT, and point to new insights about the nature of PTSD and its treatment, because failure to manage death awareness is known to cause anxiety and exacerbate anxiety-related disorders (e.g., PTSD).

TI  - The impact of mortality awareness on meaning in life among Christians and atheists
T2  - RELIGION BRAIN & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Research derived from terror management theory suggests that reliance on a terror-managing set of beliefs when reminded of death can influence one's perception of meaning in life. The present research builds on prior work suggesting that religious concepts help to manage the awareness of death, and expands on that work to explore the challenges of religious and atheistic terror management. It was hypothesized that religious participants would be able to sustain perceived meaning in life when reminded of death, but that atheists would be vulnerable to a reduction in meaning when reminded of death. To test that idea, Christians and atheists were first reminded of either mortality or a control topic, and then asked to rate how strongly they felt life was meaningful. Results indicated that ratings of meaning in life were lower in the mortality salience condition, relative to the control condition, among the atheists but not among the Christians. Implications regarding religious and non-religious terror management strategies are discussed.

AB  - In this study, coseismic and postseismic deformation following the October 31, 2013 M 6.4 earthquake in eastern Taiwan is investigated using InSAR and GPS measurements. The InSAR data includes a pair of ascending and descending SAR data from Radarsat-II satellite covering the mainshock. The GPS measurements span the earthquake and up to 340 days after the event. The geodetic measurements of coseismic deformation are inverted to determine fault geometry and slip distribution. GPS time series data are analyzed by Principal Component Analysis based Inversion Method (PCAIM) to derive space and time distribution of postseismic fault slip. The main coseismic slip in the best fitting oblique-thrust dislocation shows two clear asperities: a small asperity at a depth of about 5 km with a maximum slip of 0.6 m and a larger asperity between depths of 15-25 km with maximum slip of 1 m. There is little slip above 5 km, suggesting the presence of active subsurface (blind) faulting under the Central Range. The mainshock is followed by widespread frictional afterslip on one patch which is localized close to the deepest coseismic asperity.

TI  - An assessment of commonly employed satellite-based remote sensors for mapping mangrove species in Mexico using an NDVI-based classification scheme
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing the classification accuracy of a mangrove forest is of utmost importance for conservation practitioners. Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle. When considering such type of sensors, the higher spatial resolution can be particularly important in mapping small mangrove islands that often occur in degraded mangrove systems.

TI  - "I am my own creator": Vocational identity of emerging adults in a local labor market and the globalized world
T2  - TIMARIT UM UPPELDI OG MENNTUN-ICELANDIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful identity development (Erikson, 1968) is considered important in the fast changing societies of the globalized world. Finding your "niche" in society through occupational choice is one of the major developmental tasks in emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000). Vocational identity specifically refers to the cognitive processes that are involved in relating self to work (Vondracek & Skorikov, 1997). In Iceland young people tend to drop out of upper secondary and tertiary education in higher proportions than elsewhere (Kristjana Stella Blondal et al., 2010). Lack of school engagement (Kristjana Stella Blondal & Sigrun Aoalbjarnardottir, 2012) has been shown to influence dropping out of school. Youth in general are also indecisive in their career choices (Abrams et al., 2013) and do not carefully consider the many educational options (Svanhildur Svavarsdottir, 2010). Problems surrounding career choice are possibly an indicator of poor vocational identity development. The purpose of this study is to start exploring the content of vocational identity of emerging adults in Iceland, focusing on the possible conflict between globalization and local culture (Hannerz, 1996; Jensen et al., 2011; McAdams & Cox, 2010).Vocational identity is an important construct in career development theories but its content still needs considerable research (Porfeli et al., 2013). A first step in understanding how Icelandic youth develop identities is using a narrative approach to allow full expression of their thoughts and ideas concerning issues and problems in relation to education and the labor market (McAdams & Pals, 2006). Narrative approaches have been increasingly applied in career development (Hartung, 2013) and are based on multiple theoretical views and strategies. We decided to apply McAdams' (1993, 2015) life story approach designed to explore narrative identity to decode the content of vocational identity.Four 22 year old women and two men were interviewed. The semi-standardized interview included McAdams' life story approach (1993). The participants were asked to give an account of events they saw as high points, low points and turning points in their lives. They were asked to consider whether any of those events might have influenced their career choice. Participants were selected from a random sample of high school students in a longitudinal study of interests, personality and life goals (Katrin Osk Eyjolfsdottir, 2012) for maximum variation (Creswell, 2007). Four of the participants are still in upper secondary school (gymnasium) and two attend university. All have part-time jobs alongside their studies, the majority are partnered and four have started independent living away from their families. The interviews were analyzed based on grounded theory approach using constant comparison (Charmaz, 2006).The results center around two main themes. The first theme captures the influence of globalization on their worldview in relation to their careers. A changed world was the first of four subthemes that emerged. Technology and transportation has transformed and brought the world closer but made it more complex. Horizons have been widened and it is hard to localize oneself in the world. More education is needed than before but it is difficult to make choices from the variety of educational options because the world changes fast. This results in simultaneously feeling overwhelmed or intimidated by the big ever-changing world and having at your fingertips a world full of opportunities.The second theme reflects the influence of local culture and society apparent in their common career stories. A good worker is a clear subtheme; they consider themselves and their family members hard workers with important qualities for the job market such as diligence, conscientiousness, initiative, and communication skills. They also express somewhat contradictory ideas about the crazy labor market. They feel it is enough to possess all those good qualities to get a job, and they doubt the existence of unemployment. Nevertheless, it is hard to get work and you need good luck, family or friendship relations to be able to land a good job. Notably education was not mentioned in this context. Finally the young people possess relentless optimism and a firm belief that their career will work itself out (ice: reddast) as long as they possess those good qualities along with honesty and persistence.The narratives clearly show inconsistency and conflicting views between self and society - the local and global - leading to difficulty in defining future goals and forming a coherent vocational identity. Contrary to expectations (Jensen et al., 2011) their career related narratives are firmly grounded in local ideas of diligence handed down in their families and belief in kinship for success in the labor market instead of education. Both global and local changes make it hard for them to plan and decide on educational pathways. This conflict is however resolved in the "heroic" narrative of the self (McAdams, 2015), based on the enduring cultural fatalistic belief (Terry Gunnell, 2009) that it will all somehow turn out well for them in the end.

TI  - Built-up index methods and their applications for urban extraction from Sentinel 2A satellite data: discussion
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Several built-up indices have been proposed in the literature in order to extract the urban sprawl from satellite data. Given their relative simplicity and easy implementation, such methods have been widely adopted for urban growth monitoring. Previous research has shown that built-up indices are sensitive to different factors related to image resolution, seasonality, and study area location. Also, most of them confuse urban surfaces with bare soil and barren land covers. By gathering the existing built-up indices, the aim of this paper is to discuss some of their advantages, difficulties, and limitations. In order to illustrate our study, we provide some application examples using Sentinel 2A data. (c) 2017 Optical Society of America

T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The impact of wildfires on society is increasing. Annually burned area, fire season length and fire severity have increased during the last decade in several regions of the world, and a number of tragic events have occurred recently in fire-prone areas. Whereas forest fires are natural phenomena, emergency management must be improved in order to minimise human and economic losses as well as undesired effects to ecosystems not resilient enough to fire. However, wildland fire behaviour is not completely understood. Fire rate of spread depends on terrain, weather and vegetation, but the exact relationship between all involved variables is unknown. Remote sensing can help to solve this issue because it has a great potential to measure real-scale fire behaviour with a high spatio-temporal resolution. In this paper, we propose the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to combine wildfire remote sensing data with spatial information about vegetation, weather and terrain. This integrated framework facilitates the systematic analysis of multisource data and the study of observed relationships between variables. We describe which operations may be applied to remote sensing and geospatial data in order to display the observed fire evolution and extract relevant statistical relationships. Among others, fire spread is displayed over a topographic map; burned area and fire perimeter evolution are measured; spatially-explicit rates of spread (ROS) are computed; surface ROS is derived from horizontal ROS using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM); and relationships between ROS, intensity, slope and vegetation type are studied.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Management of the axilla in early breast cancer patients has significantly evolved in the last several decades. With the arrival of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, surgical practice for axillary staging in patients with early breast cancer has become gradually less invasive and formal axillary lymph node dissection has been confined to selected patients. Over the last two decades, evidence from randomized clinical trials have allowed for the de-escalation of axillary surgery in the management of early stage breast cancer. Advances in the staging and treatment of the axilla constitute a key component in determining initial surgical planning and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of early breast cancer. This chapter provides an updated review on the history, evolution, and current practices for axillary management in patients with early breast cancer, with particular attention to the surgical recommendations and controversial scenarios of the evolving management of the axilla.

T2  - INTERLITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking as a basis Soren Kierkegaard's narrative strategy of attack and defence, this paper will analyse the representation of western civilization in connection with the worldview of the native people living in a leper colony in Belgian Congo in Graham Greene's novel A Burnt-Out Case. I will examine concretely the way in which Greene attacks in the novel the hegemonic structure of the European colonizers, which both ignores and imposes itself on the African native society, considering it a no-structure. Additionally, I will study the cases of the priests in the leper colony and of doctor Colin, characters that, being on the frontier between both value systems, become cultural translators and thus make communication possible. These characters acknowledge that the native way of life is as legitimate as the European and represent the possibility of an empathic side of western civilization. In contrast with the attack mentioned above, with the priests and Dr Colin Greene defends the European community living in the area. Through the use of the narrative strategy of attack and defence, therefore, contradictory messages are inserted in the text so that the readers take an active role solving the paradoxes they find in their reading. Finally, I will focus on the main protagonist, Querry, whose internal journey starts with his contact with Deo Gratias, a member of the native society, and whose spiritual evolution throughout the novel cannot be explained without his experience with the native culture.

TI  - A Tool Assessing Optimal Multi-Scale Image Segmentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation to create representative objects by region growing image segmentation techniques such as multi resolution segmentation (MRS) is mostly done through interactive selection of scale parameters and is still a subject of great research interest in object-based image analysis. In this study, we developed an optimum scale parameter selector (OSPS) tool for objective determination of multiple optimal scales in an image by MRS using eCognition software. The ready to use OSPS tool consists of three modules and determines optimum scales in an image by combining intrasegment variance and intersegment spatial autocorrelation. The tool was tested using WorldView-2 and Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV Mx images having different spectral and spatial resolutions in two areas to find optimal objects for ground features such as water bodies, trees, buildings, road, agricultural fields and landslides. Quality of the objects created for these features using scale parameters obtained from the OSPS tool was evaluated quantitatively using segmentation goodness metrics. Results show that OSPS tool is able determine optimum scale parameters for creation of representative objects from high resolution satellite images by MRS method.

TI  - The challenges of using satellite data sets to assess historical land use change and associated greenhouse gas emissions: a case study of three Indonesian provinces
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in satellite remote sensing and the wealth of earth observation (EO) data now available have improved efforts toward determining and quantifying historical land use and land cover (LULC) change. Satellite imagery can overcome the absence of accurate records of historical land use; however, the variability observed in the case study regions demonstrates a number of current challenges.Differences in spatial coverage, resolution and land cover classification can lead to challenges in analyzing historical data sets to estimate LULC change and associated GHG emissions. This paper demonstrates the calculation of LULC change from three existing, open-source data sets to show how this can lead to significant variation in estimates of GHG emissions related to differences in land classification methodologies, EO input data and period of investigation. This article focuses on selected regions of Indonesia, where quantifying land use change is important for GHG assessments of agricultural commodities and for evidencing progress against corporate and government deforestation commitments.Given the significance of GHG emissions arising from LULC change and the increasing need for emissions monitoring, this research highlights a need for consensus building to develop consistency in historical and future LULC change estimates. This paper concludes with a set of recommendations for improvements to ensure consistent LULC mapping.

AB  - Sentinel-2 MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument) is the Landsat-like spatial resolution (10-60 m) super-spectral instrument of the European Space Agency (ESA), aimed at additional data continuity for global land surface monitoring with Landsat and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) missions. Several studies with simulated and real data have been conducted in the last several years to show the potential of Sentinel-2 MSI, including its use for geological remote sensing.An aspect of Sentinel-2 MSI that has not yet been evaluated for geological remote sensing is the 5-10 days revisiting time. This paper shows the first results of a multi-temporal study performed in a hydro-thermal alteration system in southern Spain. Several band ratios for mapping mineral alteration have been calculated in more than 200 Sentinel-2 MSI images that cover a period of two years. Results show the effect of seasonality, illumination and weather on ground cover and the stability of the geological indices.

M3  - Data study
AB  - The Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) with GWR, 1998-2016 consist of annual concentrations (micrograms per cubic meter) of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with dust and sea-salt removed. This data set combines AOD retrievals from multiple satellite instruments including the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS). The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model is used to relate this total column measure of aerosol to near-surface PM2.5 concentration. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used with global ground-based measurements to predict and adjust for the residual PM2.5 bias per grid cell in the initial satellite-derived values. These estimates are primarily intended to aid in large-scale studies. Gridded data sets at 0.01 degrees are provided to allow users to agglomerate data as best meets their particular needs. Data sets are gridded at the finest resolution of the information sources that were incorporated, but do not fully resolve PM2.5 gradients at the gridded resolution due to influence by information sources at coarser resolutions. The data are distributed as GeoTIFF files and are in WGS 84 projection.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - The introduction of optical imaging by using near-infrared (NIR) light shines new light in the field of (oncologic) surgery. The use of non-specific fluorophores, such as Indocyanine Green (ICG) and Methylene Blue (MB) have already shown its value for different applications during image-guided surgery. Both ICG and MB are currently the only fluorophores approved by regulatory agencies for off-label use. ICG improves visibility of several solid tumors, sentinel lymph nodes, biliary ducts and can be used to evaluate tissue perfusion. MB could be used for ureter imaging and neuroendocrine or thyroid tumors detection. Recently, a shift to molecular imaging was made by the introduction of new NIR fluorophores (IRDye-800CW, ZW800-1), which could be conjugated to tumor or structure specific targets, such as proteins, antibodies, antibody fragments or nanoparticles. Several clinical trials showed detection of both tumor and metastases in patients with head-and neck, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and renal tumors. Furthermore, nerve and ureter specific agents are (pre-)clinically evaluated, however more research is necessary to make these agents clinically available. Limitations of using NIR fluorescence imaging during surgery are the lack of quantification of fluorescence signals and limited penetration depth. Further optimization of NIR fluorescence imaging and evaluation of the clinical benefit for the patient are necessary steps to make NIR fluorescence guided surgery general applicable into surgical daily practice.

AB  - Speckle-tracking of historically acquired ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-2 datasets are used to determine the dynamics of major glaciers and ice masses in western Canada over the past decade. For the icefields of the St. Elias Mountains and those that fringe the northern British Columbia/Alaska border, our results are largely consistent with earlier studies that used the same data, but different speckle-tracking techniques, to derive ice motion. However, our results are generally more spatially comprehensive than those previously published, in particular in fast-flowing regions such as Hubbard, Seward, Tweedsmuir and Lowell glaciers. We also produce new velocity maps for the icefields located in the Coast Mountains of southwestern British Columbia and for the Chaba, Clemenceau and Columbia icefields of the Rocky Mountains. Generally, faster flow is present on large ocean- and land-terminating outlet glaciers, particularly those in high accumulation maritime regions. These results, taken together with velocity maps of the Canadian Arctic and Yukon produced in previous studies, mean that baseline maps of glacier velocities determined from speckle tracking of SAR datasets are now available for nearly all the major ice masses of Canada.

TI  - The Utility of Sentinel-1 Data for Ocean Surface Feature Analysis in the Vicinity of the Gulf Stream
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - European Space Agency Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets are used to assess their suitability for ocean surface feature extraction in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream. A SAR ocean feature detection tool originally developed to extract and classify brightness fronts in RADARSAT-2 (R2) SAR imagery has been updated to extract and classify brightness fronts from S1 ground range-detected products. Results indicate that the features extracted from S1 datasets are largely consistent with those derived from R2. However, more features are extracted from S1 data and, in limited examples, there are differences in how features are classified. In addition, S1 radial velocity (RVL) products were compared with simulated RVL products created from modeled ocean current data. This comparison shows that the orientation and magnitude of the Gulf Stream in S1 RVL products is generally consistent with modeled results, but does indicate that some regions of the Gulf Stream (meanders and ocean eddies) are likely to present challenges for automatic extraction algorithms. Taken together, this research shows that S1 data have utility for ocean surface feature extraction and provide an additional dataset that can be exploited to expand ocean feature analysis over Canadian waters.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpretations of post-fire condition and rates of vegetation recovery can influence management priorities, actions and perception of latent risks from landslides and floods. In this study, we used the Waldo Canyon fire (2012, Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA) as a case study to explore how a time series (2011-2016) of high-resolution images can be used to delineate burn extent and severity, as well as quantify post-fire vegetation recovery. We applied an object-based approach to map burn severity and vegetation recovery using Worldview-2, Worldview-3 and QuickBird-2 imagery. The burned area was classified as 51% high, 20% moderate and 29% low burn-severity. Across the burn extent, the shrub cover class showed a rapid recovery, resprouting vigorously within 1 year, whereas 4 years post-fire, areas previously dominated by conifers were divided approximately equally between being classified as dominated by quaking aspen saplings with herbaceous species in the understorey or minimally recovered. Relative to using a pixel-based Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), our object-based approach showed higher rates of revegetation. High-resolution imagery can provide an effective means to monitor post-fire site conditions and complement more prevalent efforts with moderate-and coarse-resolution sensors.

TI  - It matters when you measure it: using snow-cover Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to isolate post-fire conifer regeneration
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is commonly used to monitor post-fire green-up; however, most studies do not distinguish new growth of conifer from deciduous or herbaceous species, despite potential consequences for local climate, carbon and wildlife. We found that dual season (growing and snow cover) NDVI improved our ability to distinguish conifer tree presence and density. We then examined the post-fire pattern (1984-2017) in Landsat NDVI for fires that occurred a minimum of 20 years ago (1986-1997). Points were classified into four categories depending on whether NDVI, 20 years post-fire, had returned to pre-fire values in only the growing season, only under snow cover, in both seasons or neither. We found that each category of points showed distinct patterns of NDVI change that could be used to characterise the average pre-fire and post-fire vegetation condition Of the points analysed, 43% showed a between-season disagreement if NDVI had returned to pre-fire values, suggesting that using dual-season NDVI can modify our interpretations of post-fire conditions. We also found an improved correlation between 5- and 20-year NDVI change under snow cover, potentially attributable to snow masking fast-growing herbaceous vegetation. This study suggests that snow-cover Landsat imagery can enhance characterisations of forest recovery following fire.

AB  - Terrestrial Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) describes the total amount of CO2 assimilated by plants in an ecosystem during photosynthesis and is considered the largest flux component of the global carbon cycle. One of the most prominent techniques for estimating GPP at ecosystem scale is the Light Use Efficiency (LUE) approach, taking advantage of the spatiotemporal capabilities that satellite data provide. LUE expresses GPP as the product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and the efficiency (epsilon) that APAR is converted to biomass. Although satellite imagery is the key component of such models, the effects of image spatial resolution on model performance have not been thoroughly investigated. The emergence of new satellite instruments with enhanced spatial, spectral and temporal capabilities (i.e. Copernicus Sentinels) provides the opportunity for GPP estimation in high spatial resolution and comparison with low resolution GPP products (i.e. MODIS). In this study, a LUE model is applied to three satellite instruments with different spatial resolution: MODIS (500 m), Sentinel-3 (300 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m). The GPP estimates of the three instruments are compared over six forest sites in Greece: two deciduous (Quercus sp., Fagus sylvatica), two coniferous (Pinus nigra, Pinus halepensis) and two mixed (Pinus nigra with Fagus sylvatica). The results demonstrate that spatial resolution is not a crucial parameter for LUE modeling in wide, homogenous and fully covered forested areas. The spatial resolution is more important when applying LUE in mixed canopies or partially covered forested areas due to the effects of the different land cover types. To that purpose, Sentinel-2 presents a unique potential for accurate characterization of the land cover type and dynamics, due to the increased spatial resolution and frequent coverage, appearing as a prominent tool for future large scale GPP monitoring.

AB  - Tank rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are a potential solution for reducing water stress in Southern India by providing groundwater recharge and seasonal water storage. Remote sensing (RS) observations have a potential to monitor these systems over larger spatial scales and offer a systemic approach to support scientific efforts in water management. The research objective was to develop a method for water volume retrieval in tank systems in S. India. This method used data from the Sentinel-1A (S-1A) sensor in combination with a new high-resolution global digital elevation model (DEM), the TerraSAR-X Add-On for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X), to monitor the water volume changes within seven tank structures. This research has offered a unique contribution to the hydrologic science community by incorporating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a high-resolution DEM for tank monitoring.

AB  - This work deals with the validation of integrated water vapor (IWV) products derived from the following satellite instruments: Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument (GOME-2), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Spining Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). IWV data from GPS in nine ground-based stations located in the Iberian Peninsula are used as reference. The study period extends from 2007 to 2012, under cloud-free conditions. All satellite instruments showed a tendency to reduce IWV extreme values: low IWV is overestimated while high IWV is underestimated. As for the influence of solar zenith angle (SZA), Seasonal dependence is mainly due to the SZA and IWV typical values in each season. In general, in summer the tendency is to underestimate with low inter-quartile range (IQR) and in winter the trend is to overestimate with high IQR.

TI  - Inter-comparison of integrated water vapor from satellite instruments using reference GPS data at the Iberian Peninsula

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the inter-comparison of integrated water vapor (IWV) products derived from the following satellite instruments: Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument (GOME-2), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Spining Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). IWV data from GPS in nine ground based stations located in the Iberian Peninsula are used as reference. The study period extends from 2007 to 2012. The results show that, in general, OMI has good accuracy (pseudomedian of the relative differences between OMI and GPS IWV of (-0.7 +/- 1.1)%). However, OMI, SCIAMACHY and AIRS show higher inter quartile range (IQR) (which indicates lower precision) than the rest of satellite instruments. Both MODIS satellite instruments and SEVIRI products tend to slightly underestimate reference IWV data while GOME-2 exhibits a notable overestimation (16.7 +/- 0.8%). All satellite instruments showed a tendency to reduce IWV extreme values: low IWV is overestimated while high IWV is underestimated. As for the influence of solar zenith angle (SZA), it can be observed that GOME-2 strongly overestimates the reference for high SZA values (by around 60% for SZA 60 - 80 degrees). OMI shows, however, a high IQR for high SZA values. Both MODIS instruments show an increase in the pseudomedian of relative differences and IQR with SZA at daytime, with more stable values at night. Seasonal dependence is mainly due to the SZA and IWV typical values in each season. In general, in summer the tendency is to underestimate with low IQR (which happens when IWV is high and SZA is low), and in winter the trend is to overestimate with high IQR (which happens when IWV is low and SZA is high). SCIAMACHY shows a high pseudomedian in summer and autumn, and lower in winter and spring. It must be noted that GOME-2 shows a higher overestimation and OMI shows a higher IQR than other satellite instruments in winter and autumn. The influence of clouds was also studied, showing an increase of IQR as cloudiness increases in all satellites. Pseudomedian also worsens as cloudiness increases, generally.

TI  - Teaching An Introduction to Sociology Course in a Secular College: Systematic Reflections from an Orthodox Catholic Worldview
T2  - CATHOLIC SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay addresses some of the central issues, prospects, and problems that a serious Catholic scholar can be expected to deal with in teaching an Introduction to Sociology course in a secular college. The paper assumes the basic validity and utility of the secular discipline of sociology while noting certain dysfunctional empirical tendencies that are not intrinsic to this intellectual enterprise. Rather, these dysfunctional tendencies reflect the secular and progressive individual worldviews and biases of the majority of scholars who teach, write, and practice the discipline at this present moment in time and space. Examples of how the individual secular and progressive biases impact on the discipline can be found in numerous ways. Among others, they can be found in 1) the construction of concepts and definitions and in the choice of theoretical frameworks, all bringing with them distinctive, albeit usually implicit, philosophical assumptions; 2) the denial of any metaphysical dimension; 3) the degree and amount of hyper-specialization found in research; and 4) the utopian and ideological aspects part and parcel of the analysis in question. The line of analysis pursued here generally follows an earlier effort of mine dealing with similar issues, i.e., "Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments-An Exploratory Critique From a Catholic Sociological Sensibility" (2011).

AB  - A priori information regarding the land cover in remote sensing applications is critical to the effectiveness of the results yielded by the analysis, particularly in complex terrain. Mostly, such information is estimated from spectral indices using either, software with heavy pre-requirements on the machines, or by introducing programmable codes using different programming languages, or other development tools. This paper intends to introduce and demonstrate the details of a simple tool "Ppmask" to generate pre-processing masks for generalized remote sensing analysis of land cover in mountainous regions. The tool yields cloud and cloud shadow masks irrespective of the existence of thermal bands in the source imagery. Further, the tool is capable of extracting several spectral indices and corresponding land cover masks based on these indices. The applicability of the tool is demonstrated using data sets of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. To assess the quality of masks, a comparison is made with the results from the "Fmask" algorithm for cloud and shadow masks. Another assessment is made by comparison of land cover masks generated by the utility "Ppmask" for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery.

AB  - Himalayan snow contributes significantly in towards water resource in several countries in Asia. In mountain hydrology, timely information on the spatial and temporal variability of the extent of wet snow is significant in snowmelt runoff models. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have enabled us to study the extent of snow cover using different techniques based on remote sensing data. The all-weather capability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) makes it extremely useful especially in difficult alpine terrains. Due to the penetrability of microwave signals, dry snow often exhibits scattering from the underlying soil surface. Snow exhibits very high reflectance in the visible and near infrared spectrum. Thus, using either optical or active microwave data, identification of wet and dry snow for characterization of snow surface is a complicated problem. This paper investigates the potential of optical and SAR imagery for identification of dry and wet snow in alpine regions by considering a synergistic multi-sensor framework. In this study, the wet snow is identified using Sentinel-1A and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and simultaneously the dry snow is determined using Landsat-8 multispectral data. The study is conducted around a glacier area in Sarsot near Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir, India.

AB  - Snow cover characterization and estimation of snow geophysical parameters is a significant area of research in water resource management and surface hydrological processes. With advances in spaceborne remote sensing, much progress has been achieved in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of snow geophysical parameters. However, most of the methods available in the literature are based on the microwave backscatter response of snow. These methods are mostly based on the remote sensing data available from active microwave sensors. Moreover, in alpine terrains, such as in the Himalayas, due to the geometrical distortions, the missing data is significant in the active microwave remote sensing data. In this paper, we present a methodology utilizing the multispectral observations of Sentinel-2 satellite for the estimation of surface snow wetness. The proposed approach is based on the popular triangle method which is significantly utilized for the assessment of soil moisture. In this case, we develop a triangular feature space using the near infrared (NIR) reflectance and the normalized differenced snow index (NDSI). Based on the assumption that the NIR reflectance is linearly related to the liquid water content in the snow, we derive a physical relationship for the estimation of snow wetness. The modeled estimates of snow wetness from the proposed approach were compared with in-situ measurements of surface snow wetness. A high correlation determined by the coefficient of determination of 0.94 and an error of 0.535 was observed between the proposed estimates of snow wetness and in-situ measurements.

AB  - In this paper, we propose automatic road extraction using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based Remote Sensing data. Road extraction using UAV data is very useful in traffic management, city planning, GPS based applications, etc. Deep learning techniques namely, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to extract roads from a UAV dataset available in the literature. FCN performs semantic segmentation on the image whereas the GAN generates output images from the model it learns. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the deep learning methods for the task of road extraction.

AB  - Change detection is important to understand the patterns of transition in multi-temporal SAR acquisitions over same geographical areas. In this work, we implemented a test statistic on covariance matrices for change detection. The RADARSAT-2 data spanning the agricultural land of Central Hisar Farm in Haryana, India was used. Hypothesis testing on test-statistic was done by a pre-decided significance level. A change map was plotted and the areas with 'change' and 'no change' were determined. Analysis of changing trends of different crop lifecycles is done. This study is useful in making important agricultural crop predictions.

AB  - MARINE-EO is a Research and Development project using a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) mechanism with the scope to develop innovative beyond the state-of-the-art downstream applications which meet the demand of maritime authorities and stakeholders, leveraging on the existing services and other products from the Copernicus portfolio. More specifically, MARINE-EO aims to meet the procurers' demands in the thematic areas of Marine monitoring and Maritime security. In this study we present the consultation three-step-procedure, which was designed and launched in order to define the services to be procured and developed within MARINE-EO project, with focus on the set of features addressing Marine monitoring (called SATOCEAN). These features deal with information on ocean parameters' variability in time and space, best probable fishing areas, fish farm locations, water quality and sea ice extent for safe navigation and maritime operations. The EO-based services, mainly related to satellites and Copernicus Sentinel missions, aim to be established in the areas of Mediterranean, Atlantic and Arctic, by adapting Copernicus data and information on the marine environment. Upon the completion of this consultation procedure, three SATOCEAN feature services and use-case scenarios were finally proposed to be procured and developed: i) Marine environmental status in hot spots (in Gulfs and Marine Protected Areas),ii) Detection of fish farms threats (in aquaculture sites), and iii) Detection of vessels and icebergs in the Arctic Sea.

AB  - The study of NDVI variations and phenology dates of Eastern Siberia vegetation on NOAA satellite data (1982-2017) is carried out. Trend maps of seasonal NDVI (May-September) and maps of correlations NDVI with air temperature and precipitation were constructed. Area with the highest NDVI linear trend (10 - 15%) is located in the northern part of Yakutia. The increasing of NDVI seasonal trend is mainly due to significant increase of NDVI in May. Correlation between NDVI (in May) in the test site and air temperature is R=0.8. While the relationship between NDVI and precipitation is negligible. For 1982-2004 NDVI trend had near-zero values, but during 2004-2015 NDVI trend showed a significant increase about similar to 27%. The significant increase of air temperature (similar to 3 degrees C) during 2004-2015 is also observed in test site. Method "NDVI 0.3"(1) based on NDVI threshold 0.3 was used to calculated the start and end of vegetation season in test site. In addition, BISE2 algorithm was used to reducing noise in daily NDVI time-series. Analysis of phenology variations during 1982-2017 showed: the SOS shifted by similar to 12 days earlier and EOS by similar to 4 days later. Thus, the growing season has increased. The average trend of growing season length is similar to 16 days. For same time, the mean values NDVI of growing season increased by similar to 10% and mean values NDVI of July by similar to 17%.

T2  - PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - The theme of the relationship with his native land presents the dominant trait of Rachmaninoff's worldview. His last composition for solo piano, the "Variations on a Theme of Corelli" opus 42 (1931) was composed at the time of his emigration after a decade of creative silence. Having been forever separated from Russia by the revolution, the composer in his Variations narrates about the fate of his beloved native land in the 20th century, about the force of the "Russian rebellion, senseless and merciless." While not forsaking his previous romantic ideals in the sphere of feeling and lyrical melody, Rachmaninoff nonetheless discloses here an indisputable commitment to 20th century art as well. The composition may be discerned for its stern ascetic color and a special significance of each sound, along with a neoclassical piano texture. The concept of the "dreams about Russia" is rationalized by the author by means of the method of conceptual integration: it is founded on associative thinking, a scenario, and a theatrical approach on the part of the pianist towards the musical text. The basis of the concept is presented by an abundance of stable semantical signs of the musical text, as well as its intertextual connections. The foundation of the group-division of the cycle as a dramatic whole is presented by various transformations of the basic theme - a folia. The concept is aided by the saturation of images of combined art forms and an active usage of rhetorical devices in the composition.

TI  - Tornado statistics in Ukraine based on new data
T2  - GEOFIZICHESKIY ZHURNAL-GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tornadoes are dangerous and difficult to forecast atmospheric phenomenon that may cause high economic and social losses. Therefore in the USA and Europe tornado receive more attention and tornadoes observation systems are actively expanding and improving. In the present paper, based on the new data of seven severe weather catalogs of Europe and former USSR a merged catalog was created containing 6298 tornado sighting records. On this basis the geographical distribution of recorded tornadoes of all types and intensities in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Hungary and other European countries near Ukraine in 1119-2017 within 21-65 degrees E and 44-71 degrees N was mapped. The tornado geographic distribution in continental and moderate continental climate areas was shown to be approximately homogeneous and correlating with population density in the territories under consideration. A conclusion that in the low populated regions of Ukraine 90-95 % of destructive tornadoes with intensity EF1 and above remain unreported and are not included in the catalogs was obtained. This conclusion was confirmed by Earth remote sensing data, therefore the real quantity of tornadoes in Ukraine should be approximately 10-20 times higher than the amount of events reported in the catalogs. Based on analysis of the merged catalog it was shown that catastrophic tornadoes with EF4-EF5 intensity may also emerge in Ukrainian territory. The geographic distribution of tornado emerging probability in Ukrainian territory was mapped. The probability of powerful destructive tornadoes with intensity EF1 and higher registration was also shown to be approximately homogeneous in all the territory of Ukraine. Based on geographic distribution of tornado observation frequency in Ukraine the average rate of tornado reporting in Ukraine was estimated to be 20.6 tornadoes per square degree per century, and for destructive tornadoes of EF1 intensity and higher, this frequency estimate is 4.3.

TI  - CHRISTIAN IDEOLOGY AS A SOURCE OF TRANSFORMATION OF THE PENAL SYSTEM IN BRITAIN IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the problem of reconsidering penalties in the theological doctrines of English Protestantism in the early phase of the penal reform in Great Britain. The period of the Enlightenment led to radical changes in the system of criminal justice. This time is considered to be the origin of the "era of punitive restraint": gradual legislative restriction of sanctions in the form of the death penalty led to qualitative changes in the entire system of criminal penalties in general. The increasing crime rate, which plagued the eighteenth-century England, was often referred to by the penal reformers and gave rise to an abundance of religious projects of imprisonment. The authors are convinced that socially active adepts of various sects of English Protestantism extrapolated their religious views on the system of penalties execution; this laid the humanist foundation of the prison reform in Great Britain and in the continental Europe. English Protestants proposed to consider punishment as a method of rehabilitation of the convict in solitary confinement. Religious principles of the Quakers (the Religious Society of Friends) were expressed in the model of a penitentiary house. According to their theology, the prison became the place and environment where the prisoner was able to establish an incredible connection with the Lord, repent and get atonement. The outcome of this theology was the hope that God would allow the prisoner to break out of prison as a "reborn person". In turn, Calvinist Protestants resisted the attempts of humanization of the system of penalties execution, considering them as a challenge to predestination. The authors underline that the majority of the conservative wing of the religious penal reformers strongly doubted the feasibility of repentance and relied on God's commandments and the Bloody Code of the 18th century to restrain crime. It is suggested that the Christian worldview of the British influenced the early penitentiary reforms in Great Britain in the eighteenth century more than the secular ideology of the Enlightenment. The methodological basis of analyzing the sources of the eighteenth century was the principles of the "new social and cultural history". It allowed to rethink the genesis of English penitentiary reforms in a specific historical socio-cultural context.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX

AB  - In the present paper, the actual evapotranspiration for the territory of Bulgaria on an annual basis for the period 2000-2014 has been modeled, using satellite data MOD16A3. The data was received by means of remote sensing from a MODIS sensor. Raw evapotranspiration (ET) data were integrated and processed in GIS environment in order to obtain the final goal of finding 2D distribution of the qualitative values of the actual evapotranspiration (AET) for the territory of Bulgaria. In order to generate the relevant values for the annual AET in the area, a model was developed using the MOD16A3 evapotranspiration dataset. In the present paper, the actual evapotranspiration was estimated as a function of the land cover and a digital elevation model. The results obtained show the relationship between the actual evapotranspiration, the land cover and a DEM. In the process of research, some trends for the annual quantity of AET were estimated. The model for the quantitative area estimation of the evapotranspiration developed in the study has already been applied to the catchment area of Lefedzha River (located in northern Bulgaria). It was established that the satellite data give a more representative and reliable information on the spatial distribution of the AET on a regional scale. These methods have less human interference in obtaining information about the individual physical parameters on which the process of evaporation depends. In the MOD16 product the temperature of the spreading surface that influences the evaporation processes was recorded.

TI  - Airborne Laser Scanning Outperforms the Alternative 3D Techniques in Capturing Variation in Tree Height and Forest Density in Southern Boreal Forests
T2  - BALTIC FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to better understand the relationship between forest structure and point cloud features generated from certain airborne and space borne sensors. Point cloud features derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS), aerial imagery (AI), WorldView-2 imagery (WV2), TerraSAR-X, and Tandem-X (TDX) data were classified as features characterizing forest height and density as well as variation in tree height. Correlations between these features and field-measured attributes describing forest height, density and tree height variation were investigated at plot scale. From the field-measured attributes, basal area (G) and the number of trees per unit area (N) were used as forest density indicators whereas maximum tree height (H-max) and standard deviation in tree height (H-std) were used as indicators for forest height and tree height variation, respectively. In the analyses, field observations from 91 sample plots (32 m x 32 m) located in southern Finland were used. Even though ALS was found to be the most accurate data source in characterizing forest structure, AI, WV2, and TDX were also capable of characterizing forest height at plot scale with correlation coefficients stronger than 0.85. However, ALS was the only data source capable of providing separate features for characterizing also the variation in tree height and forest density. Features related to forest height, generated from the other data sources besides ALS, also provided strongest correlation with the forest density attributes and variation in tree height, in addition to H-max. Due to these more diverse characterization capabilities, forest structural attributes can be predicted more accurately by using ALS, also in the areas where the relation between the attributes of interest is not solely dependent on forest height, compared to the other investigated 3D remote sensing data sources.

T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimated the recent evolution of three glacierized stratovolcanoes - namely Volcan Iztaccihuatl, Volcan Popocatepetl and Volcan Citlaltepetl - in South-central Mexico using Landsat and Sentinel-2A satellite data acquired between 1973 and 2017. These three glaciers are influenced by various factors such as climate change, volcanic eruption and pollution. Three key climate variables, which control the presence of glacier coverage - air temperature, precipitation and humidity - were also analysed. Among these three volcanoes, only Volcan Iztaccihuatl and Volcan Citlaltepetl have ice-covered areas since the late 1990s and Volcan Popocatepetl has lost its glaciers due to volcanic eruption, even though the glacier shrinkage has started long before the appearance of eruptive products. An overall glacier area loss of 75% has been observed for the period between 1973 and 2017. Shrinkage of Volcan Citlaltepetl (66%) is comparable with the retreat observed in the tropical Andes of Peru and Bolivia during the same period. Observed trends in the air temperature were not very significant for all the three glaciers studied whereas a substantial rise in relative humidity (+0.11%/year) was observed. Trends in precipitation were different for Citlaltepetl (+7.8mm/year) and the other two volcano-glaciers (-5.1mm/year).

AB  - Landscape analysis characterizes ecological structure and functioning to propose mitigation strategies for addressing environmental problems. The objective was to analyze the spatial configuration of landscape elements in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve (LTBR), from 1995, 2006 and 2016 LANDSAT images. These were rectified and classified according to the land cover and use types; each one was analyzed with landscape metrics using FRAGSTATS 3.3 software. For 2016, 60% of the landscape corresponds to an agricultural profile, with 95% aggregation and a matrix density of 0.9; acahual (fallow land) constitutes 77.62% of the landscape and is composed of 6 242 fragments, with dispersed and disaggregated cover, with a density of 4.05; rainforest/cloud forest (CF) accounts for 27% of the landscape with 2 141 fragments, 94.9% aggregation and a matrix density of 1.38. The rainforest/CF is the cover with the highest connectivity index, so actions must be taken to conserve these areas and even increase them, while the acahuales are in processes of ecological succession and those that are transitioning to rainforest must be identified, to channel these properties as private conservation areas. The LTBR is increasing the rainforest/CF, acahual and mangrove cover and diminishing the agricultural matrix, which leads to the conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - This paper addresses the performance of time-frequency based techniques for the detection of small ships (length less than 30m) under side-looking synthetic aperture radar (SAR) limiting conditions. The aim of this work is to assess this technique for improving TerraSAR-X (TS-X) near real time (NRT) ship detection service. The goals are achieved by processing both the co-polarized single look complex channels (HH and VV) of TS-X data where ships have been identified by their self-reporting messaging system. The results show that the target-to-clutter ratio does not improve significantly for the detection of small ships under the conditions investigated.

TI  - Past medical history: A comparison between children at the point of entry into the care system and children at home
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD CUSTODY
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a one-center, case-controlled study to determine which medical disorders portend entry into out-of-home care. A total of 137 children aged 4 to 14 in local authority care and 126 controls (at home children) matched by health area, age, and sex were studied. The pediatric Primary Care registry was reviewed for the period from May to September 2017. Compared with children at home, those at entry into the care system were significantly more likely to: experience a poisoning; present with bruising; and suffer from tooth decay, psychiatric, or neurological conditions. Conversely, they were significantly less likely to suffer from asthma, abdominal pain, insect stings, or limb injuries. Analysis of medical history helped to identify children at risk of out-of-home placement.

TI  - <i>Sentinel Amenable Mortality</i>: A New Way to Assess the Quality of Healthcare by Examining Causes of Premature Death for Which Highly Efficacious Medical Interventions Are Available
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. Amenable mortality, or premature deaths that could be prevented with medical care, is a proven indicator for assessing healthcare quality when adapted to a country or region's specific healthcare context. This concept is currently used to evaluate the performance of national and international healthcare systems. However, the levels of efficacy and effectiveness determined using this indicator can vary greatly depending on the causes of death that are included. We introduce a new approach by identifying a subgroup of causes for which there are available treatments with a high level of efficacy. These causes should be considered sentinel events to help identify limitations in the effectiveness and quality of health provision. Methods. We conducted an extensive literature review using a list of amenable causes of death compiled by Spanish researchers. We complemented this approach by assessing the time trends of amenable mortality in two high-income countries that have a similar quality of healthcare but very different systems of provision, namely, Spain and the United States. This enabled us to identify different levels of efficacy of medical interventions ( high, medium, and low). We consulted a group of medical experts and combined this information to help make the final classification of sentinel amenable causes of death. Results. Sentinel amenable mortality includes causes such as surgical conditions, thyroid diseases, and asthma. The remaining amenable causes of death either have a higher complexity in terms of the disease or need more effective medical interventions or preventative measures to guarantee early detection and adherence to treatment. These included cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, all amenable cancers, and some infectious diseases such as pneumonia, influenza, and tuberculosis. Conclusions. Sentinel amenable mortality could act as a good sentinel indicator to identify major deficiencies in healthcare quality and provision and detect inequalities across populations.

TI  - Non-visualized sentinel nodes in breast cancer patients; prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence and consensus is lacking in international guidelines regarding axillary treatment recommendations for patients in whom a sentinel lymph node (SLN) cannot be visualized (non-vSLN) during the sentinel node procedure. In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence of non-vSLNs in a Dutch population of breast cancer patients and to examine predictors and survival rate for non-vSLN.A nationwide, retrospective, population-based study was performed including 116,920 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent a SLN procedure in the Netherlands between January 2005 and December 2013.Of the 76,472 clinically negative patients who underwent a SLN procedure, 1924 patients (2.5%) had a non-vSLN, of whom 1552 (80.7%) underwent an ALND. Multivariate analysis showed predictive factors for non-vSLN: older age (p < 0.001), diagnosis in the period 2005-2009 (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p = 0.003), and extensive nodal involvement (p < 0.001). Multivariate survival analysis showed a significantly worse survival (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.34, p = 0.015) for non-vSLNs patients. However, in the non-vSLN group, an ALND was not statistically significantly associated with a better survival (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.53-1.75, p = 0.891).Patients with non-vSLNs had less favorable disease characteristics and a worse survival compared to patients with a visualized SLN. Performing an ALND was not associated with a significantly better survival in patients with non-vSLNs. However, further research on the necessity of axillary treatment in this specific patient group is required.

TI  - Hyperspectral radiative transfer modeling to explore the combined retrieval of biophysical parameters and canopy fluorescence from FLEX - Sentinel-3 tandem mission multi-sensor data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The FLuorescence EXpiorer (FLEX) satellite mission, selected as ESA's 8th Earth Explorer, has been designed for the measurement of sun-induced fluorescence (F) spectra emitted by plants. This will be accomplished through a multi-sensor approach by placing it in a common orbit in tandem with the Sentinel-3 (S3) mission, which will have two optical sensors on board, OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) to complement FLEX. These S3 instruments will be used in combination with the imaging spectrometers on board FLEX to provide data useful for atmospheric correction of FLEX data. However, a fully synergetic approach, i.e. by exploiting the spectral and directional information from all tandem mission instruments together, is an attractive alternative which is explored in this paper. By employing all combined top of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data, one can (i) characterize the relevant optical properties of the atmosphere, (ii) retrieve biophysical canopy properties including the associated reflectance anisotropy, and (iii) retrieve a more accurate and consistent canopy F.Regarding retrieval methods, Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) and Spectral Fitting (SF) are well-known techniques applied to hyperspectral data. Both methods depend on a high spectral resolution and assume a Lambertian (isotropic) canopy reflectance. However, most vegetation canopies are non-Lambertian. This implies that, in particular when ignoring the anisotropic surface reflection, substantial retrieval errors can occur due to the interaction between atmospheric absorption bands and surface reflectance anisotropy. In this paper, a novel method based on spectral radiative transfer (RT) modeling is proposed, in which coupled RT models are used to simulate TOA radiance spectra. These are then matched with `measured' spectra in order to retrieve surface fluorescence, along with a suite of biophysical parameters, by model inversion through optimization. By applying coupled RT models of the soil-leaf-canopy and the surface-atmosphere systems, TOA radiance spectra can be simulated for all optical sensors of this tandem mission. In this way, complex effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and the spectral sampling by the various instruments, which are difficult to compensate for in the end products, are properly taken into account by their incorporation in the forward modeling. Next, by model inversion of TOA radiance data via optimization, the most accurate F retrievals can be achieved in a consistent manner, along with important canopy level biophysical parameters that may help interpret the F spectrum, such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI). The potential of this approach has been explored in a numerical experiment, and the results are presented in this paper. We find that, with the assumed well-characterized and plausible FLEX/S3 instrument performances, the simultaneous retrieval of biophysical canopy parameters and F spectra would be possible with a remarkable accuracy, provided the correct atmospheric characterization is available.

T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
CL  - Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Periodic forest fire in the Pine zone of Indian Himalayas has been portrayed as the great destroyer of forests. The coniferous forests in the Himalayan region, notably Pinus roxburghii stands are highly prone to fire. The lack of proper forest fire monitoring system in Pine zone is a major management issue needs attention for the long term viability. Hence the present study was attempted using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method to predict the potential areas under fire across the Pine zone and to identify key variables associated with fire occurrence. A total of n=529 spatiotemporally independent fire incidence locations were used after auto-correlation testing. Bioclimatic environmental variables were used along with other anthropogenic, topographic, Forest type/canopy density variables. Spatial multi-collinearity of variables was tested where the variables with r > 0.7 were dropped from the analysis. The accuracy of the model was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and to assess the variables importance jackknife procedure was adopted. Hence, 100 model predictions were averaged to produce a probability map. The map was classified into four categories based on the probability value viz., Very highly, highly, moderately and least susceptible to fire. The results showed that the forest areas having moderate canopy density and near to village is highly affected by fire. The areas identified as very highly and highly susceptible to fire can be used for preparatory planning for management of forest fire in Pine Zone of Uttarakhand Himalayas.

AB  - For the detection of the sea ice SAR algorithm has been utilized in order to avoid any damage to ship. This will identify whether there is any obstruction in the way of ice or not so that ship does not strike with ice. The desired results are obtained when SAR algorithm is connected on RADAR1 imagery data. They also studied the algorithm for the segmentation of ice known as pixel based segmentation which helps to differentiate ice based on its properties. Large number of methods has been utilized for multi temporal segmentation from the MODIS data which is known as TempoSeg strategy for multiyear sea ice. Synthetic Aperture Radar utilized the RADARSAT1 imagery data in order to detect the ice of sea at different regions of the seas. With the help of R1 imagery data better outcomes are provided by the automated algorithm. In present work, the automated SAR algorithm is required to execute in order to detect sea ice.

TI  - Cloud fraction retrieval using data from Indian geostationary satellites and validation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud fraction (CF) is known as the dominant modulator of Earth's radiation budget, thus regarded as Essential Climate Variable. CF is retrieved using Indian geostationary satellites Kalpana-1 and Indian National Satellite System (INSAT-3D) by calculating the fraction of area covered by the clouds in a given pixel divided by the total area of the pixel. The technique uses multi-channel thresholding for three channels in Kalpana-1, that is, thermal, visible, and water vapour, and four channels in INSAT-3D with mid-infrared channel in addition to the three mentioned for Kalpana-1. A 2-year record of CF at 30-min intervals was generated for the Indian region using the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3D data. The retrieved CF data were compared against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) CF product in the near vicinity of simultaneous data availability (i.e., within +/- 15 min interval). This product agrees with MODIS (correlation coefficient 80%) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.30, inspite of +/- 15 min of time difference between both the satellites. In addition, ground-based Total Sky Imager (TSI-440) retrieved data over Pune is used to validate the satellite retrieved CF over the same region. The probability of detection between retrieved CF and ground-based data is relatively more for range of CF between 0.00 and 0.25, that is, 90% and more than 20% for CF greater than 0.50. In view of the close agreement between retrieved CF from Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3D with MODIS and TSI-440, this product is operational and is being made available through National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies portal for use in better understanding of climate.

TI  - What is Urban Sprawl in Flanders?
T2  - EXPANDING CITIES - DIMINISHING SPACE: ARE SMART CITIES THE SOLUTION OR PART OF THE PROBLEM OF CONTINUOUS URBANISATION AROUND THE GLOBE? (REAL CORP 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 23rd International Conference on Urban and Regional Development and Spatial Planning in the Information Society (REAL CORP)
CL  - Vienna Univ Technol, Campus Gusshaus, Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - At the country level, Belgium was found to be the European country with the highest degree of urban sprawl (EEA report on Urban sprawl in Europe, 2016). The phenomenon is most pronounced in Flanders, the highly populated northern part of the country. No less than 32.6% of its territory is taken in by settlement area, and, its landscapes are highly fragmented by ribbon and scattered development. An increase of ribbon development in Flanders from 3612 km in 1989 up to 4155 km in 2012 was calculated by Verbeek et al. (2014). This means an increase of 15% over 23 years. Given this urban fragmentation of the landscape, concerns and discussions rise about the pros and cons of this development and strategies to mitigate or stop urban sprawl.Urban sprawl can refer to both a state (level of sprawl at a certain point in time) and a process (evolution of the level of sprawl in time). To gain better insights in the state of urban sprawl, detailed data of high quality are necessary. Several measures have been used in the literature to quantify (different aspects of) urban sprawl. Depending on the measure, but also on the type of input data used, different results can be obtained which in turn can lead to completely different interpretations and conclusions regarding the level of urban sprawl in Flanders. In this paper we analyse the effect of alternative input data on the outcome of the quantitative sprawl measure "WUP" (weighted urban proliferation) (EEA, 2016). Using sealed surfaces as an input to calculate WUP leads overall to an underestimation of the space taken in by urban settlements, hence of the importance of urban sprawl. Using the total settlement area of Flanders (including sealed surfaces, but also gardens, parks, etc.) leads to a much better representation of the phenomenon of urban sprawl.The process of urban sprawl in Flanders is analysed by means of a temporal analysis using Landsat images of 1976, 1988 and 2000. The images are processed into urban settlement maps and urban sprawl is measured by means of WUP for the different time steps. Difference maps show the temporal and spatial dynamics of urban sprawl throughout the region.Finally, in order to make measures of urban sprawl, and hence the phenomenon itself, easier to interpret and understand for a wider public, and, to answer the question "What is urban sprawl and where is it affecting Flanders?", the WUP-maps are translated into an urban sprawl typology map with characterizing examples and typical spatial configurations for each type. These will be used to stimulate the public awareness and debate with respect to sprawl and the generally devastating effects that it has on the Flemish landscapes.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality monitoring through remote sensing with UAVs is best conducted using multispectral sensors; however, these sensors are expensive. We aimed to predict multispectral bands from a low-cost sensor (R, G, B bands) using artificial neural networks (ANN). We studied a lake located on the campus of Unisinos University, Brazil, using a low-cost sensor mounted on a UAV. Simultaneously, we collected water samples during the UAV flight to determine total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved organic matter (DOM). We correlated the three bands predicted with TSS and DOM. The results show that the ANN validation process predicted the three bands of the multispectral sensor using the three bands of the low-cost sensor with a low average error of 19%. The correlations with TSS and DOM resulted in R-2 values of greater than 0.60, consistent with literature values.

AB  - Maritime situational awareness can be enhanced using imagery provided by low earth orbit (LEO) satellites which have the capability to regularly monitor coastal zones. Successful ship detection relies on both payload imaging performance and smart onboard data processing techniques. In this study, a multistage ship detection algorithm is proposed, where the spectral, spatial and geometric properties of suspected ships are exploited for effective maritime target mapping. Multispectral images produced by the Landsat OLI and the Sentinel 2 MSI sensors of four locations were used in this study and they present a variety of scenarios that a ship detection algorithm could face. We observed that the NIR and SWIR bands produced a higher number of correctly detected ships when compared to the visible spectral bands and that the spatial resolution had a more significant impact than spectral resolution on true target detection levels.

TI  - Optimal extent of completion lymphadenectomy for patients with melanoma and a positive sentinel node in the groin
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The optimal extent of groin completion lymph node dissection (CLND) (inguinal or ilioinguinal dissection) in patients with melanoma is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the extent of groin CLND after a positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is associated with improved outcome.Methods: Data from all sentinel node-positive patients who underwent groin CLND at four tertiary melanoma referral centres were retrieved retrospectively. Baseline patient and tumour characteristics were collected for descriptive statistics, survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.Results: In total, 255 patients were included, of whom 137 (537 per cent) underwent inguinal dissection and 118 (463 per cent) ilioinguinal dissection. The overall CLND positivity rate was 188 per cent; the inguinal positivity rate was 155 per cent and the pelvic positivity rate was 93 per cent. The pattern of recurrence, and 5-year melanoma-specific survival, disease-free survival and distant-metastasis free survival rates were similar for both dissection types, even for patients with a positive CLND result. Cox regression analysis showed that type of CLND was not associated with disease-free or melanoma-specific survival.Conclusion: There was no significant difference in recurrence pattern and survival rates between patients undergoing inguinal or ilioinguinal dissection after a positive SNB, even after stratification for a positive CLND result. An inguinal dissection is a safe first approach as CLND in patients with a positive SNB.

TI  - Historical carbon fluxes in the expanding deforestation frontier of Southern Brazilian Amazonia (1985-2012)
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical areas, pioneer occupation fronts steer the rapid expansion of deforestation, contributing to carbon emissions. Up-to-date carbon emission estimates covering the long-term development of such frontiers depend on the availability of high spatial-temporal resolution data. In this paper, we provide a detailed assessment of carbon losses from deforestation and potential forest degradation from fragmentation for one expanding frontier in the Brazilian Amazon. We focused on one of the Amazonia's hot-spots of forest loss, the BR-163 highway that connects the high productivity agricultural landscapes in Mato Grosso with the exporting harbors of the Amazon. We used multi-decadal (1984-2012) Landsat-based time series on forested and non-forested area in combination with a carbon book-keeping model. We show a 36% reduction in 1984s biomass carbon stocks, which led to the emission of 611.5 TgCO(2) between 1985 and 1998 (43.6 TgCO(2) year(-1)) and 959.8 TgCO(2) over 1999-2012 (68.5 TgCO(2) year(-1)). Overall, fragmentation-related carbon losses represented 1.88% of total emissions by 2012, with an increasing relevance since 2004. We compared the Brazilian Space Agency deforestation assessment (PRODES) with our data and found that small deforestation polygons not captured by PRODES had increasing importance on estimated deforestation carbon losses since 2000. The comparative analysis improved the understanding of data-source-related uncertainties on carbon estimates and indicated disagreement areas between datasets that could be subject of future research. Furthermore, spatially explicit, annual deforestation and emission estimates like the ones derived from this study are important for setting regional baselines for REDD+ or similar payment for ecosystem services frameworks.

TI  - THE INTERPRETATION OF IMAGE-MAP AS A PROPOSAL FOR TEACHING-LEARNING OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL
T2  - GEOSABERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Faced with the popularization of geotechnologies, it becomes necessary pedagogical actions that explore their potentials in basic education, given that these tools provide support to the teaching-learning process. In this perspective, this article approaches the image-map as didactic material worked in the discipline of Geography in a school in the city of Sobral - CE. For this purpose, the Landsat 8 satellite image was used, which was manipulated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) manager QGIS 2.8. Thus, it prepared a low-cost product, updated and adapted to the school context. As conclusions, it is noticed that the students have more contact with the geotechnologies outside the classroom, thus revealing the little use of these materials in the school. It was also verified that the content approach helps them in understanding about such resources and that the interpretation of the picture card has contributed to the learning of their geographical space.

TI  - The Lifecycle of Semidiurnal Internal Tides over the Northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The life cycle of semidiurnal internal tides over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) sector south of the Azores is investigated using in situ, a high-resolution mooring and microstructure profiler, and satellite data, in combination with a theoretical model of barotropic-to-baroclinic tidal energy conversion. The mooring analysis reveals that the internal tide horizontal energy flux is dominated by mode 1 and that energy density is more distributed among modes 1-10. Most modes are compatible with an interpretation in terms of standing internal tides, suggesting that they result from interactions between waves generated over the MAR. Internal tide energy is thus concentrated above the ridge and is eventually available for local diapycnal mixing, as endorsed by the elevated rates of turbulent energy dissipation epsilon estimated from microstructure measurements. A spring-neap modulation of energy density on the MAR is found to originate from the remote generation and radiation of strong mode-1 internal tides from the Atlantis-Meteor Seamount Complex. Similar fortnightly variability of a factor of 2 is observed in epsilon, but this signal's origin cannot be determined unambiguously. A regional tidal energy budget highlights the significance of high-mode generation, with 81% of the energy lost by the barotropic tide being converted into modes >1 and only 9% into mode 1. This has important implications for the fraction (q) of local dissipation to the total energy conversion, which is regionally estimated to be similar to 0.5. This result is in stark contrast with the Hawaiian Ridge system, where the radiation of mode-1 internal tides accounts for 30% of the regional energy conversion, and q<0.25.

AB  - End-to-end mission performance simulators (E2ES) are suitable tools to accelerate satellite mission development from concet to deployment. One core element of these E2ES is the generation of synthetic scenes that are observed by the various instruments of an Earth Observation mission. The generation of these scenes rely on Radiative Transfer Models (RTM) for the simulation of light interaction with the Earth surface and atmosphere. However, the execution of advanced RTMs is impractical due to their large computation burden. Classical interpolation and statistical emulation methods of pre-computed Look-Up Tables (LUT) are therefore common practice to generate synthetic scenes in a reasonable time. This work evaluates the accuracy and computation cost of interpolation and emulation methods to sample the input LUT variable space. The results on MONDTRAN-based top-of-atmosphere radiance data show that Gaussian Process emulators produced more accurate output spectra than linear interpolation at a fraction of its time. It is concluded that emulation can function as a fast and more accurate alternative to interpolation for LUT parameter space sampling.

AB  - ESA's FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission aims at mapping Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy to quantify photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. Due to the complexity of the mission concept and stringent requirements for the data processing algorithms, ESA developed a Phase A/B1 End-to-End Mission Performance Simulator (E2ES) tool to reproduce the expected mission performance and check the mission and instrument concepts. In the current Phase C/D, the E2ES concept must evolve to consolidate the whole data processing chain, providing an accurate figures of the whole mission error budget and serving as a roadmap for the future development of FLEX Ground Segment. This paper gives an overview of the activities involving the FLEX E2ES, from the conceptual development phase (Phase A/B1) to the implementation of the Ground Segment and operations (Phase C/D). Particularly, we will focus on the high-level description of the Level-2 data processing chain from an architecture and software design point of view.

AB  - InSAR coherence is a promising parameter for land-cover classification and mapping. The ESA SEOM SInCohMap project is devised to test and analyze multi-temporal InSAR coherence potentialities exploiting dense multitemporal data from the Sentinel1 constellation. In the framework of the project, this paper shows the first classification results using machine learning algorithms over a two-year period of InSAR coherence data. The evaluation is performed on the test site of Donana (Seville, Southwestern Spain), mainly an agricultural area where different land covers can be identified. Classification results exploiting InSAR coherence shows accuracies around 80 % for this site.

AB  - The integration of medical imaging technologies into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can provide a preoperative insight into both anatomical (e.g. using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound), as well as functional aspects (e.g. using single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, lymphoscintigraphy, or optical imaging). Moreover, some imaging modalities are also used in an interventional setting (e.g. computed tomography, ultrasound, gamma or optical imaging) where they provide the surgeon with real-time information during the procedure.Various tools and approaches for image-guided navigation in cancer surgery are becoming feasible today. With the development of new tracers and portable imaging devices, these advances will reinforce the role of interventional molecular imaging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y SEMNIM.

TI  - The VIS/NIR Land and Snow BRDF Atlas for RTTOV: Comparison between MODIS MCD43C1 C5 and C6
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A monthly mean land and snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) atlas for visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum has been developed for Radiative Transfer for Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical sounder (TOVS) (RTTOV). The atlas follows the methodology of the RTTOV University of Wisconsin infrared land surface emissivity (UWIREMIS) atlas, i.e., it combines satellite retrievals and a principal component analysis on a dataset of hyper-spectral surface hemispherical reflectance or albedo. The current version of the BRDF atlas is based on the Collection 5 of the Moderate Resolution Imaging (MODIS) MCD43C1 Climate Modeling Grid BRDF kernel-driven model parameters product. The MCD43C1 product combines both Terra and Aqua satellites over a 16-day period of acquisition and is provided globally at 0.05 degrees of spatial resolution. We have improved the RTTOV land surface BRDF atlas by using the last Collection 6 of MODIS product MCD43C1. We firstly found that the MODIS C6 product improved the quality index of the BRDF model as compared with that of C5. When compared with clear-sky top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance of Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imagers (SEVIRI) solar channels over snow-free land surfaces, we showed that the reflectances are simulated with an absolute accuracy of 3% to 5% (i.e., 0.03-0.05 in reflectance units) when either the satellite zenith angle or the solar zenith angle is below 70 degrees, regardless of the MODIS collection. For snow-covered surfaces, we showed that the comparison with in situ snow spectral albedo is improved with C6 with an underestimation of 0.05 in the near infrared.

AB  - The extent of seagrasses in Cockburn Sound was examined using Nearmap images of year 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 to be compared to the last assessment in 1999. It was identified that the seagrass coverage has increased by 231 Ha since 1999, with most of the growth occurred in the southern part. While the water quality in Cockburn Sound has improved, it is believed that there are other pressures affecting the slow growth rate of the seagrasses. Seagrass biomass was also evaluated using Landsat images of year 1994, 1999, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 in addition to a field survey data of leaf biomass in 2016. Despite its increasing extent, seagrass in Cockburn Sound indicated a declining biomass since 1994, which is believed due to the changing nutrient content.

AB  - The knowledge of the energy balance is critical to the understanding the urban thermal behavior. Advances in quantitative remote sensing showed that the energy fluxes can be retrieved from imagery data. However, every product generated from remote sensing must be validated. In this context, this study retrieved the fluxes from the energy balance and validated them with in-situ data. The fluxes were based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat-8 images, for comparison with a micrometeorological station located in the Fundao Island-RJ. The Bowen ratio and eddy covariance methods were used to obtain the in-situ fluxes from the station data. The retrieved SEBAL fluxes were closer to the Bowen ratio than eddy covariance method. As energy fluxes present themselves as turbulent fluxes, much remains to understand their behavior and the accuracy of algorithms based on remote sensing data over urban surfaces. The work is a contribution to improve our knowledge about these surface fluxes in urban environments.

AB  - Despite multiple decades' worth of credible data confirming the extent of sustainability problems, OUT society has subsequently shown very limited progress with finding viable solutions on such critical subjects. Indeed, there is growing evidence of a general misunderstanding regarding the challenges related to the climate change issue. More specifically, we point to evidence outlining sustainable development (SD) and climate change as complex meta-problems. This explains why current global environmental policies are inefficient in addressing the causes of SD and climate change and why they fail to induce sustainable practices in consumers and organizations. In this paper, we argue that the primary obstacles businesses face in adopting proper sustainable practices are found in their neoclassical business worldview and in the increased competition levels resulting from internationalization and market deregulation. To counter these obstacles, we suggest solutions that have the potential to bring true SD. First, we believe the use of specific economic tools such as sovereign funds, green investments and ethical financial indexes, can have significant effects on neoclassical businesses in stewarding them towards sustainable practices. Finally, we call for increased interdisciplinary interactions between the scientific community, policymakers and business leaders in order to better manage meta-problems related to climate change.

AB  - Accurate information about the built-up area in a city or town is essential for urban planners for proper planning of urban infrastructure facilities and other basic amenities. The normalized difference indices available in literature for built-up area extraction are mostly based on moderate resolution images such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and enhanced TM (ETM+) and may not be applicable for high resolution images such as Sentinel-2A. In the present study, an attempt has been made to extract the built-up area from Sentinel-2A satellite data of Chennai, India using normalized difference index (NDI) with different band combinations. It was found that the built-up area was clearly distinguishable when the index value ranges between -0.29 and -0.09 in blue and near-infrared (NIR) band combination. Post extraction editing using Google satellite imagery was also attempted to improve the extraction results. The results showed an overall accuracy of 90% and Kappa value of 0.785. Same approach when applied for another area also yields good results with overall accuracy of 92% and Kappa value of 0.83. As the proposed approach is simple to understand, yields accurate results and requires only open source data, the same can be used for extracting the built-up area using Sentinel-2A and Google satellite imagery.

Combining the confidence intervals and prediction levels, the ground-based AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and precipitable water vapour (PWV) have been used to validate the MODIS, model AOD (550 nm), and PWV (cm) observations. The correlation coefficients (r) of AOD for the linear regression fits are 0.73, 0.75, and 0.79, and of PWV are 0.88, 0.89, and 0.97 for Terra, Aqua, and model simulations, respectively. Month-to-month/seasonal variation of AOD (550 nm) and PWV observations of satellite and model observations are also compared with AERONET observations. Additionally, various statistical metrics, including the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and root mean bias values were calculated using AERONET, satellite, and model simulations data. Furthermore, a frequency distribution of AOD (550 nm) and PWV observations are studied from AERONET, satellite, and model data. The study emphasizes that the globally distributed AERONET observations help to improve the satellite retrievals and model predictions to enrich our knowledge of aerosols and their impact on climate, the hydrological cycle, and air quality.

AB  - In this study, the capability of using Sentinel-1 satellite SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for land cover mapping in metropolitan areas is investigated. The dual-polarization (VV+VH) Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode image acquired on February 10th 2018 along descending orbit over Hyderabad city, India has been used. Data have been calibrated, terrain corrected, and filtered by a kernel using gamma filter method. For terrain correction a 30m resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) has been used. Radar data has been reduced to a spatial resolution of 20m. In general SAR images are well suited to detect urban areas thank to the strong signal responses by double-bounce scattering at the dihedral corner reflector between the ground and the building wall. Different combinations of VV and VH polarizations have been analyzed and the resulting classified images have been evaluated to assess the total classification accuracy. At the end it has been demonstrated that, combining dual-polarization Sentinal-1 data are suitable for producing accurate land cover maps in urban areas for metropolitan cities management purposes. This could represent a significant advantage in the case of regions frequently affected by clouds.

T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is a comprehensive, synergetic analysis of the phenomenon of "genius" in art. Methodology of the research is due to the multidisciplinary approach, which involves the use of general scientific methods of analysis, synthesis and synthesis of the phenomenon of "genius" in the context of understanding the synergetic models in psychoanalysis, ideology, pedagogy, philosophy with art; semiotic and anthropological approach to comprehension of synergetic models, allowed to consider the interconnection and transformation of the phenomenon of "genius" and its expression in art. The scientific novelty lies in a new perspective on the study of synergetic models of the phenomenon of "genius" as a polysymmetric definition in the aspect of anthropological measurement of art. The new is the comprehension of anthropological problems, tendencies, and aspirations to reveal the creative potential of the individual. Conclusions. The study of the phenomenon of "genius" in art led to the isolation of synergetic models associated with the understanding of the creative personality as a manifestation of a particular worldview, a way of interaction with reality, the ability to reveal, express and convey to the world. The conceptual orientation to solving a given problem is reduced to the assumption that mental non-standard, disturbance of equilibrium at any personal level is manifested in an artistic act, where genius is controlled insanity and the ability to express exits beyond the standard or fatigue actively.

AB  - This study aims to estimate wildfire occurrence in two representative Spanish regions with different territorial, social and environmental characteristics as well as fire history; Zamora and Madrid. Land-Use Land Cover (LULC) interfaces derived from ESA Climate Change Iniciative-Land Cover (CCI-LC) 2005 (covering 2003-2007 period at 300m resolution) were used as indirect indicator of socio-economic drivers associated with human-caused wildfire ignition sources. Three general interfaces were used; forest-agricultural interface (FAI), grassland-forest interface (GFI) and wildland urban interface (WUI), as well as other more specific ones derived from a disaggregated LULC legend. A set of biophysical variables including orientation, monthly precipitation, temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) as well as live fuel moisture content (FMC) were also considered in the model. Monthly precipitation and temperature were obtained from a regional climate dataset developed for the study sites by the University of Cantabria (Spain) at 1km(2) spatial resolution while FMC were calculated from MODIS images following Yebra et al. (2018) methodology. Orientation was obtained from the Digital Terrain Model at 25m available for Spain at the Spanish National Geographic Institute (CNIG).Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were used to obtain four sub-models to estimate wildfire occurrence in the two study regions during the 2000-2010 period. Two models included only LULC interfaces at two different disaggregation levels, and the other two models also included biophysical drivers. Results showed that disaggregated interfaces helped to improve the spatial characterization of probability of occurence. FAI was the LULC general interface that contributed the most to the models. Biophysical drivers had larger contribution to the models than the interfaces but the later still had importance explaining the spatial distribution of the fire occurrence probability. The accuracy of the models improved when biophysical variables were included achieving a sensitivity of and omission errors of 58% in Zamora and 6% and 90%, respectively in Madrid. The results for Madrid were less accurate mainly due to the small number of fire events to fit the models. Future works will deal with modeling in areas with small but of importance number of fires as in this last site. This study indicates that the human component of wildfires represented by LULC interfaces and its disaggregation can be integrated into wildfire occurrence estimation.

AB  - In this study an optical empirical algorithm was used to evaluate the robustness of some experimental processes to derive Satellite-Derived Bathymetric (SDB) models for shallow waters in the Minho river mouth, Caminha, Portugal. Multiple procedures to calibrate and modelling SDB calculation were tested. Regarding to these procedures, the following approaches were studied: i) Based on TOA and WL reflectance, a linear regression, as proposed by Stumpf et al. [3], and a quadratic regression to modelling the SDB algorithm were tested; (ii) several in situ data sets acquired at different epochs were used in order to investigate the dependency of the temporal and the spatial density of the calibration sample; (iii) The tidal level was considered in order to provide a tide height at the time of image acquisition to depth models calibration. Numerous SDB models from Sentinel-2 imagery were derived and compared with a reference hydrographic survey data. The results show that SDB models present a good level of reliability regardless of the acquisition date or source of the in situ datasets. Coefficients of determination (R-2) higher than 50% were obtained for the majority of the tested procedures. The quadratic modelling approach also appear to retrieve SDB models in agreement with hydrographic surveys data. In addition, the results demonstrate that the SDB information is influenced by the spatial density variation of the calibration datasets. Furthermore, the operational capabilities of the synergy of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to derive SDB information in shallow waters will be briefly discussed.

T2  - MAGALLANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We discuss the singular conception of nature embedded in the Mapuche culture, emphasizing the central role that the myth of origin plays in the Mapuche worldview. In particular, we reflect about the image of the serpent, filu, and its symbolic representation, by analogy, in the forms of related animals, especially in the perception of natural catastrophes and disequilibrium of the natural order. We remark on the importance of these symbolic links for the conception of several aspects of the physical, biological and cultural world of the Mapuche: be it the geologic-geographic domain; be it the denomination and classification of animals and plants, the mode of subsistence, the understanding of the source and treatment of diseases; be it the rituals, customs, and religiosity of the community. As an example of the inclusion of the myth of origin in traditional activities, we point out some symbolic features associated with the capture of lamprey, filoko in the Mapudungun language; in the same vein, we review the ethno-history around the term for worm, piru in Mapudungun, and its relationship to the etiology of human diseases. Finally, we underline the heuristic value of the symbolic space derived from the Mapuche knowledge of nature, considering (1) the reflexive domains of anthropology, history, sociology and natural science, (ii) the form of inhabiting the natural surroundings, and (iii) the interdisciplinary and inter-cultural education

AB  - The analysis of dynamical models for prediction and geosimulation using the information extracted from a geographical region processed from the data provided by multispectral remote sensing systems provides useful information for urban planning and resource management. However, several topics of interest on this particular matter are still to be properly studied. Using the remote sensing data that has been extracted from multispectral images from a particular geographic region in discrete time, its dynamic study is performed in both, spatial resolution and time evolution, in order to obtain the dynamical model of the physical variables and the evolutionary information about the data. This provides a background for understanding the future trends in development of the dynamics inherent in the multispectral and high-resolution images. This proposition is performed via an intelligent computational paradigm based on the use of dynamical filtering techniques modified to enhance the quality of reconstruction of the data extracted from multispectral remote sensing images and using high-performance computational techniques to unify the available data scheme with its dynamic analysis and, therefore, provide a behavioral model of the sensed data.

T2  - J-FOR-JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY FOR FOREST PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Food-borne pathogens are a huge food safety threat. The Canadian SENTINEL network was created to provide sustainable and practical solutions in the form of bioactive papers. One of these immobilizes bacteriophages on a paper surface to deactivate Escherichia coli bacteria. Because physical adsorption has its limits and chemical adsorption costs are prohibitive, this work aims to explore a biomimetic pathway using polydopamine (PDA) to improve phage attachment and activity at the paper surface. PDA is used to modify fibre surfaces, and its impact on physical and biological properties of paper is determined. The results show that PDA can be successfully deposited on the paper surface and that its presence on the cellulosic fibres strengthens the paper network. Biological measurements give encouraging outcomes on the influence of PDA to enhance paper bioactivity. This biomimetic treatment gave promising results and could be used as a platform for other kinds of modifications or biological agents.

TI  - Using high-resolution multitemporal imagery to highlight severe land management changes in Mediterranean vineyards
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean vineyards are subjected to drastic changes due to socio-economic, physical and environmental drivers. Whereas global trends affecting the evolution of Mediterranean land cover are well-known, their descriptions at a fine spatial scale, i.e., a plot level of several decametres, and over long time periods are still underexplored. This lack of exploration persists despite the increase in multitemporal imagery at fine resolutions. As scale and stakeholders are often correlated, we hypothesize that monitoring land cover at fine spatial and temporal scale would help understanding the local drivers shaping landscapes. To that end, we exploited a database of aerial pictures to obtain classified and vectorized land uses at the field level during the past five decades of a large watershed. The land uses were analyzed to detect changes at the field level considering the evolution of vineyard management. Changes in land management were synthesized in transition matrices expressing gains, losses and swaps for each land use category and illustrated using chord and Sankey diagrams. The results showed both a change in land management through a severe transformation of vineyards areas, from goblet to trellised vineyards, during the 1980s and a progressive evolution of land uses from vineyards to urban areas, arboriculture areas and arable lands. This transformation resulted from the local policies on vineyard replanting and the arrival of mechanization.

AB  - Land cover types classification and investigating the temporal changes are considered as the common application of remote sensing. Water body classification is one of the most basic classification tasks which analyze the occurrence of water on the earth surface. However, common remote sensing practices such as thresholding, spectral analysis, and statistical approaches alone are not sufficient to produce globally reliable water classification. Therefore, this research developed a formula which could effectively classify water in a global scale. Further improvements to the classification applied by developing an optimal threshold generation method, hill-shade, Volcanic Soil Mask (VSM) etc. The results are showing significant improvements compared to previous researches.

TI  - Influential factors analysis towards mangrove cover and production of demersal fish in Maumere Bay, Indonesia.
T2  - AACL Bioflux
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of mangrove ecosystems has been closely associated with the level of fishery production. This is primarily attributed to the role of mangrove as spawning grounds, feeding grounds and nursery grounds for fishery. The changing conditions of mangrove ecosystem in a given area is expected to impact the extent and quantity of fishery production in that area. The objective of this research study is to determine the influential factors towards the change of mangrove cover as well as the production of demersal fish in Maumere Bay of Sikka Regency of East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia, which makes it necessary to undertake the analysis using appropriate methods. Some methods used in this process are spatial analysis, statistical regression and analytical hierarchy process. The results of spatial analysis of the Landsat 5, Landsat ETM 7 and Landsat 8 to the mangrove ecosystems within the Maumere Bay of Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province of Indonesia over a 25-year period (year 1991-2016) signify the fluctuating changes, including the area of mangrove cover (hectare) and the classes of density of mangrove cover (low class, middle class, high class). Meanwhile, the analysis of statistical regression conducted on the area of mangrove cover and the classes of density of mangrove cover against the total production of demersal fish found a significant correlation. In addition, the data analyzed using Analytical Hierarchy Process suggests that the factors which have the strongest influence on the decline of mangrove cover and demersal fish production in Maumere Bay are the tsunami and the tectonic earthquake which occurred on December 12th 1992. On the other hand, there is another key determinant of increasing mangrove cover and demersal fish production in the Maumere Bay: natural environmental factor (without any pressure from human activities).

AB  - Mapping and quantifying lunar water ice addresses one of NASA's Strategic Knowledge Gaps to understand the lunar resource potential for future human exploration of the Moon. Lunar Flashlight is an innovative NASA CubeSat mission dedicated to mapping water ice in the permanently-shadowed and occasionally-sunlit regions in the vicinity of the lunar South Pole. Lunar Flashlight will acquire these measurements from lunar orbit using a multi-band laser reflectometer composed of an optical receiver aligned with four lasers emitting different wavelengths in the shortwave infrared spectral region between 1 mu m and 2 mu m. The receiver measures the laser radiance reflected from the lunar surface in each spectral band and continuum/absorption reflectance band ratios are then analyzed to quantify water ice concentration in the illuminated spot. The receiver utilizes a 70x70-mm, aluminum, off-axis paraboloidal mirror with a focal length of 70 mm, which collects the incoming light onto a single, 2 mm diameter InGaAs detector with a cutoff wavelength of 2.4 mu m. We present the optical and mechanical designs of the receiver, including its optimization for rejection of solar stray-light from outside its intended field of view. This highly mass- and volume-constrained instrument payload will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first instruments onboard a Cube Sat performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit and the first planetary mission to use multi-band active reflectometry from orbit.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes philosophical problems that arise in the works of one of the classics of the Yakut literature P.A. Oyunsky. His works consider people's perspective of the world, man and his fate, society, the truth, everlasting and implacable battle between the forces of Good and Evil and his views on these issues. As a result of the research, the author of the article concludes that according to P.A. Oyunsky, oral folk art is an inexhaustible source of folk wisdom. That is the reason his works are based on vivid images and representations of the Yakut heroic epic olonkho, legends and folk tales. Oyunsky considers problems of current, turbulent social events of the beginning of the 20th century and important worldview issues in the language of images making maximum use of figure of speech and oral folk art techniques of the Yakuts. The author of the article proceeds from the premise that the outstanding literary artists in a state of creative inspiration can find such holistic and deep artistic image, successful expression of what they have seen and perceived that the true and hidden meaning of which cannot always be fully understood. Therefore the author believes that the works of P.A. Oyunsky can be studied from the perspective of philosophical hermeneutics over and over again returning to his works and trying to gain a richer understanding of his works' meaning. It has been noted that philosophy has always been closely related to the fiction in domestic and foreign philosophical literature. This tradition has not been interrupted during the history of philosophy. The author of the article considers that many of the classics of Yakut literature also raised important philosophical issues. Nevertheless, studies devoted to the consideration of philosophical views in the works of P.A. Oyunsky are absent.

AB  - The study of agriculture and agricultural production is an important part of planning for allocation of resources and economic forecasting. The prediction of crop output requires collecting accurate crop data through-out the growing season, in locations with a wide range of climatic conditions. To ensure the accurate estimation for forecasting the harvests and crop insurance; the type of crop and area should be regularly measured all through the year. Moreover, crop classification by remote sensing data is becoming more important. With the help of Satellite image time series (SITS) and number of classification approaches there are more chances of efficient crop classification. This proposal intends to rectify some of the issues like crop similarity, salt and pepper noise that obtained in crop classification process.

TI  - Increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes with low invasive disease potential four years after switching to the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children 65 years (2004-2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Fusing a multispectral image with a co-registered higher resolution single panchromatic band, provided by any multi-resolution satellite systems, to rise the resolution of the former to that of the latter is known as pansharpening, and can be regarded as a guided super-resolution problem. Recently the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been extended to the pansharpening problem achieving state-of-the-art performance. Following this research line, the objective of this work was two-fold: provide a trained CNN model fitted to a specific sensor (WorldView-3) and explore a range of architectural configurations varied in both width and depth, seeking for the optimal one. Numerical and visual results show that the proposed solution compares favourably against reference methods.

TI  - Vision-Based Change Detection Using Comparative Morphology
T2  - COMPUTER VISION IN CONTROL SYSTEMS-3: AERIAL AND SATELLITE IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The chapter addresses the theoretical and practical aspects of the scene change detection problem with the use of computer vision techniques. It means detecting new or disappeared objects in images registered at different moments of time and possibly in various lighting, weather, and season conditions. In this chapter, we propose the new scheme of Comparative Morphology (CM) as a generalization of the Morphological Image Analysis (MIA) scheme originally proposed by Pyt'ev. The CMs are the mathematical shape theories, which solve the tasks of the image similarity estimation, image matching, and change detection by means of some special morphological models and tools. The original morphological change detection approach is based on the analysis of difference between the test image and its projection to the shape of reference image. In our generalized approach, the morphological filter-projector is substituted by the comparative morphological filter with weaker properties, which transforms the test image guided by the local shape of reference image. Following theoretical aspects are addressed in this chapter: the comparative morphology, change detection scheme based on morphological comparative filtering, diffusion morphology, and morphological filters based on guided contrasting. Following practical aspects are addressed: the pipeline for change detection in remote sensing data based on comparative morphology and implementation of change detection scheme based on both guided contrasting and diffusion morphology. The chapter also contains the results of qualitative and quantitative experiments on a wide set of real images including the public benchmark.

AB  - IntroductionAxillary node pathological status is one of the most important prognostic factors of breast cancer, but even replacing axillar dissection by sentinel lymphnode biopsy still has a 20% complication rate. Improving clinical examination by using the best imaging technique may substantially reduce invasivity and complications. This must be correlated to risk factors and site-related probability.MethodsThis presentation is an in-depth review and up-to-date study based on literature scientific papers and multicentric studies concerning the role axillary imaging techniques in breast cancer staging.The lymph node metastases' development favours ultrasound morphological depiction, but the vascularity study using ultrasound and MRI is of no less importance.DiscussionsUltrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB) reaches specificity of up to 100%, challenged by MRI with ultra-small paramagnetic iron oxide (95%) or diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (92%). The sensitivity of these methods is between 88-97% for ultrasound guided biopsy and 80-96% for MRI using USPIO or DWI. Discrimination between N0 and N+ is easier than between N1 and N2 or N3.ConclusionsComparing costs, harm, degree of sophistication and time consumption, ultrasound is by far the best option for axillar basin evaluation. Considering intrathoracic nodes, the preference may favour MRI or PET-CT.

AB  - Nowadays, maritime security faces many kinds of problems - environmental hazards, unlawful actions such like piracy, cargo theft, illegal border crossing etc. These challenges bring the situational awareness of this domain to a high level of importance. Optical satellite images, captured during cloudless weather conditions, are valuable source of information about situation at sea. On the one hand, modern very high resolution (VHR) optical sensors (e.g. WorldView family) taking images with spatial resolution higher than 0.5 m per pixel, enabling to perform object (ship) detection tasks. On the other hand, high resolution (HR) sensors like Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A(B) are able to cover relatively large areas and are suitable for environment monitoring tasks. Developed at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD), part of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Maritime Security Lab Processing Framework is intended to support the operational maritime surveillance near real time (NRT) services based HR and VHR optical satellite data. The Framework supports automated request driven processing from different satellite missions provided by a network of different ground stations and service providers. Actionable information products are created in an automatic processing chain including image pre-processing, data transcription and GUI based interactive value adding and validation. The paper will focus on the overall architecture of the framework including workflow of data handling, the interfaces and components, needed to enable fast data access for operator analysis and supervision.

CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - With the commercialisation of hyperspectral sensing, a range of promising applications in precision agriculture, including nutrient mapping, are now becoming available to the research community and industry. An online workflow for calibration and analysis of the airborne multispectral and hyperspectral data including geo-rectification, derivation of vegetation indices and comparison with time series of the satellite data is being presented. The system is being demonstrated on a case study of nitrogen trials in Australian cotton conducted at Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI). The broadband and narrowband vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral imagery were compared with the satellite imagery from Sentinel 2B to assess the accuracy losses in mapping the variability of the field. The developed workflow has successfully been used for assessment of the quality and the suitability of the hyperspectral and multispectral aerial imagery for mapping in-field variability across the season. The comparison of the vegetation indices derived using source imagery from different sensors revealed the benefits of each of the imagery types and its potential for field variability mapping.

TI  - THE CRITERION OF USEFULNESS IN THE EVALUATION OF ART IN THE RUSSIAN LITERARY CRITICISM OF THE 1860s
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers discussions about the purpose and usefulness of art which took place in the Russian literary criticism of the 1860s. A comparative analysis of journalistic and aesthetic criticism as well as works by M. N. Katkov and N. D. Akhsharumov leads the author to conclude that the critical discussions of the period in question had a variety of answers to these questions, but there was a number of recurring ideas. Art is seen as a tool for popularising scientific knowledge and has enlightening functions; it is recognised as a valuable factor capable of spiritually and morally influencing people; it is regarded as lacking practical usefulness, and superfluous when considered from the rational viewpoint. Depending on the authors' methods and their own axiological preferences, the usefulness of art was considered differently between the 1850s and 1860s. For instance, N. G. Chernyshevsky argues that when promoting and popularising academic knowledge, art helps change people's consciousness and improve their material and social status, in other words, it can become practically useful. A. V. Druzhinin, V. P. Botkin, and P. V. Annenkov do not use any evaluative categories when speaking about the role and meaning of art. For M. N. Katkov, the idea of usefulness of art is connected with the idea of creative freedom, and independence of creative work from any dictatorship from without. N. D. Akhshrumov thinks the criterion of usefulness cannot be applied to art at all.In spite of the polemic nature of the issue, all the above mentioned approaches manifest certain similarities, though not obvious enough, but anyway significant for the understanding of the complex relations between different aesthetic theories and key problems of the epoch. Discussions about the usefulness of art in the criticism of the 1850s-1860s testify to the relativity of this axiological category and its historical changeability. However, regardless of the interpretations of the category, it remains a constant notion which determines the value of art for an individual and society as a whole as well as its purpose and need for it. Such issues were topical in the 19th century, an era of change. and they remain relevant in any epoch capable of reflection and not indifferent to 'eternal' questions.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to establish the philosophical-aesthetic and culturological context of the Ukrainian and Polish avant-garde of the first third of the 20th century formation. The essence and significance of the main ideas of the Lviv-Warsaw Philosophical School for the emergence of avant-garde imagery, homological understanding of the problems of semiosis, sign and meaning in Ukrainian and Polish cubism, futurism, abstractionism, suprematism, "formalism", "unism" are revealed. The methodology of the research is based on the aesthetic-semiotic conceptions of the Lviv-Warsaw School of Philosophy (S. Baley, R.Ingarden, S. Lisse, L. Khvistek) representatives, the founders of the semantic philosophy of art (K. Bell, B. Croce, S. Langer, G. Rikert) and modern culture semiology (J. Mukarzhovsky, J. Lothman, U. Eco). The interdisciplinary synthesis of philosophical-cultural, aesthetic and art criticism is used. Scientific novelty. Semiotics and aesthetics of the Ukrainian and Polish avant-garde art are revealed from a perspective of the philosophy of the Lviv-Warsaw school for the first time. The ideological significance of the philosophical "turn" and "perceptual revolution" of the early 20th century is shown. For the origin and embodiment of modern ideas in the works of artists of Ukraine and Poland. Conclusions. A conclusion is based on the worldview and scientific influence of the "perceptual revolution" of 1905-1915, philosophical and aesthetic as well as art criticism and cultural studies in the neo-positivist, phenomenological and semiotic concepts of the beginning of the 20th century, using works of the Lviv-Warsaw School of Philosophy, theoretical works of Ukrainian and Polish avantgardists (A.

AB  - Sentinel-1 C&D SAR instruments are designed to continue the observations beyond the lifetime of Sentinel-1 A & B. They are to a high degree rebuilds of S-1A&B and will have the same imaging modes and interfaces to ground. Changes have been implemented within the SAR antenna by using a new Tile Amplifier design, which will contribute to improved radiometric stability and accuracy. The new tile amplifiers simplify the internal calibration approach by reducing the number of internal measurements from five to three. Another improvement is the introduction of interleaved noise measurements during image acquisition in addition to noise acquisitions in preamble and postamble. This is important as the surface brightness temperature have a significant impact on the acquired noise and can change the measured levels by up to 1 dB. A first tile for S-1C with the new design has been successfully tested. Results confirm the updated design and indicate improved measurement accuracy.

T2  - Idesia
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of a continuous search for technological innovations that allow fruit growers to practice a more competitive and sustainable fruit production, satellite-derived vegetation indexes could be used as tools to support the decision-making processes of technicians and territory planners. The objectives of the present study were to characterize phenological stages of cherry trees (Prunus avium L.) in the Maule region of Chile using field observations and to evaluate the capacity of multispectral satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) and the derived vegetative indexes (NDVI, SAVI), as tools for remotely identifying these phenological stages in cherry trees. Phenological transition stages in cherry trees, estimated from Landsat 7 (ETM+) data did not agree with in situ measurements of phenology made at the different sites. Landsat 7 (ETM+) derived vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI) could discriminate only gross changes associated with an increase and then a decrease of canopy greenness in cherry trees, but could not discriminate between successive phenological states in which the proportion of foliage is only slightly different. The number of days after the first of July (Southern Hemisphere) tended to be a less variable indicator than growing degree-days (GDD) for predicting the occurrence of different phenological stages in cherry trees.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous remote sensing studies (2005-2008) have identified Namibia's Kuiseb as the dustiest river in southern Africa. The purpose of this study was to extend the dust event record through to 2014, and to examine the nature of the surfaces from which this satellite imagery indicates these dust plumes originate. The new 10-year record confirms the delta as the dustiest geomorphological unit (54% of plumes), followed by the gravel plain (28%) and then the river (8%). No dust originated from the Namib Sand Sea dunes or interdunes. Field observations provided detail about the geomorphological and sedimentological setting of the landscape components. The laboratory analysis focused on the size characteristics of 153 surface sediment samples collected from the Kuiseb main channel, its terraces, delta, gravel plain surfaces and tributaries, dunes and interdune. This study has identified that surface sediments suitable for dust production increase towards the coast with particular dusty' floodplain surfaces between Swartbank and Rooibank and the Kuiseb delta. We suggest that silt crusts formed as the flood water dissipate, provide a main source of potentially entrainable material for emission. The crusts consist entirely of silt- and clay-sized materials, with a maximum of 97%<63m, 39%<10m and 6%<2m. Anthropogenic disturbances of the surfaces are potentially playing a role in the production of dust, with the area undergoing significant development.

AB  - The field of remote sensing is nowadays faced with huge amounts of data. While this offers a variety of exciting research opportunities, it also yields significant challenges regarding both computation time and space requirements. In practice, the sheer data volumes render existing approaches too slow for processing and analyzing all the available data. This work aims at accelerating BFAST, one of the state-of-the-art methods for break detection given satellite image time series. In particular, we propose a massively-parallel implementation for BFAST that can effectively make use of modern parallel compute devices such as GPUs. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed GPU implementation is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the existing publicly available implementation and up to ten times faster than a corresponding multi-threaded CPU execution. The dramatic decrease in running time renders the analysis of significantly larger datasets possible in seconds or minutes instead of hours or days. We demonstrate the practical benefits of our implementations given both artificial and real datasets.

TI  - Religion at Play <i>Pentecostalism</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>Transformation</i> <i>of</i> <i>a</i> <i>Secular</i> <i>Age</i>
T2  - PNEUMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pentecostals do not fit the dominant narrative of a secular age constructed by Charles Taylor. Instead, Pentecostalism is a religion at play that engages with the secular without accepting its authority. A critical dialogue with Taylor's foundational proposal of the central conditions of premodern life that have made room for our modern secular world demonstrates how and why these conditions are not met in Pentecostalism. The article then identifies the alternative mechanisms in place in Pentecostalism as a form of religion at play manifested in an enchanted worldview, sociospiritual attachment, the festival of Pentecost, the transformation of secular time, and a porous cosmos. A close examination of the notion of play in Taylor's narrative illuminates in more detail the ill fit of Pentecostalism in the history of a secular age and reveals that Pentecostalism represents a condition of religion that resolves the tension between sacred and secular and that challenges the dominance of "secular" and "religious" as uncontested ideas of our modern world.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the history and current state of Belokrinitskaya community in the town of Ivanovo. In the 19th - early 20th centuries, this was one of the major Russian centres of Old Believers, but nowadays there is only one small community in the town; it has a number of typical problems, ranging from the lack of a prayer room to the unwillingness of the young to continue the tradition. With one family as an example, the article demonstrates the changes that took place among the local Old Believers in the Soviet time, as well as main events and conflicts that affected the life of the community. The authors of the paper also raise the question about the character of the religiosity of modern urban Old Believers. They analyse the religious practice and circle of reading of a hereditary female Old Believer, her world outlook and self-identification. We also touch upon the question about the commonly shared criteria of religiosity, e.g. the frequency of the prayer, going to church, sacrament of communion. By means of a specific example and employing a wide range of personal sources, we show the problem of collision of the traditional (Old Faith) and non-traditional, esoteric (urban), worldview. Particular attention is paid to the image of the representative of a traditional culture that has established in relevant scientific literature, as well as the influence of this image on academic researchers.

TI  - Diaries, letters, personal testimony: Lev Shestov and Sergei Bulgakov
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of the panel discussion here reported was the role that personal testimonies, correspondence and diaries can have in philosophical studies. In particular, the participants explored the problem of the inner relations between the experiences of a thinker's personal life and his philosophical activity. Lev Shestov and Sergei Bulgakov, for all the differences they had between them both in style and philosophical content of their writings, still have much in common: they both strongly rely on the biblical tradition, profess certain skepticism as regards reason and its presumed `omnipotence'; they draw from the sources of intimate existential experience, and so on. Despite the fact that Shestov almost never speaks in the first person, his philosophy can be qualified as a kind of self-expression and self-analysis, and his writings ultimately appear as an indirect confession. Bulgakov directly transfers much of his diaries into his philosophical oeuvre, moreover, he often accords a different meaning to one and the same entry. An analysis of such revisions makes it possible to trace down how Bulgakov's worldview evolved. Shestov and Bulgakov's letters, Bulgakov's book Sophia, the Wisdom of God and other unpublished documents were employed in the course of the panel.

AB  - Altimetry-derived sea surface heights (SSH) from the recently launched Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A missions were validated against records from seven tide gauges located along the French Atlantic coast in the southern Bay of Biscay. Comparisons between Jason-2 and Jason-3 based SSH were performed along-track when they were orbiting 80 seconds apart during the tandem mission that lasted more than six months. The benefits of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisition mode on Sentinel-3A is compared to the classical Low Resolution Mode (LRM) on Jason-2 and 3 missions are analyzed.

AB  - Stand-alone synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ground moving target indication (GNITI) methods have both advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a hybrid SAR GMTI method that is based on two well-known methods: space time adaptive processing (STAP) and moving target detection by focusing (MTDF). The input of the proposed hybrid method is two time separated complex radar images. The output is detected ground moving targets, the target normalized relative speeds (NRS), and focused images of the detected targets. In the paper, we provide the mathematical background behind the hybrid SAR GMTI method in details. We also provide some experimental results for validating the proposed method. The data for the experiments was acquired in early 2015 by TanDEMX and TerraSAR-X operating in monostatic pursuit mode. The ground scene where the measurements were conducted is around Mantorp, west of Linkoping, Sweden.

TI  - Multitemporal soil moisture monitoring by use of optical remote sensing data in a dike relocation area

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The nature restoration project 'Lenzener Elbtalaue', realised from 2002 to 2011 at the river Elbe, included the first large scale dike relocation in Germany (420 ha). Its aim was to initiate the development of endangered natural wetland habitats and processes, accompanied by greater biodiversity in the former grassland dominated area. The monitoring of spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture in this dike relocation area is therefore particularly important for estimating the restoration success. The topsoil moisture monitoring from 1990 to 2017 is based on the Soil Moisture Index (SMI) derived with the triangle method2 by use of optical remotely sensed data: land surface temperature and Normalized Differnce Vegetation Index are calculated from Landsat 4/5/7/8 data and atmospheric corrected by use of MODIS data. Spatial and temporal soil moisture variations in the restored area of the dike relocation are compared to the agricultural and pasture area behind the new dike. Ground truth data in the dike relocation area was obtained from field measurements in October 2017 with a FDR device. Additionally, data from a TERENO soil moisture sensor network (SoilNet) and mobile cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) rover measurements are compared to the results of the triangle method for a region in the Harz Mountains (Germany). The SMI time series illustrates, that the dike relocation area has become significantly wetter between 1990 and 2017, due to restructuring measurements. Whereas the SMI of the dike hinterland reflects constant and drier conditions. An influence of climate is unlikely. However, validation of the dimensionless index with ground truth measurements is very difficult, mostly due to large differences in scale.

AB  - It has been widely knowing that one of the important parameters to study about processes and phenomena in oceans is sea surface temperature (SST). This study is about the use of satellite and in situ data to find the seasonal and temporal SST value in Indian Ocean western part of Sumatera Island during 2010 to 2016. This result focuses on changes of SST and the accuracy of SST value derived from MODIS Satellite and ARGO Float. We divide the data into the dry and wet season based on a seasonal condition in Indonesia. The result shows the same pattern of SST value both from satellite and in situ data. The changes trend of SST value (Celsius) is increasing from 2010 to 2016 both in situ and satellite data. SST value increases 0.093 for in situ data and SST value increases 0.132 measured by MODIS satellite. The accuracy assessment (RMSE) value is 0,555. The coefficient of determination r(2) value shows a positive correlation between MODIS and ARGO data especially in dry season, while in the wet season the R-2 is smaller than in dry season.

TI  - Simulation of SAR images of urban areas by using the ray tracing method with measured values of backscatter coefficients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses the ray tracing method to simulate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of urban areas. The images are constructed for polarisations: horizontal-horizontal (HH) and vertical-vertical (VV), and different types of buildings, vegetation, and streets. Simulated images of a given area are compared with real SAR images of the same area acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite. The simulations use the measured backscatter coefficient for HH and VV polarisations and for five different classes of terrain: houses, trees, shrubs, grass, and ground. For multiple reflections, we apply the generalized bistatic Lambertian model. The results show that, despite the limits of the ray tracing method and the approximations involved in modelling three-dimensional objects in the simulated scene, the simulated SAR images correspond well with the actual scene. All features present in the real image are reproduced in the simulated image; in particular, the double reflections of buildings and the surrounding ground appear clearly. However, discrepancies exist, and these are also discussed.

AB  - The paper presents satellite imagery from active SENTINEL-1A and passive SENTINEL-2A/2B sensors for their application in the monitoring of mining areas focused on detecting land changes. Multispectral scenes of SENTINEL-2A/2B have allowed for detecting changes in land-cover near the region of interest (ROI), i.e. the Szczercow dumping site in the Belchatow open cast lignite mine, central Poland, Europe. Scenes from SENTINEL-1A/1B satellite have also been used in the research. Processing of the SLC signal enabled creating a return intensity map in VV polarization. The obtained SAR scene was reclassified and shows a strong return signal from the dumping site and the open pit. This fact may be used in detection and monitoring of changes occurring within the analysed engineering objects.

AB  - The goal of this research was to evaluate the effect of Arctic climate change on the surrounding land area. In this research, we developed a method to monitor the freezing and thawing of shallow lakes in the Arctic region using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and provide a strategy to evaluate the effect of climate change on the Arctic land area. A method to monitor the ice condition of these lakes was investigated using the SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1 from 2014 to 2017. We confirmed that the C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 could monitor the freezing and thawing ice condition of shallow lakes in northern Alaska. The backscattering threshold between floating and grounded ice was -14 dB, which was approximately 2 dB less than that of ers-1/2. We envision continuing to monitor lake ice over a long period of time using future available Sentinel-1 data.

AB  - The authors have developed monitoring system for rice growth status in the Tohoku region of Japan using satellite data. One of the important input parameters for the monitoring system is the heading date. Until now, the heading dates in the system are provided by the users on the base of field records. However, the collection of the data records is time consuming work and all users of the system cannot provide a hearing date of each field in time. For this reason, we have investigated whether the heading date can be estimated by using SAR data with NDVI of optical satellite data. In this paper, we will present the estimation method of heading date for paddy rice using the dual polarization of Sentinel 1A and 1B. The result shows potentiality to estimate the heading date of paddy rice in error range of about 6 days by combined using NDVI changes.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether specific religious coping styles and cultural worldview would be associated with thoughts of suicide given higher levels of stress in a community-based sample of African American adults. African American men and women (n=134) completed measures of religious coping, cultural worldview, stressful life events, depression symptoms, and suicide ideation. Higher ratings of suicide ideation were observed for African Americans who endorsed a more self-directing religious coping style. The self-directing religious coping was more frequently endorsed by participants who identified with a more Eurocentric cultural worldview that espouses an individualist philosophy. Together, these findings provide some insight to how religious coping and culture are related to suicide vulnerability for African Americans who are not in clinical care.

TI  - Holy piracy: Kopimism, the sacralisation of information, and the legitimating power of religion
T2  - CULTURE AND RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Kopimism is a new religious movement predicated on, and revolving around, the assertion and belief that information is inherently sacred and needs to be copied and shared. Adherents to this Swedish-born religious movement have persisted in small pockets of devout communities around the world for almost a decade. This paper outlines a rudimentary and general sketch of the Kopimist worldview, its basic aims and its place within the contemporary religious landscape. In the latter part of this analysis, particular attention is given to the movement's claim that it is not simply a sacralisation of political ideals - pirate politics, in particular-but that it maintains a distinct worldview and ethical system based on the notion that information - the foundation of everything - is itself divine. 'Religion' as a legitimating categorical force and the sociocultural conditions that engender new religious movements are also considered alongside the movement's history and development.

CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The Carbon Observatory Instrument Suite, or CARBO, consists of four carbon observing instruments sharing a common instrument bus, yet targeted for a particular wavelength band each with a unique science observation. They are: a) Instrument 1, wavelength centered at 756 nm for oxygen and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations, b) Instrument 2, centered at 1629 nm, for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) observation, c) Instrument 3, centered at 2062 nm for carbon dioxide and d) Instrument 4, centered at 2328 for carbon monoxide (CO) and methane. From low-Earth orbit, these instruments have a field-of-view of 10 to 15 degrees, and a spatial resolution of 2 km square. These instruments have a spectral resolving power ranging from ten to twenty thousand, and can monitor column-average dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) at 1.5 ppm, and methane (XCH4) at 7 ppb. These new instruments will advance the use of immersion grating technology in spectrometer instruments in order to reduce the size of the instrument, while improving performance. These compact, capable instruments are envisioned to be compatible with small satellites, yet modular to be configured to address the particular science questions at handHere we report on the current status of the instrument design and fabrication, focusing primarily on Instruments 1 and 2. We will describe the key science and engineering requirements and the instrument performance error budget. We will discuss the optical design with particular emphasis on the immersion grating, and the advantages this new technology affords compared to previous instruments. We will also discuss the status of the focal plane array and the detector electronics and housing. Finally, we report on a new approach - developed during this instrument design process - which enables simultaneous measurement of both orthogonal polarization states (S and P) over the field-of-view and optical bandpass. We believe this polarization sensing capability will enable science observations which were previously limited by instrumental and observational degeneracies. In particular: improved sensitivity to all species, better sensitivity to surface polarization effects, better constraints on aerosol scattering parameters, and superior discrimination of the vertical distribution of gases and aerosols.

AB  - Nowadays, the image of the forest in Germany is changing from monoculture areas to very mixed forests, where individual stands are no longer clearly visible. The objective of this study was to examine the use of remotely sensed data at enterprise level for pre-stratification and sample plot allocation in the planning stage of forest inventories in a very heterogeneous forest. On the basis of RapidEye satellite data and object-based image analysis, a stratified segment-based non-permanent sampling design was developed and evaluated against the results of a permanent systematic sampling design. The relative efficiency (RE) was calculated based on variance estimators for simple random sampling and stratified random sampling for the variable timber volume [m(3)/ha]. By stratification of the sample designs, we achieved an RE of 1.25 for the systematic sampling and 1.34 with the segment-based sampling design. Based on a targeted standard error of 4.6%, the sampling designs were compared with respect to the required sample size. The stratified segment-based sampling design reduced the number of sample plots compared to the systematic sampling design by 28%. Furthermore, it was shown that the possible reduction of sampling plots leads to a cost saving of 21%.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The changes of land use affect the sustainable development of society through its influences on the interactive balance among the population, resource, environment and ecological development. In the process of Chinese urbanization, increasingly serious contradictions between human and land have been caused by the dramatic increase in the demand of land resources. This paper used a case study on Guian New District, which is a national-level new district in China. The research focused on the change of land use in the new-style urbanizing process of Guian New District. The sustainable development in this district was analyzed by applying the technology of Remote Sensing and Geography Information System to collect the spatial data of land use in 2010 and 2018 of Guian New District, utilizing the theory of ecosystem service value to obtain quantitative description of the ecological outcome of land use, and comparing the variance in land use and ecological benefit before and after the establishment of Guian New District. The study has shown that the land use of Guian New District almost meets the basic requirements of sustainable development. Furthermore, in order to achieve sustainable development in this district, suggestions were provided on how to improve the structure and location of land use, as well as taking account of the impacts on the long-term ecological benefit.

AB  - The scientific and technological revolution has a real impact on every aspect of personal and social life. The impact on real life and the resulting changes lead to the break up of existing ethical norms that govern the real life of human beings and society. In other words, it calls for a new ethical norm that defines social life. The changes in the ways of living the life brought about by the scientific and technological revolution and the changes in the ethical norms require changes in understanding of life and the world. The scientific and technological revolution eventually calls for changes in life and norms (ethics, morals) and worldviews (the way in which people understand and explain nature and human beings and the world). Religion and theology should play their role in the formation of a new social norm that the scientific and technological revolution demands. Moreover, the technological revolution causes changes and challenges in the life of religion and faith itself.In other words, the scientific and technological revolution has some direct impact on the form and content of religious life. In addition, the worldview conceived by the technological revolution brings conflict with the worldview of the religion.In the revolution of science and technology, human beings seem to be Homo Deus, but in reality they are becoming scapegoats of science and technology. Challenges and problems caused by the technological revolution often go beyond the scope of existing ethical norms. The technological revolution calls for the re-establishment of ethical norms. Christianity has always participated in the formation of social ethics norms. Christianity should help to reflect on the ethical issues raised by the technological revolution from the point of view of faith and to refine social norms. The bigger problem, however, is that the relationship between the technological revolution and Christianity does not simply stay in the dimension of ethics and morality. The scientific and technological revolution can threaten the very existence of Christianity as a religion. Christian doctrine and theology must compete with the scientific and technological revolution (the post-human and trans-human worldview implied by the technological revolution) as a matter of worldview.Christianity as a platform has to compete with cutting edge technology. And the religious practice of Christianity must also compete with the post-human way of life.

AB  - This paper introduces an object-based method based on a new statistical distance for SAR image change detection. Firstly, multi-temporal segmentation is carried out to segment two temporal SAR images simultaneously. It considers the homogeneity in two temporal images, and could generate homogeneous objects in spectral, spatial and temporal. In addition, through setting different segmentation parameters, the multi-temporal images can be segmented in a set of scales. This process exploits the advantages of OBIA that could effectively reduce spurious changes, and considers the scale of change detection task. Secondly, a multiplicative noise model called Nakagami-Rayleigh distribution is employed to describe SAR data, and then applied to Bayesian formulation. Thus, a new statistical distance that is insensitive to speckles is derived to measure the distances between pairs of parcels. Then, cluster ensemble algorithm is utilized to improve accuracy of individual result in each scale to obtain the final change detection map. Finally, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 images are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other four methods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXIV
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Scene classification is a hot research topic in the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) community. Currently, the investigations conducted in RS domain mainly use single source data (e.g. multispectral imagery (MSI), hyperspectral imagery (HSI), or light detection and ranging (LiDAR), etc.). However, one of the RS data aforementioned merely provides one certain perspective of the complex scenes while the multisource data fusion can provide complementary and robust knowledge about the objects of interest. We aim at fusing the spectral-spatial information of the HSI and the spatial-elevation information of LiDAR data for scene classification. In this work, the densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet), which connects all preceding layers to later layers in feed-forword manner, is employed to effectively extract and reuse heterogeneous features from HSI and LiDAR data. More specifically, a novel two-stream DenseNet architecture is proposed, which builds an identical but separated DenseNet stream for each data respectively. Then one of stream is utilized to extract the spectral-spatial features from HSI, the other is exploited to extract the spatial-elevation features of LiDAR data. Subsequently, the spectral-spatial-elevation features extracted in two streams are deeply fused within the fusion network which consists of two fully-connected layers for the final classification. Experimental results conducted on widely-used benchmark datasets show that the proposed architecture provides competitive performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Accurate prediction of crop yields in developing countries in advance of harvest time is central to preventing famine, improving food security, and sustainable development of agriculture. Existing techniques are expensive and difficult to scale as they require locally collected survey data. Approaches utilizing remotely sensed data, such as satellite imagery, potentially provide a cheap, equally effective alternative. Our work shows promising results in predicting soybean crop yields in Argentina using deep learning techniques. We also achieve satisfactory results with a transfer learning approach to predict Brazil soybean harvests with a smaller amount of data. The motivation for transfer learning is that the success of deep learning models is largely dependent on abundant ground truth training data. Successful crop yield prediction with deep learning in regions with little training data relies on the ability to fine-tune pre-trained models.

TI  - Dynamics of 30 large channel bars in the Lower Mississippi River in response to river engineering from 1985 to 2015
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel bars are a major depositional feature in alluvial rivers and their morphodynamics has been investigated intensively in the past several decades. However, relatively less is known about how channel bars in alluvial rivers respond to river engineering and regulations. In this study, we assessed 30-yr morphologic changes of 30 large emerged bars located in a 223 km reach of the highly regulated Lower Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi, to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River diversion. Landsat imagery and river stage data between 1985 and 2015 were utilized to characterize bar morphologic features and quantify decadal changes. Based on bar surface areas estimated with the satellite images at different river stages, a rating curve was developed for each of the 30 bars to determine their volumes. Results from this study show that the highly regulated river reach favored the growth of mid-channel and attached bars, while more than half of the point bars showed degradation. Currently, the mid-channel and attached bars accounted for 38% and 34% of the total volume of the 30 bars. The average volume of a single mid-channel bar is over two times that of an attached bar and over four times that of a point bar. Overall, in the past three decades, the total volume of the studied 30 bars increased by 110,118,000 m(3) (41%). Total dike length in a dike field was found mostly contributing to the bar volume increase. Currently, the emerged volume of the 30 bars was estimated approximately 378,183,000 m(3). The total bar volume is equivalent to-530 million metric tons of coarse sand, based on an average measured bulk density of 1.4 t/m(3) for the bar sediment The findings show that these bars are large sediment reservoirs.

TI  - An NDVI synthesis method for multi-temporal remote sensing images based on <i>k</i>-NN learning: a case based on GF-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite data has the advantages of having high temporal resolution and wide coverage. Therefore, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data collected by GF-1 can provide an accurate assessment of vegetation coverage. Because of its limited range and the interference of cloud cover, NDVI data should be synthesised by using multi-day data, which creates a more reliable dataset. However, NDVI data synthesised by existing methods have poor continuity and reliability. To overcome these problems, an NDVI synthesis method for multi-temporal remote sensing images based on k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) learning is proposed in the present study. Based on a k-NN learning algorithm and the continuity in spatial and temporal aspects of NDVI data, multi-temporal remote sensing image data was screened and classified to remove cloud cover. Then, each image was assigned a weight, based on which the data weighting fusion could be achieved. Compared with the Maximum Value Compositing and the Average Compositing methods, the k-NN method proposed in this study was found to remove the mutation points more effectively, ensuring better spatial continuity of NDVI data and improving the reliability of the results.

AB  - In this paper, the Sentinel-1 ScanSAR IR GRD products are used for sea ice mapping using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The sea and ice are classified as 2 types and 4 types respectively according to their SAR image textures. They are smooth sea, rough sea, granular ice, massive ice, smooth ice and striped ice. The Sentinel-1 SAR images are firstly pre-processed using ESA SNAP software. Then the classes are interpreted manually for chip preparation and annotations. Chips with 3 spatial scales (32x32, 64x64, 128x128) are used for training input of the CNN. The trained CNN is then used for generation of sea ice map from the ScanSAR image. The results are promising. Further work is still going on.

AB  - ESA's two Sentinel-1 satellites collect similar to 120,000 synthetic aperture radar wave mode vignettes every month over the world's oceans. This provides a new and unique opportunity for routine identification and study of a wide range of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena observed in SAR imagery. To this end, the first challenge is to develop an efficient and accurate method to detect and classify key geophysical phenomena signature among the whole dataset. In this study, the deep-learning-based convolutional neural network architecture of Inception v3 model was adopted. We identified 10 geophysical categories detectable by SAR and selected 320 Sentinel-1 wave mode imagettes for each category. The full pre-trained Inception v3 model was then retrained using these images. Preliminary results demonstrate that this deep-learning methodology is quite effective, with overall accuracy each of the 10 classes exceeding 0.93 and clear class differentiation in cluster analysis. This opens perspectives to rely on wave mode vignettes in order to analyze geophysical phenomena at global scale. Further work remains to address ambiguous or unknown images that often include a mix of several air-sea processes.

AB  - By using the data of Phase Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) on board Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), this paper shows the compensation of ionospheric phase scintillation. The phase scintillation is generated based on the multiple phase screen theory and added into the PALSAR L1.0 data (unfocused raw data). The Phase Gradient Autofocus (PGA) is then applied to remove the phase distortion. Simulations show that after compensation, the effects of ionospheric phase scintillation is obviously removed.

CP  - Conference on Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring II
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The effects of the ionosphere on spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems have received attention since the development of ALOS PALSAR (L-band). One of them is the Faraday rotation (FR) due to the dispersive nature of ionosphere and the existence of Earth's magnetic field. The FR error is obviously embedded in polarimetric data of PALSAR systems, which destroys the scattering matrix. Nevertheless, distorted echoes contain abundant ionospheric information, the ionospheric sounding based on the scattering matrix data can become possible if the mechanisms of ionospheric interference can be understood and accurately modeled. SAR systems are generally characterized by high spatial resolution, this powerful technique can detect kilometer-scale ionospheric information where such unprecedented spatial resolution was previously inaccessible (e.g., such resolution is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than that obtained by GPS). In this paper, by using the ALOS PALSAR full-polarization data sets, we quantitatively evaluate the reliability and accuracy of retrieved TEC information. We have used the observation results of incoherent scattering radar (ISR) to verify the accuracy of our results, given that ISR is currently the most powerful ground means for ionospheric monitoring and the ideal means for ionospheric data verification. In our work, the AMISR data for the Alaskan region in the United States is selected. After screening the data, we have selected and compared three sets of SAR and ISR results obtained at the same observation time (universal time: 8/6/2010, 21:6:25; 3/19/2011, 7:32:50; 3/31/2011, 7:28:16) and place. Our results show that the deviation between the results of SAR and ISR is only 0.1-0.35 TECU accounting for different factors, such as system and geographical deviations. However, the accuracy of the most widely used GPS data can only up to 1-2 TECU. Both accuracy and resolution of ionospheric sounding using full - polarization SAR are therefore superior to those of ionospheric sounding using GPS.

TI  - Parameter estimation for a cohesive sediment transport model by assimilating satellite observations in the Hangzhou Bay: Temporal variations and spatial distributions
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Model parameters in the suspended cohesive sediment transport models are critical for the accurate simulation of suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs). Difficulties in estimating the model parameters still prevent numerical modeling of the sediment transport from achieving a high level of predictability. Based on a threedimensional cohesive sediment transport model and its adjoint model, the satellite remote sensing data of SSCs during both spring tide and neap tide, retrieved from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), are assimilated to synchronously estimate four spatially and temporally varying parameters in the Hangzhou Bay in China, including settling velocity, resuspension rate, inflow open boundary conditions and initial conditions. After data assimilation, the model performance is significantly improved. Through several sensitivity experiments, the spatial and temporal variation tendencies of the estimated model parameters are verified to be robust and not affected by model settings. The pattern for the variations of the estimated parameters is analyzed and summarized. The temporal variations and spatial distributions of the estimated settling velocity are negatively correlated with current speed, which can be explained using the combination of flocculation process and Stokes' law. The temporal variations and spatial distributions of the estimated resuspension rate are also negatively correlated with current speed, which are related to the grain size of the seabed sediments under different current velocities. Besides, the estimated inflow open boundary conditions reach the local maximum values near the low water slack conditions and the estimated initial conditions are negatively correlated with water depth, which is consistent with the general understanding. The relationships between the estimated parameters and the hydrodynamic fields can be suggestive for improving the parameterization in cohesive sediment transport models.

AB  - Garlic and onion are the most important vegetable crops in Korea. The accurate estimation of cultivation area for garlic and onion acreage are critical to predict the production of vegetable crops, adjusting agricultural planting plane and ensuring an effective supply of farm products. However, the plots cultivated with garlic and onion are very fragmentary and dispersive because the cross cropping commonly occurs in the two crops. Therefore, it is very difficult to establish the accurate identification of garlic and onion only using satellite-based remotely sensed images. In case of tracking Hapcheon Gun, Korea as the sampling site, objective of this study was to formulate a spatial sampling scheme through combining satellite-based, UAV remotely sensed images and the stratified sampling method for improving the estimated accuracy to cultivation area of garlic and onion. The results are shown that there was almost no classification error, when UAV remotely sensed image is used to retrieve the cultivation area of garlic and onion. The error found in the two crops classification using Rapid Eye satellite-based images, although the classification error for garlic was the larger than that of onion;. The variance for cultivation area of garlic and onion within each stratum can be significantly decreased, when the proportion of the cultivation area for two crops is accounted for one sampling unit. It was observed that the required sample size for meeting the designed extrapolation accuracy decreased with the stratification number of the sampled population. Comprehensively considering population extrapolating accuracy, sampling survey cost and rationality, 10 strata was the optimum stratification number. It was appeared that the spatial stratified sampling scheme combining satellite-based and UAV remotely sensed images had a high accuracy and stability for estimation of cultivation areas for the two crops, because both the relative error and CV of population extrapolation using this scheme were less than 10%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Diabetic nephropathy is developed in 20-40% of patients with diabetes mellitus, and patients with diabetic nephropathy require dialysis and renal transplantation. Traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in treating patients with diabetic nephropathy in China. However, the detailed mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine remain unclear. Yiqi Yangyin Huayu Tongluo formula (ZY formula) is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula. Here, we demonstrated kidney protective effect of ZY formula on the rats with diabetic nephropathy. The therapeutic effect of ZY formula on the diabetic nephropathy was almost the same as that of Irbesartan, which proved to have excellent curative effects on diabetic nephropathy. We also demonstrated the mechanism of ZY formula effect on the diabetic nephropathy. First, we validated that the activation of ROS-JNK signaling pathway in diabetic rats could be reduced by ZY. Furthermore, collagen I expression could be downregulated by ZY formula treatment. Meanwhile, cell apoptosis in the kidney of diabetic rats could be alleviated by ZY formula.

AB  - Suspended matter is an important indicator of water environment monitoring. As a model of tropical tourist island in China, the content of the suspended substance influences the development of marine tourism. In order to understand the distribution of suspended matter concentration in Wuzhizhou Island, the correlation between the band combination and the concentration of suspended matter was analyzed by EXCEL and SPSS using TM data of Landsat-5 satellite and WFV2 image data of GF-1 satellite. The inversion model with high correlation level and good ufit was selected for estimation of suspended substance concentration. The results show that the polynomial regression model with the B2/ B3 ratios of the Landsat-5 TM image on June 12010 is the best, and the B4 / B3 combination of GF-1 WFV2 data on June 2, 2014 is the best. The increase of the suspended matter concentration in Wuzhizhou Island area from 2010 to 2014, especially the northwest marine bathing area, the northern diving area and the maritime recreation area were affected by human tourism activities, and the suspended matter concentration changed obviously.

AB  - Fractional snow cover from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites often encounters data gaps mainly caused by cloud obscuration in one or two observations in a single day. Imagers onboard GEOstationary (GEO) satellites have hourly or more frequent observations, making it possible to reduce cloud obscuration significantly. To map daily cloudfree fractional snow cover, we present a way using blended measurements from Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FengYun-2 Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (FY-2 VISSR). The fractional snow cover from MODIS is estimated using the Multiple End-member Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA), while that from FY-2 VISSR is generated using a simple linear interpolation between snow and snow-free end-members. Quickly-moving clouds can be alleviated mainly by the utilization of FY-2 VISSR multi-temporal data. Then spatio-temporally continuous daily fractional snow cover results from the removal of remaining clouds through the interpolation pixel by pixel in time series of snow fraction.

TI  - Indocyanine green-incorporating nanoparticles for cancer theranostics
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) is a near-infrared dye that has been used in the clinic for retinal angiography, and defining cardiovascular and liver function for over 50 years. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the incorporation of ICG into nanoparticles (NPs) for cancer theranostic applications. Various types of ICG-incorporated NPs have been developed and strategically functionalised to embrace multiple imaging and therapeutic techniques for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This review systematically summaries the biodistribution of various types of ICG-incorporated NPs for the first time, and discusses the principles, opportunities, limitations, and application of ICG-incorporated NPs for cancer theranostics. We believe that ICG-incorporated NPs would be a promising multifunctional theranostic platform in oncology and facilitate significant advancements in this research-active area.

AB  - In wave mode, Sentinel-1A/B from ESA provide swell spectra dataset on a continuous and global basis since. In this paper, a method of a dynamical validation approach for SAR swell spectra is developed, in which the Sentinel-1A swell spectra are partitioned and propagated up to the vicinity of in-situ reference along the great circle based upon the linear wave theory. Here, sentinel-1A wave mode data for the period of three months were dynamically validated against buoys from NDBC and CDIP networks. Comparison results show a good agreement with buoy measurements. Influent of buoy types on the validation results are also discussed.

TI  - Dynamic analysis of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> forest health levels from 1995 to 2013 in the Yellow River Delta, China using multitemporal Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Robinia pseudoacacia forest in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China, was planted in the 1970s and has continuously suffered dieback and mortality since the 1990s. Timely and accurate information on forest growth and forest condition and its dynamic change as well is essential for assessing and developing effective management strategies. In this study, multitemporal Landsat imagery was used to analyze and monitor changes of the R. pseudoacacia forest in the YRD from 1995 to 2013. To do so, Landsat image band reflectance, three fraction images calculated by using a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) method, and four vegetation indices (VIs) were used to discriminate three health levels of R. pseudoacacia forest in years 1995, 2007, and 2013 with a random forest (RF) classifier. The four VIs include a difference infrared index (DII) developed in this study, normalized difference vegetation index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, and normalized difference infrared index (NDII), all of which were computed from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager multispectral (MS) bands. The dynamic changes of the forest health levels during the periods of 1995-2007 and 2007-2013 were analysed. The analysis results demonstrate that three fraction images created by MESMA method and four VIs were powerful in separating the three forest health levels. In addition to the Landsat MS bands, the additional three fraction images increased the classification accuracy by 14-20%; if coupled with the four VIs, the overall accuracy was further increased by 5-6%. According to the importance values calculated by RF classifier for all input features, the DII vegetation index was the second effective feature, outperforming NDII. From 1995 to 2013, a total of 2615ha of forest in the study area suffered from mortality or loss.

TI  - Snow Grain-Size Estimation Over Mountainous Areas From MODIS Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow in mountainous areas is a major source of surface water and groundwater recharge in the world. The water balance in mountainous regions is controlled by the interactions between the climate, cryospheric, and hydrological systems. Surface snow grain is a sensitive thermodynamic indicator of snowpack and plays an important role in the snow albedo. In mountainous regions, the complicated terrain conditions may introduce errors in the snow grain size estimated from satellite imagery. In this letter, an effective method based on the Snow Grain-Size and Pollution (SGSP) amount algorithm is proposed to estimate the surface snow grain size with careful topographic correction, using spectral reflectance data in Channel 5 (1.24 mu m) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. The SGSP-estimated snow grain size was validated with in situ measurements collected from field campaigns in mountainous areas of Manasi River Basin, China, during the periods of snow accumulation and ablation from 2011 to 2015. The R-2 value of 0.90 and root mean squared error of 80.42 mu m were obtained.

TI  - Spatio-temporal urban growth dynamics of Lagos Metropolitan Region of Nigeria based on Hybrid methods for LULC modeling and prediction
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate information on the amount and location of Land use and land cover (LULC) changes is necessary to develop and implement a sustainable-urban planning. This research investigates the potential of an integrated Multi-Layer Perceptron and Markov Chain Analysis (MLP-MCA) to map and accurately predict the future LULC change scenarios in Lagos Metropolitan Region of Nigeria. Multi-temporal LULC datasets derived from remotely sensed Landsat images from 1984, 2000 and 2015 were used for modeling, validation and prediction. Predicted LULC changes for 2030 and 2050 were performed based on the LULC map of 2015 using MLP-MCA method. The result reveals a significant expansion of built-up areas during the whole study period. Analysis of LULC distribution in Lagos metropolitan region shows that about 50% of urban land expansion happened beyond the administrative boundary of Lagos State during the period of 2000-2015. It is predicted that more than 75% of future urban growth will occur across the border of Lagos State, in the neighbouring Ogun State by 2050. These results imply that a strong and consistent collaboration between different states is crucial to establish an effective regional planning framework and ensure a proper planned growth of the metropolitan region.

TI  - Development of a MODIS data based algorithm for retrieving nearshore sea surface salinity along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing algorithms for retrieval of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) were generally developed for deep ocean waters while practical applications of SSS are commonly involved in coastal (particularly nearshore) waters. To fill the gap, this paper presents a new SSS algorithm, called Nearshore SSS Algorithm, developed using the Artificial Neural Networks toolbox in the MATLAB Program and 7years of cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua data as well as in situ data collected from United States Geological Survey (USGS) stations along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The independent input variables involved in the new algorithm include the water-leaving reflectance at 412nm, 443nm, 488nm, 555nm, 678nm, and 645nm of MODIS Aqua sensor. Results of sensitivity analysis indicate that SSS in nearshore waters is most sensitive to reflectance at 412nm and 488nm, followed by the reflectance at 555nm and 645nm. While reflectance at 678nm is also important, reflectance at 443nm is the least important to SSS in nearshore waters, providing new insights into SSS in coastal waters. MODIS data collected from January 2012 to September 2014 were used for validation of the nearshore SSS algorithm. The linear correlation coefficient of this algorithm for Louisiana coast was 0.7256 and 0.6985 for the development and validation, respectively. A unique feature of this paper is that while the new algorithm is particularly useful to the retrieval of SSS in nearshore waters, it is also expanded to further offshore waters, providing reliable SSS data for various applications of coastal environment and resources management particularly along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast.

TI  - Development of a MODIS Data-Based Algorithm for Retrieving Gage Height in Nearshore Waters along the Louisiana Gulf Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gage height is one of most important physical parameters commonly used for the description of daily sea levels and generally monitored at sparsely scattered tidal stations. This paper presents a novel remote sensing algorithm for the retrieval of spatially distributed gage height data in coastal waters with emphasis on nearshore waters using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The algorithm was trained using the Artificial Neural Networks toolbox in the MATLAB program and over 4 years (2007-11) of cloud-free MODIS Aqua data for waterleaving reflectance as well as ground truth measurements collected daily from U.S. Geological Survey stations along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The algorithm was validated using 3 additional years of independent data sets, which were not used in the algorithm training and collected from 2012 to 2014. Cross-validation results indicated that the gage heights derived from the new algorithm were in good agreement with observed height, as evidenced by the high linear correlation coefficient of 0.8465 and low root mean square error of 0.2238 m. The new algorithm makes it possible to produce daily, spatially distributed gage height data for coastal management and resources development in shallow coastal areas where there are no gages.

AB  - Rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee) is one of the most important pests that endanger rice development and yield, which has characteristics of large outbreak areas, high occurrence frequencies and heavy damages. At present, the monitoring methods of rice leaf folder damage is based on artificial investigation, which has the advantages of objective truth and high reliability, while there is a drawback of time-consuming, and it cannot used for a wide range of rice damage monitoring. An ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc.) Hand-held Spectroradiometer was used at jointing stage of rice. The results showed that, reflectance from rice canopy significantly decreased in the green (530-570 nm) and near infrared (700-1000 nm) regions, and significantly increased in the blue (450-520 nm) and red (580-700 nm) regions as the rice leaf folder population increased. Reflectance from rice canopy significantly decreased in the spectral regions from 737 to 1000 nm as the infestation scale of pest population increased, and the most correlation appeared at 941 nm. The more the numbers of rice leaf folder, the higher the changes of such characteristic parameters. The positive correlations were found between the damage of rice leaf folder and the discrepancy of characteristic parameters in these experimental fields. With China Remote Sensing career advancement, a large number of independent researches and development satellites have launched. Among a new generation of high-resolution satellites, GaoFen-1 (GF-1) stands out. It sets high spatial resolution (2 m-16 m), multi-spectral and high temporal resolution (4-day) with 60 km-800 km swath in a fusion technology with strategic significance. In order to explore the adaptability of Chinese GF-1 images in monitoring rice damage from rice leaf folder, nine rice fields were selected by damage severity in Xinghua City, Jiangsu Province at full heading stage in 2015, and the Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) were used to characterize the occurrence of rice leaf folder damages, which were calculated from the satel-lite GF-1 retrieval data. A series of analyses were performed to disclose the relationship among these six indices and the severity of rice leaf folder. Quantitative correlation analyses showed that NDVI, EVI, EVI2, SAVE OSAVI and leaf folding population had a highly significant correlation (P<0.01), and SAVI had a highest correlation of 0.94. While there was no significant correlation between RVI and leaf folding population. Therefore, it was feasible to using hyperspectral data and GF-1 satellite images to monitor and warn the outbreak and development of rice leaf folder, which provided a new possible method to monitor dynamically the damage of rice leaf folder.

AB  - Significant wave height (H-s), is an important parameter, represented as the integration of directional wave spectra. Although many researchers have directly extracted H-s from SAR images and got a great accuracy of retrieval, those approaches are not suitable for GF-3 SAR data. In this paper, we propose an empirical approach for SAR H-s retrieval, using lambda(c) estimated from the real part of image cross spectra obtain from VV-polarized Gaofen-3 (GF-3) wave mode data acquired in different radar beams (called wave-code). Results using GF-3 wave mode data from January to February 2017 indicate that the bias and RMSE errors are: 189 wave-code, -0.13 m and 0.57 m; 190 wave-code, -0.07 m and 0.34 m; 193 wave-code, -0.3 m and 0.59 m; 199 wave-code, 0.16 m and 0.68 m; 215 wave-code, 0.2 m and 0.87 m. they show a relative behavior between the retrieved H-s and the H-s extracted from WAVEWATCH-III (WW3). However, there is a significant error when WW3-extracted H-s exceed 4 m. It seems that the model is not suitable for H-s retrieval on high sea conditions.

AB  - Fine and fast classification for ecologically sound land use types is the perquisite for ecosystem management and protection. However, few studies focused on the fine classification of ecologically sound land use especially using high-resolution remote sensing data. Therefore, this paper is to test the feasibility and applicability of classifying ecologically sound land using object-oriented classification method based on high-resolution remote sensing images, Pleiades-1 satellite images in Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province. Results showed that the overall classification accuracy was 87.43%, the users' accuracies and producers' accuracies of classification results of seven ecologically sound land types were higher than 80.00%. The classification result was in agreement with the field survey results. In addition, the experiment also indicated the segmentation result based on multi-threshold algorithm was closer to the real features in the shape, size, figure and texture comparing with that based on quadtree or chessboard algorithm. Different land use types can easily and efficiently extracted based on their difference in features using the assign classification method. Our research provides data support for evaluating ecologically sound land and it also provides a relatively rapid, accurate and practical way for finely classifying ecologically sound land.

TI  - Quantifying and characterizing the dynamics of urban greenspace at the patch level: A new approach using object-based image analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and quantitative description of spatial pattern of urban greenspace and its change over time is crucial for understanding ecosystem service provision and urban sustainability. Patches are the basic management and planning units in urban landscapes, and urban designers and planners and natural resource managers frequently seek tools to understand changes at the patch level. High spatial resolution imagery has been increasingly used to measure fine-scale changes of percent cover of urban greenspace. However, few studies have investigated the dynamics of urban greenspace at the patch level, to quantify the process of growth, shrinking, or disappearance of patches. Here, we developed a new approach to quantify and characterize urban greenspace change at the patch level, by implementing object-based image analysis. We used2.5 m resolution ALOS and SPOT image data captured in 2005 and 2009, and tested the new approach in Beijing, China. With this approach, we identify different types of change in patches of urban greenspace, such as expansion and shrinking, newly created, and totally lost, in addition to gain and loss information. The results show: 1) 9.25% of the total area (6179 ha) was generated from expansion of extant patches, while 5.36% (3582 ha) was lost due to shrinking of patches; 2) 0.91% (607 ha) of urban greenspace was totally removed, and 1.23% (821 ha) was newly created; and 3) Urban greenspace with different ranges of patch size, from 0.01 to 1000 ha, all experienced large changes, with a tendency for small-sized patches (< 1 ha) to be totally removed. This new approach provides an effective tool for better understanding changes of urban greenspace, and results from this study provide important insights for planners and managers to devise target-specific measures and plans to more effectively protect urban green space.

TI  - Feasibility of using mobile phone to estimate forest Leaf Area Index: a case study in Yunnan Pine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) is vital to describe the vegetation canopy and assess plant growth condition and healthy status. However, sufficient instant ground LAI samples are pre-required for calibration or validation, which is generally difficult to collect. We proposed a method, LAI-Mobile, to use mobile phones with low-cost fisheye lens to take fisheye photos and to invert LAIs, which may be popularized for ordinary people to generate big volume of LAI sample data. The feasibility of LAI-Mobile was tested by comparing with LAI-2200 and GF-1 satellite data (GF = high resolution) in a pest-invaded Yunnan pine forest area in Yunnan province of China. Results show significant correlation between LAI-2200 and LAI-Mobile data for forest plots with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.706 and Root Mean Square Error (RSME) = 0.241, and GF-1 satellite images (R-2 = 0.659 and RMSE = 0.268). The linear regression shows a good agreement between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product and the inverted GF-1 LAI, with R-2 = 0.649, RMSE = 0.795. Despite larger uncertainty for single fisheye image than LAI-2200, LAI-mobile can provide fast and convenient method to collect large amount of LAI, which will support remote sensing inversion of LAI at large scale.

AB  - The spectrum of water is directly related to the. composition of the water, so water quality can be estimated by spectral reflectance. In this paper, the inversion model of water quality parameters for remote sensing images is established, based on which the status of water pollution is analyzed. Firstly, the spectral information of water in studied area is extracted from remote sensing images. Then, the relationship between spectral reflectance and water quality parameters is modeled. The model is evaluated by the fitting SSE (Sum of the Squared Errors), R-square, RMSE (the Root Mean Squared Errors) and Adjusted R-square. When R-square and Adjusted R-square are close to 1 and the SSE and RMSE are close to 0, inversion model is considered to be built up successfully. The experiments are conducted on 14 Landsat 8 OLI images in recent four years and the results show that the model method can realize the analysis and monitoring of the water quality. The R-square of the permanganate and dissolved oxygen were 0.96 and 0.80 respectively, which satisfied the requirements of the application.

TI  - Large-scale assessments and mapping of snow hazards in pastoral areas of the Tibetan Plateau using microwave remote sensing data and ground records
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau frequently experiences snow hazards that endanger livelihoods of local herders. Fast mapping and risk assessments of snow hazards are significant and prerequisite for decision making in mitigating negative impacts of snow hazards and facilitating social adaptation. In this study, we intended to develop a method for fast mapping multiple grades of snow hazards happened on the Tibetan Plateau relying on satellite microwave remote sensing data that can represent critical snow conditions. First, we calculated pasture burial index and continuous days of snow cover and used the two factors to classify pixels of the study area into four grades of snow hazards. Second, we assessed the grades of snow hazards at county scale using the above two factors and the factor of snow cover percentage over each county. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of predicting multiple grades of snow hazards based on remotely sensed data by comparing the above results with ground-recorded historical snow hazards at county scale. The results indicated that the frequencies of four grades of snow hazards had similar spatial patterns with high frequencies in southeast areas and low frequencies in northeast and southwest areas of the Tibetan Plateau. The evaluation results showed that the overall accuracy of the method developed in this study was over 70% and the accuracy of predicting the severe grade of snow hazards was higher than that of the other grades. In conclusion, the method developed in this study was feasible and practical for mapping multiple grades of snow hazards happened on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Observations and Modeling of Coseismic and Postseismic Deformation Due To the 2015 <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use space geodetic data to investigate coseismic and postseismic deformation due to the 2015 M-w 7.8 Gorkha earthquake that occurred along the central Himalayan arc. Because the earthquake area is characterized by strong variations in surface relief and material properties, we developed finite element models that explicitly account for topography and 3-D elastic structure. We computed the line-of-sight displacement histories from three tracks of the Sentinel-1A/B Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) satellites, using persistent scatter method. InSAR observations reveal an uplift of up to approximate to 70mm over approximate to 20months after the main shock, concentrated primarily at the downdip edge of the ruptured asperity. GPS observations also show uplift, as well as southward movement in the epicentral area, qualitatively similar to the coseismic deformation pattern. Kinematic inversions of GPS and InSAR data and forward models of stress-driven creep suggest that the observed postseismic transient is dominated by afterslip on a downdip extension of the seismic rupture. A poroelastic rebound may have contributed to the observed uplift and southward motion, but the predicted surface displacements are small. We also tested a wide range of viscoelastic relaxation models, including 1-D and 3-D variations in the viscosity structure. Models of a low-viscosity channel previously invoked to explain the long-term uplift and variations in topography at the plateau margins predict opposite signs of horizontal and vertical displacements compared to those observed. Our results do not preclude a possibility of deep-seated viscoelastic response beneath southern Tibet with a characteristic relaxation time greater than the observation period (2years).

TI  - MAPPING SPATIAL VARIATION OF URBAN GREENING BASED ON QUANTITATIVE REMOTE SENSING
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - With the modification of urban structures and increasingly expanding urban areas, there will be a greater demand for urban greening as an important means to improve the urban environment. Urban green space systems are the main natural productive areas that play an important and positive role in ecological structure of the city. Changchun city in northeast China as was selected case study region for green spaces. Remote sensing data from SPOT 5 and the American Landsat TM data were used to extract vector data of urban borders and green spaces by man-computer interactive interpretation method based on experience. Also, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was estimated by a quantitative remote sensing method. The vegetation fraction is a general and quantitative index related to vegetation growth and has many important applications in evaluating land desertification, water resources, regional ecology, and global change research. The fractional coverage of vegetation was selected and estimated by "vegetation-impervious surfaces -soil" and physically explicit linear spectral mixing models. The spatial distribution of different green space types, compositions, and vegetation coverage were further analyzed by spatial analysis technology in a geographical information system. The results show that attached green space covered the highest area in Changchun city, followed by parkland with the two types accounting for 76.5% of the total area. Residential green space covered in the fourth largest area at 5.0%, which indicated that there was some green space associated city residents' daily life. The areas containing deciduous trees is largest compositional fraction at 45.1% of all the green space followed be grassland, with the two types accounted for 89.7% of the total area. Farmland and evergreen tree comprised the remaining small proportion. There are clear differences among vegetation coverage in the green space of Changchun city in terms of the NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index). Due to the distribution of the large amount of water in park land of Changchun city, the NDVI and vegetation fraction value was much lower in the whole park land. From the composition of green space, the results showed that the order of vegetation coverage was evergreen tree > deciduous trees > farmland > grassland.

T2  - WATER QUALITY AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT ISSUES IN SURFACE WATER
M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Port Elizabeth, SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - In this paper, changes of sediment yield and sediment transport were assessed using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This model was based on the integrated use of precipitation data, Landsat images in 2000, 2005 and 2010, terrain parameters (slope gradient and slope length) and soil composition in Zhifanggou watershed, Gansu Province, Northwestern China. The obtained results were basically consistent with the measured values. The results showed that the mean modulus of soil erosion is 1224, 1118 and 875 t km(-2) yr(-1) and annual soil loss is 23 130, 21 130 and 16 536 in 2000, 2005 and 2010 respectively. The measured mean erosion modulus were 1581 and 1377 t km(-2) yr(-1), and the measured annual soil loss were 29 872 and 26 022 t in 2000 and 2005. From 2000 to 2010, the amount of soil erosion was reduced yearly. Very low erosion and low erosion dominated the soil loss status in the three periods, and moderate erosion followed. The zones classified as very low erosion were increasing, whereas the zones with low or moderate erosion were decreasing. In 2010, no zones were classified as high or very high soil erosion.

TI  - Intensive precipitation observation greatly improves hydrological modelling of the poorly gauged high mountain Mabengnong catchment in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is one of the most critical inputs for models used to improve understanding of hydrological processes. In high mountain areas, it is challenging to generate a reliable precipitation data set capturing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to the harsh climate, extreme terrain and the lack of observations. This study conducts intensive observation of precipitation in the Mabengnong catchment in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau during July to August 2013. Because precipitation is greatly influenced by altitude, the observed data are used to characterize the precipitation gradient (PG) and hourly distribution (HD), showing that the average PG is 0.10, 0.28 and 0.26 mm/d/100 m and the average duration is around 0.1, 0.8 and 5.2 h for trace, light and moderate rain, respectively. A distributed biosphere hydrological model based on water and energy budgets with improved physical process for snow (WEB-DHMS) is applied to simulate the hydrological processes with gridded precipitation data derived from a lower altitude meteorological station and the PG and HD characterized for the study area. The observed runoff, MODIS/Terra snow cover area (SCA) data, and MODIS/Terra land surface temperature (LST) data are used for model calibration and validation. Runoff, SCA and LST simulations all show reasonable results. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that runoff is largely underestimated without considering PG, indicating that short-term intensive precipitation observation has the potential to greatly improve hydrological modelling of poorly gauged high mountain catchments.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Studying abundance and distributions of floating macroalgae such as pelagic Sargassum calls for long-term continuous and consistent observations from multiple satellite sensors. Previous studies mainly relied on observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). As a follow-on sensor, the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) also has the appropriate spectral bands to detect and quantify floating macroalgae. Based on previous works on MODIS, this study presents an improved procedure to extract floating algae pixels from VIIRS Alternative Floating Algae Index (AFAI) imagery, with image filtering used to suppress noise and adjusted thresholds used to mask sun glint, clouds, and cloud shadows. The overall extraction accuracy is about 85%. Simultaneous daily observations from MODIS and VIIRS over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) show consistent spatial patterns, but VIIRS estimations of the algae coverage (in km2) are consistently lower than MODIS (around - 19% mean relative difference or MRD), possibly due to lower sensitivity of the VIIRS near-infrared (NIR) bands than the corresponding MODIS bands. Similarly, at monthly scale VIIRS also shows lower coverage than MODIS, and their difference (around - 29% MRD) is larger than the difference between MODIS-Aqua and MODIS-Terra estimates (around - 14% MRD). Despite these differences, the spatial and temporal patterns between VIIRS and MODIS observed algae distributions match very well at all spatial and temporal scales. These results suggest that VIIRS can provide continuous and consistent observations of floating algae distributions and abundance from MODIS as long as their differences are accounted for, thus assuring continuity in the future. Furthermore, once Sargassum biomass per unit Sargassum area is determined from field measurements, conversion of these area estimates to Sargassum biomass is straightforward. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Surface reflectance spectrum is an important information in many applications. However, accurate retrieval of reflectance from remotely sensed data is difficult because of the existence of atmosphere. This paper described an improved physically-based algorithm to retrieve the aerosol optical thickness@550nm, columnar water vapor and the surface reflectance from airborne optical hyperspectral data. The improved method introduced were tested on synthetic and airborne collected optical hyperspectral data. The. RMSE between retrieved and measured land surface reflectance were less than 0.0299 and 0.0158 for tested artificial targets and agriculture crops, respectively. The results indicate that this method is reliable for atmospheric and surface reflectance retrieval from airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data.

The 30m England building height and volume data set was produced by fusing of freely available Landsat and global elevation data. Based on an object-based machine learning approach, it is the first freely available data set to provide 30m wall-to-wall coverage of urban structure at the scale of a country. This data set has been validated using Lidar measurements and achieved an RMSE of 1.61 meters for building height and an RMSE of 1,142 cubic meters for building volume.

AB  - Monitoring heavy metal stress on rice is of great significance for food security. In this paper, we used NDVI time series during the whole growing period of rice to identifying the rice growing differences under varied heavy metal stress. Here the NDVI time series were with high spatial-temporal resolution and obtained by blending MODIS and Landsat NDVI data. We extracted two kinds of features: Max NDVI value and time-integrated NDVI and use Fisher discrimination to explore the rice phonological differences under mild and severe stress levels. Results indicates that under severe stress the values of the metrics for presenting rice phonological differences in the experimental areas of heavy metal stress were smaller than the ones under mild stress. This means using the phenology differences can help to monitoring the heavy metal contamination.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fusion for daily Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are two newly launched satellites for global monitoring. The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensors have very different spatial and temporal resolutions (Sentinel-2 MSI sensor 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, 10 days, albeit 5 days with 2 sensors, conditional upon clear skies; Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor 300 m, < 1.4 days with 2 sensors). For local monitoring (e.g., the growing cycle of plants) one either has the desired spatial or temporal resolution, but not both. In this paper, spatio-temporal fusion is considered to fuse Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-3 images to create nearly daily Sentinel-2 images. A challenging issue in spatio-temporal fusion is that there can be very few cloud-free fine spatial resolution images temporally close to the prediction time, or even available, strong temporal (i.e., seasonal) changes may exist. To this end, a three-step method consisting of regression model fitting (RM fitting), spatial filtering (SF) and residual compensation (RC) is proposed, which is abbreviated as Fit-FC. The Fit-FC method can be performed using only one Sentinel-3 Sentinel-2 pair and is advantageous for cases involving strong temporal changes (i.e., mathematically, the correlation between the two Sentinel-3 images is small). The effectiveness of the method was validated using two datasets. The created nearly daily Sentinel-2 time-series images have great potential for timely monitoring of highly dynamic environmental, agricultural or ecological phenomena.

AB  - Landsat images are the most widely used satellite data; they are susceptible to cloud interference that will affects the subsequent applications. In this paper, an effective cloud detection algorithm is proposed for Landsat images by fusing multi-temporal Landsat data. The algorithm includes two parts: thick clouds detection based on the reflection characteristics of thick clouds in the blue band; and thin clouds detection by Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA). Experimental results indicate that the algorithm proposed has good accuracy and effectiveness both for thick and thin cloud detection in large area scene.

AB  - Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received substantial attention in the literature for object recognition (e.g., buildings and roads) in several remote sensing data modalities (e.g., aerial color imagery). Although CNNs have exhibited excellent recognition performance, recent research suggests that trained CNNs can often perform very poorly when applied to data collected over new geographic regions, and for which little labeled training data is available. In this work, we consider the adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) approach to address this limitation, due its recent success on related problems. A limitation of ADDA is that it is unsupervised, so in this work we extend ADDA to a semi-supervised algorithm, in which we assume that both labeled and unlabeled data are available in the new domain (e.g., in new geographic region to be evaluated). We compare semi-supervised ADDA to ADDA and a standard fine-tuning approach wherein available labeled data is used for standard CNN training. We perform experiments on two remote sensing datasets and the results indicate that semi-supervised ADDA consistently improves over the other approaches when small amounts of labeled training data are available in the new domain.

AB  - With the rapid development of micro-nano satellite technology, the light and compact design of laser communication receiving terminals has become the current development trend. Quadrant detector is a kind of photodetector of which photosensitive surface quadrant distribution. This characteristic makes quadrant detector not only detect signal of light, but also detect the position of spot. In this paper digital tracking and communication composite receiver for four-quadrant detector is designed. First, the quadrant detector converts the optical signal into an electrical signal. And then the pre-transimpedance amplifier circuit amplifies the signal and converts it into a voltage signal. Next, the A/D module photoelectric signals are converted into digital signals, and the FPGA based digital algorithms perform tracking and communication related signal processing. By theoretical analysis, when the bit error rate is 10(-6), the communication rate is 10Mbps and the signal to noise ratio is 90.09, the detection sensitivity is -45.06dbm. Also it is realized the position resolution of 6.29 mu m. Through the software implementation of tracking and communication function, the feasibility of the design is further verified, which lays the foundation for further development of the receiver.

AB  - Rapid urbanization in China has attracted the attention of researchers from different countries and regions due to its potential influence on the environment and local climate. In this study, Nanjing City was chosen as a research site to demonstrate the process of urban expansion as well as the associated land surface temperature change in a long time period. Multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite images acquired in April or May in 1985, 1991, 1996 and 2009 were used to document changes in land cover and land surface temperature (LST) using the support vector machine method and thermal image processing. Results showed that Nanjing City rapidly expanded over the study period, with impervious surface area replacing soil and vegetated land. Increasing LST was mostly due to the conversion of LULC change. This study provided an approximately quantification of the magnitude and spatial patterns of urbanization in Nanjing City, and urbanization was shown to be associated with the conversion of vegetative land cover, with likely negative consequences for biodiversity and local climate change.

TI  - Estimating the area burned by agricultural fires from Landsat 8 Data using the Vegetation Difference Index and Burn Scar Index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining an accurate estimate of the area of burned crops through remote sensing provides extremely useful data for the assessment of fire-induced trace gas emissions and grain loss in agricultural areas. A new method, incorporating the Vegetation Difference Index (VDI) and Burn Scar Index (BSI) models, is proposed for the extraction of burned crops area. The VDI model can greatly reduce the confounding effect of background information pertaining to green vegetation (forests and grasslands), water bodies and buildings; subsequent use of the BSI model could improve the accuracy of burned area estimations because of the reduction in the influence of background information. The combination of VDI and BSI enables the VDI to reduce the effect of non-farmland information, which in turn improves the accuracy and speed of the BSI model. The model parameters were established, and an effects analysis was performed, using a normalized dispersion value simulation based on a comparison of different types of background information. The efficacy of the VDI and BSI models was tested for a winter wheat planting area in the Haihe River Basin in central China. In comparison with other models, it was found that this method could effectively extract burned area information.

AB  - Taking the Shenfu mining area, located in the northwest of China, as an example, temporal and spatial changes of land use/cover and its human-driven mechanism were analyzed based on the land use and MODIS NDVI data. The results show that: (1) by the implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GGP), the area of cultivated land decreased, and grassland increased. By the exploitation of coal and other resources and the development of social and economic levels, the area of construction land increased. (2) The vegetation cover level in the mining area significantly increased from 2000 to 2015, and the implementation of GGP and the increase of precipitation were the main reasons. (3) The driving force of land use to forest land and grassland could increase the level of vegetation cover, such as with the GGP, and the promotion of cultivated land and construction land will lead to the reduction of vegetation cover level, such as with urban expansion and mining area construction caused by population growth and industrial development.

TI  - Planar block adjustment and orthorectification of Chinese spaceborne SAR YG-5 imagery based on RPC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yaogan-5(YG-5), launched in December 2008, is a Chinese high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, with a ground resolution of 3 m. However, the direct geometric positioning accuracy of YG-5 slant range images is low and so is the mosaic accuracy of the orthoimages. To improve the geometric accuracy of YG-5 orthoimages, this article proposes a strategy to calculate the rational polynomial coefficients for each SAR image and then uses a planar block adjustment method to solve for the orientation research parameters of the SAR images to achieve the orthorectification while a auxiliary digital elevation model is necessary for height constraint. Compared with the traditional orthorectification method using a single image, this strategy can ensure both uniformity in positioning accuracy of orthorectified images and high mosaic accuracy of adjacent orthoimages based on a small number of ground control points (GCPs). Tests using Chinese YG-5 satellite data over Xi'an and Xianning, China show that, using four GCPs positioned in the four corners of the test area, we can achieve independent check point plane accuracies better than +/- 4 m after the planar block adjustment. Finally, this article demonstrated that seamless mosaic geometry levels can be attained after the block orthorectification.

AB  - Intertidal habitats are important not only for the ecosystem services they provide but also because they represent a key ecotone between land and ocean. In this paper we explore the synergistic use of time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for mapping intertidal plant communities, using a Random Forest algorithm. We compare the performances of ten models with different input data. Results showed that the use of multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images could significantly improve the mapping accuracy compared to the use of any single-season image. There was no statistically significant difference in mapping accuracies between the use of multiseasonal and time series Sentinel-2 images. However, when combining time series Sentinel-1 data, time series Sentinel-2 data and NDVI statistic metrics, the highest mapping accuracy was achieved with an overall mapping accuracy of 77.7% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.75.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of high spatial resolution evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for water resources management at both regional and local scales. This research employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach (ESTARFM: Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) combined with a Two-Source N95 model and a constant evaporative fraction method to compute daily ET at 30 m spatial resolution. Two schemes are followed: the first scheme is to apply ESTARFM on the LST data to estimate daily ET at 30 m spatial resolution. The second scheme is to apply ESTARFM on the ET derived from MODIS and Landsat 8 images. The results show that the ET fused by both schemes is in good agreement with the reference ET data from the Landsat 8, while the first scheme (applying the ESTARFM on LST) is observed with more variations.

AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric pollutants (especially PM2.5), which may cause adverse effects on human health and the environment, are affected by urban vegetation through deposition and dispersion processes. Although lots of studies have been conducted to investigate this effect, we still lack the knowledge of how urban vegetation reduces PM2.5 and other air pollutions quantitatively. In this study, Landsat 8 data are used to retrieve the urban surface parameters (including Leaf Area Index and Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index). Meanwhile, hourly PM2.5 and other air pollutions concentrations over a period of one year (from Jan. 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2016) were obtained at a real-time air quality monitoring system in Shenzhen, P.R. China. It is found that, urban vegetation has little effect on air pollutants. Meanwhile, the results show that, a strong relationship between impervious surface and air pollutants are found.

AB  - Realistic digital elevations of urban areas are required in urban studies but are not always available. There is a need to extract urban information from satellite images that can be used for, but not limited to, studies of the urban wind environment. This study evaluates urban geometries, including building heights and building footprints, extracted from various satellite images by large-eddy simulations for air ventilation assessment (AVA). The result shows that building heights extracted from TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and the fused results of SAR and WorldView-2 optical (stereo) images are suitable for AVA. Better performance in representing tall buildings, rather than low buildings, is found to be more important for AVA purposes. Moreover, the performance of building geometries retrieved from fused satellite images with and without real building footprints is comparable, which suggests that building footprints extracted from stereo images are reliable.

TI  - Fine spatial resolution coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery by integrating downscaling and pansharpening approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat series images are the main data resources used for coastline monitoring. However, the 30m spatial resolution of multispectral (MS) image is always dominated by mixed pixels around the coast areas. Given that the latest Landsat-8 Operational Lands Imager (OLI) imagery has a 15m panchromatic (PAN) band, it is instinctive to improve the coastline extracting accuracy by directly using the pansharpening approach. The spatial resolution of the sharpened MS image, however, may still not be sufficient in real applications, due to the meter-level spatial-temporal change of coastline. In this letter, a novel downscaling-then-pansharpening coastline extracting (DTPCE) approach is proposed to extract higher accuracy coastline from Landsat-8 OLI imagery. DTPCE first uses the radial basis function (RBF) method to downscale the 15m PAN band to a finer spatial resolution, and then produces a fine spatial resolution fused MS image by pansharpening of the downscaled PAN band and original MS bands. Finally, the fused MS image is used for coastline extracting. Comparing the extracted coastline with the reference coastline extracted from 5.8m ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) MS image, DTPCE produced coastlines with the state-of-the-art representation in terms of both the visually and quantitatively analysis.

The influencing factors affecting the correlation between MODIS AOT and PM2.5 were studied, and the correlation coefficient between them was also greatly improved. Therefore, it is of great value to use MODIS AOT to monitor the distribution of PM2.5 in atmospheric particulate pollutants.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the capability of Compact Polarized (CP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to classify multi-sea-surface characteristics (defined as typical sea surface suspended sediments, such as oil spills algal look-alikes and algal blooms). CP reconstruction is carried out on two C-band RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized (QP) SAR images using Nord's algorithm. The accuracies of the reconstructed polarized signatures of the multi-sea-surface characteristics of open water, oil spills and algal blooms derived from QP original quad-polarized data (quad-pol) and CP reconstructed approximate quad-polarized data (namely pseudo quad-pol) are then compared and analyzed. In addition, 10 types of polarization parameters are chosen in order to investigate the accuracy of the reconstruction for open water, oil spills and algal blooms. A comparison of the results shows that, of the chosen parameters, the reconstruction accuracies for sigma(0)(HH), sigma(0)(VV), , l(1), l(2) and are the highest whereas the accuracies obtained for sigma(0)(HV), l(3), H and A are unsatisfactory. The influence of reconstructed CP polarization parameters on the classification of multi-sea-surface characteristics is also assessed. Based on an assessment of this classification, it is concluded that the hybrid polarization (CTLR) mode should be adopted for the reconstruction of sigma(0)(HH), sigma(0)(VV), l(1), H and whereas the /4 mode should be used for the reconstruction of sigma(0)(HV), , l(2) and l(3).

The north coastal wetland of Zhejiang is selected as the test case, which is operated by on-site measure as reference results, matched up with three scenes of GF-3 Quad Polarized Strip I (QPSI) mode SAR imagery. Based on the collected datasets, three well-known methods of Pauli, Freeman and H/A/Alpha decomposition are performed to data processing, and the experimental results reveal that reliable observation capability of GF-3 quad-polarized SAR is verified. The promising preliminary results indicate that GF-3 is encouraging for operational implementation, especially for coastal wetland observation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the capability of compact polarized (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to retrieve ocean wave field parameters. Souyris' and Nord's algorithms are used to carry out the reconstruction of CP SAR pseudo quad-polarized data for the ocean surface under both the circular transmit linear receive (CTLR) and pi/4 mode. The results show that, for the CP reconstruction, Nord's algorithm has a better convergence ability than Souyris'. In addition, the investigation of the reconstruction accuracy shows that the CTLR mode is superior to the pi/4 mode, in terms of ocean surface reconstruction. It is, therefore, concluded that the reconstructed parameters of CP CTLR mode data by Nord's algorithm adapt to retrieve ocean wave information. The ocean wave slope spectrum and other main wave parameters are also calculated from reconstructed CP data and compared with measurements from in situ National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) matched-up buoys. Comparison of CP SAR-based wave field information with buoy outputs also shows good agreement in the case of dominate wave height, wave direction, and wave period, with biases of 0.36 m, 17.96 degrees, and 0.88 s, respectively.

AB  - For hyperspectral image classification, we present a novel graph based semi-supervised classification method that learns from similarity and dissimilarity on labeled and unlabeled data, which contain both the adjacency graph and the dissimilar graph. Since manifold learning approach is capable of exploring the manifold geometry of data, it is suitable for calculating the adjacency graph with label similarity. A manifold learning method was utilized to calculate the adjacency graph. Dissimilarity among examples probably be used to construct the dissimilar graph, which is hard to grasp. The dissimilar probability was proposed to construct the dissimilar graph, which has effectively improved the classification accuracy of hyperspectral data in experiment.

AB  - Accurately estimating the spatial distribution of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is important because of its carbon budget forms part of the global carbon cycle. This paper presented three methods for obtaining forest AGB based on a forest growth model, a Multiple-Forward-Mode (MFM) method and a stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) model. A Li-Strahler geometricoptical canopy reflectance model (GOMS) with the ZELIG forest growth model was run using HJ1B imagery to derive forest AGB. GOMS-ZELIG simulated data were used to train the SGB model and AGB estimation. The GOMS-ZELIG AGB estimation was evaluated for 24 field-measured data and compared against the GOMS-SGB model and GOMS-MFM biomass predictions from multispectral HJ1B data. The results show that the estimation accuracy of the GOMS-MFM model is slightly higher than that of the GOMS-SGB model. The GOMS-ZELIG and GOMS-MFM models are considerably more accurate at estimating forest AGB in arid and semiarid regions.

AB  - Human activities and discharged river pollution affect the marine ecological environment. Therefore, it is very important to study how human activities affect the offshore ecological environment by monitoring the fluxes of terrestrial materials from rivers over long-times sequence. Landsat satellite data, which began in the 1970s, are of great value for monitoring changes in water quality in many small and medium-size rivers in China, which lacked field observation data in the early years. Because river water is usually turbid and the composition of water is complex, there is no uniform precise atmospheric correction. In addition, components of inland riverine water are different, so we need to build regional high-precision total suspended matter (TSM) inversion model. Based on Landsat-8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) data, we evaluate the applicability of different atmospheric correction methods (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes-FLAASH, Dark Subtraction-DS and Quick Atmospheric Correction-QUAC) to Oujiang River. The results show that FLAASH gives good atmospheric correction, with the mean relative error of each band being around 15%. We collected three occurrences of measured data synchronized with the Landsat-8 satellite. Based on the measured TSM and remote sensing reflectance spectrum data, we analyze the correlation between different band combinations and TSM. The results show that the equivalent remote sensing reflectance ratio of OLI (482nm)/OLI (865nm) is highly correlated. Finally, we apply the established regional TSM inversion model to the OLI data in Oujiang River basin and comprehensively analyze the long-term changes of TSM concentration in the Oujiang River.

AB  - This paper uses the Xilin Gol League as a research area, based on Landsat TM and meteorological data for the past 15 years, selects three periods of remote sensing images to use RS, GIS technology and dynamic degree and landscape index to select the landscape pattern and desertification dynamics of sandy land from 2000 to 2015. The driving force factor is analyzed. The results show that the degree of fragmentation of the sandy landscape in the Xilin Gol district was reduced from 2000 to 2015, the landscape patch area was regularized, and the disturbance intensity of human activities on sandy land was reduced; the degree of desertification generally showed a reversal trend, but there was a development trend during the period. Further research shows that from 2000 to 2015, the main factors affecting the reversal of desertification are the increase of precipitation and the implementation of national and local policies in order to provide a theoretical basis for the desertification control project of the motherland and the protection of ecological security in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

AB  - In-situ water quality sampling is used for accurate water quality assessment. However, in-situ water quality sampling offers limited samples and requires much time and intensive labors. Remote sensing approach has recently applied for water quality assessment. It has shown the advantage of offering a synoptic view but also more efficient and economical.In this study, we utilized Landsat Imagery to estimate the water quality of the Tamsui River basin, considered as one of the most important rivers located in the north of Taiwan. In order to monitor water quality of Tamsui River basin, a linear regression relation between the value of spectral radiance and four water quality parameters are investigated with 38 water sampling stations. Through the regression model, we could estimate river pollution index (RPI) from the predicted value of four water quality parameters. By using RPI, we can examine the pollution level of Tamsui River. The accuracy of RPI conversion of this study ranged from 32.2% to 68.2%.

CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The light collected from remote sensors taken from space must transit through the Earth's atmosphere. All satellite images are affected at some level by lightwave scattering and absorption from aerosols, water vapor and particulates in the atmosphere. For generating high-quality scientific data, atmospheric correction is required to remove atmospheric effects and to convert digital number (DN) values to surface reflectance (SR). Every optical satellite in orbit observes the earth through the same atmosphere, but each satellite image is impacted differently because atmospheric conditions are constantly changing. A physics-based detailed radiative transfer model 6SV requires a lot of key ancillary information about the atmospheric conditions at the acquisition time. This paper investigates to achieve the simultaneous acquisition of atmospheric radiation parameters based on the multi-spectral information, in order to improve the estimates of surface reflectance through physics-based atmospheric correction. Ancillary information on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total water vapor (TWV) derived from the multi-spectral information based on specific spectral properties was used for the 6SV model. The experimentation was carried out on images of Sentinel-2, which carries a Multispectral Instrument (MSI), recording in 13 spectral bands, covering a wide range of wavelengths from 440 up to 2200 nm. The results suggest that per-pixel atmospheric correction through 6SV model, integrating AOD and TWV derived from multi-spectral information, is better suited for accurate analysis of satellite images and quantitative remote sensing application.

AB  - Obtaining city models in a large scale is usually achieved by means of remote sensing techniques, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and optical image stereogrammetry. Despite the controlled quality of these products, such observation is restricted by the characteristics of their sensor platform, such as revisit time and spatial resolution. Over the last decade, the rapid development of online geographic information systems, such as Google map, has accumulated vast amount of online images. Despite their uncontrolled quality, these images constitute a set of redundant spatial-temporal observations of our dynamic 3D urban environment. These images contain useful information that can complement the remote sensing data, especially the SAR images.This paper presents a one of the first studies of fusing online street view images and spaceborne SAR images, for the reconstruction of spatial-temporal (hence 4D) city models. We describe a general approach to geometrically combine the information of these two types of images that are nearly impossible to even coregister without a precise 3D city model due to their distinct imaging geometry. It is demonstrated that, one can obtain a new kind of city model that includes high resolution optical texture for better scene understanding and the dynamics of individual buildings up to the precision of millimeter retrieved from SAR interferometry.

AB  - The joint interpretation of very high resolution SAR and optical images in dense urban area are not trivial due to the distinct imaging geometry of the two types of images. Especially, the inevitable layover caused by the side-looking SAR imaging geometry renders this task even more challenging. Only until recently, the "SARptical" framework [1], [2] proposed a promising solution to tackle this. SARptical can trace individual SAR scatterers in corresponding high-resolution optical images, via rigorous 3-D reconstruction and matching. This paper introduces the SARptical dataset(1), which is a dataset of over 10,000 pairs of corresponding SAR, and optical image patches extracted from TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight images and aerial UltraCAM optical images. This dataset opens new opportunities of multisensory data analysis. One can analyze the geometry, material, and other properties of the imaged object in both SAR and optical image domain. More advanced applications such as SAR and optical image matching via deep learning [3], [4] is now also possible.

AB  - With the advantages of all-time, all-weather, and wide coverage, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are widely used for ship detection to ensure marine surveillance. However, the azimuth ambiguity and buildings exhibit similar scattering mechanisms of ships, which cause false alarms in the detection of ships. To address this problem, self-designed deep convolutional neural networks with the capability to automatically learn discriminative features is applied in this paper. Two datasets, including one dataset reconstructed from IEEEDataPort SARSHIPDATA and the other constructed from 10 scenes of Sentinel-1 SAR images, are used to evaluate our approach. Experimental results reveal that our model achieves more than 95% classification accuracy on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - With the capabilities of constant use in any weather condition and a wide coverage area, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology is widely used in marine transportation safety and fishing law enforcement. Currently, due to automatic learning of discriminative features, deep learning has achieved enormous success in object detection. Compared to other detection models, the single shot multiBox detector (SSD) has the advantages of high detection accuracy with relatively high speed, which is suitable for inferences in a large volume of SAR images. This paper focuses on the application of the SSD to address ship detection in complex backgrounds. Due to a limited number of datasets, transfer learning is adapted to train the model. Ten scenes of Sentinel-1 SAR images are used to evaluate our approach. Experimental results reveal that 1) transfer learning improves the detection accuracy and overall performance and reduces the false positives, and 2) compared with the faster RCNN and other SSD models, the SSD-512 model with transfer learning achieves the best overall performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - With the development of space satellites, a large number of high-resolution remote sensing images have been produced, so the analysis and application of high-resolution remote sensing images are very important. Recently deep learning provides a new method to increase the accuracy of land-cover classification. This study aims to propose a classification framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to carry out remote sensing scene classification. After remote sensing images are trained by CNN, a model which can extract complex characteristic from the image for classification is created. In this paper, GaoFen-2(GF-2) satellite data is used as data sources and Jilin province of China is selected as the study area. Firstly, the preprocessed images are made into a GF-2 satellite data sets. Secondly, CaffeNet is used to train the data sets through Caffe platform and the classification result is obtained. The CNN overall accuracy is 89.88%, the Kappa coefficient is 0.8026. Compared with the traditional BP neural network classification result, it is obviously find the CNN is more suitable for remote sensing image classification.

AB  - Multi-source remote sensing data were used to generate 500-m resolution cloud-free daily snow cover images for the Northern Hemisphere. Simultaneously, the spatial and temporal dynamic variations of snow in the Northern Hemisphere were evaluated from 2000 to 2015. The results indicated that (1) the maximum, minimum, and annual average snow-covered area (SCA) in the Northern Hemisphere exhibited a fluctuating downward trend; the variation of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere had well-defined inter-annual and regional differences; (2) the average SCA in the Northern Hemisphere was the largest in January and the smallest in August; the SCA exhibited a downward trend for the monthly variations from February to April; and the seasonal variation in the SCA exhibited a downward trend in the spring, summer, and fall in the Northern Hemisphere (no pronounced variation trend in the winter was observed) during the 2000-2015 period; (3) the spatial distribution of the annual average snow-covered day (SCD) was related to the latitudinal zonality, and the areas exhibiting an upward trend were mainly at the mid to low latitudes with unstable SCA variations; and (4) the snow reduction was significant in the perennial SCA in the Northern Hemisphere, including high-latitude and high-elevation mountainous regions (between 35 degrees and 50 degrees N), such as the Tibetan Plateau, the Tianshan Mountains, the Pamir Plateau in Asia, the Alps in Europe, the Caucasus Mountains, and the Cordillera Mountains in North America.

AB  - In order to meet the high-speed downlink data transmission requirements of medium and low-orbit remote sensing satellites, higher spectrum efficiency is achieved under limited frequency band resources. This paper proposes an adaptive coding and modulation technique aiming at the problem of waste of link margin in the traditional data transmission mode. It can realize full utilization of link margin and improve spectrum efficiency under the premise of reliable transmission. Through link calculation and simulation verification, the spectrum utilization rate of the remote sensing data transmission under adaptive mode is 1.8 times that of the traditional constant coding and modulation mode.

AB  - In the K-means algorithm, every pixel in a super-space is required to calculate Euclidean distance for clustering, so it is time-consuming computing when there are a great many class centers. Improved K-means clustering algorithm presented here could save initial clustering time by making initial division based on previous clustering results, and maintain the relationship among stable classes. Only calculating and comparing distances with neighbor centers, near to the pixel except those far away from it, accelerates clustering process with more and more classes becoming stable. Clustering lossless compression algorithm can efficiently eliminate the inter spectral and intra-spectral redundancy at high convergent speed through enhancing intra-class redundancy. The multi-level clustering process can not only remove the spatial redundancy but also delete the residue redundancy, whose importance in lossless compression was overlooked previously, realizing a breakthrough lossless compression ratio at 2.882 for multi-spectral images. The comparison of the parameter analysis of the TM (Landsat Thematic Mapper) images with other lossless compression algorithms shows that this multilevel clustering lossless compression algorithm is more efficient.

TI  - Comparison of cloud top heights derived from FY-2 meteorological satellites with heights derived from ground-based millimeter wavelength cloud radar
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are currently observed by both ground-based and satellite remote sensing techniques. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the observation method, instrument performance and the methods used for retrieval. It is important to study synergistic cloud measurements to improve the reliability of the observations and to verify the different techniques. The FY-2 geostationary orbiting meteorological satellites continuously observe the sky over China. Their cloud top temperature product can be processed to retrieve the cloud top height (CTH). The ground-based millimeter wavelength cloud radar can acquire information about the vertical structure of clouds such as the cloud base height (CBH), CTH and the cloud thickness and can continuously monitor changes in the vertical profiles of clouds. The CTHs were retrieved using both cloud top temperature data from the FY-2 satellites and the cloud radar reflectivity data for the same time period (June 2015 to May 2016) and the resulting datasets were compared in order to evaluate the accuracy of CTH retrievals using FY-2 satellites. The results show that the concordance rate of cloud detection between the two datasets was 78.1%. Higher consistencies were obtained for thicker clouds with larger echo intensity and for more continuous clouds. The average difference in the CTH between the two techniques was 1.46 km. The difference in CTH between low -and mid-level clouds was less than that for high-level clouds. An attenuation threshold of the cloud radar for rainfall was 0.2 mm/min; a rainfall intensity below this threshold had no effect on the CTH. The satellite CTH can be used to compensate for the attenuation error in the cloud radar data.

TI  - Thin semitransparent cloud removal in coastal area of the South China Sea using an atmospheric correction method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF CLOUDS AND THE ATMOSPHERE XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Thin semitransparent cloud removal is not an easy task, because the data optical remote sensing satellite acquired contains not only the information from the terrain object but also the information from the thin semitransparent cloud. For this reason, an atmospheric correction method was used in this study to remove the effect of cloud. A case study is carried out in the world famous cloudy area in the coastal area of the South China Sea. The qualitative and quantitative results show this method works well in the coastal area of cloudy South China Sea. It will make full use of the potential of GF-1 and Landsat data in this area by using this method.

TI  - Social media analytics for natural disaster management
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Social media analytics has become prominent in natural disaster management. In spite of a large variety of metadata fields in social media data, four dimensions (i.e. space, time, content and network) have been given particular attention for mining useful information to gain situational awareness and improve disaster response. In this article, we review how existing studies analyze these four dimensions, summarize common techniques for mining these dimensions, and then suggest some methods accordingly. We then propose a schema to categorize the gathered articles into 15 classes and facilitate the generation of data analysis tasks. We find that (1) a large part of studies involve multiple dimensions of social media data in their analyses, (2) there are both separate analyses for each dimension and simultaneous analyses for multiple dimensions and (3) there are fewer simultaneous analyses as dimensions increase. Finally, we suggest research opportunities and challenges in fusing social media data with authoritative datasets, i.e. census data and remote-sensing data.

TI  - Extraction of coastal raft cultivation area with heterogeneous water background by thresholding object-based visually salient NDVI from high spatial resolution imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of high spatial resolution satellite imaging has enabled the acquisition of mariculture area information. This data could play an important role in mariculture investigations, ocean disaster evaluations, and coastal management. Because chlorophyll is concentrated in the widely distributed raft culture (a major kind of mariculture), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used for extraction. However, extensive coastal raft culture is easily confused with the heterogeneous water background. This results in unsatisfactory extraction when surveying a large water area with heterogeneous water background. By combining object-based image analysis and the centre-surround mechanism of a visual attention model, we propose an object-based visually salient NDVI (OBVS-NDVI) feature. Comparison experiments using Gaofen-2 spectral imagery of Luoyuan Bay, Fuzhou, China, indicate that OBVS-NDVI can effectively discriminate raft cultivation areas over large areas with a heterogeneous water background.

AB  - Due to limitation of observation angles and resolution of satellite sensor, the resolution of surface albedo products retrieved based on angle information is usually coarse, such as MODIS albedo products and GLASS albedo products. Downscaling method of stratified linear regression proposed in this study solved this problem. First, under the assumption of non-anisotropy surface, Landsat8 primary albedo is obtained by converting narrow albedo to broadband albedo. Under the resolution of 500m, the correlation degree of Landsat8 primary shortwave albedo and MCD43A3 shortwave albedo shows higher after classification. Therefore, a linear regression model for each land cover is established. By fusing Landsat8 data with MCD43A3 albedo, downscaled shortwave albedo with high-resolution is obtained. Finally, it is validated with data of four observation sites in the United States. The results show that downscaled albedo has high precision (bias is 0.01 and sd is 0.012) and rich details, and the algorithm is reliable for different land cover, indicating its potential to become an operational algorithm for high-resolution albedo product.

AB  - Spectral vegetation indices are powerful tools in statistically estimating leaf area index (LAI) with remotely sensed imagery. However, the band selection in some generic vegetation indices influenced their performance to a great extent due to the rapid development of new sensors. As the latest launched satellite carried with multispectral sensors, Sentinel-2 provides 3 extra red-edge bands and 1 extra SWIR band. For the purpose of statistical LAI retrieval based on Sentinel-2 data, the optimal bands combination of the DVI, SR and NDVI-formed spectral indices were selected on the basis of correlation analysis. The experiment results demonstrated that band 7 (red-edge) and 8 (near-infrared) of Sentinel-2 MSI data were the optimal bands combination of LAI retrieval. And finally the optimal spectral index were validate with the in-situ LAI observations, which performed satisfied estimated accuracy.

AB  - Land Surface Albedo is an important surface parameter and is widely applied to the surface energy balance, mid-term and long-term weather forecast and atmospheric general circulation model. GF-4 satellite is the first geostationary orbit satellite which combines high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution in China. In order to explore the feasibility of semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model applied on GF-4 satellite data, the earth's surface classification is joined to give kernel factors initial value, and Powell iteration algorithm is used to optimize the result of model. Then the land surface narrow band albedos of each band could be gained through angle integration on BRDF model. On this basis, combining spectral library with spectral response function of GF-4 satellite, the conversions of narrow to broadband albedo for GF-4 satellite data is built for the first time. And albedo inversion in short wave band (0.3-3 um) are acquired. Finally, cross validation used by MODIS albedo product indicates that an accurate land surface albedo could be acquired by this method.

AB  - The conventional shape similarity measurements of remote sensing data face problems in the situation of noise interference, partial information occlusion and missing. A method of shape similarity measurement based on principal curvature enhancement distance transformation is proposed. The distance transformation is carried out to extend the range of the shape contour, improving the robustness of the similarity measure. Besides, to ensure the accuracy of measurement results, the distance map is enhanced by the principal curvature of the shape contour, improving the response of contours with rich information. Application experiments of road vectors with GPS data and optical remote sensing images show that the method is effective in practical application.

TI  - Governance issues constraining the deployment of flood resilience strategies in Maroua, Far North Region of Cameroon
T2  - DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Cities across the globe, particularly those of the less developed world, face long-term challenges associated with floods which impact negatively on the resilience of city systems and their inhabitants. In the city of Maroua, most urban management stakeholders have been unable to integrate flood resilience research into urban development issues. It is against this background that the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the governance issues constraining the deployment of flood resilience strategies implemented by residents in flood-prone zones and those used by the government via administrative authorities and institutions charged with urban development to flood-related risks in the city of Maroua, Far North Region of Cameroon.Design/methodology/approach - Field surveys, participant observations, interviews, and on-the-spot appraisals were carried out with residents in flood-prone neighbourhoods and municipal authorities on the state of recurrent floods including mitigating strategies being implemented.Findings - The results revealed that Maroua has a fragile ecological setting which has increased the vulnerability of the town to flood-related risks. This is further aggravated by the fact that municipal authorities are yet to have a thorough mastery of such recurrent flood incidences due to their limited planning horizons, rendering the urban poor disproportionately susceptible to flood-related stresses. This exposes them to unavoidable flood associated hazards such as water borne diseases (typhoid and cholera) as they are bogged down by physical and financial limitations. Besides, decision-making processes in relation to managing urban systems are not guided by good governance as efforts to enhance and integrate the local population for flood resilience are neither participatory nor inclusive, ushering the urban environment of Maroua into a frivolous path to profligacy.Originality/value - For resilience to be deeply entrenched, the paper proffers for the mainstreaming of flood resilience strategies into urban development plans through multi-stakeholder involvement across different sectors and departments, as well as the setting up of a practical time table for monitoring the progress of these measures through geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and geographical information systems.

TI  - Metastatic Melanoma in Sentinel Node-Negative Patients: The Ottawa Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node involvement is a major independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with malignant melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) detection of microscopic nodal melanoma has been shown to improve both 5-year survival and 5-year disease-free survival.Objective: To determine the rate of metastatic melanoma in SLNB-negative patients at long-term follow-up.Methods: Study subjects include all 152 patients who had a negative SLNB and were followed at the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre (ORCC) between 1999 and 2004. Patients with a follow-up period less than 6 months, more than 1 primary melanoma, and metastatic melanoma at diagnosis were excluded. Age at diagnosis, sex, Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitoses, regression, Clark level, anatomical location, development of metastatic melanoma, time to detection of metastatic disease, and time to death from melanoma were studied.Results: In this retrospective study at the ORCC, 40 of 140 (28.6%) patients with a single primary melanoma developed metastatic melanoma following negative SLNB at a mean follow-up of 63 months.Conclusion: The rate of metastatic melanoma following negative SLNB at long-term follow-up at the ORCC is higher than the upper limit of rates reported in the literature (6%-24%). The reason for this is multifactorial, and the long follow-up period of 5 years allowed for detection of metastatic disease at a mean of 3.9 years. Long-term prognosis may be guarded in node-negative patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma, and surveillance by a multidisciplinary team is crucial.

TI  - Liverpool Merchants in 19th-Century Niger Delta <i>Impact of Business Practices and Ethos on Missions</i>
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES AND MISSIONS-SCIENCES SOCIALES ET MISSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - How does religion or worldview affect business practices and ethics? This tradition of inquiry goes back, at least, to Max Weber who, in the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, explored the impact of theological suppositions on capitalist economic development. But the connection can also go the other way. So the focus of inquiry can become: How does business ethics or practices affect ethics in a given nation or corporation? This paper inquires into how the political and economic conditions created and sustained by nineteenth-century trading community in the Niger Delta influenced religious practices or ethics of Christian missionaries. This approach to mission study is necessary not only because we want to further understand the work of Christian missions and also to tease out the effect of business ethics on religious ethics, but also because Christian missionaries came to the Niger Delta in the nineteenth century behind foreign merchants.

TI  - A procedure for semi-automated cadastral boundary feature extraction from high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Fit-for-purpose land administration aims to align cadastral policies, administration and technology selection with the prevailing societal needs and capacity within a country context. It seeks to support delivery of more rapid and low-cost cadastral boundary mapping - and ultimately more widespread land tenure security. The philosophy suggests that when high positional accuracies are not the primary concern, but when time pressure is, high-resolution satellite images can serve as a source for creating cadastral boundary information. This paper explores the potential of mean-shift segmentation plug-in in QGIS to semi-automatically extract cadastral boundaries in rural areas - based on the land cover information from WorldView-2 satellite images. The segmentation gives a vector file satisfying many cadastral boundary requirements and ready to be used in a GIS environment. The buffer overlay method was used to assess the quality of extracted boundaries. For a non-vegetated terrain having visible boundaries, the approach could be taken as an alternative to support existing, relatively slow, boundary mapping approaches by minimizing the effects of manual digitization and surveying.

TI  - Detection accuracy of new well sites using Landsat time series data: a case study in the Alberta Oil Sands Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest change features related to resource exploration and extraction are important in the Alberta Oil Sands Region (AOSR), where, for example, 2486 oil and gas well sites were established in a 5000 km(2) area on three leases in the period 1984-2011. A newly established well site is typically readily identified visually in Landsat multispectral and high spatial resolution imagery, but poses an automated detection and mapping challenge over larger areas and long time periods relative to other major disturbance features. In this study, Landsat time series image composites from the national Composite-2-Change (C2C) change detection protocol were used in a comparison to randomly sampled, independently-generated well site reference data. The highest accuracy reported was approximately 83%, with relatively low errors of omission (13%) and high errors of commission (up to 37%). Future research will incorporate well site disturbance object characteristics in this type of regionally-sensitive forest change analysis.

AB  - JAXA has developed the Advanced Optical Satellite (ALOS-3) as a successor to the optical mission of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) "Daichi" (2006 - 2011) since FY 2016. The wide-swath and high-resolution optical imager (WISH) is the main instrument of ALOS-3 and equipped with a panchromatic (Pa) band and 6 multispectral (MS) bands. For the optics of WISH, a large off-axis four mirror anastigmat type has been selected to achieve both high-resolution (0.8 m Pa, 3.2 m MS) and wide-swath (70 km). The proto-flight model (PFM) of all mirrors has already in the precision polishing process, and highly accurate measurements of large off-axis aspherical surfaces (primary and tertiary mirror) are carried out both in a contact and a non-contact method. The verification concerning the high precision assembly of the large off-axis optical system was also carried out using the structural model which is manufactured with the same design for the PFM. Manufacture and test of the PFM of WISH would be conducted over the next one year and the PFM would be delivered to the ALOS-3 satellite system within FY 2019. ALOS-3 is scheduled to be launch from Tanegashima Space Center in FY 2020.

AB  - JAXA has continued to develop the Advanced Optical Satellite (called "ALOS-3") since FY 2016, as a successor of the optical mission of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) "DAICHI" (2006-2011). The wide-swath and high-resolution optical imager (WISH) is a main sensor of ALOS-3. It has capabilities to collect high-resolution (0.8m Pan / 3.2m MS at nadir) and wide-swath (70 km) images with a high geo-location accuracy to meet the mission objectives of ALOS-3. WISH has a Pan band and 6 MS bands. The MS equips the basic four bands (R, G, B and NIR) and 2 additional bands of "coastal" and "RedEdge" expected to use for the various applications.The development of WISH is in the final stage of the critical design phase. We have finished the test of engineering model of the primary mirror assembly with no critical problem. In addition, the mechanical environmental tests using the structure model was completed, and the demonstration for high accuracy assembling of the large off-axis telescope is undergoing. For the detector system, the evaluation of the engineering model of the CCDs was completed in early phase, and assembly of the flight CCDs has been started in advance.In the current schedule, PFM manufacturing and subsequent proto-flight tests would be conducted within about a year and WISH would be delivered to the satellite system by the middle of FY 2019. ALOS-3 equipped with WISH would be launched by H-IIA rocket in FY 2020.

AB  - Beam splitters separating visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light are an important component of many optical systems such as spectrometers or telescopes. Here, one part of the spectrum is transmitted while the other is reflected. Typical goal requirements are broadband high transmittance and high reflectance without local minima combined with a steep transition zone. These requirements drive the complexity of the coating design. Beside the coating design also the deposition technology has an impact on the feasibility of the coating.In this contribution, we address manufacturing challenges for manufacturing of an ideal beam splitter and compare Ion Assisted Deposition (IAD) and Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputtering (PARMS) technology by presenting examples of VIS-NIR beam splitters manufactured at Optics Balzers Jena GmbH (OBJ). These examples reach from beam splitters manufactured by IAD with a total coating thickness of about 3.5 mu m to the beam splitter of Sentinel 2 multi-spectral instrument with more than 100 layers a and a coating thickness of about 13 mu m. An example which overcomes the limitations of the IAD process is the dichroic plate of ESAs Euclid telescope manufactured by OBJ by means of PARMS process. This dichroic plate shows a reflectance of over 99% in the VIS spectral range and a transmittance of more than 98% in the NIR spectral range. Both mentioned manufacturing technologies are discussed in terms of process stability, coating homogeneity, and straylight limitations.

TI  - The Role of Geospatial Technologies in Communicating a More Effective Hazard Assessment: Application of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - OBSERVING THE VOLCANO WORLD: VOLCANO CRISIS COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Remote sensing data and the application of geo-spatial technologies have progressively been built into real-time volcanic hazard assessment. Remote sensing of volcanic processes provides a unique synoptic view of the developing hazard, and provides insights into the ongoing activity without the need for direct, on-the-ground observations. Analysis and visualization of these data through the geospatial tools, like Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and new virtual globes, brings new perspectives into the decision support system. In this chapter, we provide examples of (i) how remote sensing has assisted in real-time analysis of active volcanoes; (ii) how by combining multiple sensors at different spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions one is able to better understand a given hazard, leading to better communication and decision making; and (iii) how visualizing this in a common platform, like a GIS tool or virtual globe, augments effective hazard assessment system. We will illustrate how useful remote sensing data can be for volcanic hazard assessment, including the benefits and challenges in real-time decision support, and how the geo-spatial tools can be useful to communicate the potential hazard through a common operation protocol.

TI  - An inverse method for estimating air volume fraction of sea foam from emissivity data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The air volume fraction (AVF) of a sea foam layer is a key parameter that affects the microwave emissivity and brightness temperature of the sea surface. To extract AVF of a sea foam layer from the measured emissivity data at microwave frequencies, a novel retrieval method is developed based on the spectral representation of effective dielectric constant of sea foam composites media, with the volume fraction of constituents and the geometry of foam microstructure included in the spectral function. In the retrieval method, the cost function of emissivity is constructed with two constraints: one is the first two moments of the spectral function and the other is derived from the spectral representation of coated spherical composites. We tested the inverse method using the simulation data of a known emissivity model with Gaussian noise. Good agreement is obtained between the inverse results and the known AVF of sea foam from the simulated emissivity data with varying sea surface temperature, salinity, and incident angle. Finally, the proposed method was used to estimate the AVF of the sea foam layer from the measured emissivity data at frequencies 1.4, 6.8, 10.8, 35, and 36.5 GHz. Generally, the retrieved values of the AVF fall in the range of 0.85-0.98. This study implies that our method can be extended to retrieve the volume fraction of constituents of other composites media from the passive microwave remote-sensing data.

TI  - Statistical modelling of snow cover dynamics in the Central Himalaya Region, Nepal
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover modelling is primarily focussed on snow depletion in the context of hydrological research. Degree-day or temperature index models (TIMs) as well as energy balance models (EBMs) are conventional to quantify catchment runoff. Whereas the former exploit relationships between snow (and/or ice) melt and air temperatures, the latter rest upon quantifying melt as the deviation from heat balance equations. However, the 2 approaches contain distinct drawbacks. For example, increasing temporal resolution decreases the accuracy of TIMs, and no spatial variability is provided, whereas EBMs have large dataset requirements for climate, landscape and soil properties. Nevertheless, detailed knowledge about shifts in seasonal ablation times and spatial distribution of snow cover is crucial for understanding hydrological systems, plant distribution and various other research interests. Therefore, we propose a statistical model based on a combination of high resolution spatio-temporal climate datasets and climate-related topographic data, which were obtained by meteorological network stations, remote sensing and GIS analysis. The main objectives were to identify suitable inputs and to develop a robust binary snow distribution model that enables the mapping of major physical processes controlling snow accumulation, melt and stagnation in a high mountain environment in the Gaurishankar Conservation Area in Nepal. We used the random forest technique, which represents a state of the art machine learning algorithm. The snow distribution was predicted very accurately with high spatio-temporal resolution (daily on 0.5 x 0.5 km), with hit rates of around 90% and an overall model accuracy of 90.8% compared to independent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Karlsruhe, GERMANY
AB  - The automated analysis of large areas with respect to land-cover and land-use is nowadays typically performed based on the use of hyperspectral or multispectral data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms. While hyperspectral data offer a more detailed description of the spectral properties of the Earth's surface and thus a great potential for a variety of applications, multispectral data are less expensive and available in shorter time intervals which allows for time series analyses. Particularly with the recent availability of multispectral Sentinel-2 data, it seems desirable to have a comparative assessment of the potential of both types of data for land-cover and land-use classification. In this paper, we focus on such a comparison and therefore involve both types of data. On the one hand, we focus on the potential of hyperspectral data and the commonly applied techniques for data-driven dimensionality reduction or feature selection based on these hyperspectral data. On the other hand, we aim to reason about the potential of Sentinel-2 data and therefore transform the acquired hyperspectral data to Sentinel-2-like data. For performance evaluation, we provide classification results achieved with the different types of data for two standard benchmark datasets representing an urban area and an agricultural area, respectively.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the analysis of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data for land-cover and land-use classification. Given a set of representative training areas, we use a Random Forest classifier for the semantic labeling of the considered scene with respect to seven classes. As the classifier allows assessing the relevance of involved features for the classification task, we also estimate the relevance of the spectral channels for different dates. The derived results clearly reveal the benefit of a multitemporal analysis of Sentinel-2 data, since it also addresses seasonal changes in the acquired data.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative tool to recognize potential zones for the development of offshore aquaculture activities from an expanded spatial perspective. The methodology- developed in the framework of the TEN-SHORES project (Development of new technologies in oceanic aquaculture RTC-2014-2485-5) - aims to identify optimal conditions for the growth of fish species and for cage resistance. The first step is based on the Delphi method and consists of the selection of variables according to their relevance to fish species and to the cage location. The selected variables were acquired from reanalysis models and remote sensing data (time series of 20-30 years). In the second step, an evaluation system was developed to estimate the percentage of time (on a 0-1 scale) that the selected variables remain in optimum conditions, for the fish and the cage, in the whole data series (grid of 0.25 degrees). Suitability maps were generated according to the conditions for the fish species growth and to house a generic cage. The integration of these maps allows for the identification of potential zones (>0.7) for farming the Greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), highlighting unexploited offshore zones in South and North America, Oceania and in the Africa continent. The developed tool can be applied to large-scale studies of different aquaculture species, as well as to other types of marine uses.

TI  - Impact of rotavirus vaccine on rotavirus diarrhoea in countries of East and Southern Africa.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Established in 2006 with four countries conducting hospital-based rotavirus surveillance, the African rotavirus surveillance network has expanded over subsequent years. By 2015, 14 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) East and Southern Africa sub-region (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) were participating in the rotavirus surveillance network coordinated by WHO. We monitored the proportion of rotavirus diarrhoea among children under five years of age who were hospitalized for diarrhoea in the sentinel hospitals from 2010 to 2015 among countries that introduced rotavirus vaccine during or before 2013 (Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Ethiopia) and compared with the other countries in the network.METHODS: Children under the age of five years hospitalized due to acute diarrhoea were enrolled into the sentinel surveillance system and had stool samples collected and tested for rotavirus antigens by enzyme immunoassay. We described trends in rotavirus positivity among tested stool samples before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction.RESULTS: In countries that introduced rotavirus vaccine by 2013 (Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Ethiopia), average rotavirus vaccine coverage from 2010 to 2015 improved from 0% in 2010 and 2011, 13% in 2012, 46% in 2013, 83% in 2014 to 90% in 2015. Annual average rotavirus positivity from 2010 to 2015 was 35%, 33%, 38%, 28%, 27%, and 19%, respectively. In countries that introduced rotavirus vaccine after 2013 or had not introduced by 2015, average rotavirus vaccine coverage was 0% in 2010-2013, 13% in 2014 and 51% in 2015. In these countries, rotavirus positivity was 44% in 2010, 32% in 2011, 33% in 2012, 41% in 2013, 40% in 2014 and 25% in 2015.CONCLUSION: Countries that introduced rotavirus vaccine by 2013 had a lower proportion of rotavirus positive hospitalizations in 2013-2015 as compared to those that had not introduced rotavirus vaccine by 2013. The decrease in rotavirus positivity was inversely related to increase in rotavirus vaccine coverage showing impact of rotavirus vaccines.

AB  - Arafura Sea is one of the waters in the eastern region of Indonesia that is rich in marine and fisheries potentials because of its fertile conditions which is suitable for fishing ground. One of the fish resources which have important economic value at the Arafura Sea is big pelagic fish such as Mackerel. Thus this study aims to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of Mackerel in the Arafura Sea based on fishing boat coordinate data, to know the distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration and SST from MODIS satellite data in the Arafura Sea and to determine the correlation of chlorophyll-a and SST to the Mackerel catch distribution. This study was conducted in December 2016 until February 2017 in the Arafura Sea, image data analysis of MODIS level-3 conducted at the Laboratory of Oceanography FPIK UNDIP. The data used are Mackerel catch data, the Chlorophyll-a data and SST from MODIS satellite from June to August 2015. The results of this study showed that the distribution of Mackerel catch from June to August more were caught in August a total of 62.2 tons for 19 trips. While the chlorophyll-a between June and August ranged from 0.30 to 8.04 mg/m(3) and SST in June-August ranged from 24.6 degrees C - 28.4 degrees C. The correlation between chlorophyll-a and Mackerel catch results showed very strong correlation (correlation coefficient (r) 0.934). While the correlation between SST with the Mackerel catch showed a strong correlation (correlation coefficient (r) 0.664).

T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article the method of Scriptural Reasoning (SR), a text-based approach to interreligious dialogue between participants of the three Abrahamic religions, was implemented for a teacher education setting at a German university. Not only students with an outspoken religious conviction but also agnostic and atheist students, preparing themselves to become teachers in public schools, were invited into the conversation. The article documents and discusses the qualitative-empirical research in which the SR meetings were embedded. The aim of the article is not to create a hermeneutical theory for SR but rather to explore how SR as a method, with its specific learning tool of text-work, can be turned into a broader didactical model which can be transferred to other learning environments and which can in the long run provide empirical evidence on successful teacher education in multi-religious and multi-worldview societies and schools.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Earth below ground is the subject of interest for many geophysical as well as geological investigations. Even though most practitioners would agree that all available information should be used in such an investigation, it is common practice that only a part of geological and geophysical information is actually integrated in structural geological models. We believe that some reasons for this omission are (a) an incomplete picture of available geological modeling methods, and (b) the problem of the perceived static picture of an inflexible geological representation in an image or geological model.With this work, we aim to contribute to the problem of subsurface interface detection through (a) the review of state-of-the-art geological modeling methods that allow the consideration of multiple aspects of geological realism in the form of observations, information, and knowledge, cast in geometric representations of subsurface structures, and (b) concepts and methods to analyze, quantify, and communicate related uncertainties in these models. We introduce a formulation for geological model representation and interpolation and uncertainty analysis methods with the aim to clarify similarities and differences in the diverse set of approaches that developed in recent years.We hope that this chapter provides an entry point to recent developments in geological modeling methods, helps researchers in the field to better consider uncertainties, and supports the integration of geological observations and knowledge in geophysical interpretation, modeling and inverse approaches.

AB  - Autonomous Navigation Based on Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) is a hot spot in the future development of satellite navigation system. The new generation Beidou navigation satellites are equipped with Ka-band ISL test verification platform. The processing flow of ISL observation data and the algorithm of centralized orbit determination are derived. Analysis of centralized orbit determination for 3 day arcs is carried out with measured data of five new generation BD satellites and an anchor station. Some 4 experiments were carried out on the effect of anchor station. Meanwhile, some 2 experiments were carried out on the effect of observation frequency. The result shows that: (a) The working time length of anchor station has little influence on the accuracy of orbit determination; (b) When the intersatellite observation is healthy, the anchor station and single satellite chain can maintain the orbit determination accuracy of 1 m, otherwise the improvement of anchor station's observation quantity will not improve its constraint function. (c) When the anchor station is well linked to all the satellites, the centralized algorithm can survive a lower number of observations, which means the orbit determination accuracy can remain being better than 1 m even though all links' observational frequencies dropped to 240 min.

TI  - An alternative approach to determine critical angle of contrast reversal and surface roughness of oil slicks under sunglint
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The critical angle is the angle at which the contrast of oil slicks reverse their contrasts against the surrounding oil-free seawater under sunglint. Accurate determination of the critical angle can help estimate surface roughness and refractive index of the oil slicks. Although it's difficult to determine a certain critical angle, the potential critical angle range help to improve the estimation accuracy. In this study, the angle between the viewing direction and the direction of mirror reflection is used as an indicator for quantifying the critical angle and could be calculated from the solar/viewing geometry from observations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The natural seep oil slicks in the Gulf of Mexico were first delineated using a customized segmentation approach to remove noise and apply a morphological filter. On the basis of the histograms of the brightness values of the delineated oil slicks, the potential range of the critical angle was determined, and then an optimal critical angle between oil slicks and seawater was then determined from statistical and regression analyses in this range. This critical angle corresponds to the best fitting between the modeled and observed surface roughness of seep oil slicks and seawater.

AB  - Snow cover plays an important role both globally and regionally as it is fundamental for local water availability, river run-off, and groundwater recharge. Hence, the exact knowledge of extent and dynamic of the snow coverage is essential. This study combines synergetic optical and SAR data with the main object to map the snow cover extent. As the Sentinel-Mission provides a wide swath width and a high revisit time (2-3 days at mid-latitudes with same acquisition geometry), the Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW) SAR data and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data are used. Additionally, the TanDEM-X DEM is applied for the exact determination of the snow line as well as for snow classification. The mapping of the snow cover extent is applied on the three test sites Devon Island in Canada, Nordenskiold, Svalbard, and French Alps, France which are characterized by different topography and land cover. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 85% for Devon Island, 60% for Nordenskiold and 88 % for the French Alps.

TI  - Lymph node 8a as a prognostic marker for poorer prognosis in pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: An investigation of patients with pancreatic carcinoma aims to identify those who will benefit from surgery. Physical examination, radiology and laboratory findings are helpful. Most prognostic markers, such as lymph node status, micro metastasis and tumour differentiation, are not preoperatively accessible. Metastatic disease in lymph node 8a (Ln8a) in patients operated for pancreatic carcinoma has been reported to be a predictor of shorter overall survival (OS). This lymph node can be assessed preoperatively through resection (possibly even with laparoscopy) and subsequent histopathology. The value of the procedure is disputed. The aim of this study is to investigate whether metastatic disease in Ln8a is a predictor of decreased OS.Materials and methods: In patients with suspected pancreatic or periampullary carcinoma, who were operated with pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), Ln8a was separately resected and analysed with standard and immuno-histochemical methods. Patients with or without metastasis in Ln8a were compared regarding OS.Results: Between 2008 and 2011, 122 consecutive patients were eligible and 87 were resected and had LN8a analysed separately. Sixteen patients were Ln8a+and 71 were Ln8a-. Patients with Ln8a+had a significantly reduced median OS as compared to patients with Ln8a- (0.74 (95% CI 0.26-1.26) versus 5.91 years (95% CI 2.91-), p<.001).Conclusion: Ln8a+was associated with a marked reduction of OS, indicating a possible role in the future preoperative workup in patients with a suspicion of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - In the last decade, spatial datasets started to grow from small collections of high quality geospatial information into huge collections of data covering the whole planet with varying formats and qualities. Large-scale spatial datasets are about to create significant value in varying application fields including navigation, autonomous driving, urban geography, agriculture, and climate research. Therefore, large datasets are actively acquired. In addition, social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr provide text, video, and images with associated geospatial information from the crowd. These sources are highly interesting as they provide near-realtime insights into aspects of human behavior and dynamics. Finally, global and long-running satellite missions such as Landsat, Sentinel, World-View, or TerraSAR add large amounts of geospatial information. It is a matter of fact that these data collections are putting challenges to the computational infrastructure used for spatial computing. Not only do we need a lot of computation, we also need to think about how to organize and design distributed systems that can help tackle the volume, velocity, and variety of current and future geospatial datasets. Modern big data systems employ data replication for two main reasons: first, for increased fault tolerance, and, second, for higher flexibility in scheduling tasks across a large cluster of machines. This paper proposes and compares novel data replication schemata for scalable spatial computing and analyzes the impact on the communication complexity of global spatial joins of a large collection of tweets collected from the Twitter API and building polygons extracted from OpenStreetMap.

TI  - Complement and the Regulation of T Cell Responses
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF IMMUNOLOGY, VOL 36
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The complement system is an evolutionarily ancient key component of innate immunity required for the detection and removal of invading pathogens. It was discovered more than 100 years ago and was originally defined as a liver-derived, blood-circulating sentinel system that classically mediates the opsonization and lytic killing of dangerous microbes and the initiation of the general inflammatory reaction. More recently, complement has also emerged as a critical player in adaptive immunity via its ability to instruct both B and T cell responses. In particular, work on the impact of complement on T cell responses led to the surprising discoveries that the complement system also functions within cells and is involved in regulating basic cellular processes, predominantly those of metabolic nature. Here, we review current knowledge about complement's role in T cell biology, with a focus on the novel intracellular and noncanonical activities of this ancient system.

TI  - Incorporation of Satellite Data and Uncertainty in a Nationwide Groundwater Recharge Model in New Zealand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A nationwide model of groundwater recharge for New Zealand ( NGRM), as described in this paper, demonstrated the benefits of satellite data and global models to improve the spatial definition of recharge and the estimation of recharge uncertainty. NGRM was inspired by the global- scale WaterGAP model but with the key development of rainfall recharge calculation on scales relevant to national- and catchment- scale studies ( i. e., a 1 km 1 km cell size and a monthly timestep in the period 2000- 2014) provided by satellite data ( i. e., MODIS- derived evapotranspiration, AET and vegetation) in combination with national datasets of rainfall, elevation, soil and geology. The resulting nationwide model calculates groundwater recharge estimates, including their uncertainty, consistent across the country, which makes the model unique compared to all other New Zealand estimates targeted towards groundwater recharge. At the national scale, NGRM estimated an average recharge of 2500 m3/ s, or 298 mm/ year, with a model uncertainty of 17%. Those results were similar to the WaterGAP model, but the improved input data resulted in better spatial characteristics of recharge estimates. Multiple uncertainty analyses led to these main conclusions: the NGRM model could give valuable initial estimates in data- sparse areas, since it compared well to most ground- observed lysimeter data and local recharge models; and the nationwide input data of rainfall and geology caused the largest uncertainty in the model equation, which revealed that the satellite data could improve spatial characteristics without significantly increasing the uncertainty. Clearly the increasing volume and availability of large- scale satellite data is creating more opportunities for the application of national- scale models at the catchment, and smaller, scales. This should result in improved utility of these models including provision of initial estimates in data- sparse areas. Topics for future collaborative research associated with the NGRM model include: improvement of rainfall- runoff models, establishment of snowmelt and river recharge modules, further improvement of estimates of rainfall and AET, and satellite- derived AET in irrigated areas. Importantly, the quantification of uncertainty, which should be associated with all future models, should give further impetus to field measurements of rainfall recharge for the purpose of model calibration.

TI  - Forest cover changes in Gorce NP (Poland) using photointerpretation of analogue photographs and GEOBIA of orthophotos and nDSM based on image-matching based approach
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change can be detected with high precision using 3D geospatial data and semi-automatic analyses of Remote Sensing data. The aim of our study, performed in Gorce National Park in Poland, was to generate a land use land cover (LULC) map and use it to analyse forest cover change. The study area is a subalpine forest region that has been affected by bark beetle and wind disturbances. The Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis approach was used for classification, with Colour Infrared orthophotos and normalized Digital Surface Models generated using image-matching approach. Gathered results showed that dominating LULC class is coniferous forests (3380 ha; 47% of study area), when second largest class is deciduous forests (2204 ha; 30%). The dead Norway spruce stands (465.5 ha; 6.5%) showed significant increase comparing to 114.1 ha mapped in 1997.

TI  - Upscaling site-scale ecohydraulic models to inform salmonid population-level life cycle modeling and restoration actions - Lessons from the Columbia River Basin
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With high-resolution topography and imagery in fluvial environments, the potential to quantify physical fish habitat at the reach scale has never been better. Increased availability of hydraulic, temperature and food availability data and models have given rise to a host of species and life stage specific ecohydraulic fish habitat models ranging from simple, empirical habitat suitability curve driven models, to fuzzy inference systems to fully mechanistic bioenergetic models. However, few examples exist where such information has been upscaled appropriately to evaluate entire fish populations. We present a framework for applying such ecohydraulic models from over 905 sites in 12 sub-watersheds of the Columbia River Basin (USA), to assess status and trends in anadromous salmon populations. We automated the simulation of computational engines to drive the hydraulics, and subsequent ecohydraulic models using cloud computing for over 2075 visits from 2011 to 2015 at 905 sites. We also characterize each site's geomorphic reach type, habitat condition, geomorphic unit assemblage, primary production potential and thermal regime. We then independently produce drainage network-scale models to estimate these same parameters from coarser, remotely sensed data available across entire populations within the Columbia River Basin. These variables give us a basis for imputation of reach-scale capacity estimates across drainage networks. Combining capacity estimates with survival estimates from mark-recapture monitoring allows a more robust quantification of capacity for freshwater life stages (i.e. adult spawning, juvenile rearing) of the anadromous life cycle. We use these data to drive life cycle models of populations, which not only include the freshwater life stages but also the marine and migration life stages through the hydropower system. More fundamentally, we can begin to look at more realistic, spatially explicit, tributary habitat restoration scenarios to examine whether the enormous financial investment on such restoration actions can help recover these populations or prevent their extinction.

TI  - Time-series classification of Sentinel-1 agricultural data over North Dakota
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of agricultural land cover are important for monitoring global food security, economic stability, and environmental conditions. Since significant portions of global agricultural land are frequently cloud covered, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been shown to be a reliable form of gathering crop measurements, even in regions where acquiring clear optical imagery is challenging. In this work, repeat coverage from the C-band Sentinel-1 satellite over a portion of North Dakota is used to classify individual agricultural land-cover types. In this approach the times series forms the basis of a classification algorithm, where individual pixels are compared against a model of average crop backscatter response and classified as the crop with the least difference from the model. Multiple variations on the analysis are run to test the influence of polarization, iterations in model building, number of training fields, and validation input on the classification accuracy. It is shown that both VV and VH polarizations individually and combined are routinely able to produce overall accuracies above 90% when using multiple iterations in model building. These results show the potential for SAR-based agricultural land cover classifications built from comprehensive time series data.

TI  - Sacramentally Imagining Sports as a Form of Worship: Reappraising Sport as a Gesture of God
T2  - SPORT ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We live in a world in which God is made known in and through God's material works, which are other than himself. That is, they are signs of God's presence whether in the natural world or the world we structure, as God's image bearers, in our practices, rituals, and the stuff we make. The Christian tradition holds that the created order and human creativity witness to God, because creation is suffused with God's (sacramental) presence. A sacramental understanding of sports aims to give an alternative stance to how Christian traditions conceive of sports. A sacramental understanding intimates how this worldview helps us reckon that sports can be an acceptable form of divine worship, because of how sports can participate in and point to God. I argue that, when sport is understood as a material mode of worship, sport can serve as an iconic indicator which reflects and imparts something of divine presence. If we inhabit such a world in which God is close to the lived experience of this strenuous and sensual mode of existence, this re-sacralizes sports as contexts in which humans can actually celebrate with gratitude goods such as autotelicity and experience God's presence in this cultural liturgy.

TI  - Mass gathering enhanced syndromic surveillance for the 8th Micronesian Games in 2014, Pohnpei State Federated States of Micronesia
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pohnpei State's Division of Primary Health Care implemented enhanced surveillance for early warning and detection of disease to support the 8th Micronesian Games (the Games) in July 2014.The surveillance comprised 11 point-of-care sentinel sites around Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, collecting data daily for eight syndromes using standard case definitions. Each sentinel site reported total acute care encounters, total syndrome cases and the total for each syndrome. A public health response, including epidemiological investigation and laboratory testing, followed when syndrome counts reached predetermined threshold levels.The surveillance was implemented using the web-based Suite for Automated Global Electronic bioSurveillance Open-ESSENCE (SAGES-OE) application that was customized for the Games. Data were summarized in daily situation reports (SitReps) issued to key stakeholders and posted on PacNet, a Pacific public health e-mail network.Influenza-like illness (ILI) was the most common syndrome reported (55%, n = 225). Most syndrome cases (75%) were among people from Pohnpei. Only 30 cases out of a total of 408 syndrome cases (7%) presented with acute fever and rash, despite the large and ongoing measles outbreak at the time. No new infectious disease outbreak was recorded during the Games. Peaks in diarrhoeal and ILI cases were followed up and did not result in widespread transmission.The technology was a key feature of the enhanced surveillance. The introduction of the web-based tool greatly improved the timeliness of data entry, analysis and SitRep dissemination, providing assurance to the Games organizers that communicable diseases would not adversely impact the Games.

AB  - Southern California possesses a Mediterranean climate having semi-arid to arid characteristics and contains shrubland areas at high risk to wildfire. To assess wildfire danger, fire agencies have been monitoring the moisture of vegetation, called live fuel moisture (LFM), using field-based sampling. Unfortunately, spatial and temporal resolution of live fuel moisture data are significantly limited because sampling is labor intensive. Remote sensing satellite data has been used to monitor vegetation moisture content and health of shrublands. Therefore, a potential approach to overcome the limitations of manual measurements of live fuel moisture is to use vegetation indices (VIs) derived from satellite data. The objective of this study is to understand the link between vegetation indices derived from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard both Terra and Aqua satellites and in-situ live fuel moisture data. In this study, five vegetation indices were calculated using 6 bands of MODIS data within the visible and infrared spectrum collectively with the focus on the three best performing: enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI). Six sites with multi-year live fuel moisture data collection type were each represented with one pixel of MODIS data with a 500m by 500m spatial resolution covering the time period of February 2000 through December 2017 acquired aboard Terra and June 2002 through December 2017 acquired aboard Aqua. Simple linear regression was then applied to measure the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the vegetation indices and live fuel moisture data. The results show a great variance of R-2 between the sites as well as a variance of best performing VL The two strongest coefficients of determination, R-2=0.74 and R-2=0.72, were calculated at one site for enhanced vegetation index vs. live fuel moisture over a 15-year time period of data collected on Aqua and a 17-year time period of data collected on Terra respectively. The relationship was also affected by annual climate conditions including precipitation. Our preliminary results indicate that the satellite data reasonably well represents the live fuel moisture with higher temporal resolutions over a large area. Utilizing the remote sensing data in wildfire danger assessment will support fire agencies by saving resources for collecting ground data and providing better dataset in both time and space. This will also be beneficial for land management and planning, stakeholders and local governments.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a is one of the parameters used to detect the presence of fish populations, as well as one of the parameters to state the quality of a water. Research on chlorophyll concentrations has been extensively investigated as well as with chlorophyll-a mapping using remote sensing satellites. Mapping of chlorophyll concentration is used to obtain an optimal picture of the condition of waters that is often used as a fishing area by the fishermen. The role of remote sensing is a technological breakthrough in broadly monitoring the condition of waters. And in the process to get a complete picture of the aquatic conditions it would be used an algorithm that can provide an image of the concentration of chlorophyll at certain points scattered in the research area of capture fisheries. Remote sensing algorithms have been widely used by researchers to detect the presence of chlorophyll content, where the channels corresponding to the mapping of chlorophyll -concentrations from Landsat 8 images are canals 4, 3 and 2. With multiple channels from Landsat-8 satellite imagery used for chlorophyll detection, optimum algorithmic search can be formulated to obtain maximum results of chlorophyll-a concentration in the research area. From the calculation of remote sensing algorithm hence can be known the suitable algorithm for condition at coast of Pasuruan, where green channel give good enough correlation equal to R-2 = 0,853 with algorithm for Chlorophyll-a (mg / m(3)) = 0,093 (R (-0) Red -3,7049, from this result it can be concluded that there is a good correlation of the green channel that can illustrate the concentration of chlorophyll scattered along the coast of Pasuruan

TI  - Assessment of PlanetScope images for benthic habitat and seagrass species mapping in a complex optically shallow water environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first assessment of PlanetScope image for benthic habitat and seagrass species mapping in optically shallow water. PlanetScope image is equipped with ideal resolutions for benthic habitat and seagrass mapping including high-spatial resolution (3m), high radiometric resolution (12-bit), sufficient water penetration bands (Visible-Near-infrared) and very high temporal resolution (almost daily), which distinguishes it from other high spatial resolution images. It is necessary to assess the accuracy of this ideal system in a real-world benthic habitat and seagrass species mapping application. The optically shallow water of Karimunjawa Islands was selected as the study area. Two PlanetScope images acquired on 17 May 2017 and 15 August 2017 were tested as a control for the consistency of PlanetScope image accuracy. Several treatments were applied to both PlanetScope images including atmospheric correction, sunglint correction, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU). Per-pixel classification algorithms (including Maximum Likelihood - ML, Support Vector Machine - SVM, and Classification Tree Analysis - CTA) and Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) were used to perform benthic habitat and seagrass species classification. Spectra-based classifications were also applied to classify seagrass species using seagrass species spectra as input endmember. The results indicated that PlanetScope images produced 47.13-50.00% overall accuracy (OA) for benthic habitat mapping consist of five classes (coral reefs, macroalgae, seagrass, bare substratum, dead coral) and 74.03-74.31% OA for seagrass species mapping consist of five seagrass species classes. The accuracy of PlanetScope images for benthic habitat and seagrass species mapping was comparable to other high spatial resolution images. The performance of PlanetScope images was also consistent, shown by the similar accuracy obtained from May and August image. The concern regarding PlanetScope image was the low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) over homogeneous areas such as optically deep water, which led to the failure of performing sunglint correction and obtaining higher accuracy. To conclude, with the very high temporal resolution, PlanetScope image is promising for monitoring the dynamics and changes of benthic habitat and seagrass species composition, and rapid assessment of extreme events impacts, especially in coastal areas with limited accessibility.

AB  - To access the valuable information contained within Earth observation data, users are required to undertake a series of complex pre-processing steps to turn the data from a 'raw` unprocessed format into a state that can be analysed. In a move to remove barriers to accessing Earth observation datasets the concept of ARD has been proposed to improve opportunities for exploitation. This paper seeks to explore whether true interoperability can be achieved for Sentinel 1 ARD through application of a standardised set of pre-processing steps.

AB  - Malaria is one of deadly infectious diseases commonly found in tropical countries, and until now its preventive efforts are still going on. From a spatial-analytical perspective, the preventive efforts can be done by developing malaria vulnerability maps, which can be used as a basis for risk management. Remotely sensed imagery is a powerful source for collecting relevant spatial data for that purpose. Among various models, there are four analysis methods for generating such maps, i.e. scoring, matching, spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), which have been compared according to their effectiveness and accuracies. The authors tested those methods in Purworejo Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, which has been recognized as a malaria endemic area. This study used Landsat-8 OLI imagery as a basis for deriving spatial parameters closely related to malaria vulnerability. Each vulnerability spatial model's accuracy was then evaluated by calculating the number of cases found in the field, with respect to each vulnerability class, and then compiling all values using cross tabulation. It was found that, among other methods, the SMCE-based malaria vulnerability map statistically delivered the best result.

AB  - Permafrost is an essential element of the cryosphere, which will be strongly affected by global warming. Although permafrost cannot be measured directly with remote sensing, many permafrost features are observable. Polarimetric information can be used in this context. Polarimetric data of TerraSAR-X is the basis for a local landcover classification presented here, which reflects different scattering mechanisms. The resulting classification aims on the identification of process areas and periglacial features such as thaw slumps (bare wet surfaces) and thaw lakes as well as wetland areas.

AB  - Forest fire is the main problem in Indonesia and 75% occurred in peatland area, mainly in open area. Fast-growing commercial oil palm and paper pulp tree plantations, especially in Sumatera and Kalimantan has led to widespread deforestation and drainage in peatland area. Therefore, detection of dry-flammable peatland area is important to support land and forest fires prevention. The purpose of this research is to develop simple model for detection of dry-flammable peatland area by using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ALOS-2 L-Band data. Synthetic Aperture Radar ALOS-2 operating in L-Band frequency have advantages for peatland monitoring compare to other radar satellite data due to its longest wavelength and higher resolution which made a possibility to penetrate peatland surface. In this research, statistic approach was used to calculate relationship and develop model between backscattering coeffiient (BC) and groundwater table (GWT). The study area is located in Sungai Apit, Siak Regency, Riau Province, Indonesia. The GWT were measured from 18 points sampling. Backscattering coefficient then calculated based on ALOS-2 L-Band calibration from JAXA for level 1.1.(Single Look Complex) data. Based on this research, the result of the relationship between GWT and backscattering coefficient is -0.5 both for HH and VV polarization. The equation model were developed by using linear regression based on the relationship between GWT and backscattering coefficient of HH and VV polarization. By using the information of backscattering coefficient of HH and VV polarization, we can calculate GWT of the peatland area. GWT more than 40 cm is classify as dry-flammable peatland area. We have termed the model Simple Dry-Flammable Peatland Detection SAR Model.

TI  - Sensory analysis of Ontario Riesling wines from various water status zones
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Determinants of the terroir effect in Riesling were sought by choosing vine water status as a major factor. It was hypothesized that consistent water status zones could be identified within vineyards, and, differences in wine sensory attributes could be related to vine water status.Methods and results: To test our hypothesis, 10 Riesling vineyards representative of each Ontario Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) sub-appellation were selected. Vineyards were delineated using global positioning systems and 75 to 80 sentinel vines were geo-referenced within a sampling grid for data collection. During 2005 to 2007, vine water status measurements [leaf water potential (psi)] were collected bi-weekly from a subset of these sentinel vines. Vines were categorized into "low" and "high" leaf. zones within each vineyard through use of geospatial maps and replicate wines were made from each zone. Wines from similar leaf psi zones had comparable sensory properties ascertained through sorting tasks and multidimensional scaling (2005, 2006). Descriptive analysis further indicated that water status affected wine sensory profiles, and attributes differed for wines from discrete leaf psi zones. Multivariate analyses associated specific sensory attributes with wines of different leaf psi zones. Several attributes differed between leaf psi zones within multiple vineyard sites despite different growing seasons. Wines produced from vines with leaf psi > - 1.0 MPa had highest vegetal aromas whereas those with leaf psi < -1.3 MPa were highest in honey, petrol and tropical fruit flavors. Vines under mild water deficit had highest honey, mineral, and petrol and lowest vegetal aromas.Conclusion: Results indicate that water status has a profound impact on sensory characteristics of Riesling wines and that there may be a quality threshold for optimum water status.Significance and impact of the study: These data suggest that vine water status has a substantial impact on the sensory properties of Riesling wines. Variability of leaf. within vineyards can lead to wines that differ in their sensory profiles. These findings were consistent among vineyards across the Niagara Peninsula. These strong relationships between leaf. and sensory attributes of Riesling suggest that vine water status is a major basis for the terroir effect.

TI  - Analysis of vegetation recovery surrounding a restored wetland using the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed restoration efforts seek to rejuvenate vegetation, biological diversity, and land productivity at Cienega San Bernardino, an important wetland in southeastern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico. Rock detention and earthen berm structures were built on the Cienega San Bernardino over the course of four decades, beginning in 1984 and continuing to the present. Previous research findings show that restoration supports and even increases vegetation health despite ongoing drought conditions in this arid watershed. However, the extent of restoration impacts is still unknown despite qualitative observations of improvement in surrounding vegetation amount and vigor. We analyzed spatial and temporal trends in vegetation greenness and soil moisture by applying the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) to one dry summer season Landsat path/row from 1984 to 2016. The study area was divided into zones and spectral data for each zone was analyzed and compared with precipitation record using statistical measures including linear regression, Mann-Kendall test, and linear correlation. NDVI and NDII performed differently due to the presence of continued grazing and the effects of grazing on canopy cover; NDVI was better able to track changes in vegetation in areas without grazing while NDII was better at tracking changes in areas with continued grazing. Restoration impacts display higher greenness and vegetation water content levels, greater increases in greenness and water content through time, and a decoupling of vegetation greenness and water content from spring precipitation when compared to control sites in nearby tributary and upland areas. Our results confirm the potential of erosion control structures to affect areas up to 5km downstream of restoration sites over time and to affect 1km upstream of the sites.

CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the key instruments on board the Terra (EOS AM-1) spacecraft. MODIS has 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength between 0.4 and 14.2 mu m, at three spatial resolutions of 250 m (bands 1 - 2), 500 m (bands 3 - 7), and 1 km (bands 8 - 36). For each 1-km sample, the 250-m and 500-m bands use 4 and 2 detectors with each acquiring 4 and 2 subsamples respectively in order to maintain consistent along-scan and along-track resolutions at nadir. The SWIR bands, 5 - 7 and 26, share the same focal-plane array as the 1-km thermal emissive bands, 20 - 25. During one of the two 500-m subsamples for bands 5 - 7, sampling of the 1-km bands introduces increased electronic crosstalk contamination, resulting in a subsample difference for both Earth-view and on-board calibrator observations. For this work, we use data from lunar and on-board blackbody observations, which occur at different signal levels for bands 20 - 25, to derive a correction to the contamination. This correction can be applied to reduce the subsample differences in the MODIS Earth-view data over a wide range of scenes. The impact of this correction on the sensor calibration and Earth-view data will be assessed.

CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been in operation for over 18 and 16 years on the Terra and Aqua spacecrafts, respectively. In order to maintain long-term calibration stability over the life of each mission, MODIS uses a set of on-board calibrators as well as observations of the Moon and selected Earth-view targets. The lunar observations nominally occur in a narrow phase angle range, 55 degrees - 56 degrees, and use scheduled spacecraft maneuvers in order to bring the Moon into alignment with the MODIS space-view port. These observations are used to help characterize the MODIS scan-mirror response versus scan-angle. In addition to these scheduled lunar observations, MODIS also views the Moon through the space-view port without a spacecraft maneuver when the geometry is appropriately aligned. This occurs over a wider phase angle range, between 51 degrees - 82 degrees degrees, than those of the scheduled moon observations. While the phase angle restriction of our scheduled observations provides consistency between the calibration events, the unscheduled Moon data can provide a valuable assessment of many calibration related investigations that use the Moon. In this paper, we compare the results of unscheduled versus scheduled lunar observations for several sensor calibration and performance assessments. These include the lunar calibration trending used to characterize the scan-mirror response versus scan angle and the electronic crosstalk correction of bands 27 - 30, which are currently used in the MODIS Level-1B data products, as well as sensor performance assessments such as band-to-band and detector-to-detector spatial registration.

TI  - Estimating aboveground woody biomass change in Kalahari woodland: combining field, radar, and optical data sets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Maps that accurately quantify aboveground vegetation biomass (AGB) are essential for ecosystem monitoring and conservation. Throughout Namibia, four vegetation change processes are widespread, namely, deforestation, woodland degradation, the encroachment of the herbaceous and grassy layers by woody strata (woody thickening), and woodland regrowth. All of these vegetation change processes affect a range of key ecosystem services, yet their spatial and temporal dynamics and contributions to AGB change remain poorly understood. This study quantifies AGB associated with the different vegetation change processes over an 8-year period, for a region of Kalahari woodland savannah in northern Namibia. Using data from 101 forest inventory plots collected during two field campaigns (2014-2015), we model AGB as a function of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR and PALSAR-2) and dry season Landsat vegetation index composites, for two periods (2007 and 2015). Differences in AGB between 2007 and 2015 were assessed and validated using independent data, and changes in AGB for the main vegetation processes are quantified for the whole study area (75,501km(2)). We find that woodland degradation and woody thickening contributed a change in AGB of -14.3 and 2.5 Tg over 14% and 3.5% of the study area, respectively. Deforestation and regrowth contributed a smaller portion of AGB change, i.e. -1.9 and 0.2 Tg over 1.3% and 0.2% of the study area, respectively.

TI  - Magnetic resonance sentinel lymph node imaging and magnetometer-guided intraoperative detection in prostate cancer using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node (LN) dissection (sLND) using a magnetometer and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) as a tracer was successfully applied in prostate cancer (PCa). The feasibility of sentinel LN (SLN) visualization on MRI after intraprostatic SPION injection has been reported. In the present study, results of preoperative MRI identification of SLNs and the outcome of subsequent intraoperative magnetometer-guided sLND following intraprostatic SPION injection were studied in intermediate-and high-risk PCa.Patients and methods: A total of 50 intermediate-and high-risk PCa patients (prostatespecific antigen. 10 ng/mL and/or Gleason score. 7) scheduled for radical prostatectomy with magnetometer-guided sLND and extended pelvic LND (eLND), were included. Patients underwent MRI before and one day after intraprostatic SPION injection using T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences. Diagnostic rate per patient was established. Distribution of SLNs per anatomic region was registered. Diagnostic accuracy of sLND was assessed by using eLND as a reference standard.Results: SPION-MRI identified a total of 890 SLNs (median 17.5; IQR 12-22.5). SLNs could be successfully detected using MRI in all patients (diagnostic rate 100%). Anatomic SLN distribution: external iliac 19.2%, common iliac 16.6%, fossa obturatoria 15.8%, internal iliac 13.8%, presacral 12.1%, perirectal 12.0%, periprostatic 3.7%, perivesical 2.3%, and other regions 4.4%. LN metastases were intraoperatively found in 15 of 50 patients (30%). sLND had a 100% diagnostic rate, 85.7% sensitivity, 97.2% specificity, 92.3% positive predictive value, 94.9% negative predictive value, false negative rate 14.3%, and 2.8% additional diagnostic value (LN metastases only outside the eLND template).Conclusion: MR scintigraphy after intraprostatic SPION injection provides a roadmap for intraoperative magnetometer-guided SLN detection and can be useful to characterize a reliable lymphadenectomy template. Draining LN from the prostate can be identified in an unexpectedly high number, especially outside the established eLND template. Further studies are required to analyze discordance between the number of pre- and intraoperatively identified SLNs.

TI  - Detection of CK19 mRNA Using One-step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) in Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Results
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate histopathological evaluation of lymph nodes (LNs) is essential for reliable staging in prostate cancer. In routine practice, conventional techniques only examine parts of the LN. Molecular nodal staging methods are limited by their high costs and extensive time requirement. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) determines the metastatic status of the complete LN and allows for rapid intraoperative detection of LN metastases. OSNA has been proposed for diagnosis of LN metastases from breast cancer by quantifying the CK19 mRNA copy number. To provide basic data for OSNA development for prostate cancer, we conducted an investigation of CK19 and OSNA in prostate cancer specimens.Methods: OSNA is based on a short homogenization step and subsequent automated amplification of CK19 mRNA directly from the sample lysate, with results available in 30-40 min. A total of 20 prostate cancer specimens from consecutive patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason-Score >= 7) were investigated by both OSNA and conventional histopathology (H&E stain ing, CK19 immunohistochemistry). OSNA was performed on frozen samples using a ready-to-use amplification kit in an automated real-time detection system. Samples were defined as 'negative' or 'positive' according to mRNA copy number: >5000 copies/mu l (++), 250-5000 copies/mu l (+), and <250 copies/mu l (-).Results: Histopathological analysis confirmed prostate cancer in all samples: Gleason score 7 (n=11), Gleason score 8 (n=2), and Gleason score 9 (n=6). Gleason score could not be given for one patient who previously underwent hormonal treatment. OSNA analysis detected CK19 expression in 100% of the specimens and high numbers of CK19 mRNA copies in all cases (9 samples ++; 11 samples +). Immunohistochemistry confirmed CK19 expression in 19 of 20 cases. In the immunohistochemistry CK19-negative patient, a Gleason score 9 prostate cancer was diagnosed.Conclusions: This is the first study using OSNA to detect CK19 expression in prostate cancer. Initial data indicate that this rapid method for molecular LN staging reliably identifies CK19 mRNA in prostate cancer. These results suggest that the OSNA assay may be suitable to improve (intraoperative) LN staging in prostate cancer. For further verification, OSNA analysis of LN specimens from prostate cancer patients is required.

TI  - Apocalypse, later: a longitudinal study of the Islamic State brand
T2  - CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article compares two universes of official Islamic State media that were compiled 18 months apart. It explores the nuances of the group's worldview and illustrates the extent to which external and internal situational exigencies impacted the Islamic State's brand during its formative years as caliphate. It finds that the organization's media infrastructure was about half as productive in early 2017 as it had been in mid-2015. The data also show that, even though the group had internationalized its theater of terrorist operations during the time period in question, the brand itself actually contracted to become markedly less globalized in 2016. Finally, the data indicate a substantial thematic rearrangement in the organization's propaganda, one that saw its story shifting away from the millenarian "utopia" towards military denialism. In sum, the data indicate that the Islamic State propagandists were far less productive by January 2017, and that their aggregate product was less international and less utopian but more militant and more defiant, a shift that suggested a new phase in their political marketing operations, one focused on framing the caliphate as an embattled but still defiant pseudo-state struggling to maintain past momentum.

TI  - Different responses of chlorophyll-a concentration and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) on southeasterly wind blowing in the Sunda Strait

AB  - During southeast monsoon, along the western coast of Sumatra Island and southern coast of Java Island are known as the coastal upwelling areas denoted by the occurrence of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cooling and chlorophyll-a blooming. Located between Sumatra and Java Islands, Sunda Strait waters may give different response to the southeasterly wind blowing above. Using SST and chlorophyll-a data obtained from daily MODIS level 3 during 2006-2016, this study demonstrated the evidence on how bathymetry and topography modified the effect of southeasterly wind on the spatial variability of SST and chlorophyll-a. All datasets were composed into monthly and monthly climatology. The area in the center of Sunda Strait had the lowest chlorophyll-a concentration and the warmest SST during the peak of upwelling season. The deep bottom topography and the absence of barrier land prevented the generation of wind driven coastal upwelling. However, the chlorophyll-a concentration in this area had the highest correlation with the wind speed which means that the variation of chlorophyll-a concentration in this area was highly depended on the variability of wind. On the other hand, the areas with shallow bathymetry and in front of Panaitan and Java Islands had higher chlorophyll-a concentration and cooler SSTs.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Tropical and Coastal Region Eco Development (ICTCRED)
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) are two parameters often used for identifying the marine productivity. Located at the maritime continent, the variability of SST and Chl-a in the Indonesian seas is influenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The previous studies showed that the effect of El Nino tend to decrease SST and increase Chla in the areas within the Indonesian seas. Using long time observation of satellite data (2003-2016), it was found different result in Java Sea. Since Java Sea has strong seasonal variability influenced by monsoon wind, the effect of ENSO depend on the season. During southeast monsoon season, El Nino (La Nina) tend to increase (decrease) the speed of southeasterly wind cause the decrease or increase of SST. On the contrary, during northwest monsoon season, El Nino (La Nina) tend to decrease (increase) the speed of northwesterly wind cause the increase (decrease) of SST. The dependence of Chl-a on wind speed is only observed in the off shore which exhibit the strong seasonal variation. However, the effect of ENSO on the variability of Chl-a is not robust since the effected amplitude is less than the RMSE of Chl-a data.

CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In this paper we explore the capabilities of two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM) to distinguish between 10 cloud genera. We will evaluate these methods using images acquired by the satellite Landsat 8. The classification of cloud genera is of high general relevance for remote sensing applications such as the surveillance of atmospheric or meteorological processes. Transfer learning is of advantage because it exploits neural networks, which are known to perform well, and enables the adaption to a specific problem with relatively small training data size. We will utilize Landsat 8 images for evaluating the examined machine learning approaches because these image data are freely available in large amounts. Downscaling the Landsat 8 images utilized for training to a resolution of about 300 meters per pixel will allow for keeping the CNN and SVM size reasonably low, such that our training data set can be restricted to a moderate size.

AB  - This study has developed a forest fire occurrence probability model for inaccessible areas such as North Korea and Demilitarized Zone and we have developed a real-time forest fire danger rating system that can be used in fire-related works. There are limitations on the research that it is impossible to conduct site investigation for data acquisition and verification for forest fire weather index model and system development. To solve this problem, we estimated the fire spots in the areas where access is impossible by using MODIS satellite data with scientific basis. Using the past meteorological reanalysis data(5㎞ resolution) produced by the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA) on the extracted fires, the meteorological characteristics of the fires were extracted and made database. The meteorological factors extracted from the forest fire ignition points in the inaccessible areas are statistically correlated with the forest fire occurrence and the weather factors and the logistic regression model that can estimate the forest fires occurrence(fires 1 and non-fores 0). And used to calculate the forest fire weather index(FWI). The results of the statistical analysis show that the logistic models(p<0.01) strongly depends on maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, effective humidity and average wind speed. The logistic regression model constructed in this study showed a relatively high accuracy of 66%. These findings may be beneficial to the policy makers in Republic of Korea(ROK) and Democratic People's Republic of Korea(DPRK) for the prevention of forest fires.

CP  - 4th IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)

AB  - The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is gaining popularity recently. The IoT networks comprise of the wired, the wireless terrestrial and the satellite networks. The Satellite IoT networks can cover areas that are not reachable by the wired IoT networks and the wireless terrestrial networks. A Slot Carrier-sense Time Division Multiple Access (SCTDMA medium access control (MAC) protocol is used for the Satellite VHF Data Exchange System (S-VDES). This paper analyzes and derives the detection probabilities of the ship vessels from a VDES satellite for the S-VDES MAC protocol with a Decollision Algorithm (S-VDES-DA) as well as with Spot Beam (S-VDES-SB) or both (S-VDES-DA-SB). A simple probabilistic model is used to capture the packet error ratios in these schemes. Single-slot and multi-slot messages are also considered. It is shown that the performance gains in the number of ship vessels that can be detected can be up to 92% for the S-VDES-DA MAC protocol with a DA capability of up to 3 packets over a basic S-VDES MAC protocol and up to 88% for the S-VDES-DA-SB MAC protocol with a DA capability of up to 3 packets and with 7 spot beams over the S-VDES-SB MAC protocol, respectively, for a detection probability threshold of 90%. On the other hand, the percentage drops in the detection probabilities of the S-VDES-DA MAC protocol and the S-VDESDA-SB MAC protocol for detecting up to 3 packets with and without packet error ratios are 4.6% and 4.0%, respectively.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF CHINESE NARRATIVE OF WORLD ORDER AND FOREIGN POLICY: IS CHINA A REVISIONIST OR REFORMIST POWER?
T2  - SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - China has altered its global posture from "keeping a low profile" to "striving for achievement" since President Xi came to power. The adjusted approach to Chinese foreign policy is in the context of growing China's state capabilities and shrinking American global leadership under Trump's presidency. Given these structural changes in the international system, China is expected to play a bigger role in the world politics. Accordingly, questions have raised that how China perceives the world and whether rising China is a reformist or revisionist power. The paper would address these questions by first revisiting the ancient Chinese idea of Tianxia, which is both a concept and practice in ancient times. As Tianxia is not applicable in the modern world, the concepts are reinvented by Chinese scholars, which are similar to ideas proposed by President Xi, offering an ideal worldview. In the third part, an empirical analysis of the Chinese foreign policy would check whether China's behaviors correspond to Xi's vision and whether China is a revisionist power.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The evolutionary creationism presented in Jong-Hak Woo’s Challenges of the Scientific Age and Christian Responses is unacceptable in Reformed theology because his theory shows the errors of confusing the results of science with “general revelation,” includes an anti-Christian worldview that is too attached to the Darwinian theory of evolution and naturalism, and discords seriously with major doctrines of the traditional Reformed theology.First, Jong-Hak Woo claims that the discoveries of natural science are general revelation, if the Bible is special revelation. This is a serious conceptual error. His evolutionary creationism, starting from this fundamental confusion, gradually moves on to the wrong argument. He regards a scientist as a describer of general revelation, which is an entirely different argument from the teachings of traditional Reformed theology. The most appropriate explanation for general revelation is found in the Bible which is special revelation.Second, the evolutionary creationism of Jong-Hak Woo has a tendency to be affiliated too much with the Darwinian theory of evolution and naturalism. Though he criticizes New Atheism, he formulates arguments that are very similar to New Atheism when he criticizes Creation Science. This not only is a logical contradiction but has the risk of falling into a naturalistic and anti-Christian worldview.Third, it is difficult for Jong-Hak Woo’s evolutionary creationism to harmonize with the major doctrines of Christianity. His evolutionary creationism distorts traditional Reformed doctrines of Adam and covenant, and in so doing loses a proper place for the doctrine of original sin and strikes a blow to soteriology. Additionally, in the doctrine of God, it goes back and forth between deism and pantheism and also damages the doctrine that the human being is the image of God.For these reasons, traditional Reformed theology should not accept the evolutionary creationism formulated in Jong-Hak Woo’s Challenges of the Scientific Age and Christian Responses.

AB  - In order to compare significant wave height (SWH) data from multi-satellites (GFO, Jason-1, Envisat, Jason-2, Cryosat-2, SARAL) and SWH measurements from Ieodo Ocean Research Station (IORS), we constructed a 12 year matchup database between satellite and IORS measurements from December 2004 to May 2016. The satellite SWH showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.34 m and a positive bias of 0.17 m with respect to the IORS wave height. The satellite data and IORS wave height data did not show any specific seasonal variations or interannual variability, which confirmed the consistency of satellite data. The effect of the wind field on the difference of the SWH data between satellite and IORS was investigated. As a result, a similar result was observed in which a positive biases of about 0.17 m occurred on all satellites. In order to understand the effects of topography and the influence of the construction structures of IORS on the SWH differences, we investigated the directional dependency of differences of wave height, however, no statistically significant characteristics of the differences were revealed. As a result of analyzing the characteristics of the error as a function of the distance between the satellite and the IORS, the biases are almost constant about 0.14 m regardless of the distance. By contrast, the amplitude of the SWH differences, the maximum value minus the minimum value at a given distance range, was found to increase linearly as the distance was increased. On the other hand, as a result of the accuracy evaluation of the satellite SWH from the Donghae marine meteorological buoy of Korea Meteorological Administration, the satellite SWH presented a relatively small RMSE of about 0.27 m and no specific characteristics of bias such as the validation results at IORS. In this paper, we propose a conversion formula to correct the significant wave data of IORS with the satellite SWH data. In addition, this study emphasizes that the reliability of data should be prioritized to be extensively utilized and presents specific methods and strategies in order to upgrade the IORS as an international world-wide marine observation site.

AB  - Three patients underwent total mastectomy with sentinel/axillary lymph node dissection.After the surgical procedure, ultrasound (US)-guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) was performed. The fifth rib and transverse process (TP) was located using a 5–12 MHz linear probe this was marked on the skin. At this level, the probe was moved from the lateral to the medial side transversely to identify any change in shape that traversed the rib and TP. Where the round shadow of the rib shifted to the rectangular shape of the TP, an 18-G Tuohy needle was inserted by using the in-plane technique (Fig. 1). After penetrating the erector spinae muscle, the needle was located in the fascial plane between the TP and erector spinae muscle. We confirmed that the fascial plane was well-separated by injecting 2 mL of saline. Then, 0.375% ropivacaine 30 mL with epinephrine (1:200,000) was injected, and the catheter was inserted 2 cm over the tip of the needle under real-time US guidance (Figs. 2 and 3).

AB  - Recent climate change affected forest fires, landslides, and pests, which have caused serious damages to human life and property. Such forest disasters can occur randomly and develop rapidly, so the in-situ observations may be limited spatially and temporally. As an alternative, satellite remote sensing is an effective method for detecting forest disasters. This paper described the development of a forest disaster detection method by combining the existing spectral methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. NBR(Normalized Burned Ratio), BAI(Burn Area Index), and FBI(Fire Burn Index), which are mainly used fire damage indices, were applied to seven forest fires cases together with the satellite images from Kompsat-3A, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5. The existing spectral methods have limitation of threshold adjustment for each region and for each season. To mitigate this problem, we used the FCN(Fully Convolutional Network)-based U-Net model, which produced more effective detectability of forest fire damages. For future work, the result of spectral methods and several deep learning techniques can be compared quantitatively to prove the performance of U-Net model objectively.

AB  - Algal bloom around the dammed pools of the major four rivers in Korea is recently considered a serious problem.Chlorophyll-a concentration is usually employed as an index for measuring algal bloom. In this paper, the applicability of highresolution satellite images to estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration was examined for inland water in Korea. Also, performance tests for several remote sensing approaches to estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration were conducted. Analyses of Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images showed that the models using Red Edge band produced favorable results. In particular, the M09 and M12 model with RapidEye outperformed others, showing the correlation coefficients of 0.934 and 0.936, respectively. We expect a new Korean satellite for agriculture and forest having the same sensor specification as RapidEye can greatly contribute to realtime monitoring of algal bloom.

AB  - Quantifying long-term environmental variability, including climatic trends, requires decadal-scale time series of observations. The reliability of such trend analysis depends on the long-term stability of the data record, and understanding the sources of uncertainty in historic, current and future sensors. We give a brief overview on how metrological techniques can be applied to historical satellite data sets. In particular we discuss the implications of error correlation at different spatial and temporal scales and the forms of such correlation and consider how uncertainty is propagated with partial correlation. We give a form of the Law of Propagation of Uncertainties that considers the propagation of uncertainties associated with common errors to give the covariance associated with Earth observations in different spectral channels.

TI  - Climate change and its effects on vegetation phenology across ecoregions of Ethiopia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is an integrative environmental indicator of climate change and long-term observations of the changes in plant phenology using remote sensing technologies help us to understand climate change trends over space and time. However, such trends and their implications for ecosystem health have been poorly explored in Ethiopia. In this paper we examine the temporal changes in the phenology of vegetation in relation to climatic drivers across Ecoregions in Ethiopia using satellite images. To do this, the MODIS 8-day NDVI product, MODIS surface temperature and emissivity, and pentad based rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) for the 14 year period 2002-2015 were used. The aggregated time series NDVI, temperature and rainfall data were generated for each Ecoregion in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Environment followed by Fourier smoothing to overcome various noises. The phenology of each Ecoregion was constructed using the intra-annual NDVI variability. Major events in the vegetation cycle or phenophases were identified using sigmoid vegetation growth functions and inflection point detection techniques. The relationships between rainfall and NDVI and between temperature and NDVI were investigated and multiple regression models were developed as regressors to NDVI. Our results indicated that, over the 14 years, the start of the growing period became earlier, and the growing period elongated for most of the Ecoregions in Ethiopia, except for the Somali Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets (SACBT) Ecoregion, in which the start of the growing period was delayed. The widening of the growing period indicates an increase in ecosystem productivity, increment of evapo-transpiration, and disturbance to the water and energy balance of the region. Rainfall and NDVI were positively and strongly correlated but with one-month lag time, whereas temperature and NDVI were negatively correlated for all the Ecoregions. This appears to be due to the variation in timing of the high rainfall season and the decreasing trends of temperature with respect to the variation in the angle of the sun and the subsequent movements of the ITCZ in the region. The overall study indicates that climate variability is affecting the phenology of vegetation across all Ecoregions in Ethiopia. Shifts in crop growing seasons should be considered to efficiently utilize the summer rain for crop production. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Enteroendocrine cells-sensory sentinels of the intestinal environment and orchestrators of mucosal immunity
T2  - MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The intestinal epithelium must balance efficient absorption of nutrients with partitioning commensals and pathogens from the bodies' largest immune system. If this crucial barrier fails, inappropriate immune responses can result in inflammatory bowel disease or chronic infection. Enteroendocrine cells represent 1% of this epithelium and have classically been studied for their detection of nutrients and release of peptide hormones to mediate digestion. Intriguingly, enteroendocrine cells are the key sensors of microbial metabolites, can release cytokines in response to pathogen associated molecules and peptide hormone receptors are expressed on numerous intestinal immune cells; thus enteroendocrine cells are uniquely equipped to be crucial and novel orchestrators of intestinal inflammation. In this review, we introduce enteroendocrine chemosensory roles, summarize studies correlating enteroendocrine perturbations with intestinal inflammation and describe the mechanistic interactions by which enteroendocrine and mucosal immune cells interact during disease; highlighting this immunoendocrine axis as a key aspect of innate immunity.

TI  - A comparison between the 2010 and 2016 El-Nino induced coral bleaching in the Indonesian waters

CP  - 1st Global Colloquium on GeoSciences and Engineering (GCGE)
CL  - Bandung, INDONESIA
AB  - Severe coral bleaching events are always associated with El-Nino phenomenon which caused a rise in ocean temperature between 1-2 degrees C and that they potentially kill the corals worldwide. There were at least four severe coral bleaching events occurred in the Indonesian waters. This study aims to compare the coral bleaching events of the 2010 and 2016 and their impact on corals in Indonesian waters. Long-term (2002-2017) remotely sensed night time sea surface temperature (SST) data acquired from Aqua MODIS Satellite were used in the analysis. Here, we calculated the mean monthly maximum (MMM) of SST as SST in normal condition in which coral can adapt to temperature; the differences between high SST in each pixel during coral bleaching events of the 2010/2016 and MMM SST, called hot spot (HS); and how long has HS occupied a certain water body, called degree of heating weeks (DHW,degrees C-week) and then mapped it. Results show that the MMM SST for the Indonesian waters is 29.1 degrees C. Both bleaching events of 2010 and 2016 started and finished in the same periods of Mar-Jun and they nearly have the same pattern, but bleaching magnitude of the 2016 was stronger than 2010 with the mean SST about 0.4 degrees C higher in May-June. The percentage of impacted areas of strong thermal stress on corals of Alert-1 plus Alert-2 status was higher in 2016 (39.4%) compared to 2010 (31.3%). Coral bleaching events in the 2010 and 2016 spread in almost all Indonesian waters and relatively occurred in the same places but with small variation in the bleaching sites that was caused by the strength/weakness of El-Nino and upwelling phenomenon as well as the role of Indonesian through flow (ITF).

TI  - Multi-temporal polarimetry in land-cover classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses time-series Sentinel-1(S-1) synthetic aperture radar images to evaluate the impact of multi-temporal polarimetric processing on land-cover classification. Various polarimetric processing methods are applied to multi-temporal S-1 data set in order to obtain several inputs parameters for land-cover classification: e.g. time-series coherence matrices from dual-polarization data (shows coherence among polarizations in matrix for separated time points t(1), t(2), to t(n)); scatter zone time series; multi-temporal single and dual-polarization coherence matrices (reveal coherences among time points for one or two polarizations); and parameters from the H/alpha decomposition. Then, the classification potential of each polarimetric data set is compared to a reference classification, which was derived from time series of dual-polarization backscatter (sigma(0)) images. We evaluate if polarimetric processing of dual-polarization images brings better classification results than alone classification of backscatter image. Finally, we evaluate the impact of segment size and the classifier on classification accuracy.The classification based on polarimetric data sets is consistently better than that of backscatter time series. A maximum overall accuracy of 93.2% was achieved for the classification of four basic land-cover classes (urban, agriculture, forest, and water) using a composite data set made up time series of scatter zone derived from the H/alpha plane and scatter zone temporal stability maps. This accuracy was 4.5% better compared to our reference classification based on sigma(0) time series. Similar trends were observed for more detailed land-cover classes. Classification accuracy is heavily influenced by segment size and can drop by about 15% for very small segments. The most suitable classifier proved to be the Support Vector Machine, which performed up to 12% better than the worst one. This study demonstrates the suitability of multi-temporal polarimetry processing for land-cover classification.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Missions and Sensors: Development, Implementation, and Characterization V
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - The newly launched (November 18, 2017) polar-orbiting satellite of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1), now transitioned to NOAA-20, is the follow-on mission to the SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite, launched six years ago. NOAA-20 leads SNPP by a half orbit or about 50 minutes. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a key sensor onboard both NOAA-20 and SNPP spacecraft with nearly identical band spectral responses. Similar to the heritage sensor MODIS, VIIRS has on-board calibration components including a solar diffuser (SD) and a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) for the reflective solar bands (RSB), a V-groove blackbody for the thermal emissive bands (TEB), and a space view (SV) as background reference for calibration. This study provides an initial assessment of calibration of the NOAA-20 VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSB) by intercomparison with measurements from SNPP VIIRS using various vicarious approaches. The first approach is based on a double difference method using observations from simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNO) with Aqua MODIS. The second is from the collected reflectances over the widely used Liby-4 desert site from 16-day repeatable orbits so each data point has the same viewing geometry relative to the site. The third approach is to use the frequent overpasses over the Dome C snow site. Results of this study provide useful information on NOAA-20 VIIRS post-launch calibration assessment and preliminary analysis of its calibration stability and consistency for the first 6 months.

TI  - A method of extracting construction areas using Gaofen-1 remote sensing images
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXIV
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The precisely extraction of construction areas in remote sensing images can play an important role in territorial planning, land use management, urban environments and disaster reduction. In this article, we propose a method for extracting construction areas using Gaofen-1 panchromatic remote sensing images by adopting the improved Pantex([1]) (a procedure for the calculation of texture-derived built-up presence index) and unsupervised classification. First of all, texture co-occurrence measures of 10 different directions and displacements are calculated. In this step, we improve the built-up presence index that we use the windows size of 21*21 to calculate the GLCM contrast measure instead of 9*9 according to the spatial resolution of Gaofen-1 panchromatic image. Then we use the intersection operator "MIN" to combine the 10 different anisotropic GLCM contrast measure to generate the final built-up presence index result. At last, we use the unsupervised classification method to classify the Pantex result into two classes and the one with larger cluster center is the construction area class. Confusion matrix of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region experiment shows that this method can effectively and accurately extract the construction areas in Gaofen-1 panchromatic images with the overall accuracy of more than 92%.

TI  - Using nonparametric modeling approaches and remote sensing imagery to estimate ecological welfare forest biomass
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of forest biomass is closely related with carbon cycle, climate change, forest productivity, and biodiversity. Efficient quantification of biomass provides important information about forest quality and health. With the rising awareness of sustainable development, the ecological benefits of forest biomass attract more attention compared to traditional wood supply function. In this study, two nonparametric modeling approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine were adopted to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) using widely used Landsat imagery in the region, especially within the ecological forest of Fuyang District in Zhejiang Province, China. Correlation analysis was accomplished and model parameters were optimized during the modeling process. As a result, the best performance modeling method RF was implemented to produce an AGB estimation map. The predicted map of AGB in the study area showed obvious spatial variability and demonstrated that within the current ecological forest zone, as well as the protected areas, the average of AGB were higher than the ordinary forest. The quantification of AGB was proven to have a close relationship with the local forest policy and management pattern, which indicated that combining remote-sensing imagery and forest biophysical property would provide considerable guidance for making beneficial decisions.

CL  - Reston, VA
AB  - The modernized global navigation satellite system (GNSS), with its improved signal structure and frequency diversity, is now developed and has been recognized throughout the world in the last decade. In addition, the satellite based augmentation system (SBAS) is one of the GNSS augmentation systems that improves accuracy and integrity in the field of aviation. Conventional SBAS uses a single constellation GNSS (GPS) single frequency (L1 band) signal to augment satellite positioning systems. To improve the position accuracy as well as to enhance integrity, the next-generation SBAS, called DFMC (dual-frequency multi-constellation) SBAS, augments positioning systems using both L1 and L5 band signals. Furthermore, there are many GNSS augmentation systems under development, such as the quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS). The first QZSS satellite, called "Michibiki" was launched in 2010 and has been continuously broadcasting ranging signals and augmentation signals. Moreover, the new QZSS satellites launched in the summer of 2017 can transmit the L5S signal, which is identical to the L5 SBAS signal. Thus, the objective of this research is to develop a piece of equipment to assess the real augmentation performance of the QZSS L5S experimental signal in the Asia Pacific region.We develop a piece of prototype equipment using software defined radio (SDR) technology for QZSS L5S signal reception to assess all the necessary signal processing techniques. The proposed SDR consists of a GNSS antenna, a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) platform, and a personal computer. The SDR implements all receiver chains, including the digital signal processing, performing signal acquisition and tracking of the available satellite signals, and decoding the navigation message and computing the observables needed by the positioning algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the QZSS L5S SDR, the acquired QZSS satellite is marked, and the value of acquired Correlation Peak to next Peak Ratio (CPPR) is calculated in the signal acquisition process, Finally, we apply several signal quality analysis (SQA) methods to analyze the L5S signal continuity and signal strength for various times. Moreover, the actual GPS and QZSS satellite data, signals, and measurements are analyzed for comparison.

TI  - Object Detection in Multispectral and Panchromatic Image Using Superpixel Segmentation and Multisource Feature
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Object detection is a fundamental problem faced in remote sensing images analysis. Most of object detection methods mainly focus on single-source image and utilize single spectral or spatial information. Therefore, they are easily affected by illumination angle, brightness and the structure similar to the object. To overcome these defects, a novel object detection framework is proposed using superpixel segmentation and multisource features in multispectral and panchromatic images. During multisource feature extraction stage, the local region spectral information and the spatial information are extracted from multispectral and panchromatic patches respectively. Then, we embed these spectral features into spatial features to construct the new multisource features. During the detection stage, superpixel segmentation method is applied to extract candidate patches based on the superpixel centers from multisource images, which makes detection more efficient. Then, multisource features are also extracted from these candidate patches, which are input to SVM for detection. Experiments are implemented using two groups of the panchromatic and multispectral images by WorldView 2. The results indicated that, compared with single-source detection result, the proposed method can effectively improve the detection performance both on precision and recall rate.

TI  - Shape feature-assisted discrimination of cloud and snow in GF-1 spectral images of mountainous areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a new method for cloud and snow discrimination, which is based on spectral, texture, and shape features and combined with support vector machine multi-classification strategy. A new feature called curvature histogram is designed to describe edge shape. First, the region of interest test is applied to extract cloud and snow area. Then, the extracted area is combined with the segmentation results using the mean shift algorithm to obtain the object of interest while calculating the feature values. The complexity of surfaces in the cloud and snow area is classified into four types, namely, thick cloud, thin cloud, snow, and snow-covered land, such that six kinds of classifiers are obtained by designing a classifier between every two categories. Through six classifiers and calculating the sum of confidence coefficients for each category, every superpixel is classified into the class with the highest confidence coefficient and a rough cloud and snow mask is obtained. Finally, the GrabCut algorithm is applied to optimize the classification results at the pixel level. The experiments on the images of China's GF-1 satellite, indicate that the proposed method is effective for cloud and snow discrimination on multispectral high-resolution satellites images in mountainous area.

AB  - Due to the widespread use of Android devices and apps, it is important to develop tools and techniques to improve app quality and performance. Our work focuses on a problem related to hardware sensors on Android devices: the failure to disable unneeded sensors, which leads to sensor leaks and thus battery drain. We propose the Sentinel testing tool to uncover such leaks. The tool performs static analysis of app code and produces a model which maps GUI events to callback methods that affect sensor behavior. The model is traversed to identify paths that are likely to exhibit sensor leaks during run-time execution. The reported paths are then used to generate test cases. The execution of each test case tracks the run-time behavior of sensors and reports observed leaks. Our experimental results indicate that Sentinel effectively detects sensor leaks, while focusing the testing efforts on a very small subset of possible GUI event sequences.

AB  - Conventional singe baseline InSAR is easily affected by atmospheric artifacts, making it difficult to generate high precision DEM. To solve this problem, in this paper, a multi-baseline interferometric phase accumulation method with weights fixed by coherence is proposed to generate higher accuracy DEM. The mountainous area in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China is selected as study area, which is characterized by cloudy weather, rugged terrain and dense vegetation. The multi-baseline InSAR experiments are carried out by use of four ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images. The generated DEM is evaluated by Chinese Digital Products of Fundamental Geographic Information 1:50000 DEM. The results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed method can reduce atmospheric artifacts significantly; 2) the accuracy of InSAR DEM generated by six interferograms satisfies the standard of 1:50000 DEM Level Three and American DTED-1.

Due to rapid development, road information of the map is not consistent with the actual case of land features. Road extraction from digital images is of fundamental importance in effective urban planning and updating GIS databases. There is an urgent need for updating road information in a timely manner. Therefore, a large amount of research is being dedicated on the development of efficient methods to extract the geographic features (such as roads) from digital remote sensed images. This paper applies semi-automatic approach to extract different road types from high-resolution remote sensing images. The approach is based on a K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and membership function algorithm(MFA) method. First the outline of the road is detected based on different segmentation scales. Membership function algorithm(MFA)-threshold value method reflecting various spatial, spectral, and texture attributes is to modify and optimize. Then the entire image was classified to form a road image. Finally, the quality of detected roads is evaluated. The results of the accuracy evaluation demonstrate that the proposed road extraction approach can provide high accuracy for extraction of different road types.

AB  - The traditional methods used in the atmospheric correction depend on the empirical relationships or atmospheric radiative transfer model. However, both of them have some deficiencies. For example, as the empirical method depends highly on the training data, it will be applicable under certain conditions. On the other hand, the method that based on the atmospheric radiative transfer model has to run the code each time, which is not an appropriate choice for operational correction of the atmospheric effects. In this paper, a fast parametric model of estimating atmospheric parameters for Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor is proposed. The results show that the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of the total transmission is 0.003, the RMSE of for both the atmospheric upward and downward radiances are 0.0004. Therefore, the proposed model could be used without the help of any atmospheric radiative transfer model. That is, this model would have a better application market.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS

AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a vital variable in global carbon cycling and plays important roles in ecosystem structure and function in grasslands. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 leaf area index (LAI) and fractional photo-synthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) data were used to model AGB in alpine grasslands in the Northern Tibetan Plateau. MYD15A2H (derived from the Aqua MODIS with a temporal resolution of eight days) FPAR/LAI with lower RMSE values (< 18 gm(-2)) may have higher estimated accuracies than MOD15A2H (derived from the Terra MODIS with a temporal resolution of eight days), MCD15A2H (derived fromthe combination of Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS with a temporal resolution of eight days) and MCD15A3H (derived from the combination of Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS with a temporal resolution of four days) FPAR/LAI with higher RMSE values (> 20 g m(-2)). The RMSE values (11.42-13.27 g m(-2)) in the open grazed areas were lower than those (17.46-17.56 g m(-2)) in fenced areas for MYD15A2H. Therefore, the estimated accuracies of AGB may vary among the four MODIS FPAR/LAI products and land use types in alpine grasslands of the Northern Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Development of an Asset Value Map for Disaster Risk Assessment in China by Spatial Disaggregation Using Ancillary Remote Sensing Data
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of economic losses due to a natural hazard and disaster depends largely on the spatial distribution of asset values in relation to the hazard intensity distribution within the affected area. Given that statistical data on asset value are collected by administrative units in China, generating spatially explicit asset exposure maps remains a key challenge for rapid postdisaster economic loss assessment. The goal of this study is to introduce a top-down (or downscaling) approach to disaggregate administrative-unit level asset value to grid-cell level. To do so, finding the highly correlated "surrogate" indicators is the key. A combination of three data sets-nighttime light grid, LandScan population grid, and road density grid, is used as ancillary asset density distribution information for spatializing the asset value. As a result, a high spatial resolution asset value map of China for 2015 is generated. The spatial data set contains aggregated economic value at risk at 30 arc-second spatial resolution. Accuracy of the spatial disaggregation reflects redistribution errors introduced by the disaggregation process as well as errors from the original ancillary data sets. The overall accuracy of the results proves to be promising. The example of using the developed disaggregated asset value map in exposure assessment of watersheds demonstrates that the data set offers immense analytical flexibility for overlay analysis according to the hazard extent. This product will help current efforts to analyze spatial characteristics of exposure and to uncover the contributions of both physical and social drivers of natural hazard and disaster across space and time.

AB  - As the largest body of water in California, the Salton Sea provides important social, economic, and ecological values to the region. However, the Sea has shrunk substantially over time and water quality has deteriorated considerably, mainly caused by agricultural and industrial pollutants, reduced inflow, and enhanced evaporation. Six functionally different spectral water indexes were selected and evaluated to determine their efficiency in estimating water surfaces during excessive growth of algae and outbreaks of green tide when water quality degraded significantly. The evaluation indicated that among the selected water indexes, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was most efficient in differentiating open water from surrounding non-water features, and the differentiation was least affected by water quality change. MNDWI was applied to each archived Landsat TM imagery of the Salton Sea area acquired between 1982 and 2012. The extracted water surfaces showed that the Sea experienced significant change over the 31-year period and entered an accelerated drying stage in 2005. The results also revealed the clear seasonal variations of water surface extent, which increases from September to January and decreases afterwards.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) pointed out that landslides caused a loss of billions and thousands of deaths each year all over the world. In Taiwan, because of vulnerable geological conditions, the invasion of typhoon in summer, and over 70% of mountain area in the whole island, landslides not only cause people's property damage but also threaten personal safety. Current landslide mapping techniques include field inventorying, photogrammetry, and the use of digital elevation models (DEMs) to highlight regions of past instability. Most researchers focus on automatically producing landslide inventory maps by using different kinds of remote sensing data. However, not many researches pay attention to deep-seated landslides. Nowadays, deep-seated landslides are detected by experts from DEMs and there are few methods for the automatic detection of deep-seated landslides. One of the landslide mapping methods, contour connection method (CCM), utilizes bare earth light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to consistently detect landslide deposits on a landscape scale in an automated manner. However, CCM with computational complexity not only requires user inputs but focuses on general landslide geometry. This paper focuses on the automatic detection of landslide features by modifying CCM. The detection results were evaluated by the ground truth and marked some features of landslides and high susceptibility areas. It shows that by using the proposed method, the accuracy will be the same as that obtained by using CCM, but with less computation time.

AB  - Though extensive researches were conducted in the source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) to analyse climate change influence on streamflow, however, few researches concentrate on streamflow of the subbasin above the Huangheyan station in the SRYR (HSRYR) where a water retaining dam was built in the outlet in 1999. To improve the reservoir regulation strategies, this study analysed streamflow change of the HSRYR in a mesoscale. A tank model (TM) was proposed and calibrated with monthly observation streamflow from 1991 to 1998. In the validation period, though there is a simulation deviation during the water storage and power generation period, simulated streamflow agrees favourably with observation data from 2008 to 2013. The model was further validated by two inside lakes area obtained from Landsat 5, 7, 8 datasets from 2000 to 2014, and significant correlations were found between the simulated lake outlet runoff and respective lake area. Then 21 Global Climate Models (GCM) ensembled data of three emission scenarios (SRA2, SRA1B and SRB1) were downscaled and used as input to the TM to simulate the runoff change of three benchmark periods 2011-2030 (2020s), 2046-2065 (2050s), 2080-2099 (2090s), respectively. Though temperature increase dramatically, these projected results similarly indicated that streamflow shows an increase trend in the long term. Runoff increase is mainly caused by increasing precipitation and decreasing evaporation. Water resources distribution is projected to change from summer-autumn dominant to autumn winter dominant. Annual lowest runoff will occur in May caused by earlier snow melting and increasing evaporation in March. According to the obtained results, winter runoff should be artificially stored by reservoir regulation in the future to prevent zero-flow occurrent in May. This research is helpful for water resources management and provides a better understand of streamflow change caused by climate change in the future.

AB  - Constrained energy minimization (CEM) extracts target signatures from hyperspectral images and multispectral images by suppressing the energy of background using a FIR filter. While the energy of background is described by the correlation matrix of the whole image, the target signatures could also be suppressed if they occupy a large proportion of the image. In this respect, we come up with an approach, which abandons possible target pixels based on spectral angle mapper (SAM) and then uses the left pixels to construct the correlation matrix. Based on this approach, we propose a new method named SAM-hCEM for target detection, which improves hierarchical CEM, a variation of CEM, and exhibits impressive performance for oil spill detection on MODIS datasets.

AB  - Residential area is an important place for human habitation and life. Using remote sensing technology to identify residential areas is of great value for land resources planning and utilization, disaster prevention and relief and other fields. As the world's first high resolution optical remote sensing satellite for geosynchronous orbit, GF-4 satellite has high time resolution, medium spatial resolution and multispectral land detection capability, which provides a new data resource for residential monitoring. Closely combining with the detection characteristics of the GF-4 satellite, this paper proposes a remote sensing identification method based on GF-4 satellite, and the recognition ability of the GF-4 satellite to the residential area is analyzed. The remote sensing recognition of residential areas is mainly divided into four steps. First, Super-resolution image enhancement technology is used to improve the spatial resolution of GF-4 satellite PMS image. Then, the resolution enhanced image is processed by geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction. Third, the existing land use and land cover data are selected as prior knowledge to select typical sample areas. Based on the spectral characteristics and spectral relationship of different objects in GF-4 satellite image, decision tree classification method is used to eliminate the obvious non-residential areas such as cloud, vegetation, water and shadow, so as to reduce the subsequent data processing and reduce the false recognition rate in residential area. Finally, SVM classifier is selected for the classification of residential areas. Taking GF-4 satellite data in Jiashan county as experiment, the result shows that the user accuracy of resident recognition by this method is 89.96%, which is significantly higher than that without resolution enhancement in the same method. Besides, the spatial scope of the county and township residents can be effectively identified in GF-4 enhanced image.

TI  - Model selection in Bayesian framework to identify the best WorldView-2 based vegetation index in predicting green biomass of salt marshes in the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems globally but have experienced dramatic degradation and loss within the past several decades. Vegetation biomass of coastal wetlands is not only the key component of blue carbon storage but also plays an important role in vertical accretion, important for maintaining these habitats under relative sea-level rise. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective approach to study vegetation biomass at a broad spatial scale. We developed statistical models to predict peak aboveground green biomass of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, two dominant species of salt marshes using WorldView-2 satellite imagery at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) on the Mississippi coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The model accounted for nested data structures in the sampled biomass, assimilated uncertainties from data, parameters and model structures, and helped determine the best vegetation index among a variety of commonly-used indices to predict aboveground green biomass. We developed a series of mixed-effects models, which included different combinations of fixed effect(s), random intercept, and random slope(s). The fixed effects were species and one of the 60 vegetation indices derived from a WorldView-2 image obtained on 6 October 2012. The random effect used was site. We implemented the models in a Bayesian framework and selected the best model structure and vegetation index based on minimum posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion. The results showed that the best vegetation index to predict peak green biomass was the green chlorophyll index derived from the reflectance values of band 8 (near-infrared) and band 3 (green), and its effect on biomass prediction varied among sites. The inclusion of species as a fixed effect improved the model prediction. The study demonstrated the need to account for spatial dependence of data in developing a robust model, and the importance of the second WorldView-2 near-infrared band (860-1040nm) in predicting aboveground green biomass for the Grand Bay NERR. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling in Bayesian inference which coherently combined field and WorldView-2 data with uncertainties accounted for provides a robust and nondestructive tool for resource managers to monitor the status of coastal wetlands at a high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Through this study, we hope to emphasize the importance of appropriately accounting for nested data structures using mixed-effects models and promote wider application of Bayesian inference to facilitate assimilation of uncertainties in remote sensing applications.

TI  - Forward a spatio-temporal trend surface for long-term ground-measured albedo upscaling over heterogeneous land surface
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Upscaling ground albedo is challenged by the serious discrepancy between the heterogeneity of land surfaces and the small number of ground-based measurements. Conventional ground-based measurements cannot provide sufficient information on the characteristics of surface albedo at the scale of coarse pixels over heterogeneous land surfaces. One method of overcoming this problem is to introduce high-resolution albedo imagery as ancillary information for upscaling. However, due to the low frequency of updating of high-resolution albedo maps, upscaling time series of ground-based albedo measurements is difficult. This paper proposes a method that is based on the idea of conceptual universal scaling methodology for establishing a spatiotemporal trend surface using very few high-resolution images and time series of ground-based measurements for spatial-temporal upscaling of albedo. The construction of the spatiotemporal trend surface incorporates the spatial information provided by auxiliary remote sensing images and the temporal information provided by long time series of ground observations. This approach was illustrated by upscaling ground-based fine-scale albedo measurements to a coarse scale over the core study area in HiWATER. The results indicate that this method can characterize the spatiotemporal variations in surface albedo well, and the overall correlation coefficient was 0.702 during the study period.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastlines are some of the most important dynamic linear features on the Earth's surface. Conducting research on coastline changes is essential to improve the environmental management and development of the coast. In this study, Landsat satellite images that cover the entire coastal zone of Shenzhen, which was the first special economic zone in China, are used to study coastline changes. Multitemporal coastline information for Shenzhen from 1988 to 2015 is extracted based on the object-oriented classification approach. The overall classification accuracy of this approach can reach 85% or more when it is used to classify the land-use types present within the coastal zone in this study. Moreover, coastline change rates are calculated using a point-based approach. Coastline stability changes are analyzed, and driving rules are explored, using a data-mining approach that addresses natural and social factors. The research results demonstrate that the object-based approach can extract accurate coastline information from Landsat images and that the coastlines in Shenzhen have varied with time and location. The coastline changes in Shenzhen from 1988 to 2015 can be divided into two stages: one displays accelerated change (1988-2003), whereas the other displays decelerated change (2003-2015). Completely different change characteristics of coastline stability are found between the eastern and western coastlines in Shenzhen, and the differences are mainly reflected in the coastline's morphological changes and varying rules.

TI  - NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY DYNAMICS AND DRIVING FORCES IN GUANGZHOU CITY, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion and land use/land cover change (LULCC), driven primarily by human activities, have significant influences on the environment; in addition, the two factors, together with climate change, have an impact on urban vegetation. This study explored spatiotemporal dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) and calculated relative contributions of driving factors from 2001 to 2013 in Guangzhou City, China The effects of climate variables, urban expansion, and subsequent LULCC on interannual NPP variability were analyzed and compared. Results showed that NPP fluctuated and generally declined in Guangzhou over the 13-year study period, especially significant in inner suburbs (southern, eastern, and northern regions (p < 0.05), due to increasingly intensive human activities. LULCC, especially the reduction of cropland due to urban sprawl, resulted in significant NPP losses and positive relative impact index (RII) values, which indicated that LULCC played a negative role in NPP accumulation. More than 67.2% of NPP variability was controlled by LULCC in the whole area under study and mean RII values in all regions were higher than 50%, indicating that the influence of LULCC on NPP variability was greater than that of climate change. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that local climate change had a greater influence on NPP in forested areas (e.g. in the northeastern region), but it should not be ignored that RII kept increasing annually in this region and therefore more efforts paid in conservation were required. In conclusion, urban expansion and LULCC across the whole study area are resulted from human activities, and this, rather than climate change, was the primary driving force for the regional reduction in NPP.

AB  - Lakeside cities in Plateau Lake Area are unique in the natural environment and ecological landscape. The rapid urbanization of Lakeside cities results in the urban heat island effect, thus impact the regional climate, ecological environment and social-economic development of plateau Lakeside cities. (1) The Landsat series of satellite remote sensing data of the past 30 years (1987-2017) in Dianchi basin is selected to retrieve brightness temperature, the land use/land cover and landscape metrics. (2) The spatial and temporal variation of heat island intensity over the past thirty years in Dianchi Lake Basin was analyzed. The result shows that the heat island is mostly concentrated in the high-density residential area, industrial area, developing land, building materials storage area and other areas. (3) The temporal-spatial correlation between land use/land cover and landscape pattern and heat island intensity in lakeside cities of the plateau was analyzed. The analysis shows that the land use/land cover and landscape pattern have a strong spatial-temporal correlation with the heat island intensity, the vegetation has an obvious cooling effect and building area has a warming effect. Urbanization undermines the characteristics of the original natural surface and causes the surface temperature change.

AB  - The detection of built-up areas is essential for high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR) applications, such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. In this paper, we proposed an attention based convolutional neural network for the detection of built-up areas in SAR images. Our network composes of two parts. First part contains two branches, one is designed to obtain high detection rate and the other one is designed to obtain low false alarm rate. Second part aims to merge the advantages of the two detection results of first part by using attention mechanism. Experiments on TerraSAR-X high resolution SAR images over Beijing demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

TI  - Estimation of CDOM concentration in inland lake based on random forest using Sentinel-3A OLCI
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the water is an important source of organic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the lake ecosystem. It is a challenge to use the satellite data to inverse the CDOM concentration in inland water. Based on the in situ observations in Lake Dianchi (September 2009 and April 2017) and Lake Taihu (July 2016), and experiments in the laboratory and on the basis of analyzing the inherent optical properties of water bodies, this paper introduces a machine learning algorithm, the random forest inversion model of CDOM concentration in inland lake water, was established based on Sentinel-3A OLCI sensor. The inversion accuracy of the random forest model and other commonly used model such as band ratio model, the first order differential model, the semi-analysis model and the BP neural network model are evaluated by using an independent verification data set. The results show that the mean square error of the random forest model is 0.14 m(-1), with a mean relative error 21%. Compared with the BP neural network model with relatively good inversion effect, the root mean square error is reduced by 50% and the mean relative error is reduced by 38%. The accuracy of inversion has been significantly improved. According to the characteristic parameters of the random forest algorithm, the influence of the respective variables is provided, it is found that the contribution rate of B11 (709 nm) and B6 (560 nm) is the largest, which is the sensitive band of CDOM. Finally, the random forest model was applied to the Sentinel-3A OLCI image in Lake Dianchi on April 12, 2017 and Lake Taihu on May 18, 2017, the distribution of CDOM concentration in the two lakes were obtained. The distribution of CDOM concentration in Lake Dianchi show that the northeast and the southwest region is higher than that in the central and western region. Meanwhile, the CDOM concentration in estuarine is higher than that in the lake water, which indicates that the input of runoff brings a lot of CDOM to Lake Dian chi. The distribution of CDOM concentration in Lake Taihu show a trend that higher in the west region while lower in the middle and east region. The western part of Lake Taihu and the Meiliang Bay in the northern part are greatly affected by the rivers inflow, resulted in a high CDOM concentration, although such influence is gradually reduced for the open area far from the estuary. The CDOM concentration in the eastern Lake Taihu is low due to the abundant aquatic plants and clear water.

AB  - The PROSAIL (Prospect + SAIL) canopy radiation transfer model is the most widely used physical model in vegetation parameter inversion, however, it is hard to achieve a balance between the accuracy and efficiency of the retrieval. In this paper, a PSO-coupled (particle swarm optimization) bi-LUT (look-up table) was used to retrieve LAI (leaf area index) and LCC (leaf chlorophyll content) from Sentinel-2 MSI (multi-spectral instrument) images, which largely reduced the time consumption of the inversion. The results were validated with ground measurements. The RMSE of retrieved LAI and LCC were 0.79 m(2)/m(2) and 7.1 mu g/cm(2), separately.

AB  - Accurate and realtime data in wide spatial space at this time is still a problem because of the unavailability of observation of rainfall in each region. Weather satellites have a very wide range of observations and can be used to determine rainfall variability with better resolution compared with a limited direct observation. Utilization of Himawari-8 satellite data in estimating rainfall using Convective Stratiform Technique (CST) method. The CST method is performed by separating convective and stratiform cloud components using infrared channel satellite data. Cloud components are classified by slope because the physical and dynamic growth processes are very different. This research was conducted in Bali area on December 14, 2016 by verifying the result of CST process with rainfall data from Ngurah Rai Meteorology Station Bali. It is found that CST method result had simililar value with data observation in Ngurah Rai meteorological station, so it assumed that CST method can be used for rainfall estimation in Bali region.

TI  - Land cover 2.0
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Interest in knowing more about the Earth's land cover and how it has changed over time motivated the mission and sensor design of early terrestrial remote sensing systems. Rapid developments in computer hardware and software in the last four decades have greatly increased the capacity for satellite data acquisition, downlink, dissemination, and end user science and applications. In 1992, Townshend reviewed the state of land cover mapping using Earth observation data at a pivotal point in time and in the context of years of research and practical experience with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Visible (HRV) and Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, demonstrating the opportunities and information content possible with increased spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Townshend characterized the state-of-the-art for land cover at that time, identified trends, and shared insights on research directions. Now, on the 25th anniversary of Townshend's important work, given numerous advances and emerging trends, we revisit the status of land cover mapping with Earth observation data. We posit that a new era of land cover analysis - Land Cover 2.0 - has emerged, enabled by free and open access data, analysis ready data, high performance computing, and rapidly developing data processing and analysis capabilities. Herein we characterize this new era in land cover information, highlighting institutional, computational, as well as theoretical developments that have occurred over the past 25years, identifying the key issues and opportunities that have emerged. We conclude that Land Cover 2.0 offers efficiencies in information generation that will result in a proliferation of land cover products, reinforcing the need for transparency regarding the input data and algorithms used as well as adoption, implementation, and communication of rigorous accuracy assessment protocols. Further, land cover and land change assessments are no longer independent activities. Knowledge of land change is available to inform and enrich land cover generation.

TI  - Decision Tree-Based Contextual Location Prediction from Mobile Device Logs
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contextual location prediction is an important topic in the field of personalized location recommendation in LBS (location-based services). With the advancement of mobile positioning techniques and various sensors embedded in smartphones, it is convenient to obtain massive human mobile trajectories and to derive a large amount of valuable information from geospatial big data. Extracting and recognizing personally interesting places and predicting next semantic location become a research hot spot in LBS. In this paper, we proposed an approach to predict next personally semantic place with historical visiting patterns derived from mobile device logs. To address the problems of location imprecision and lack of semantic information, a modified trip-identify method is employed to extract key visit points from GPS trajectories to a more accurate extent while semantic information are added through stay point detection and semantic places recognition. At last, a decision tree model is adopted to explore the spatial, temporal, and sequential features in contextual location prediction. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, experiments were conducted based on a trajectory collection in Guangzhou downtown area. The results verified the feasibility of our approach on contextual location prediction from continuous mobile devices logs.

AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to provide consistent land cover and land cover change products for the nation since 2001. As one of products in the NLCD, the percent impervious surface area (ISA), which was estimated with Landsat imagery, represents the fraction of human-made impervious area in a 30-m grid and has been used to quantify urban land cover types and extents for the United States. However, it is still a challenge to clearly determine urban land cover intensity and extents using remote sensing data with spatial and spectral resolutions similar to Landsat in part because of highly heterogeneous features of urban land cover. Most urban areas, especially in low intensity development areas, exhibit sub-pixel characteristics that mix impervious surface with other land covers (e.g., grass and trees) in the 30-m resolution satellite imagery. Furthermore, the influence of highly heterogeneous features in many urban areas and how they alter the spectral signature of urban landscapes has not yet been fully studied.Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided multiple spectral and spatial resolution data from several satellites including WorldView (WV), Sentinel-2, and the Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI). Remote sensing images having different spectral bands and high spatial resolution provide the potential to derive detailed information on the nature and properties of different surface materials on the urban ground.This study focuses on performance of mapping impervious surface using data collected from WorldView-3, Sentinel-2, and Landsat OLI. We compared ISA results estimated from these sensors and evaluated benefits and limitations of radiometric and spatial resolutions for mapping impervious surface in a study area on the Eastern corridor between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, where developed impervious surface containing both residential housings, office buildings, and roads, in the United States. The impact of different band combinations in Sentinel-2 imagery on mapping urban impervious surface and urban land cover was also evaluated.

AB  - The FY-3C MWHS-2 (Microwave Humidity Sounder-2) data have been assimilated in the ECMWF operational forecasting system showing small positive impacts on short-range forecasts. To assess the impacts of all-sky (i.e. clear, cloudy and precipitating) assimilation of MWHS-2 183 GHz channels on the analysis and forecasts of typhoon precipitation caused by Typhoon Nida which made landfall in Guangdong Province, China in 2016, three experiments (without MWHS-2 data, with MWHS-2 data in clear-sky conditions and with MWHS-2 data in all-sky conditions) have been carried out. RTTOV-SCATT, a fast Radiative Transfer Model for simulating cloud-and precipitation-affected microwave radiances, and a symmetric observation error model for all-sky radiance assimilation are implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting model data assimilation system (WRFDA) and its three-dimension variational data assimilation scheme is used for all experiments. Compared with the experiment run without MWHS-2 data, the assimilation of MWHS-2 observations in clear-sky and all-sky conditions makes more accurate precipitation forecasts over the north-central Guangdong. Furthermore, compared with the clear-sky experiment, the precipitation distribution over the east of the Pearl River and the rainfall amount in the eastern Guangdong both are more close to the observations due to the improved temperature and humidity analysis by assimilating more cloud-and precipitation-affected radiances over the northern South China Sea and Typhoon Nida in all-sky experiment. Since the results in this study are very encouraging, more experiments are to be run to verify the positive impacts of all-sky assimilation on the prediction of severe weather processes.*tastelifeweather@sina.cn

AB  - Individual tree detection and counting are critical for the forest inventory management. In almost all of these methods that based on remote sensing data, the treetop detection is the most important and essential part. However, due to the diversities of the tree attributes, such as crown size and branch distribution, it is hard to find a universal treetop detector and most of the current detectors need to be carefully designed based on the heuristic or prior knowledge. Hence, to find an efficient and versatile detector, we apply deep neural network to extract and learn the high-level semantic treetop features. In contrast to using manually labelled training data, we innovatively train the network with the pseudo ones that come from the result of the conventional non-supervised treetop detectors which may be not robust in different scenarios. In this study, we use multi-view high-resolution satellite imagery derived DSM (Digital Surface Model) and multispectral orthophoto as data and apply the top-hat by reconstruction (THR) operation to find treetops as the pseudo labels. The FCN (fully convolutional network) is adopted as a pixel-level classification network to segment the input image into treetops and non-treetops pixels. Our experiments show that the FCN based treetop detector is able to achieve a detection accuracy of 99.7% at the prairie area and 66.3% at the complicated town area which shows better performance than THR in the various scenarios. This study demonstrates that without manual labels, the FCN treetop detector can be trained by the pseudo labels that generated using the non-supervised detector and achieve better and robust results in different scenarios.

TI  - Downscaling MODIS-derived water maps with high-precision topographic data in a shallow lake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery is the most efficient and widely used data source to monitor the water area changes. However, a trade-off always exists between temporal resolution and spatial resolution for satellite images. Taking the southern Dongting Lake as an example, this study was conducted to develop a method of down-scaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived coarse spatial resolution water maps in shallow lakes with high-precision digital elevation model. The main principle of the method is to identify and adjust the horizontal location errors of the waterlines extracted from coarse-resolution data by analysing and modifying the elevation leaps using finer-scale topography information. Moving average filter was used to smooth the errors of waterlines caused by the geometric inaccuracies and classification uncertainties of the coarse data. The optimal local window size of the moving average filter was selected automatically using an exponential decay function model and a curvature algorithm for each pixel in the waterlines. In reference to Landsat Thematic Mapper data, the accuracy of the downscaling result is distinctly higher than that of the original MODIS normalized difference water index-derived water maps. The presented method is proved to be an effective tool for acquiring water maps of shallow lake with high spatio-temporal resolution using coarseor moderate-resolution satellite imagery and high-precision topographic data.

AB  - Vegetation coverage dynamics is affected by climatic, topography and human activities, which is an important indicator reflecting the regional ecological environment. Revealing the spatial-temporal characteristics of vegetation coverage is of great significance to the protection and management of ecological environment. Based on MODIS NDVI data and the Maximum Value Composites (MVC), we excluded soil spectrum interference to calculate Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC). Then the long-term FVC was used to calculate the spatial pattern and temporal variation of vegetation in Wujiang River Basin from 2000 to 2016 by using Trend analysis and Hurst index. The relationship between topography and spatial distribution of FVC was analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The multi-annual mean vegetation coverage reveals a spatial distribution variation characteristic of low value in midstream and high level in other parts of the basin, owing a mean value of 0.6567. (2) From 2000 to 2016, the FVC of the Wujiang River Basin fluctuated between 0.6110 and 0.7380, and the overall growth rate of FVC was 0.0074/a. (3) The area of vegetation coverage tending to improve is more than that going to degrade in the future. Grass land, Arable land and Others improved significantly; karst rocky desertification comprehensive management project lead to persistent vegetation coverage improvement of Grass land, Arable land and Others. Residential land is covered with obviously degraded vegetation, resulting of urban sprawl; (4) The spatial distribution of FVC is positively correlated with TNI. Researches of spatial-temporal evolution of vegetation coverage have significant meaning for the ecological environment protection and management of the Wujiang River Basin.

TI  - High-resolution spatiotemporal mapping of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at Mainland China using a combined BME-GWR technique
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid economic development, industrialization and urbanization, the ambient air PM2.5 has become a major pollutant linked to respiratory, heart and lung diseases. In China, PM2.5 pollution constitutes an extreme environmental and social problem of widespread public concern. In this work we estimate ground-level PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), topography data, meteorological data, and pollutant emission using an integrative technique. In particular, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis was combined with Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) theory to assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 exposure in a large region of China and generate informative PM2.5 space-time predictions (estimates). It was found that, due to its integrative character, the combined BME-GWR method offers certain improvements in the space-time prediction of PM2.5 concentrations over China compared to previous techniques. The combined BME-GWR technique generated realistic maps of space-time PM2.5 distribution, and its performance was superior to that of seven previous studies of satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations in China in terms of prediction accuracy. The purely spatial GWR model can only be used at a fixed time, whereas the integrative BME-GWR approach accounts for cross space-time dependencies and can predict PM2.5 concentrations in the composite space-time domain. The 10-fold results of BME-GWR modeling (R-2 = 0.883, RMSE = 11.39 mu g/m(3)) demonstrated a high level of space-time PM2.5 prediction (estimation) accuracy over China, revealing a definite trend of severe PM2.5 levels from the northern coast toward inland China (Nov 2015 Feb 2016). Future work should focus on the addition of higher resolution AOD data, developing better satellite-based prediction models, and related air pollutants for space-time PM2.5 prediction purposes.

AB  - The surface deformation of Dujiangyan, Sichuan, China was studied. Permanent Scatterer (PS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique was applied to 21 Envisat SAR datasets acquired from May of 2008 to July of 2010 and 61 Sentinel-1 SAR datasets acquired between October of 2014 and November of 2017. The Zipingpu Dam, located on the northwestern highland area of Dujiangyan had obvious subsidence in a 2-year period after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The rate ranged from 0 to -30mm/year. The quake was attributed to the major cause. From 2014 to 2017, the dam was deformed less than 5mm/year. The dam was relatively stable. Since the recovering efforts were completed before 2014, the surface deformation in the urban areas of Dujiangyan was small between 2014 and 2017. The dominant rate was about 2 to -4mm/year.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change patterns of urban lakes in China's major cities between 1990 and 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced unprecedented urbanization in the past decades, resulting in dramatic changes in the physical, limnological, and hydrological characteristics of lakes in urban landscapes. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics in distribution and abundance of urban lakes in China remain poorly understood. Here, we characterized the spatiotemporal change patterns of urban lakes in China's major cities between 1990 and 2015 using remote-sensing data and landscape metrics. The results showed that the urban lake landscape patterns have experienced drastic changes over the past 25 years. The total surface area of the urban lakes has decreased by 17,620.02ha, a decrease of 24.22%, with a significant increase in the landscape fragmentation and a reduction in shape complexity. We defined three lake-shrinkage types and found that vanishment was the most common lake-shrinkage pattern, followed by edge-shrinkage and tunneling in terms of lake area. Moreover, we also found that urban sprawl was the dominant driver of the lake shrinkage, accounting for 67.89% of the total area loss, and the transition from lakes to cropland was also an important factor (19.86%). This study has potential for providing critical baseline information for government decision-making in lake resources management and urban landscape design.

AB  - Accurate spatiotemporal information about crop progress during the growing season is critical for crop yield estimation. Crop progress monitoring at field scale requires high resolution remote sensing data in both time and space. Remote sensing data from a single sensor cannot satisfy the requirement at present. Data fusion approach has been developed to fuse remote sensing imagery from Landsat and MODIS instruments. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is one of the most popular spatial and temporal data fusion algorithms and has been applied in many applications. The data fusion accuracy was evaluated for many sites. Previous studies found that the accuracy of data fusion results depended on the pair images used. In this study, several Landsat-8 reflectance images (path28/row31) in 2015 were selected as pair images to evaluate the data fusion accuracy. Results were assessed based on the observed Landsat data that have not been used as pair images due to partial cloud coverage or image gaps. Several statistic metrics, including average absolute difference, root mean square error, correlation coefficient, and the spectral angle mapper, were calculated to assess the data fusion results. The initial results show that the predictability of each images pair at different dates is different. Closer dates have better prediction accuracy as expected. Interestingly, the different crop type (corn and soybeans) shows different data fusion accuracies even using same image pair. This study suggests that data fusion results could be further improved if an appropriate image pair is selected. Accurate dense time-series data at Landsat resolution will enhance our ability in crop condition monitoring and crop yield estimation at field scale.

AB  - Soil erosion is an important research issue because it can result in serious hazards, such as land quality degrading, flood frequency increasing and deposit in rivers and lakes. The factor of cover and management is a parameter of the soil erosion prediction model and it is the ratio of soil erosion of the present cover and management to continuous clear tillage. Good vegetation cover and the effective land management can control soil erosion to some extent. Quantitative assessment the factor of cover and management in a region scale can provide the cover and management data and some good suggestion for the land use and soil conservation planning. This study chooses Hunan Province in the central and southern China which has no relevant research till now. With the land use and vegetation coverage data of 30 meters resolution extracted from Landsat images in 2000, 2005. 2010 and 2015,the cover and management factor of this region is evaluated and the spatial-temporal characteristics of land use and the factor is analyzed by using the evaluation method, GIS spatial analysis and statistical analysis. The results are as follows. Because the main terrains are mountains and hills which account for 70 percent of the whole province area, the main land use types are forest land and grassland. The mean of cover and management factor is 0.06739, 0.06783, 0.06876 and 0.07421 in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 respectively. The factor increased about 10 percent from 2000 to 2015. The change of cover and management factor may increase soil losses risk if the other factors affecting soil losses are not taken into account.

AB  - ZY3-02 is the first satellite equipped with a laser altimeter for earth observation in China. This laser altimeter is an experimental payload for land elevation measurement experiment. The ranging and pointing bias of the laser altimeter would change due to the launch vibration, the space environment difference or other factors, which is one of the most important factors affecting the geometric accuracy of laser altimeter. This paper proposed an on-orbit calibration method based on terrain matching with pyramidsearch of spaceborne laser altimeter. Firstly, we used the high-accuracy reference DEM data to match with stripes of point cloud obtained by the geometric location model of laser altimeter, and the optimal matching terrain can be determined by pyramid-search. Then the accurate pointing error of the laser altimeter was acquired. On this basis, the range error was calibrated by separating systematic and random error. After the calibration, the systematic error was effectively eliminated. Using the ALOS-DSM data with 30 meters grid size as reference, the elevation accuracy of the laser altimeter was improved from 100 meters to 2-3 meters. The proposed method provides an effective calibration means without the test site for the spaceborne laser altimeters.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology provides informative data for detecting the land surface temperature (LST) distribution and urban heat island (UHI) effect remotely and regionally. In this study, two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired on September 26, 1987 and September 17, 2013 were used to derive LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values in Wuhan, China. The relationships between NDVI and LST were examined in different contexts, namely built-up area, farmland, grassland and forest. Results showed that negative correlations between the mean NDVI and LST were detected in all observed land covers, which meant that vegetation was efficient in decreasing surface temperatures and mitigating UHI effect. The cooling efficiency of vegetation on thermal environment varied with different contexts. As mean NDVI increased at each 0.1, the decreased LST values in built-up area, farmland, grassland and forest were 1.4 degrees C, 1.4 degrees C, 1.1 degrees C, 1.9 degrees C in 1987 and 1.4 degrees C, 1.7 degrees C, 1.3 degrees C, 1.8 degrees C in 2013, respectively. This finding encourages urban planners and greening designers to devote more efforts in protecting urban forests.

T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays important roles in surface energy conversion, crop growth, environmental protection, and drought monitoring. As crops grow, the associated vegetation seriously affects the ability of satellites to retrieve SM data. Here, we collected such data at different growth stages of maize using Bragg and X-Bragg scattering models based on the Freeman-Durden polarization decomposition method. We used the H/A/Alpha polarization decomposition approach to extract accurate threshold values of decomposed scattering components. The results showed that the H and Alpha values of bare soil areas were lower and those of vegetated areas were higher. The threshold values of the three scattering components were 0.2-0.4 H and 7-24 degrees Alpha for the surface scattering component, 0.6-0.9 H and 22-50 degrees Alpha for the volume scattering component, and other values for the dihedral scattering component. The SM data retrieved (using the X-Bragg model) on June 27, 2014, were better than those retrieved at other maize growth stages and were thus associated with the minimum root-mean-square error value (0.028). The satellite-evaluated SM contents were in broad agreement with data measured in situ. Our algorithm thus improves the accuracy of SM data retrieval from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the limitations of the imaging sensor and theoretical aspect, hyperspectral images (HSIs) are contaminated with some unwanted components such as noise and a lack of spatial information. This article proposes a spatial-spectral feature enhancement model to eliminate interference, modify spectral distortion, and increase the useful features. The framework firstly proposes an effective spatial feature-based strategy for selecting a band with the most edge information to serve as alpha channel. Given the alpha channel, the continuous foreground and background are estimated by the closed form solution. Finally, feature-enhanced HSI is obtained by linearly combining the selected band, hyper foreground and background. Experimental results of the ground-based data and remotely sensed data indicate that the proposed feature enhancement algorithm provides effective performance in enhancing spatial-spectral features and reducing noise. Especially, the feature-enhanced data have positive influence on both unmixing and classification.

AB  - This study tests the performance of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) for estimation of karst rocky desertification (KRD) in karst studies. We present a methodology to build a regionally specific spectral library of karst materials including: vegetation, carbonate rock, soil, and water. Using this library, we applied MESMA to generate a total of 1000 two-, three-, and four-endmember models for each Landsat 8 OLI pixel, and the mapped fractions were validated using WorldView-2 plots. The results showed that a majority of the image could be modeled successfully with two-or three-endmember SMA models. The validation results indicated the robustness of MESMA for deriving spatially continuous variables quantified at the sub-pixel level. Quantitative analysis of the resulting percent KRD and comparative analyses with traditional Liner Spectral Unmixing (LSU) indicate that MESMA improved the estimation accuracy of KRD.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Temporal Trend of Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> over the Wanjiang City Belt of China
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We utilize the tropospheric NO2 columns derived from the observations of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard AURA to analyze the spatial distributions and temporal trends of NO2 in Wanjiang City Belt (WCB) of China from 2005 to 2016. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of industrial transfer policy on the air quality in WCB. Firstly, we used the surface in situ NO2 concentrations to compare with the OMI-retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns in order to verify the accuracy of the satellite data over the WCB area. Although it is difficult to compare the two datasets directly, the comparison results prove the accuracy of the OMI-retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns in cities of WCB. Then, the spatial distributions of the annual averaged tropospheric NO2 total columns over Anhui Province show that NO2 columns were considerably higher in WCB than those in other areas of Anhui. Also, we compared the spatial distributions of the total NO2 columns in 2005 through 2010 and in 2011 through 2016 and found that the total NO2 columns in WCB increased by 19.9%, while the corresponding value increased only 13.9% in other Anhui areas except the WCB area. Furthermore, the temporal variations of NO2 columns show that although the NO2 columns over WCB and Anhui increased significantly from 2005 to 2011, they decreased sharply from 2011 to 2016 due to the strict emission reduction measures in China. Finally, the HYSPLIT model was used to analyze the origins of NO2 and transport pathways of air masses in a typical city, Ma'anshan city.

TI  - Death Effects Assessment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Pollution in China
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The provinces of China have suffered from severe PM2.5 pollution in recent years, presenting a significant threat to human health. Identifying associations between mortality rate and PM2.5 level is extremely useful for a range of purposes, such as the development of preventive measures, increasing health awareness, and establishing disaster warning systems. Based on remote sensing data, station monitoring data, and statistical data, this paper uses the exposure response function, regression analysis, and kriging to evaluate the number of deaths in China's 31 provinces caused by PM2.5 pollution in 2015. Variations in the number of deaths and mortality rates in China under different PM2.5 concentration control standards have been simulated by a range of countries and organizations helping to develop optimal control standards for each province individually according to actual PM2.5 concentration. These results show that:1) PM2.5 pollution has an important effect on the mortality rate in China. The rate caused by PM2.5 pollution in 2015 accounted for 1.75%, or approximately 2.62 million people and 31.14% of all deaths in China.2) Strict control standards for PM2.5 concentration can bring significant health benefits, with projections that if PM2.5 concentration in China's provinces were controlled to the level set by China, the EU, Japan, USA, and Australia, the number of deaths caused by PM2.5 pollution would be reduced by approximately 0.95, 1.52, 2.02, 2.26, and 2.49 million people, respectively, or 36.24%, 58.08%, 79.91%, 86.47%, and 95.20% compared with baseline year data.3) Choosing appropriate control targets for limiting PM2.5 concentrations in different provinces in China is an effective way to obtain optimal health benefits. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan should adopt a 35 mu g/m(3) standard with a 25 mu g/m(3) standard appropriate for Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Shanxi, and Xinjiang; 13 provinces, including Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, should adopt the 15 mu g/m(3) standard; and Hainan should consider choosing a 12 mu g/m(3) standard.

AB  - Accurate wetlands distribution maps could provide important information for wetland management and protection. While, wetlands have significantly inner-annual variation which makes accurate wetland mapping challenging. Time series data with high temporal resolution, such as MODIS are wildly used in monitoring wetlands, but the coarse resolution cannot precisely identify detail of the wetlands and smaller wetlands. In addition, optimal features for wetlands classification is still unclear. In this study, Landsat monthly composited time series were used to identify wetlands. Firstly, we generated the Landsat 30m land surface reflectance, NDVI, NDWI and TC-Wetness time series by compositing the Landsat7 ETM+ and Landsat8 OLI data. Then the extension of the Jeffries-Matusita Distance (JBh) and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm were used to select the optimal features for accurate wetlands classification. Finally, the optimal features were used for wetlands classification based on the RF algorithm. The results showed that: (1) the optimal features included NDVI in May and August, TC-Wetness in May and NDWI in June and August which can effectively separate seasonal and permanent marshes, rice fields, grass and drylands; (2) the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient calculated using the optimal features were 90.05% and 0.88 respectively which were similar to the wetlands classification result derived by the entire Landsat time series data. The optimal features could improve efficiency and decrease data redundancy.

AB  - Globally, wetland loss and degradation have become serious environmental and ecological issues. Wetland monitoring of Ramsar sites in China is important for developing reasonable strategies to protect wetlands. Satellite image time series may be used for the long-term monitoring of wetland ecosystems. The present study used moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data collected in 2001 and 2013 for 20 Ramsar sites in China and assessed the environmental status of these reserves using landscape metrics. The results showed that specific seasonal wetland classes, such as flooded mud, permanent water and seasonal marshes, can be identified using MODIS time series data with acceptable accuracy. In addition to wetland area, we suggest using other landscape metrics, including landscape integrity and landscape disturbance or degradation indices, to assess wetland environmental quality. The slight wetland loss (0.8%) noted in the 20 reserves evaluated herein could indicate the effectiveness of efforts of the Chinese government and local government agencies to protect Ramsar sites. The existing unfavourable environmental conditions, which were manifested by low landscape integrity and high landscape disturbance or degradation for some reserves, were caused primarily by increasing water requirements outside the reserves and by agricultural development within reserves. Therefore, determining how to balance relationships between economic development and ecological protection of the reserves will be important in the future.

TI  - Sensitivity of BRDF, NDVI and Wind Speed to the Aerodynamic Roughness Length over Sparse <i>Tamarix</i> in the Downstream Heihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerodynamic roughness length (z0m) is an important parameter that affects the momentum and energy exchange between the earth surface's and the atmosphere. In this paper, the gradient wind speed data that were observed from May to October, 2014, at the Si Daoqiao station, which is located in an area of sparse Tamarix in the downstream region of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), are used to evaluate the sensitivity of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared (NIR) bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) R, the MODIS/Landsat 8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the wind speed at 5 m in comparison with the field-measured z0m. The results indicate that the NIR BRDF_R_MODIS and the NDVIMODIS/NDVILandsat8 are less sensitive indicators of the z0m over sparse Tamarix areas (R-2: 0.0045 for NIR BRDF_R-MODIS; R-2: 0.0342 for NDVIMODIS; and, R-2: 0.1646 for NDVILandsat8), which differs significantly from the results obtained by previous studies for farmlands and grasslands. However, there is a nearly linear correlation between the wind speed at 5 m and the z0m at the time scale of the NDVILandsat8 acquisitions (R-2: 0.3696). Furthermore, the combination of the NDVI and wind speed at 5 m can significantly improve this correlation (R-2: 0.7682 for NDVIMODIS; R-2: 0.6304 for NDVILandsat8), whereas the combination of the NIR BRDF_R-MODIS and wind speed at 5 m still has a low correlation (R-2: 0.0886). Finally, the regional z0m of the oasis in the downstream region of the HRB was determined using Landsat 8 surface reflectance data and the wind speed data at the Si Daoqiao station, which properly reflect the temporal evolution of the z0m in that region. The parameterization scheme proposed in this paper has great potential to be applied to evapotranspiration, land surface, and hydrologic model simulations of sparse Tamarix at Si Daoqiao site in the future.

AB  - Extraction of oil slicks from remote sensing data is a basic work for investigation of oil spill and natural oil leakage. It is time-consuming and laborious when the traditional method of artificial interpretation is applied to tens of thousands of remote sensing data. In order to improve the efficiency of oil slicks extraction, eCognition, object-oriented image analysis software, is introduced to set up a rule set which can realize the batch processing of oil slick extraction. Landsat TM data of known oil seep site from Gulf of Mexico is used as training data to set up the rule set. Following the several processes such as image segmentation, hierarchical classification, training Sample selection, feature space optimization and nearest neighbor classification, oil slicks and several other sea surface targets were extracted in the format of shape within ten minutes. The result shows that the oil extraction based on eCognition rule set is faster and more accurate than manual interpretation. When the rule set was applied to the sea area of South China Sea, there were two significant discoveries. One is that the pollution of the white tiger oil field is very serious. Oil slicks can be detected on almost all available Landsat TM data. Another is that the first natural oil and gas seep is come to light in South China Sea.

TI  - Snow specific surface area remote sensing retrieval using a microstructure based reflectance model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow specific area (SSA) is a quantity to describe the size of snow grains, which controls the albedo of snow surface. The remote sensing retrieval of snow SSA is important for large scale energy and snow physical properties studies. The previous SSA retrieval algorithms are based on snow reflectance forward models with shape assumptions of snow grains, which may cause bias in the quantitative retrieval of SSA. In this paper, a new SSA retrieval algorithm based on a recently developed snow reflectance model is presented. In the reflectance model, the microstructure of snow medium is simulated by computer and the light scattering process is modeled by Monte Carlo ray tracing and radiative transfer theory. Validation shows the model can accurately simulate snow surface reflectance even at large incident or observation zenith angles. Three datasets were used to validate the SSA retrieval algorithm. The validation results show that the SSA can be accurately estimated using MODIS data. The difference of SSA by using reflectance of different wavelengths are studied by MODIS band 5 and band 6 data. The SSA retrieval algorithm is then applied to seasonal snow cover to study the temporal and spatial pattern of snow surface optical grain size.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-point source (NPS) pollution is an important source of lake eutrophication, the phosphorus (P) is one of the main elements of NPS pollution, and land use change has an important influence on NPS pollution load. Most previous studies focused on a single phase and did not analyze the internal structure of land use. In this study, six natural river basins such as the Hangbu River Basin were selected as the study area in Chaohu Basin, China Based on the Sediment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model, the NPS P load was simulated from 2000 to 2015, and the characteristics of land use change were depth analyzed at the same time to discuss the mechanism of land use pattern on NPS P load under longterm sequence. The main result are as follow: the NPS P load intensity was positively correlated with FL (forest land) area, in the whole study area, the correlation coefficient between NPS load intensity and FL area was 0.67, and the NPS P load intensity was negatively correlated with arable land (AL), construction land (CL) and wetland (WL) area, and the correlation coefficients were 0.56, 0.26 and 0.14 respectively. On the other hand, the internal structure of land use is also affecting NPS P load, the Fractal Dimension Index Mean (FRAC) was positively correlated with NPS P loss intensity, and the correlation coefficient is 0.56. Compared to the AL, FL and CL are more easily affected by FRAC. The optimization of land use spatial layout plays an important role in alleviating NPS pollution particle state.

TI  - Geometric Feature Extraction of Ship in High-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method for geometric features extraction of ship target in high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image was proposed, After detecting and locating ship targets from high resolution SAR images. The algorithm continues to acquire target slices to construct the process of the ship target geometric feature extraction. Firstly, the algorithm obtained a saliency map, completed the detection and positioning of ship targets, and obtained the ship target slices. Secondly, the algorithm extracted the geometric features based on the resulting ship slices. The slices was estimated by the azimuth to obtain the exact minimum bounding rectangle, then effective and accurate extraction of geometric features can be completed. Finally, the algorithm appied to SAR image target detection, which is efficient proved by experimental results. The experiments on TerraSAR-X and a large number of satellite data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can extract the geometric features with high accuracy and good stability. Unlike traditional methods, the use of improved spectral residual visual significant computational models to locate and segment ship targets can effectively reduce the false alarm rates, and the detection speed increased by 25% to 50%. And it is suitable for practical requirements of ship target detection in high-resolution images.

AB  - The short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (5-7, 26) of Terra MODIS, co-located with the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) bands (20-25) on the short and mid-wave infrared (SMIR) Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) have a known issue related to 5.3 mu m out-of-band (OOB) thermal leak and electronic crosstalk that was identified prelaunch. Intensive efforts were undertaken shortly after launch to mitigate its impacts on the on-orbit calibration and in turn the level 1B (L1B) products. In order to the isolate the OOB contribution among the SWIR bands, special night time day mode (NTDM) operations have been regularly scheduled to collect Earth scene reflective solar bands (RSB) data during spacecraft night time. As MODIS does not have a spectral band centered at 5.3 mu m, measurements from the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) spectrometer field campaigns in the early months after Terra launch were used to help identify band 28 (7.325 mu m) as the best surrogate to simulate the radiances at 5.3 mu m. As a result, band 28 is used as the sending band for the SWIR crosstalk correction for Terra MODIS. In the case of Aqua MODIS, band 25 (4.52 mu m) was found to be more effective as the sending band for the SWIR crosstalk correction. In recent years, the Terra MODIS PV LWIR electronic crosstalk (including band 28), has gradually increased, more significantly after the safe-mode event occurred in Feb, 2016. This accentuated degradation in the PV LWIR performance has also impacted the performance of on-orbit SWIR crosstalk correction algorithm and thus the L1B products. In this paper, we examine the use of band 25 as the sending band for Terra MODIS SWIR crosstalk correction and compare its performance with that based on band 28 as the sending band. Results indicate an improvement in the stability of the on-orbit gain for the SWIR bands and a reduced detector-detector and subframe striping in the L1B products, especially during the period when the PV LWIR electronic crosstalk is more severe.

AB  - The second VIIRS instrument was launched on-board the NOAA-20 (formerly JPSS-1) satellite on November 18, 2017. It was designed and built with the same performance requirements as the first VIIRS on-board the S-NPP launched on October 28, 2011. Currently, the NOAA-20 is orbiting the Earth in the same plane as the S-NPP but separated in time and space by 50 minutes. The VIIRS observations are made in 22 spectral bands, including a day-night band (DNB) that cover wavelengths from visible to long-wave infrared. The sensor's on-orbit calibration is provided by a set of on-board calibrators (OBCs), which include a solar diffuser (SD), a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), and a blackbody (BB). After turn-on, the VIIRS instrument conducted a series of post-launch testing (PLT) and intensive calibration and validation (ICV) activities, including those performed via spacecraft maneuvers, designed to verify and establish instrument on-orbit calibration performance baseline. This paper provides an overview of NOAA-20 VIIRS ICV activities and an assessment of its initial on-orbit performance with a focus on several key calibration parameters, such as the detector response (or gain), dynamic range, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Various issues identified and lessons learned from initial instrument operation and calibration are also discussed in support of long-term monitoring (LTM) of NOAA-20 VIIRS calibration and data quality.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Two MODIS instruments (Terra and Aqua) and two VIIRS instruments (S-NPP and JPSS-1) are currently operated in space, continuously making global earth observations in the spectral range from visible (VIS) to long-wave infrared (LWIR). These observations have enabled a broad range of environmental data records to be generated and distributed in support of both operational and scientific community Despite extensive pre-launch calibration and characterization performed for both MODIS and VIIRS instruments and routine on-orbit calibration activities carried out using their onboard calibrators (OBC), various spacecraft maneuvers have also been designed and implemented to further enhance the sensor on-orbit calibration and data quality. This paper focuses on the use of observations made during spacecraft pitch maneuvers of MODIS and VIIRS in support of their on-orbit characterization of thermal emissive bands (TEB) response versus scan-angle (RVS). In the case of Terra MODIS, lunar observations made from instrument nadir view during spacecraft pitch maneuvers are used to compare with that made regularly through instrument space view (SV) port to evaluate on-orbit changes in RVS and band-to-band registration (BBR) for the reflective solar bands (RSB). In addition to results derived from spacecraft pitch maneuvers performed for MODIS and VIIRS, discussion is provided on the advantages, challenges, and lessons for future considerations and improvements.

AB  - The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument has been in operation for more than 6 years on-board the S-NPP satellite and the second instrument, with the same design and performance requirements, was launched in November, 2017 on-board the JPSS-1 satellite (named NOAA-20 after reaching its orbit) and is currently in normal operation conditions. This paper provides a brief description of VIIRS on-orbit calibration and characterization activities and presents performance assessments and comparisons of S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS using data collected from their on-board calibrators (OBC) and regularly scheduled lunar observations. Results show that NOAA-20 VIIRS is performing as well or better than S-NPP VIIRS in all of the key performance metrics. The NOAA-20 reflective solar bands, including the day-night band, have experienced less than 1% change in gain in the first 250 days since launch and did not suffer from the contamination related rapid degradation experienced by S-NPP VIIRS. Some of the NOAA-20 thermal emissive bands had larger than expected gain degradation after launch due to ice buildup on the dewar window of the long-wave IR focal plane assembly but a mid-mission outgassing operation was able to restore their gains and maintain stable behavior. Though this study is focused on the sensor's key performance parameters, such as detector responses (gains), signal-to-noise ratios, and noise-equivalent temperature differences, challenges identified and lessons learned through different phases of on-orbit calibration and characterization are also discussed.

AB  - The largest natural distribution of Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestrisvar.mongolica) in China is in Hulunber, Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The Mongolian pine growing on sandy land has been very important for building green ecological shelters in northern China, and its spatial distribution and dynamic variation were the basis for optimizing the layout. The distribution of Mongolian pine from 1985 to 2015 was obtained in the study area.The results showed that the non-growing season is more conducive to classifying Mongolian pine in the study area. Mongolian pine was mainly distributed in a longnorth-south-oriented strip, and the distribution area increased from 704.84 km(2)in 1985 to 1309.74 km(2)in 2015. Large spatial variations in Mongolian pine occurred in Ewenki Autonomous Banner and Xin Barag Left Banner, but the characteristics of the change differed among different time periods. The area mainly increased from 1985 to 1995and from 2005 to 2015 but decreased from 1995 to 2005.The spatial pattern of Mongolian pine changed significantly between 1985 and the other years, the overall fragmentation of the population decreased and human activity gradually increased.

TI  - The potential of using LiDAR and color-infrared aerial imagery for palustrine wetland typology and change
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are dynamic landscapes and their spatial extent and types can change over time. Mapping wetland locations, types, and monitoring wetland typological changes have important ecological significance. The National Wetlands Inventory data suffer from two problems: the omission error that some wetlands are not mapped, and the out-of-date wetland types in many counties of the United States. To address these two problems, we proposed an automatic wetland classification model for newly mapped (or existing) wetland polygons lacking typological information. The research goals in this study were (1) to develop a nonparametric and automatic rule-based model to assign wetland types to palustrine wetlands using high-resolution remotely sensed data and (2) to quantify wetland typological changes based on the wetland types obtained from the previous step. The model is a direct application of the Cowardin et al. (1979) wetland classification system without modification. The input information for the proposed model includes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived vegetation height and color infrared aerial imagery-derived vegetation spectral information. We tested the model for the palustrine wetlands in Horry County, SC, and analyzed 29,090 palustrine wetland polygons (101,427ha). The model achieved an overall agreement of 87% for wetland-type classification and showed the dynamics of wetland typological changes. This nonparametric model can be easily applied to other areas where wetland inventory needs updating.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics of Vegetative PUE in China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetative precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) is a key indicator for evaluating the dynamic response of vegetation productivity to the spatiotemporal variation in precipitation. It is also an important indicator for reflecting the relationship between the water and carbon cycles in a vegetation ecosystem., is paper uses data from MODIS Net Primary Production (NPP) and China's spatial interpolation data for precipitation from 2000 to 2015 to calculate the annual value, multiyear mean value, interannual standard deviation, and interannual linear trend of Chinese terrestrial vegetative PUE over the past 16 years. Based on seven major administrative regions, eleven vegetation types, and four climate zones, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of China's vegetative PUE. The research results are shown as follows: (1) China's vegetative PUE shows obvious spatial variation characteristics, and it is relatively stable interannually, with an overall slight increasing trend, especially in Northwest and Southwest China. The vegetative PUE is higher, and its stability is declined in Xinjiang, western Gansu, and the southern Tibetan valley. The vegetative PUE is lower, and its stability is increased in northeastern Tibet and southwestern Qinghai. An increasing trend in vegetative PUE is obvious at the edge of the Tarim Basin, in western Gansu, the southern Tibetan valley, and northwestern Yunnan. (2) There is a significant difference in the PUEs among different vegetation types. The average PUE of Broadleaf Forest is the highest, and the average PUE of Alpine Vegetation is the lowest. The stability of the PUE of Mixed Coniferous and Broadleaf Forest is declined, and the stability of the PUE of Alpine Vegetation is increased. The increasing speed of the PUE of Grass-forb Community is the fastest, and the decreasing speed of the PUE of Swamp is the fastest. (3) There is a significant difference in the PUEs among different vegetation types in the same climate zone, the difference in vegetative PUE in arid and semiarid regions is mainly affected by precipitation, and the difference in vegetative PUE in humid and semihumid regions is mainly affected by soil factors. The PUEs of the same vegetation type are significantly different among climate zones. The average PUE of Cultural Vegetation has the largest difference, the stability of the PUE of Steppe has the largest difference, and the increasing speed of the PUE of Swamp has the largest difference.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of citrus orchard dynamics using time-series Landsat data: a case study in southern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Citrus orchard planting is a typical land-use change process that can impact terrestrial ecosystem services both locally and globally. Longterm monitoring of citrus orchard dynamics is critical for understanding its change patterns as well as the potential driving factors. Satellite remote-sensing imagery has been a primary data source for this purpose. However, most previous studies with multi-year intervals only captured some, but not all detailed information on citrus orchard expansion. In this study, we developed a framework for mapping annual citrus orchard extent and track its long-term dynamics in Xunwu County, China, using the historical Landsat repository from 1990 to 2016. The results suggested that the average overall accuracy of original annual mapping was 87.73%, and its performance was significantly improved after the temporal filtering approach (91.46%). Several features (e.g. elevation, slope, normalized difference vegetation index) played more important roles in citrus orchard identification. With the achieved annual mapping layers, we found a rapid citrus orchard expansion trend during the study interval (i.e. from 22.18 to 697.21 km(2)). Moreover, this expansion process was unevenly distributed in time. Spatially, emerging citrus orchards were primarily transformed from forests and croplands and mainly distributed in areas with elevations from 200 to 500 m and slopes range from 5 degrees to 20 degrees. This study demonstrated the potential of mapping citrus orchard dynamics at a higher temporal frequency with remote-sensing time-series, which can contribute to providing reference for sustainable land-use policy.

AB  - Since the reform and opening-up, the society and economy of China has rapidly developing, and the living standard of person has been greatly improved. However, along with the rapid economic development, China is facing a series of environmental problems such as ecological destruction, environmental pollution and land degradation etc. It is essential to conduct an in-depth research on the existing environmental problems in China. According to the carrying capacity assessment of land and resources, using multi-source remote sensing data such as MODIS data, nighttime light data as well as the socio-economic statistics and meteorological data from 2002 to 2013, the evaluation model of the national ecological environmental quality is established based on the combination of multi-criteria decision making algorithms and principal component analysis. The assessment model of ecological environmental quality is verified by comparing the evaluation results of two different models: environmental performance index, ecological carrying capacity and eco-environmental quality index. All of results have shown a downward trend. Lastly, the better relationship between the ecological environmental quality and the ecological carrying capacity is established. The R-squared reaches 0.5023 and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.7087, which reveals the reliability and scientificity of the ecological environmental quality assessment model of China constructed in this study. The results show that the quality of ecological environment in China shows a downward trend in general. The area of the eco-environmental quality index between 0.6-0.8 performs a downward trend temporally, and then it decreased to the value between 0.4-0.6. The boundary between 0.4-0.6 and 0.6-0.8 spread southward.

AB  - This paper mainly investigated the performances between different display characterization methods, between different measurement instruments and between different testing datasets. It was found that a hybrid characterization method performed in the linear RGB space gave the highest accuracy while demanded less testing colors. Besides, no significant difference was found by using different measurement instruments on building models, indicating a limited instrumental accuracy is sufficient for characterization of a traditional LCD display. Moreover, a comprehensive dataset including 4096 test colors, i.e. 16 by 16 by 16 nodes was established. MCCC test chart was found to give a similar evaluation accuracy compared to it.

AB  - As one of the most essential economic and industrial crops globally, corn holds a very important position in China's agricultural industry. Corn mapping is one of the most concerned fields in agricultural surveillance. However, compared with the utilization of backscattering coefficients, the polarimetric information was not fully discussed in previous corn mapping researches. In this paper, we use the coherency matrix of mid to late term multi-temporal fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (FP SAR) data to discriminate corn cultivation areas. The tensor representation is adopted for PolSAR analysis, with the help of multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) to reduce feature dimensions. The importance of polarimetric information is discussed. This paper illustrates that good corn discrimination could be achieved with only mid to late term FP SAR data.

TI  - Comparison and assessment of NDVI time series for seasonal wetland classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based wetland mapping faces challenges due to the high spatial heterogeneity and dynamic characteristics of seasonal wetlands. Although normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (NTS) shows great potential in land cover mapping and crop classification, the effectiveness of various NTS with different spatial and temporal resolution has not been evaluated for seasonal wetland classification. To address this issue, we conducted comparisons of those NTS, including the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NTS with 500m resolution, NTS fused with MODIS and Landsat data (MOD_LC8-NTS), and HJ-1 NDVI compositions (HJ-1-NTS) with finer resolution, for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. Results showed the following: (1) the NTS with finer resolution was more effective in the classification of seasonal wetlands than that of the MODIS-NTS with 500-m resolution and (2) generally, the HJ-1-NTS performed better than that of the fused NTS, with an overall accuracy of 88.12% for HJ-1-NTS and 83.09% for the MOD_LC8-NTS. Future work should focus on the construction of satellite image time series oriented to highly dynamic characteristics of seasonal wetlands. This study will provide useful guidance for seasonal wetland classification, and benefit the improvements of spatiotemporal fusion models.

TI  - Annual dynamics of impervious surfaces at city level of Pearl River Delta metropolitan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have transformed natural land surface to artificial constructions, which causes the urban regions increasingly expanding. Urban development can be reflected by the dynamic changes of impervious surfaces, which can be assessed using time-series satellite data. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan has witnessed fast urban development over past decades. Even though many studied have focused on monitoring the urbanization of megacities, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about the long-term annual dynamics of urban impervious surfaces at city level in PRD. In this study, MOD09A1 (MODIS Surface Reflectance 8 Day L3 Global 500m) products were chosen to assess the annual dynamics of impervious surface at city level in PRD. Temporal filtering was utilized to improve the accuracy of the impervious surface estimation. Moreover, a new index, normalized difference urban development index (NDUDI) was proposed to investigate relative development of impervious surface in PRD. Additionally, the economy factor, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was introduced to reveal the correlation with the impervious surfaces. Results demonstrated that the overall accuracy for impervious surface extraction was about 91.00-94.00%. The impervious surfaces area in PRD dramatically increased from 6000km(2) to 115,840km(2) in the past 16years. Guangzhou and Foshan have the fastest developing speed, while Dongguan, Shenzhen and Foshan sacrificed much more lands to the construction of PRD than other cities. Besides, areas of impervious surface per city show very good correlations with GDP in city of Guangzhou, Huizhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Hong Kong and Zhuhai-Macau. The scatter plot between NDUDI and GDP data display different clustering pattern between different cities.

AB  - Red tide is an ecological anomaly that phytoplankton in seawater suddenly proliferate or aggregate under certain environmental conditions and within a period of time, resulting in seawater discoloration. Red tide not only harms marine fisheries and aquaculture, deteriorates the marine environment, affects coastal tourist industry, but also causes human health problems. East China Sea (ECS) is a region of high incidence of red tide disasters. Remote sensing has been proven an effective means of monitoring red tides. Phytoplankton-specific light absorption plays a fundamental role in the remote estimation of pigment biomass and red tide. This paper retrieves the phytoplankton absorption coefficient in decade based on MODIS data from July 2002 to June 2012 using quasi-analysis algorithm (QAA), analyzes and compares phytoplankton absorption coefficient spectral curves of red tide events with multiyear monthly averaged ones, as well as phytoplankton absorption coefficient spectral differences at the same location during red tide presence and absence. A new red tide monitoring algorithm based on the phytoplankton absorption coefficient is developed to extract red tide information of the ECS. With the application of the algorithm in the ECS, the results reveal that the developed model can effectively determine the location of red tides, with good correspondence to the results from an official bulletin. This demonstrates that the algorithm can effectively extract red tide information.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 23rd International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA).

AB  - Business location selection is of great importance in practice, but is a long and costly process. Traditional approaches to selecting optimal business locations consider complex factors such as foot traffic, neighborhood structure, space rent and available workforce, which are typically hard to acquire or measure. In this paper, we propose to exploit the highly available satellite data (e.g., satellite images and nighttime light data) as well as urban data for business location selection. We first perform an empirical analysis to evaluate the direct relationship between satellite features and business locations. We then propose a novel regression-and-ranking combined neural network model, to collectively predict the popularity and ranking for each location. Our model fuses the heterogeneous yet discriminative features from satellite and urban data and captures feature interactions effectively. We conduct experiments to compare our approach with various baselines. The results verify the effectiveness of the extracted satellite features and the superior performance of our model in terms of four metrics.

AB  - The wide use of network computing technologies has promoted the popularity of outsourced storage services. Meanwhile, the provable data possession (PDP) techniques are widely studied as the outsourcing storage servers are not always trustworthy and dependable in maintaining the outsourced data. However, most existing PDP solutions are either costly for the current Internet of things (IoT) devices, or vulnerable to spoofing attacks. In this paper, we propose a succinct anti-spoofing provable data possession scheme for lightweight clients in network computing. We employ the basic integrity comparison-based verification to fit for the resource-constrained verifiers, and propose a random sentinel metadata setup mechanism and the true-fake blended challenge scheme to improve the robustness against spoofing attacks of untrusted servers. The analyses reveal that our approach is effective in data possession verification with the robustness against spoofing attacks, while the overhead on the verifier side is low.

TI  - Updates on the clinical diagnosis and management of ocular sebaceous carcinoma: a brief review of the literature
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ocular sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is an exceedingly rare but aggressive malignancy that can impair patients' visual acuity or even cause tumor-specific mortality. This tumor usually mimics chronic benign eyelid lesions, thus leading to delayed diagnosis, thereby causing high recurrence and metastasis. Ophthalmologists should be more aware of SC in order to offer correct diagnosis and treatment at the onset of symptoms. Prompt surgical excision with frozen section margin control is the mainstay of SC management after patient evaluation and accurate biopsy. Mohs micrographic surgery has been associated with better tumor control outcomes than wide local excision. Radiation therapy should be considered as adjuvant treatment for locally advanced (stage T3a or higher) or high-risk (pagetoid spread) SC, nodal metastasis, or palliative care. Cryotherapy and topical chemotherapy are used for pagetoid spread. Targeted therapy has an emerging role in more complicated cases. For lymph node and distant metastasis, combination treatments should be provided, including lymph node and neck dissection, radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, and even orbital exenteration. The rarity of ocular SC precludes a comprehensive perspective on standard treatment. This paper offers a brief review of recent advances in the clinical diagnosis and management of ocular SC based on current scientific literature.

TI  - Exploring the temporal density of Landsat observations for cropland mapping: experiments from Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land-use/land-cover mapping based on remote-sensing images depends on clear and frequent observations. This study aimed to explore how many Landsat images were needed within a year and when they should be acquired, for cropland mapping in Africa. Three Landsat footprints in Egypt (Path/Row: 177/039, 127 images), Ethiopia (Path/Row: 168/054, 98 images), and South Africa (Path/Row: 170/078, 207 images) from 1984 to 2016 were used together with spectral indices and a 30-m digital elevation model in a random forest-based supervised classification. Detailed exploration was conducted into the number and temporal distribution of Landsat images required. Our results indicated that average cropland mapping accuracies for these three sites ranged from 81.17% to 87.59% (Egypt), 54.43% to 79.72% (Ethiopia), and 28.11% to 59.35% (South Africa) using different numbers of images within a year. The overall cropland accuracies were improved with an increase in available Landsat images within a year and reached a relatively stable stage when more than five images were acquired in all three sites. Growing season images played a key role in identifying cropland, accounting for a 13.22% average accuracy improvement compared with non-growing season images. Therefore, at least five images are recommended from a computational efficiency perspective, although fewer images, as low as two growing season images, can also achieve good results in specific regions.

AB  - This paper presents a new data fusion methodology named Fusion-FCN for the classification of multi-source remote sensing data using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Three different types of data including LiDAR data, hyperspectral images and very high resolution images are utilized in the proposed framework. Considering the confusions between similar categories (e.g., road and highway), we further implement post-classification processing with the topological relationship among different objects based on the result yielded by the proposed Fusion-FCN. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 80.78% and a kappa coefficient of 0.80, which ranked first in the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of the giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai and its relation to water masses and circulation in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea were investigated by ship observations, satellite sea surface temperature (SST), and particle tracking experiments. Temperature and salinity were examined by hierarchical clustering, and eight main water masses were identified. High abundances of giant jellyfish were observed in Southern Yellow Sea Water and in mixed waters, but few jellyfish were observed in other water masses. Variation in satellite SST was used to characterize the seasonal variation in the water masses. The results indicated that as the winter monsoon weakened, a water mass with SST (>15 degrees C) at the Jiangsu coast in May extended northeastward and eastward until July. Southerly wind was probably an important factor inducing this northeastward circulation. Moreover, transport of jellyfish was verified by backward, forward particle-tracking experiments based on the flow field from a numerical model and an independent ferry data. The water masses with jellyfish traced back to the Jiangsu coast in the month of May. Furthermore, water masses without jellyfish traced back to the mouth of the Changjiang River, and the Taiwan Strait. These results indicate that the high abundance of giant jellyfish observed in July came from the northern East China Sea or southern Yellow Sea coast in May when ephyrae were liberated from polyps there as SST increased from below 15 degrees C to higher values.

AB  - A classifier based on Bayesian theory and MRF is presented to classify the active microwave and passive optical remote sensing data, which have demonstrated their respective advantages in inversion of surface soil moisture content. In the method, the VV, VH polarization of ASAR and all the 7 TM bands are taken as the input of the classifier to get the class labels of each pixel of the images. And the model is validated for the necessities of integration of TM and ASAR, it shows that, the total precision of classification in this paper is 89.4%. Comparing with the classification with single TM, the accuracy increase 11.5%, illustrating that synthesis of active and passive optical remote sensing data is efficient and potential in classification.

AB  - Multi-source medium-to-high resolution remote sensing data differs in their spectral specifications and imaging process. To efficiently use the multi-source data and minimize the surface reflectance retrieval inconsistency from different sensors, it is a key step to apply the radiometric normalization before synthesizing these different datasets with similar spectral bands. Many traditional methods, such as pseudo invariant feature normalization (PIF), time invariant cluster (TIC), automatic scattergram-controlled regression (ASCR) and so on, usually determine the corresponding conversion coefficients of each similar band from different images mainly through the entire image statistics, without considering the different characterizations behaving in variety of the ground covers, so the conversion coefficients are the same for all pixels in a whole band. Unlikely, this paper compensated the differences of variety of ground covers, on the basis of the iteratively re-weighted multiple change detection transform (IR-MAD), proposed a pixel-by-pixel radiometric normalization method. According to matching model and transformation model between the multispectral image pixel spectral and the ground spectral library, the spectral response adjustment matching factor was used to complete the radiometric normalization of the image pairs As a case study, this method was applied to similar bands (visible-near infrared, VNIR) of Sentinel-2A (S2A) and Landsat-8 OLI (L8) data, acquired over quasi-simultaneously in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, on September 12, 2017. Compared with using traditional method IR-MAD alone, the method in this paper could effectively minimize the differences among the medium-to-high resolution surface reflectance images Before processing, the mean and standard deviation of reflectance image of the S2A in the VNIR bands was 0.0763 +/- 0.0518, 0.0891 +/- 0.0481, 0.0861 +/- 0.0609, 0.2955 +/- 0.0693. While the L8 was 0.0530 +/- 0.0361, 0.0752 +/- 0.0371, 0.0757 +/- 0.0482, 0.2711 +/- 0.0645, all lower than S2A. After the normalization, the corresponding statistical value of S2A normalized image dropped to the value which was 0.0556 +/- 0.0375, 0.0758 +/- 0.0370, 0.0741 +/- 0.0419, 0.2713 +/- 0.0610. But the result of only using IR-MAD was 0.0589 +/- 0.0390, 0.0774 +/- 0.0367, 0.0763 0.0463, 0.2719 +/- 0.0602. It indicates that the method proposed from us could achieve a more satisfactory normalization effect Next step in our research, we will further verify and improve this method for more images.

AB  - Monitoring the marine aquaculture plays an important role in the management of marine fisheries, and also provides a valid method to evaluate the expansion intensity of the mariculture. In this context, different periods (2003, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2016) of Landsat satellite data were collected and supervised classification method support vector machine (SVM) method was applied to extracted marine aquaculture in the Sansha Bay. Finally, different expansion indicators were used to evaluate the expansion intensity of mariculture in the study area. The results showed that: (1) the area of cage and algae culture increased rapidly, with the annual rates of expansion in 2.2x10(4) km(2) and 9.3x10(4) km(2) respectively from 2003 to 2016; (2) The total marine aquaculture reached 160x10(4) km(2) in 2016, more than 21.2% of the planned mariculture; (3) Cage culture expanded from the coast of mainland and island to the deep sea, but the algae culture expanded more obviously and almost covered the sea, and the expansion intensity of cage and algae culture varied greatly at different periods.

AB  - We investigated the association between cultural worldviews and gaming risk perceptions and intention in a sample of 364 tourists in Macao. Scales assessing individual's worldviews, gaming risk perceptions and intentions were collected at the famous casinos and land mark in Macao. Correlational and mediation analysis revealed that respondents with egalitarian worldviews perceived greater risk associated with the gambling risks than other worldview holders. In addition, respondents who scored high on individualism were less likely to perceive the gambling risks. They are in turn more likely to score highly on gambling intention scale. There was a significant association between hierarchism with gambling reason, gambling is the personal hobby, whereas fatalists are more likely gambling for emotional reason. Overall, our results suggest cultural worldviews may influence tourists' judgement on gambling. Individualists are not the major group in a Chinese population, who are more likely to overlap the customers in gaming industry.

TI  - A spectral mixture analysis approach to quantify Arctic first-year sea ice melt pond fraction using QuickBird and MODIS reflectance data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds play a significant role in the summer decay of sea ice due to the fact that their albedo is significantly lower than surrounding snow and sea ice surface. Despite its requirement for thermodynamic sea ice modeling, measurement of melt pond areal coverage using satellite remote sensing has proven difficult due to significant spatiotemporal variability in the timing and evolution of melt ponds. Less than optimal results from prior studies employing a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) towards the determination of melt pond areal coverage from satellite remote sensing data provided the incentive for a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach. The MESMA was performed on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using endmember spectra obtained from atmospherically corrected coincident high resolution imagery, surface observations and modeling. Results were validated against a high resolution Quickbird image acquired coincident to the MODIS image. The validation indicates that the best MESMA results provide consistent estimates of melt pond coverage for regions with high pond coverage (within 5% melt pond coverage) but overestimate pond fraction for regions with low pond coverage (by 10% or more). This may be due to deficiencies in the representation of sea ice surfaces within the endmember library used, oversimplified modeling of the ice surface and shortcomings in the validation process. However, it is assumed that with further refinement, the MESMA technique could allow for reliable estimates of the areal coverage of sea ice melt ponds using low resolution (large spatial coverage) optical satellite imagery under a wide variety of spatiotemporal pond evolution and fraction conditions.

TI  - Issues with Large Area Thematic Accuracy Assessment for Mapping Cropland Extent: A Tale of Three Continents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, consistent and timely cropland information over large areas is critical to solve food security issues. To predict and respond to food insecurity, global cropland products are readily available from coarse and medium spatial resolution earth observation data. However, while the use of satellite imagery has great potential to identify cropland areas and their specific types, the full potential of this imagery has yet to be realized due to variability of croplands in different regions. Despite recent calls for statistically robust and transparent accuracy assessment, more attention regarding the accuracy assessment of large area cropland maps is still needed. To conduct a valid assessment of cropland maps, different strategies, issues and constraints need to be addressed depending upon various conditions present in each continent. This study specifically focused on dealing with some specific issues encountered when assessing the cropland extent of North America (confined to the United States), Africa and Australia. The process of accuracy assessment was performed using a simple random sampling design employed within defined strata (i.e., Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ's) for the US and Africa and a buffer zone approach around the cropland areas of Australia. Continent-specific sample analysis was performed to ensure that an appropriate reference data set was used to generate a valid error matrix indicative of the actual cropland proportion. Each accuracy assessment was performed within the homogenous regions (i.e., strata) of different continents using different sources of reference data to produce rigorous and valid accuracy results. The results indicate that continent-specific modified assessments performed for the three selected continents demonstrate that the accuracy assessment can be easily accomplished for a large area such as the US that has extensive availability of reference data while more modifications were needed in the sampling design for other continents that had little to no reference data and other constraints. Each continent provided its own unique challenges and opportunities. Therefore, this paper describes a tale of these three continents providing recommendations to adapt accuracy assessment strategies and methodologies for validating global cropland extent maps.

TI  - Prioritisation of sub-watersheds based on earth observation data of agricultural dominated northern river basin of India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Tons River Basin of North India has been selected for prioritisation of sub-watersheds (SW) based on morphometric parameters with respect to groundwater derived from topographic sheets and CARTOSAT data. There are 10 SW have been delineated in the region, high stream frequency (F-s) values of SW (1-5) and SW-9 indicated the occurrence of steep slopes, less permeable rocks, greater runoff, less infiltration possibility. Further, these regions have been predicted as poor groundwater potentialities. SW-2 has been identified as poorest groundwater potential zone, whereas SW-4 and SW (6-8) regions possess good permeable bed rocks. The Drainage density (D-d) map demonstrated that the middle south-west region possesses higher D-d whereas northeastern regions contain lower D-d. Further, the areal parameters indicate elongated shape of the basin, hilly region has moderate to steeper ground slope. The outcomes of work have potential to manage groundwater and to ameliorate the flash flood and droughts.

AB  - A modified water cloud model (WCM) was used to estimate the biophysical parameters of wheat crop using Sentinel - 1A and Landsat - 8 satellite images. The approach of combining the potential of SAR and optical data provided a new technique for the estimation of biophysical parameters of wheat crop. The biophysical parameters estimation was done using non-linear least squares optimization technique by minimizing the cost function between the backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)) computed from the Sentinel-1A image and simulated by the modified WCM followed by look up table algorithm(LUT). The modified WCM integrates the full account of backscattering response on vegetation and bare soil by adding vegetation fraction. The modified WCM was found more sensitive than the original WCM because of incorporation of vegetation fraction (f(veg)) derived from the Landsat-8 satellite data. The estimated values of leaf area index (LAI) by modified WCM at VV polarization shows good correlation (R-2 = 83.08 % and RMSE = 0.502 m(2)/m(2)) with the observed values. Whereas, leaf water area index (LWAI) shows comparatively poor correspondence (R-2 = 76 % and RMSE = 0.560 m(2)/m(2)) with the observed data in comparison to LAI estimation at VV polarization. The performance indices show that the modified WCM was found more accurate for the estimation of wheat crop parameters during the whole growth season in Varanasi district, India. Thus, the modified WCM shows significant potential for the accurate estimation of LAI and LWAI of wheat crop on incorporating both SAR and optical satellite data.

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration From Satellite Using Easily Obtainable Variables: A Case Study Over the Southern Great Plains, USA
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the earth's water budget, a critical modulator of land-atmosphere interactions, and also plays a crucial role in managing the earth's energy balance. In this study, the feasibility of generating spatially continuous daily evaporative fraction (EF) and ET from minimal remotely sensed and meteorological inputs in a trapezoidal framework is demonstrated. A total of four variables, normalized difference vegetation index, land surface temperature (T-s), gridded daily average temperature (T-a), and elevation (z) are required to estimate EF. Then, ET can be estimated with the available soil heat flux (G) and net radiation (R-n) data. First, the crucial model variable T-s - T-a is examined how well it characterizes the variation in EF using in-situ data recorded at two eddy correlation flux towers in Southern Great Plains, USA in 2011. Next, the accuracy of satellite-based T-s is compared to ground-based T-s. Finally, EF and ET estimates are validated. The results reveal that the model performed satisfactorily in modeling EF and ET variation at winter wheat and deciduous forest during the high evaporative months. Even though the model works best with the observed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-T-s as opposed to temporally interpolated T-s, results obtained from interpolated T-s are able to close the gaps with reasonable accuracy. Due to the fact that T-s - T-a is not a good indicator of EF outside the growing season when deciduous forest is dormant, potential improvements to the model are proposed to improve accuracy in EF and ET estimates at the expense of adding more variables.

AB  - The Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) SAR acquisition mode achieves wide coverage area by employing subapertures. This way multiple subswaths can be acquired. It overcomes the problems of scalloping and azimuth-varying ambiguities inherent to the ScanSAR mode by introducing a steering of the beam in the along-track direction. The drawback is that, due to the burst operation mode, the azimuth resolution is strongly worsened with respect to the conventional StripMap mode. This reduces the performance on the retrieval of the ground displacement in the azimuth direction.In this contribution we provide an update on the last developments with our proposed 2-looks TOPS mode. This mode has been devised to mitigate the degraded sensitivity on the retrieval of ground deformation azimuth shifts of 1-look TOPS acquisitions. We will present the last improvements to the mode as well as updated results with time-series of experimental TerraSAR-X data.

AB  - In this contribution, we propose the use of 2-looks Synthetic Aperture Radar data to retrieve azimuth velocities of moving targets with a single platform. The established technique to retrieve velocities of moving targets is Along-track Interferometry (ATI), which provides a measurement of the velocity in the radar line of sight direction by employing two or more phase centers separated in the along-track direction. The use of 2-looks data allows to observe targets at two different instants of time, with a Doppler separation, enabling the retrieval of the target velocity in the azimuth direction. We introduce the 2-looks Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode, presenting the performance that can be achieved with the TerraSAR-X system. Moreover, we present experimental results with real data acquired with TerraSAR-X over coastal areas to retrieve velocities of vessels. A validation of the results with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data (ground truth) provides accuracies below 1 m/s.

AB  - A novel decision level data fusion algorithm for soil moisture content estimation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, individual estimations are determined, respectively, from the inversion of the Integral Equation Model (IEM) for Sentinel-1 and from the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) for LANDSAT-8. Then, a feature level fusion of these methods is performed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, all estimations including the feature level fusion estimation are fused at the decision level using a novel weights based estimation. The area of interest for this study is Blackwell Farms, Guildford, United Kingdom and datasets were taken on 17/11/2017 for both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1. Estimation from the proposed decision level fusion method produces a Root Mean Square Error RMSE (1.090%) which is lower than RMSE of the individual estimations of each sensor as well as that of the feature level fusion estimation.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the results and the methodology for a definition of land degradation indicators. The conducted work allowed us to specify the methods for obtaining quantitative estimates of land use as well as to estimate the land cover change for the territory of Ukraine over the period of time. An analysis of existing datasets for the territory of Ukraine was carried out to estimate the changes of the land cover. The sets of data over the territory of Ukraine were investigated for the creation of land cover maps as well as for methods of vegetation state assessment, in particular, for assessing land degradation and LDN (Land Degradation Neutrality) supported with the UN Convention to the Combat Desertification. As the national datasets for assessment of land cover changes dynamics, the land cover maps at the territory of Ukraine for 2000, 2010 and 2016 are considered. As the data sources, the maps developed at the Space Research Institute of Ukraine are used. These maps were created using the neural network classification of the time series of satellite data. For 2000 and 2010, the land cover maps have a spatial resolution of 30 m for the entire territory of Ukraine. They were created on the basis of the Landsat-4/5/7 satellite imagery within the framework of the SIGMA FP-7 project. The performed analysis showed that the overall accuracy of global land cover maps is lower as compare with the regional land cover maps by 10 % for 2000 and by 12 % for 2010. For 2016, the land cover map was created with the use of satellite data from the Sentinel constellation with a spatial resolution of 10 m. An analysis of land cover changes for 2000-2010 and 2000-2016 shows the following signs of land degradation (negative trends) at the territory of Ukraine: transitions of forest to the uncultivated land (non-cropland), transitions of forest to the cultivated land (cropland), transitions of forest to the bare land. The main problems of land degradation in Ukraine were identified, namely the places where significant land cover changes took place. The analysis of land cover change areas over the specified period of time was performed for each type of transition. We present also the results of a cross-comparison of forest areas obtained from the national land cover maps with statistics for three years (2000, 2010 and 2016).

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THE OXIDATIVE STATUS OF BLACK SEA MUSSELS (<i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> Lamark, 1819) FROM BULGARIAN COASTAL AREAS WITH INTRODUCTION OF SPECIFIC OXIDATIVE STRESS INDEX
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, the risk assessment of pollution and changes in marine ecosystems was based mainly on physicochemical analysis of environmental samples or contents of pollutants in sentinel marine organisms while the specific biological effects on the organisms themselves remained underestimated. More recently, a number of biomarkers and also multi-biomarker approaches were used to assess ecosystem health and identify impacts of environmental stress on organisms. The aim of the present study was to estimate the pro/antioxidant status in the gills, hepatopancreas and foot of specimens of M. galloprovincialis from different sites of the Bulgarian Black Sea coastal area by assessment of lipid peroxidation, glutathione levels and the activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as the glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. All tested tissues were susceptibile to oxidative stress (OS). The studied indicators varied among organs and sites. In order to estimate the overall effect of the marine environment on the studied mussels we constructed a Specific Oxidative Stress index (SOS) which is based on a new algorithum for interpreting the OS biomarkers. The proposed methodology can be successfully used to screen the state of the coastal marine environment using M. galloprovincialis as indicator.

TI  - Thermal Land Surface Emissivity for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature from Himawari-8
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) in the thermal infrared (TIR) is an essential parameter in the retrieving land surface temperature (LST) from space. This paper describes the LSE maps in three TIR bands (centered at 10.4, 11.2 and 12.4 mu m) used for retrieving the LST from Himawari-8. Himawari-8, a next-generation geostationary satellite has high spatial and temporal resolutions compared to previous geostationary satellites. Because of these improvements, the Himawari-8 LST product is expected to contribute to the observation of small-scale environments in high-frequency. In this study, the LSE is estimated by a semi-empirical method, which is a combination of the classification based method and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds method. The land cover classification information is taken from the Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations version3 (GLCNMO 2013). Material emissivities of soil, vegetation and others are taken from the MODIS UCSB emissivity library and the ASTER spectral library. This method basically follows the semi-empirical methods developed by the previous studies, but advanced considerations are added. These considerations are the phenology of vegetation, flooding of paddy fields, snow/ice coverage, and internal reflections (cavity effect) in urban areas. The average cavity effect on LSE in urban canopies is approximately 0.01, but it reaches 0.02 in built-up areas. The sensitivity analysis shows that the total LSE errors for the three bands are less than 0.02. The LSE estimation is especially stable at the vegetation area, where the error is less than 0.01.

TI  - An Algorithm for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Using Three Thermal Infrared Bands of Himawari-8
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a method for estimating the land surface temperature (LST) from Himawari-8 data. The Advanced Himawari Imager onboard Himawari-8 has three thermal infrared bands in the spectral range of 10-12.5 mu m. We developed a nonlinear three-band algorithm (NTB) that makes the best use of these bands to estimate the LST. The formula of the algorithm includes 10 coefficients. The optimum values of these coefficients were derived using a statistical regression method from the simulated data, as obtained by a radiative transfer model. The simulated data sets correspond to a variety of values of LST, as well as surface emissivity, type and season of temperature and water vapor profiles. Viewing zenith angles (VZAs) from 0 degrees to 60 degrees were considered. For the coefficients obtained in this way, we verified the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in terms of the VZA, LST and precipitable water dependence. We showed that the NTB can accurately estimate the LST with an RMSE less than 0.9 K compared with the nonlinear split-window algorithm developed by Sobrino and Romaguera (2004). Moreover, we evaluated the sensitivities of the LST algorithms to the uncertainties in input data by using the dataset independent of the dataset used to obtain coefficients. Consequently, we showed that the NTB has the highest robustness against the uncertainties in input data. Finally, the stepwise LST retrieval method was constructed. This method includes a simple cloud mask procedure and the land surface emissivity estimation. The LST product was evaluated using in-situ data over the Tibetan Plateau, and the validity was confirmed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability Characteristics of Clear-Sky Land Surface Temperature in Urban Areas of Japan Observed by Himawari-8
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides the first attempt to investigate the spatial variability of diurnal change patterns of land surface temperature (LST) in urban areas of Japan by applying principal component analysis on LST data retrieved from Himawari-8 geostationary satellite data. The Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan areas were the focus of the analysis, and the target days were days with zero cloud cover in summer and winter. The results of the analysis showed that diurnal cycles of LST are mainly formed by two temporal change patterns in both seasons. For the summer case, the first two principal components (PCs) represented the temporal change patterns related to the amplitude and phase, respectively. For the winter case, the first two PCs represented the temporal change patterns related to the amplitude and gradual change in LST throughout the day, respectively. Results suggest that these temporal change patterns in both seasons have spatial variability partially dictated by land use and wind speed/direction.

AB  - It is becoming common to apply location information for actual problems such as automatic routing, creating tour, and the prediction of user activity. In many of these cases, they use a geodata that is based on a user's self check-in. In this study, to focus on a user's daily behavior deeply, we use a large volume of geospatial data, which is detected regularly and automatically from a cell phone's GPS system and the volume of data is totally different from the self check-in based. We can comprehend users activity in more detail than self check-in based data. The main purpose of this research is to extract and interpret user preferences from big geospatial data. Because the auto-detected data is big and spatial, it is necessary to process and analyze it for transformation to a value. Firstly, we extract the spots where people visited and stayed from raw geodata. Next, we categorize spots using the spot information to reduce the dimension. Finally, we interpret user preferences by applying a topic model to the matrix of users and the categorized spot. Our results show that we can interpret user preferences as topics from big geospatial data using dimension reduction and a topic model. In addition, we verify a performance of methods that use the topics to predict purchase. We found that the models that use topics outperforms others on the real prediction problem.

TI  - Improving the Efficiency of Remote Sensing Data Interpretation by Analyzing Neighborhood Descriptors
T2  - MORDOVIA UNIVERSITY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. In evaluating the space-time structure of the Earth's surface, the data of remote sensing of the Earth become more important. Increasing the effectiveness of space survey analysis tools is possible through studying the problem of obtaining an integrated space-time characterization of the state of lands. The purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of the automated analysis of remote sensing data by taking into account the invariant and dynamic descriptors of the vicinity.Materials and Methods. In order to improve the accuracy of the remote sensing data classification, a computation of complex space-time characteristics of the state of the lands was conducted based on the system analysis of data characterizing the dynamic and invariant states of the territory surrounding the geophysical site. The formalization of this process includes methods for calculating a set of numerical descriptors of the neighborhood: local entropy, local range, standard deviation, color moment, histogram of hues, and color cortege. A technique for calculating a complex descriptor based on the Fisher vector is described. To approbate the solution, a plan for the experiment was drawn up and a sample of the initial data was sampled.Results. The approbation of the methodology and the algorithm developed on its basis, implemented as a set of programs, on the test polygon system showed a variation in the classification accuracy in the range of 81-89% (without regard to the neighborhood), and taking into account the neighborhood, it increases to 91-97%. It is revealed that a significant increase in the radius of the analyzed neighborhood leads to a decrease in the classification accuracy.Conclusions. The application of the developed set of programs allows for the rapid implementation of modeling of spatial systems for the purpose of thematic mapping of land use and analyzing the development of emergency situations. The developed methodology for analyzing lands with regard to the descriptors of the neighborhood makes it possible to improve the accuracy of classification.

AB  - Power transmission towers are the main infrastructure of power grid. It is important to monitor the safety state of transmission towers. Using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image to monitor the transmission line is not limited by cloud, rain and snow and sunlight conditions. So it has been widely studied to detect transmission tower in a SAR image. However, most of the works consider the transmission tower as point target and few studies have focused on the extraction of fine structure of the tower. This paper proposes a SAR image target extraction algorithm based on NSCT domain feature extraction and fuzzy clustering. First, the characteristics of transmission tower in SAR image in NSCT domain is analyzed. Then, the proposed method extracts the statistical characteristics of each scale and each direction in NSCT domain as features. Fuzzy C means algorithm is applied to unsupervised features clustering and the final target extraction result is obtained. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is illuminated by the experiment using the TerraSAR-X images. Experiments show that the contour of the tower structure can be clearly identified in the extraction results.

AB  - Accurate simulation of microwave scattering characteristics of wheat canopy is crucial for understanding the microwave scattering mechanism of wheat canopy and quantitative retrieval of biophysical parameters of wheat crop from radar remote sensing data. In this study, a wheat canopy scattering model (WCSM) was developed on a basis of 1st-order microwave radiative transfer equation. Multiple temporal C-band quad-polarized (Radarsat-2 and GaoFen-3) and dual-polarization (Sentinel-1) SAR data were utilized to validate the performance of the WCSM. Results showed that WCSM simulated C-band backscattering coefficients of wheat canopy is with a RMSE of < 1.8 dB for Radarsat-2 and GaoFen-3 SAR data and Sentinel-1 data at incident angle of 43.15 degrees. Larger simulation error (>3.0 dB) mainly distributed in a few of wheat fields in which the row is perpendicular and parallel to the radar beam. Besides, the large deviations (RMSE of >3.4 dB) for simulated Sentinel-1 data with incident angle of 32.12 degrees could be partly attributed to the rough resolution and radiometric errors, which is needed to be further investigated. This study demonstrated the proposed WCSM is effective in characterizing the C-band scattering features of wheat at various growth stages. By integrating with a robust inversion algorithm, it would become a useful tool in quantitative retrieval of wheat canopy parameters, and further for grain yield estimation at local or regional scales.

AB  - Xinmo landslide event, China occurred on 24 June 2017. The head of the landslide area was similar to 3,600m above the mean sea level. Then, along the high to low elevation direction, a stable zone (S1) above the head area, an unstable zone (that is divided into an upper unstable subsidence area, UU; and a lower unstable uplift area, LU), and a stable area (S2) before the landslide event were identified. The time-series surface deformation was studied using the SBAS-InSAR technique and Sentinel-1 multi-temporal datasets acquired between November of 2015 and June of 2017. The mean deformation value was -8.3mm in S1, -26.9mm in UU, 27.9mm in LU, and 1.6mm in S2, respectively. Zoning characteristics of moving earth materials in a typical landslide event were observed. After removing the deformation values in two stable zones, the difference in absolute value of the subsidence and uplift in the unstable zone was about 80mm, 100mm, and 130mm on 24 February 2017, 19 May 2017, and 24 June 2017, respectively. No landslide event occurred in February and May. Thus, with the preliminary findings, a warning might be issued once the absolute value was greater than 100mm.

TI  - Discordant correlation of breast adenoid cystic carcinoma on imaging and pathology: A case report and literature review on surgical management
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of the breast are extremely rare tumours, accounting for <0.1% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. Little data exist regarding the correlation of radiological findings with histology of this rare subtype. To our knowledge, gross size discrepancy between the 2 modalities has not been reported. We describe a case of ACC with appreciable size discordance between imaging and pathology report.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 71 years old lady presented with a painless right breast lump of a few months duration. Clinical examination revealed a 1.5 cm right breast upper outer quadrant mass. Axillary and systemic examinations were unremarkable.Mammogram showed an asymmetric density in the right upper outer quadrant which corresponded to a suspicious nodule measuring about 2 cm on the ultrasound. Ultrasound of the axilla showed an indeterminate right lymph node. Core needle biopsy of the right breast nodule showed ACC while the lymph node biopsy was non-metastatic. Staging scans did not reveal any definite distant metastasis. Her naso-endoscopy and MRI of the neck were normal.She underwent a right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Final histology returned as a grade II 55 mm ACC. Lympho-vascular invasion was absent. The tumour was triple negative for Estrogen receptor (ER), Progesterone receptor (PR) and Human epidermal receptor 2 (HER 2). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for metastasis.She recovered well but declined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She is currently well 6 months post operation.DISCUSSION: ACC is an extremely rare subtype, therefore there are limited reports in literature on its imaging and pathological characteristics. Of this sparse data, there was no mention that there might be a big size discrepancy between the 2 modalities.This appreciable discrepancy has implications for pre-operative planning and the choice of breast surgery. It will be useful if the pathological extent of ACC could be determined more accurately radiologically.However, there are no distinctive imaging characteristics for ACC. ACC can appear as a smooth round mass similar to that of a benign mass or as an irregular mass on mammogram. On ultrasound, ACC often manifested as a hypo-echoic heterogeneous mass with minimal vascularity on Doppler imaging and may have an indistinct margin. MRI has a higher sensitivity than mammogram and ultrasound in determining the true extent of the tumour, but there remains little data on its usefulness in ACC.CONCLUSION: ACC can be extensively infiltrative and present much larger than its radiological size, as reported in our case. Use of better imaging modalities judiciously, in these cases, are needed to more accurately predict the true pathological size of ACC to prevent inadequate surgery. 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Relative Geometric Refinement of Patch Images Without Use of Ground Control Points for the Geostationary Optical Satellite GaoFen4
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Patch imaging is an important capability of GaoFen4, which is the first Chinese high-resolution planar array satellite in geosynchronous orbit. When the satellite collects images in the patch-imaging mode, overlapping images can be successively obtained. As these images are captured at different times and from a very high orbit, the initial geometric accuracy of the overlapping area between images is inconsistent, which directly affects image mosaicking. In this paper, a novel bundle block adjustment method based on the rational function model without ground control points (GCPs) is proposed to eliminate the relative geometric error among the images and to generate refined rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). In this method, the average elevation is used instead of the true elevation of the ground points to solve the problem of weak convergence of corresponding bundles, which would result in unstable calculation in the height direction. Virtual control points (VCPs) generated from the original RPCs are used to restrain the freedom of the entire block in the horizontal direction, thereby ensuring stable calculation without the use of GCPs. A successive RPC regeneration method based on VCPs is also presented. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, four experiments were performed using real data to assess the geometric accuracy of the method, and the satisfactory experimental results indicate that the presented method is both practical and effective.

TI  - PET-MR and SPECT-MR multimodality probes: Development and challenges
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance (MR) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MR hybrid imaging is being used in daily clinical practice. Due to its advantages over stand-alone PET, SPECT or MR imaging, in many areas such as oncology, the demand for hybrid imaging techniques is increasing dramatically. The use of multimodal imaging probes or biomarkers in a single molecule or particle to characterize the imaging subjects such as disease tissues certainly provides us with more accurate diagnosis and promotes therapeutic accuracy. A limited number of multimodal imaging probes are being used in preclinical and potential clinical investigations. The further development of multimodal PET-MR and SPECT-MR imaging probes includes several key elements: novel synthetic strategies, high sensitivity for accurate quantification and high anatomic resolution, favourable pharmacokinetic profile and target-specific binding of a new probe. This review thoroughly summarizes all recently available and noteworthy PET-MR and SPECT-MR multimodal imaging probes including small molecule bimodal probes, nano-sized bimodal probes, small molecular trimodal probes and nano-sized trimodal probes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive overview of all PET-MR and SPECT-MR multimodal probes. Since the development of multimodal PET-MR and SPECT-MR imaging probes is an emerging research field, a selection of 139 papers were recognized following the literature review. The challenges for designing multimodal probes have also been addressed in order to offer some future research directions for this novel interdisciplinary research field.

AB  - Remote sensing classification is an important way to obtain land cover information, and the selection of classification training samples for most of the classification method is an expensive and time-consuming task. However, the traditional training samples selection method is a direct selection based on two-dimensional (2D) images, therefore, training sample selection efficiency is always low in the regions with complex terrain and landscape fragmentation, and the ROI (region of interest) separability is unsatisfactory for classification. This study aims at the low efficiency and low ROI separability for traditional training sample selection method put forward a new training sample selection method using a three-dimensional (3D) terrain model that was created by OLI image fusion digital elevation model (DEM) to select ROIs, which departs from the traditional method based on a two-dimensional image. A Landsat-8 OLI image of the Yunlong Reservoir Basin in Kunming was used to test this proposed method. Study results showed that the proposed method obtained ROI separability that was greater than 1.9, and with most reaching 2.0; while the ROI separability of traditional method still had unqualified situation, which showed the new method was more effective.

AB  - PM2.5 pollution is an environmental issue results from various natural and socioeconomic factors, frequently witnessed in the spring and winter across mainland China. However, the dominant influence of natural and socioeconomic factors within a city on PM2.5 is not extensively studied yet. In this study, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) is utilized to quantify the relationships between PM2.5 and potential factors within Wuhan city on a typical day turn from winter to spring. Technically, the 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration in downtown area on February 17th 2017 are collected at 9 sites. In the meantime, we retrieve simultaneous aerosol depth optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The ground measured PM2.5 and AOD are coupled for the retrieval of near-surface PM2.5 concentration by Spatial-temporal CoKriging (STCK) with Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Building Index (NDBI) from Landsat-8 and DEM from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). As the geospatial big data booms, the Internet-collected volunteered geographic information (VGI), representing the urban form and function, are integrating for the regression to obtain the spatial variables importance measures (VIMs) by RFR both in centre and sub-urban region of Wuhan. The results reveal that terrain characteristics and the density of industrial enterprises have obvious relationships with the accumulation of PM2.5 while the density of roads also contributes to this.

TI  - New constraints on slip rates of the Fodongmiao-Hongyazi fault in the Northern Qilian Shan, NE Tibet, from the <SUP>10</SUP>Be exposure dating of offset terraces
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fodongmo-Hongyazi fault (FHF) is a major thrust of Northeastern Tibet, bounding the Qilian Shan. It accommodates crustal shortening across this region and has produced a strong historical earthquake. Until now the slip rate has been poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of its role in the accommodation of deformation across this region. In this paper, faulted terraces at two sites on the western and middle segments of the FHF were mapped with satellite imagery and field observations. Chronological constraints are placed on the ages of displaced river terraces at these sites using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating. These ages combined with offsets measured from SPOT 6 DEM's yield average vertical slip rates of 1.3 +/- 0.1 mm/yr for the western segment since similar to 207 ka and 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm/yr since similar to 46 ka for the middle segment. These data suggest that the FHF accommodates similar to 15-20% of the total shortening across the Qilian Shan (5.5-7 nun/yr). In addition, comparisons of our data with published slip rates along the Northern Qilian Thrust Fault Zone show that the fastest tectonic uplift occurs along the western portion of the Northern Qilian Shan. This is consistent with estimates deduced from geomorphology. The western portion of the Qilian Shan is mainly controlled by compressional deformation produced by the northward movement of the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, while the eastern Qilian Shan is mainly controlled by the eastward extrusion of material along the left -lateral Haiyuan strike -slip Fault.

AB  - With the development of GPU's general computing power, hybrid systems composed of multi-core CPU and GPU are becoming more and more popular in data parallel applications. Because the performance of GPU is related to the magnitude of the load received, effective load allocation methods are very important for improving the performance of data parallel applications. The existing static load distribution methods fail to use the characteristics effectively - GPU performance changed with the load, causing the load unbalanced. Dynamic load distribution methods easily reduce the performance of the system due to the excessive synchronization and data transmission operation. In this paper, we propose a new workload partitioning algorithm, which takes advantage of the characteristics of GPU performance varying with the workload in off-line analysis stage, and uses the successive decreasing method to determine the optimal load allocation ratio between multi-core CPU and GPU. The effectiveness of the load allocation algorithm is verified on the remote sensing data set based on the median filtering algorithm.

AB  - Geostationary Ocean Color Imager-II (GOCI-II), the follow-up satellite sensor platform of GOCI, will be launched in Mar. 2019. For estimating ocean color information from this new sensor data, the dedicated ocean color algorithms will be newly developed. However, the existing ocean color algorithm development methodology without consideration for the high-speed data processing will not be employed because the amount of GOCI-II data will be significantly large and their data will have to be processed and distributed in real time. In this study, therefore, we designed the ocean color algorithm development environment (OCADE) to support high-performance computing and storage using the parallelism. Also, OCADE enables the source code projects for GOCI-II ocean color products to be automatically built and deployed. We expect that GOCI-II ocean color algorithm developers will easily create and manage their parallelized source code projects at any time and any place through the OCADE cloud service. Additionally, they will be able to validate the output and evaluate the processing performance under OCADE in real-time. We believe that OCADE will contribute to the field of massive satellite data processing.

TI  - Tracking Performance Assessment of Tiered Code Effect on GNSS Signal in the Presence of CWI
T2  - CHINA SATELLITE NAVIGATION CONFERENCE (CSNC) 2018 PROCEEDINGS, VOL III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th China Satellite Navigation Conference (CSNC) - Location, Time of Augmentation
CL  - Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In the signal structure design of new global navigation satellite system (GNSS), the ideas of secondary/tiered code was introduced. However, due to the inherent vulnerability of satellite navigation signal, frequency interference (RFI) has become a potential threat. The continuous wave interference (CWI) has become one of the most serious interference types for the characteristics of power concentration, multiple types and wide distribution of the interference source. The impact assessment of CWI on the performance of navigation signals has become a hot spot of research. However, the existing assessment method lacks the quantitative evaluation for the effect of the secondary code on signal performance in the presence of CWI. To solve the above problems, the impact of tiered codes with different length on signal power spectrum was analyzed firstly, and then influence of tiered codes on tracking performance by discrete spectrum carrier-to-noise ratio was analyzed. The experimental results show that the traditional analysis model based on continuous spectrum is no longer suitable for navigation signal performance analysis under the condition of CWI; the smaller the line distance is, the two times the code period is doubled and the line spacing is 0.1 times that of the original; and when coherent integration time doubles and the tracking performance deteriorates 2-3 dB; and when length of tiered code increase, the tracking performance can improve 2-3 dB; and short coherent integration time and long tiered code should be used in receiver design. A compromise needs to be made between these two parameters to ensure the tracking performance under CWI and the robustness of receivers. The proposed method can provide effective theoretical guidance for the development of the new GNSS signal receiver.

TI  - A novel ground-based experimental observation method for determining multiband microwave radiative properties of forest litter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The layer of litter covering the forest floor attenuates microwave radiation coming from soil. In satellite remote-sensing data, this reduces the sensitivity of brightness temperature to land surface parameters (e.g. soil moisture, snow depth, and snow water equivalent), resulting in poorer inversion accuracy. To quantify the effects of microwave radiative properties of litter at different frequencies, and especially the impact on transmissivity, a novel approach was developed for modelling radiative transfer (RT) through litter. This approach is based on a zero-order RT model that accounts for scattering effects (the tau-omega model, tau is the optical thickness;. is the single scattering albedo). Controlled ground-based experiments were conducted to obtain brightness temperatures at several frequencies (1.4, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz) as affected by the thickness and weight moisture content of the litter. The effects of measurement errors on transmissivity were then evaluated. This novel method, which is not only based on sound theory but also prevents calibration errors, can be used to obtain parameters such as the extinction coefficient and transmissivity. The results of this study provide new insights into the microwave RT theory of forest systems, allowing for more appropriate brightness temperatures corrections for satellites data, and providing a guide for controlled experiments.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Remote Sensing Technology, Techniques and Applications VII
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - In view of the confusing problem of urban river network water and building shadows in hyperspectral images, we analyzed typical shadow and water spectrum in AISA hyperspectral image. On the basis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the 588 nm height factor was introduced to constitute an anti-shadow water extraction method (ASWEM). Compared with NDVI extraction results, this method can effectively suppress shadows, especially those cast in buildings, improve water extraction accuracy and reduce water body commission error. The commission error is reduced from 45% to 10.4%, and Kappa coefficient is increased from 0.664 to 0.863. The change of spatial scale has a significant impact on the water extraction results. The lower the image resolution, the more serious the water leakage is, and some small rivers will not be able to extract. However, due to the influence of the mixed pixels, the spectral characteristics of the shadows are weakened to some extent, and the commission error is reduced. As the resolution decreases further, the number and mixing of mixed pixels increases, and the commission error increases.

TI  - Near-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Chlorite Minerals
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mineral chemistry of twenty chlorite samples from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) spectral library and two other regions, having a wide range of Fe and Mg contents and relatively constant Al and Si contents, was studied via infrared (IR) spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. Five absorption features of the twenty samples near 4525, 4440, 4361, 4270, and 4182 cm(-1) were observed, and two diagnostic features at 4440 and 4280 cm-1 were recognized. Assignments of the two diagnostic features were made for two combination bands ((nu + delta)((AlAl)O-OH) and (nu + delta)((SiAl)O-OH)) by regression with IR fundamental absorptions. Furthermore, the determinant factors of the NIR band position were found by comparing the band positions with relative components. The results showed that Fe/(Fe + Mg) values are negatively correlated with the two NIR combination bands. The findings provide an interpretation of the NIR band formation and demonstrate a simple way to use NIR spectroscopy to discriminate between chlorites with different components. More importantly, spectroscopic detection of mineral chemical variations in chlorites provides geologists with a tool with which to collect information on hydrothermal alteration zones from hyperspectral-resolution remote sensing data.

T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Tianshan Mountain is one of the most important gold ore forming zones in northwestern China and central Asia. The Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1), the first Chinese high resolution satellite, is characterized by its 2-m resolution PAN data. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), the well-known earth observation satellite, is advanced by its finer spectral resolution owing 9 bands in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) to the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. In this study, we fused the GF-1 PAN and the ASTER multispectral data using the well-known Gram-Schmidt Pan Sharpening (G-S) method to produce a new data with both high spatial and spectral resolution. Then different lithological units were mapped respectively using the fusion data, the ASTER data and the WorldView-3 data by support vector machine (SVM) method. In order to assess this fusion data, a comparison work was executed among the three mapping results. The comparison work indicated that lithological classification using the new fusion data is an efficient, robust and low cost method, and it could replace the WV-3 data in some large sale geological work.

TI  - Modeling grassland above-ground biomass based on artificial neural network and remote sensing in the Three-River Headwaters Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective and accurate monitoring of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for pastoral agriculture planning and management. In this study, we combined 1433 AGB field measurements and remotely sensed data with the goal of establishing a suitable model for estimating grassland AGB in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of China, which is one of the most sensitive regions to the warming climate. A back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) was used to select the variables that contribute the most to the model's estimation of AGB, and then we built the model. Out of 13 variables, 5 variables were selected to build the BP ANN model, and we used cross validation for the accuracy assessment. The results show that: (1) the modeled mean AGB (2001-2016) provides a reasonable spatial distribution that is similar to the field measurements but reveals more details and has better spatial coverage than the limited field measurements are able to provide; (2) the overall trend of AGB in the TRHR is increasing more than decreasing (44.4% vs 29.2%, respectively) and has a stable area of 26.4%; and (3) the BP ANN model achieves better results than do the traditional multi-factor regression models (R-2 : 0.75-0.85 vs 0.40-0.64, RMSE: 355-462 vs 537-689 kg DW/ha). This study presents an effective and operational BP ANN model that estimates grassland AGB for the study area with high accuracy at 500 m spatial resolution, providing a scientific basis for the determination of reasonable stocking capacity and possible future development.

TI  - Soil Drought and Vegetation Response during 2001-2015 in North China Based on GLDAS and MODIS Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural disaster caused by long-term water deficit. Because the growth of crops and vegetation is closely related to soil moisture environment, it is of great significance to study the soil drought and vegetation response. In this paper, the soil moisture availability index (SMAI) was developed for quantifying soil drought conditions. The effectiveness and the ability of SMAI to recognize drought events were analyzed, while the vegetation condition index (VCI) was used to characterize the vegetation status. Temporal and spatial variations of soil drought and vegetation condition as well as the impacts of drought on vegetation in North China during 2001-2015 were comprehensively examined. We firstly concluded that SMAI related well with standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and drought events can be detected by SMAI. Next, the mean value of SMAI in North China showed a decreasing trend in recent 15 years. Finally, the SMAI positively correlated with VCI in most areas of North China, and the response of four types of vegetation to SMAI differed over time. The results of SMAI on vegetation would assist drought research and application in North China.

T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate and accuracy of Tc-99m-labeled sodium phytate and stannous chloride (Tc-99m-PHY) injection versus Tc-99m-labeled sulfur colloid (Tc-99m-SC) injection in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early stage breast cancer.Methods: A total of 146 consecutive female patients with early stage breast cancer were recruited in this open-labeled, randomized, controlled study. SLNB was conducted on all patients, and Tc-99m-PHY or Tc-99m-SC was used as the radioactive agent (RA). Axillary lymph node dissections were performed in all patients post SLN dissections.Results: The detection rate of Tc-99m-PHY group was higher compared with that of Tc-99m-SC group (p=0.023), but no difference in the detection rate by dye alone (p=0.190) or by RAs alone (p=0.615) was found between the two groups, and the number of identified SLNs (p=0.100), number of identified SLNs by dye alone (p=0.161), and number of identified SLNs by RA alone (p=0.242) were similar between the two groups. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, falsenegative rate, false-positive rate, and accuracy rate of SLNB showed no difference between Tc-99m-PHY and Tc-99m-SC groups (sensitivity: p=0.645; specificity: p=0.511; false-negative rate: p=0.645; false-positive rate: p=0.511; accuracy rate: p=0.464).Conclusion: Our study revealed that Tc-99m-PHY was qualified to be a convincing radiopharmaceutical in SLNB.

TI  - Modeling three-dimensional forest structures to drive canopy radiative transfer simulations of bidirectional reflectance factor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3-D) Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer (MCRT) models are usually used for benchmarking in intercomparisons of the canopy radiative transfer (RT) simulations. However, the 3-D MCRT models are rarely applied to develop remote sensing algorithms to estimate essential climate variables of forests, due mainly to the difficulties in obtaining realistic stand structures for different forest biomes over regional to global scales. Fortunately, some of important tree structure parameters such as canopy height and tree density distribution have been available globally. This enables to run the intermediate complexities of the 3-D MCRT models. We consequently developed a statistical approach to generate forest structures with intermediate complexities depending on the inputs of canopy height and tree density. It aims at facilitating applications of the 3-D MCRT models to develop remote sensing retrieval algorithms. The proposed approach was evaluated using field measurements of two boreal forest stands at Estonia and USA, respectively. Results demonstrated that the simulations of bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) based on the measured forest structures agreed well with the BRF based on the generated structures from the proposed approach with the root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (rRMSE) ranging from 0.002 to 0.006 and from 0.7% to 19.8%, respectively. Comparison of the computed BRF with corresponding MODIS reflectance data yielded RMSE and rRMSE lower than 0.03 and 20%, respectively. Although the results from the current study are limited in two boreal forest stands, our approach has the potential to generate stand structures for different forest biomes.

TI  - A Novel Location-Awareness Method Using CubeSats for Locating the Spot Beam Emitters of Geostationary Communications Satellites
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - As more spacecraft are launched into the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) belt, the possibility of fatal collisions or unnecessary interference between spacecraft increases. In this paper, a new location-awareness method that uses CubeSats is proposed to assist with radiofrequency (RF) domain verification by means of awareness and identification of the positions of the spot beam emitters of communications satellites in geostationary orbit. By flying a CubeSat (or a constellation of CubeSats) through the coverage area of a spot beam, the spot beam emitter's position is identified and the spot beam's pattern knowledge is characterized. The geometry, the equations of motion of the spacecraft, the measurement process, and the filtering equations in a location system are addressed with respect to the location methods investigated in this study. A realistic scenario in which a CubeSat receives signals from GEO communications satellites is simulated using the Systems Tool Kit (STK). The results of the simulation and the analysis presented in this study provide a thorough verification of the performance of the location-awareness method.

TI  - VIIRS-based high resolution spectral vegetation indices for quantitative assessment of vegetation health: second version
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two approaches could be utilized to derive the vegetation health indices from recently launched Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor with the goal to maintain the consistency with the long-term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) vegetation health products. One approach is to convert VIIRS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)/brightness temperature (BT) to AVHRR, as the first version. The other is to derive long-term pixel-based VIIRS climatology without converting at NDVI/BT level. The second version of products, derived from the new VIIRS pseudo long-term climatology as presented in this article, can trace the signature of the long-term AVHRR vegetation health products quite well, in terms of histogram, correlation coefficients, time series, and so on. The extended products with higher resolutions also perform as expected, indicating that the constructed long-term high-resolution climatology is reasonable. The third version of the products, based on VIIRS real long-term climatology, still needs many years to develop.

AB  - The growth in the remote sensing data available has led to information overload, as seeking out the precise data has become more and more challenging. In this paper, a similarity evaluation modal is proposed to assist the user in his/her quest for accurate data. In the modal, correlation degree and correlation functions combining topology are proposed to evaluate the similarity degree between user's requirement and data quantitatively. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of different schemes can be compared.

TI  - Near real-time monitoring of post-fire erosion after storm events: a case study in Warrumbungle National Park, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in national parks can lead to severe damage to property and infrastructure, and adverse impacts on the environment. This is especially pronounced if wildfires are followed by intense storms, such as the fire in Warrumbungle National Park in New South Wales, Australia, in early 2013. The aims of this study were to develop and validate a methodology to predict erosion risk at near real-time after storm events, and to provide timely information for monitoring of the extent, magnitude and impact of hillslope erosion to assist park management. We integrated weather radar-based estimates of rainfall erosivity with the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and remote sensing to predict soil loss from individual storm events after the fire. Other RUSLE factors were estimated from high resolution digital elevation models (LS factor), satellite data (C factor) and recent digital soil maps (K factor). The accuracy was assessed against field measurements at twelve soil plots across the Park and regular field survey during the 5-year period after the fire (2013-17). Automated scripts in a geographical information system have been developed to process large quantity spatial data and produce time-series erosion risk maps which show spatial and temporal changes in hillslope erosion and groundcover across the Park at near real time.

AB  - The stripe noise is a key factor that affects imaging quality of satellite multi-hyperspectral remote sensing images, which also has a serious effect on the interpretation and information extraction of remote sensing images. Complex surface textures mixed with strip noises in the high-resolution multi-spectral remote sensing of satellite are extremely difficult to remove, this paper analyzes the Markov random field prior model method, combines the Huber function to propose a universal, fast and effective Huber Markov destriping method. According to the statistical characteristics of the image gray level variation, the distribution features and mutual relationship between each pixel and its neighborhood pixels in the image, the co-occurrence matrix reflecting the contrast gray characteristics of the image is connected with the threshold T of Huber function, which is automatically iteratively determined during the noise removal process, and will be able to remove image noises as well as preserving its edges and details effectively. In order to solve the time complexity of the algorithm caused by the pixel space information introduced by the Huber Markov random field algorithm, the GPU adaptive partitioning technique is adopted to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results show that the destriping method based on Huber function Markov random field can remove the strip noise effectively, while preserving texture details of the image, which can be applied to a variety of noise-containing images. Meanwhile, GPU-based adaptive partitioning technology has been adopted, which has greatly improved the computational efficiency of processsing massive remote sensing images, and lays a foundation for the application of remote sensing satellite images in China.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - In this paper, we proposed a temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) from the thermal infrared data of Chinese GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite's Multiple Spectral-Imager (MSI) payload. In order to improve the accuracy of the TES algorithm, a water vapor scaling (WVS) method for atmospheric correction was adopted. The Seebor V5.0 global atmospheric profile database and MODTRAN 5 were used to simulate the WVS coefficients. A total of 11 ASTER scenes were used to simulate the MSI images and concurrent ground measurements acquired in the HiWATER experiment were used to validate the algorithm. The results showed that the bias and root mean square error (RMSE) in the retrieved LST were 0.47 K and 1.70 K, respectively, and the absolute emissivity differences between MSI and the ground measurements were smaller than 0.01 for the four MSI TIR bands, which demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can be used to retrieve high accurate and high spatial resolution LST&E from GF-5 MSI data.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Adaptively Weighted Joint Detail Injection
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion based on the detail injection scheme consists of two steps: spatial details extraction and injection. The quality of the extracted spatial details plays an important role in the success of a detail injection scheme. In this paper, a remote sensing image fusion method based on adaptively weighted joint detail injection is presented. In the proposed method, the spatial details are first extracted from the multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images through a trous wavelet transform and multiscale guided filter. Different from the traditional detail injection scheme, the extracted details are then sparsely represented to produce the primary joint details by dictionary learning from the subimages themselves. To obtain the refined joint details information, we subsequently design an adaptive weight factor considering the correlation and difference between the previous joint details and PAN image details. Finally, the refined joint details are injected into the MS image using modulation coefficient to achieve the fused image. The proposed method has been tested on QuickBird, IKONOS, and WorldView-2 datasets and compared to several state-of-the-art fusion methods in both subjective and objective evaluations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective and robust to images from various satellites sensors.

TI  - Evaluation of Electronic Healthcare Databases for Post-Marketing Drug Safety Surveillance and Pharmacoepidemiology in China
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Electronic healthcare databases (EHDs) are used increasingly for post-marketing drug safety surveillance and pharmacoepidemiology in Europe and North America. However, few studies have examined the potential of these data sources in China.Methods Three major types of EHDs in China (i.e., a regional community-based database, a national claims database, and an electronic medical records [EMR] database) were selected for evaluation. Forty core variables were derived based on the US Mini-Sentinel (MS) Common Data Model (CDM) as well as the data features in China that would be desirable to support drug safety surveillance. An email survey of these core variables and eight general questions as well as follow-up inquiries on additional variables was conducted. These 40 core variables across the three EHDs and all variables in each EHD along with those in the US MS CDM and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM were compared for availability and labeled based on specific standards.Results All of the EHDs' custodians confirmed their willingness to share their databases with academic institutions after appropriate approval was obtained. The regional community-based database contained 1.19 million people in 2015 with 85% of core variables. Resampled annually nationwide, the national claims database included 5.4 million people in 2014 with 55% of core variables, and the EMR database included 3 million inpatients from 60 hospitals in 2015 with 80% of core variables. Compared with MS CDM or OMOP CDM, the proportion of variables across the three EHDs available or able to be transformed/derived from the original sources are 24-83% or 45-73%, respectively.Conclusions These EHDs provide potential value to post-marketing drug safety surveillance and pharmacoepidemiology in China. Future research is warranted to assess the quality and completeness of these EHDs or additional data sources in China.

TI  - Can Satellite Precipitation Products Estimate Probable Maximum Precipitation: A Comparative Investigation with Gauge Data in the Dadu River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) is an essential prerequisite in designing dams, spillways, and reservoirs in order to minimize the risk of overtopping infrastructure collapse, especially under today's changing climate. This study investigates conventional PMP estimation approach by using both scarce in-situ observations and mainstream satellite precipitation products in the Dadu River basin, where plenty of reservoirs and dams are being built. The satellite data include Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing algorithm (CMORPH), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and Tropic Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7. The evaluation of satellite products shows that CMORPH and 3B42V7 agree well with gauge-based dataset for the period of 1998-2013 at both the grid and basin scales, also capturing the extreme precipitation events, with high Correlation Coefficients (CC) in terms of 0.68 and 0.71, respectively. Also, CMORPH and 3B42V7 show better performance for the magnitude and spatial distribution of 24-h PMP in such complex terrains. PERSIANN-CDR shows an overestimation in the upstream and an underestimation in the downstream. As among the first studies of satellite precipitation-based PMP estimation, this work sheds lights on the suitability of satellite precipitation in PMP estimation and could provide a reference for future extended spatially-distributed PMP estimation in vast ungauged regions.

AB  - Soil moisture of Zoige wetland, China from 2007 to 2009 was estimated using PALSAR radiometrically terrain-corrected (RTC) and Landsat-5 surface reflectance data coupled with water cloud model (WCM) radar backscattering model. Soil moisture derived from L-HH polarization RTC data was suitable for assessing the soil moisture in Zoige wetland. In 2007, the soil moisture in the growing season had similar spatiotemporal patterns and trends, and the intra-annual difference of soil moisture was very small. However, the inter-annual soil moisture increased from 2007 to 2009 substantially. Variations of temperature and precipitation were attributed to the causes.

T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the capability of indirect computed tomography and magnetic resonance lymphography (CT/MR-LG) with gadolinium-loaded, polyethylenimine-entrapped gold nanoprobes (Gd-Au PENPs) for assessing lingual sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in a tongue VX2 carcinoma model.Materials and methods: Seventeen rabbits were used to establish a metastatic cervical lymph node model by implanting VX2 carcinoma suspension into the ventral tongue muscle. CT and MR images were acquired one hour after Gd-Au PENPs injection into the tongue submucosa bilaterally, on 1w (n = 4), 2w (n = 6) and 3w (n = 7) tumour-bearing rabbits after carcinoma transplantation. Then, the filling defects and enhancement features of the lingual SLN on indirect CT/MR-LG were assessed.Results: The enhanced lingual SLNs were observed bilaterally in all rabbits using indirect CT/MR-LG. In total, 15 enhanced SLNs displayed oval or round shape with uniform density and no filling defects or only local small filling defects, and all nodes were metastasis-negative, while 0, 19 enhanced SLNs demonstrated irregular morphologies with filling defects, non-uniform densities and unclear borders, of which 14 nodes were metastatic. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value when using SLN enhancement with irregular morphology, filling defects, non-uniform density and unclear border as diagnostic criteria for metastasis were 100%, 75.0%, 85.3%, 73.7% and 100 %, respectively.Conclusions: Indirect CT/MR-LG with Gd-Au PENPs can be used for the metastatic diagnosis of lingual SLN in tongue cancer.

TI  - A denoising method for inter-annual NDVI time series derived from Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inter-annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from Landsat (INSL) has been applied to many fields. However, INSL may contain noise from many factors. At present, most researchers focus on denoising for NDVI time series derived from other datasets with shorter time intervals. In this paper, we proposed a denoising method for INSL by combining the best index slope extraction algorithm (BISE) with wavelet transform (WT). This method consists of two steps: (a) INSL are processed by BISE under a limiting condition to remove the significant noise; and (b) INSL obtained by step (a) are filtered by WT. Commonly used methods, including Savitzky-Golay filter (S-G) and BISE, were used as references to evaluate the proposed method. Using qualitative and quantitative comparisons and a change detection analysis, the proposed method was demonstrated to be reliable.

TI  - A method of identifying mining disturbance in arid or semi-arid steppe using inter-annual Landsat images-a case study in north-eastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining disturbances affect the environmental quality, local ecology and human populations. Thus, a lot of public attention has been paid on mining issues and the need for the detection of mining disturbance. Research on mining disturbance identification is mainly for forested regions where other disturbances account for a very small areal proportion. It is more challenging to identify mining disturbance of arid or semi-arid steppe due to its vulnerable ecology and existence of other disturbances. In this letter, we proposed a method to identify mining disturbance for arid or semi-arid steppe using inter-annual Landsat images. The method utilizes both spectral characteristics and topology information. We applied the method to Bal Rishi Le mining area located in north-eastern China. By accuracy assessment, the method was proven to be reliable with 92.2% overall accuracy.

Such an approach takes advantage of the spatial resolution of the infrared instrument and the sensing accuracy of themicrowave instrument. We test our method using a precipitation scene captured with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) microwave instrument and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared instrument and compare the results to simultaneous radar observations. We show that the data fusion product is better than the original AMSU-B and AVHRR observations across all statistical indicators.

TI  - An agent-based model to simulate the cultivation pattern change of farmer households in the North China Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is the primary wheat and maize production area in China. The NCP is currently experiencing rapid urbanization, and the cultivation pattern of farmer households is changing drastically, which could influence food security in this region. In this study, we developed an agent-based model to simulate the decision-making process of farmer households and analyze the influence of this process on food security based on a regional case study conducted in Luancheng County. The model was developed based on sampling survey data, remote-sensing data, and demographic data. The results predicted a decrease in the percentage of the area of Grain Maize cultivation from 94.85% in 2015 to 89.71% in 2020 and an increase in the percentage of Lawn cultivation area from 3.61% to 9.26% over the same period due to changes in the decision-making of farmer households. These changes will have a negative effect on food security, and appropriate policies should be developed to control the over-expansion of lawn cultivation.

TI  - Evans Blue Dye: A Revisit of Its Applications in Biomedicine
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Evans blue (EB) dye has owned a long history as a biological dye and diagnostic agent since its first staining application by Herbert McLean Evans in 1914. Due to its high water solubility and slow excretion, as well as its tight binding to serum albumin, EB has been widely used in biomedicine, including its use in estimating blood volume and vascular permeability, detecting lymph nodes, and localizing the tumor lesions. Recently, a series of EB derivatives have been labeled with PET isotopes and can be used as theranostics with a broad potential due to their improved half-life in the blood and reduced release. Some of EB derivatives have even been used in translational applications in clinics. In addition, a novel necrosis-avid feature of EB has recently been reported in some preclinical animal studies. Given all these interesting and important advances in EB study, a comprehensive revisiting of EB has been made in its biomedical applications in the review.

AB  - Semantic segmentation or classification for satellite image time series (SITS) is a rarely touched topic, partly due to the difficulty in having the data, but more due to the unreachable task. In this research, we propose a dataset which consists of the Landsat image time series, with the purpose of performing multi-spectral semantic segmentation. As there is no ground truth information, we used unsupervised clustering to group time series into clusters, then Long short term memory (LSTM) unit based Recurrent neural networks (RNN) has been trained. We investigate the accuracy values for our test image patches, around 40% accuracy has been achieved for the sequence classification.

AB  - The validation research is the basis of application of remote sensing data. This study using soil surface measured data for 10 cm in Northeast China in 1992-2013 to verify the European space agency soil moisture data set (ESA CCI SM). In this study, two methods evaluating CCI data for revealing drought was used: common Pearson coefficient method and drought judgement method for coincidence degree of drought. This verification study is located in the main grain producing areas of Northeast China, which is dominated by rain-fed agriculture. After the result analysis, CCI remote sensing soil moisture is feasible for assessment research on agricultural drought. Through the evaluation of this study, this remote sensing soil water can be used as an effective indicator of agricultural drought in the main grain-producing region of Northeast China.

TI  - A new continuous fusion method of remote sensing data

CP  - 4th International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)

AB  - Remote sensing soil moisture is one of the important indexes for monitoring agricultural drought in large scale farmland area. The time series length and update speed of remote sensing data have been the important factors restricting their application. Because of the difference between the sensor and the inversion method, remote sensing data from different sources cannot be directly compared and analysed. Therefore, data fusion becomes a hotspot of research interest and key issue in the application of remote sensing data nowadays. Based on cumulative distribution matching principle, Lagrange interpolation can establish this correlation between any quantile on different cumulative probability distribution curves. Based on the above, a continuous fusion algorithm of multi-source remote sensing soil moisture is built in this study. Using this new fusion method, SMOS and CCI data are fused to real-time remote sensing soil moisture data product with long time series. The verification application result in Songnen plain indicates that this Lagrange interpolation continuous fusion method can improve the fusion accuracy of multi-source remote sensing soil moisture significantly. The low-value region of the cumulative probability distribution curve is the key data segment to characterize agricultural drought. According to this continuous fusion method, fused SMOS and CCI are almost completely coincident at each quantile in the low-value region of the curve. This remote sensing fusion data combining the advantages of CCI and SMOS provides reliable data support for the next study of agricultural drought evaluation.

AB  - As an indispensable part of remote sensing image preprocessing, geometric correction has a great influence on the application of remote sensing images. Traditional geometric correction requires lots of well-distributed ground control points(GCPs). However, GCPs are difficult to obtain GCPs in some places such as mountain and desert areas. For this reason, we propose a Multi-Observation Block Adjustment( MOBA) method to get accurate geo-position without control points. The method improves the geometric positioning accuracy by the error compensation parameters of the remote sensing images, which caculated from block adjustment error equations. Different from tranditional method, error equations are built depending on multi-projection in image space of a single object. In this way, error equation can converge to more accurate solution. Experiments of ZY-3 with wide baseline and GF-2 with narrow baseline show that the proposed method can significantly improve geometric positioning accuracy of both kinds of remote sensing images.

AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is the important information for the crop land irrigation management and drought warning. The study of SMC quantitative inversion based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology has become the hot spot. Because of using statistical modeling methods and without considering soil bidirectional reflection characteristics, the SMC inversion accuracy and model applicable scope were limited. The purpose of this study was to use the soil radiation transfer model (SOILSPECT) to invert SMC in order to not only improve the SMC hyperspectral inversion accuracy, but also make the model applying widely. Taking the black soil and chernozem in Gongzhuling city of Jilin province as the study object, this paper conducted multi-angle spectrometry measurement for different SMC from 5% to 45% (5% interval) to get measured soil reflectance by using the ASD Fieldspec Pro spectrometer under the indoor condition. The influences of the light source zenith angle, observing zenith angle, azimuth angle and SMC on soil bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were analyzed. Then SOILSPECT model parameters were obtained by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method under the different SMC gradients, and SMC inversion by using SOILSPECT model was conducted. The results showed that soil BRDF declined with SMC rising in the range of 400 similar to 1400 nm wavelength, when SMC was less than the field water holding capacity, and soil BRDF rose with SMC rising when SMC was larger than the field water holding capacity. In the range of 1400 similar to 2400nm wavelength and under different observing zenith angles, there was no rules for soil BRDF changing. SMC inversion accuracy based on SOILSPECT model was higher. R-2 value was above 0.98 compared the estimated values with the measured values. The inversion accuracy for 15% and 30% of SMC were higher at every sensitive band, but that for other SMC was unsteadiness. SMC inversion accuracy based on SOILSPECT model increased with the decreasing of the observational zenith angle. The vertical observation can get the highest SMC inversion accuracy.

TI  - The value of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT imaging in breast cancer staging
T2  - BOSNIAN JOURNAL OF BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend assessment with positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET/CT) in staging of breast cancer, starting from the stage IIIA. Previously, PET/CT contributed to the accurate staging from the stage IIB. Our aim is to evaluate the contribution of F-18-FDG PET/CT in staging of breast cancer patients. A total of 234 patients were retrospectively evaluated. PET/CT was performed preoperatively in 114/234 and postoperatively in 120/234 patients. Initial staging was performed based on histopathological results in 125/234 and clinical results in 109/234 patients, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification. All patients had a normal abdominal ultrasound and chest x-ray. Following PET/CT imaging, modification in the staging was performed in patients with the metastatic findings. In 42/234 (17.9%) patients hypermetabolic extra-axillary regional lymph nodes and in 65/234 patients (27.7%) distant metastatic involvement were detected with PET/CT. Modification in the staging was applied in 82/234 (35%) patients. Patient management was changed in 69/234 (29.4%) cases. The percentage of patients with upstaging, according to each stage, was as follows: IIA: 18.6%, IIB: 30%, IIIA: 46.3%, IIIB: 68.8%, and IIIC: 20.8%. In 43/43 patients, Tc-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan did not show additional bone metastasis. In 5/32 patients, metastatic involvement was detected with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), but preoperative PET/CT scan did not reveal hypermetabolic lymph nodes. Although our study was limited by the referral bias and lack of homogeneity in the referral group, PET/CT still significantly contributed to the accurate staging and management of our breast cancer patients, starting from the stage IIA.

TI  - Unsupervised Change Detection using Thin Cloud-Contaminated Landsat Images

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)
CL  - Funchal, PORTUGAL
AB  - In this paper, a novel unsupervised change detection method is proposed to automatically detect changes between two cloud-contaminated Landsat images. To achieve this, firstly, a photometric invariants technique with Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) are applied to input images to decrease the influence of cloud and noise artifacts in the change detection process. Then, mean shift image filtering is employed on the sub-band difference images, generated via image differencing technique, to smooth the images. Next, multiple binary change detection masks are obtained by partitioning the pixels in each of the smoothed sub-band difference images into two clusters using Fuzzy c-means (FCM). Finally, the binary masks are fused using Markov Random Field (MRF) to generate the final solution. Experiments on both semi-simulated and real data sets show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed change detection method in noisy and cloud-contaminated Landsat images.

TI  - Making Closed-Off Worlds and Solutions Explicit During Research: A Methodological Concern
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FOR BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES (ECRM 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies (ECRM)

AB  - As a norm of today's scientific society, which have been a little criticised, researchers usually do not report unsuccessful works or tested research pathways and worldviews that did not work. But what about worldviews and solutions that are gradually being closed-off in minds of researchers to reach a prospective promising solution or worldview to a problem? The present paper tries to shed light on this based on two recent research projects. Although the issue is related to the field of knowledge management and tacit form of knowledge, and to the new Mode of knowledge production as theorized by Gibbons, it is practically studied here as a research methodological or research design concern. Based on the Urmia lake restoration research project and the research project for designing a participatory learning ecosystem in Golbaf town of Iran, it was found that there are serious worldviews and solutions being closed-off during the research, only through which the researchers were able to reach prospective final solutions. In line with scientific norms, these closed-off worldviews (approaches) and solutions were not documented, communicated or disseminated. The research group retrospectively found that this was a reason for serious problems in fragmentation of ethnography results and solutions provided, in miscommunication with stakeholders, in misunderstanding of the problem by stakeholders other than researchers, and in transferring the implicit knowledge to next researchers and projects. The evidences imply that a scientific work should include both approved and closed-off worldviews and solutions, since both are advantageous the same and that it would also prevent biases and leads to better management of tacit knowledge. Thus, it is suggested to have documentation and communication of closed-off worlds incorporated into research designs. Currently, our researchers are going to add weekly/ monthly informal documentation of closed-off worldviews and solutions into their knowledge management agenda. This is going to be utilized by our interventionist researchers to gain a deeper second order of knowledge of the research process and mindset change, in regular discussions, in communications with stakeholders and in dissemination of results.

TI  - Mango Grove Relevant Information Extraction Using GF-2 Satellite Data

CP  - 7th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)

AB  - The foundation of information extraction based on remote sensing imaging involves spectral band information. Such a method often suffers from the distinctive problem of surface features. In general, artificial orchard planting is relatively regular; thus, it shows textural features that differ from other vegetation types in images with a specific spatial scale. This study used mango groves as research object. By introducing spectral index, texture feature parameters, and by using support vector machine classification method, based on GF-2 satellite images, mango grove information extraction was studied under different combinations of spectra band, vegetation index, and texture feature parameters. The findings show that the information extraction via single spectra band information has lower accuracy. Introduction of a combination of spectra index and spectra band information can improve extraction accuracy of mango groves; however, the overall classification accuracy still remains low. In addition, the introduction of texture information and spectra band information combination can dramatically improve extraction accuracy. Producer's accuracy and user's accuracy increased to 85.7% and 93.5%, respectively. Under different combination modes, the extracted mango grove accuracy of the combination of integrated spectra band information, textural feature, and vegetation index is optimal. Producer's accuracy and user's accuracy increased to 89.3% and 97.4%, respectively. Relative to the spectra band information, the extraction accuracy improved by 20.6% and 11.0%, respectively. As a result, the support vector machine of integrated spectra and texture can effectively extract the spatial distribution information of mango groves. This method can provide a technical reference for remote sensing extraction of artificial orchards.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of the Economic Efficiency of Construction Land in the Pearl River Delta Megalopolis from 1998 to 2012
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1980s, the rapid, extensive, and dispersed urban expansion in the Pearl River Delta megalopolis (PRDM) has led to landscape fragmentation and the inefficient use of construction land. Like other developed regions in China that are subject to the dual challenges of shortages of construction land and deterioration of the ecological environment, it is becoming increasingly important in the PRDM to improve the land-use efficiency of urban construction. However, current methods for assessing land-use efficiency do not meet the emerging needs of land-use planning and policymaking. Therefore, using the American Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) nighttime light imagery and Landsat TM data, this study aims to develop a timely and efficient approach to model the high-resolution economic efficiency of construction land (EECL). With this approach, we mapped the reliable EECL of the PRDM at township level and with a one-kilometer grid. Next, the study compared the temporal changes and revealed the spatial-temporal dynamics in order to provide a scientific reference for informed land-use planning and policymaking. The results show that since 1998, the economic efficiency of construction land in the PRDM increased in general but varied significantly throughout the area. Further, these disparities widened from 1998 to 2012 between the PRDM's inner and peripheral circles. Only one-fifth of the towns and subdistricts were categorized as fast-growth or ultrafast-growth, with the majority located in the most developed areas of the PRDM's inner circle. In order to improve the efficiency of construction land in the PRDM and realize sustainable development, differentiated land-use policies for the inner and peripheral circles were proposed. The inner circle should focus on promoting the efficiency of existing construction land and encourage urban renewal, while the peripheral circle should enhance the control of new construction land and improve its efficiency.

AB  - We present the first continental-scale methodology for estimating Live Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) and flammability in Australia using satellite observations. The methodology includes a physically-based retrieval model to estimate FMC from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) reflectance data using radiative transfer model inversion. The algorithm was evaluated using 363 observations at 33 locations around Australia with mean accuracy for the studied land cover classes (grassland, shrubland, and forest) close to those obtained elsewhere (r(2)=0.57, RMSE=40%) but without site-specific calibration. Logistic regression models were developed to predict a flammability index, trained on fire events mapped in the MODIS burned area product and four predictor variables calculated from the FMC estimates. The selected predictor variables were actual FMC corresponding to the 8-day and 16-day period before burning; the same but expressed as an anomaly from the long-term mean for that date; and the FMC change between the two successive 8-day periods before burning. Separate logistic regression models were developed for grassland, shrubland and forest, obtaining performance metrics of 0.70, 0.78 and 0.71, respectively, indicating reasonable skill in fire risk prediction.

TI  - MODERN REGIONAL MEDIA DISCOURSE FEATURES (ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA PRINTED PRESS)
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The mass media regional discourse is a part of mass media national space, simultaneously it has certain features that reflect regional specifics. These features are systematically displayed by mass media agenda, by the ways of information presentation, interpretation of socially significant events, the priority themes and genres, organization of the dialog with audience, media texts compositional and stylistic design. Newspapers as one of the important for the region printed mass media types concentrate regional mass media discourse attributes. The given research attempts to reconcile the theory of regionality with the real factors and facts of the Crimea media history in its dynamic characteristics displayed in the regional newspapers. It should be noted that integrated analysis of the Crimea regional media discourse in the newspaper segment presents the region's informational worldview in 2013-2015, the period of Crimea sovereignty changing and the peninsula comprisal to the Russian Federation. Regional newspapers are diverse information media, they are obtainable and convenient first of all for the accustomed reader. These characteristics afford ground for regarding the newspaper as a region's informational space core. The newspaper sheet corporality is perceived positively by many people (mainly by the older generation). A regional newspaper has an undeniable advantage - it realizes in its content principle of closeness to the reader living in the particular region. The Republic of Crimea press thematic preferences analysis (eight Crimea-wide and municipal periodicals publications have been analyzed) enables one to designate the following regional 2013-2015 agenda priorities: Crimean deputies and officials work; the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Crimea relations; Crimea legal status; language issue; Crimean economics problems and achievements; ecology; culture; tourism, - which form the public opinion, influence standards of events perception by society.

TI  - Prevalence and Consequences of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in the Era of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite clear guidelines for its use and wide adoption, no population-based study has examined the extent to which patients with early stage breast cancer are benefiting from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by being spared a potentially avoidable axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and its associated morbidity.Objective: Examine variation in type of axillary surgery performed by surgeon volume; investigate the extent and consequences of potentially avoidable ALND. ResearchDesign/Subjects: Observational study of older women with pathologically node-negative stage I-II invasive breast cancer who underwent surgery in a SEER state in 2008-2009.Measures: Surgeon annual volume of breast cancer cases and type of axillary surgery were determined by Medicare claims. An estimated probability of excess lymphedema due to ALND was calculated.Results: Among 7686 pathologically node-negative women, 49% underwent ALND (either initially or after SLNB) and 25% were operated on by low-volume surgeons. Even after adjusting for demographic and tumor characteristics, women treated by higher volume surgeons were less likely to undergo ALND [medium volume: odds ratio, 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.82); high volume: odds ratio, 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.76)]. Potentially avoidable ALND cases were estimated to represent 21% of all expected lymphedema cases.Conclusions: In this pathologically node-negative population-based breast cancer cohort, only half underwent solely SLNB. Patients treated by low-volume surgeons were more likely to undergo ALND. Resources and guidelines on the appropriate training and competency of surgeons to assure the optimal performance of SLNB should be considered to decrease rates of potentially avoidable ALND and lymphedema.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the characteristics and significance of 『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』 by comparing with 『Yuhap(類合)』. What I discovered as a feature of 『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』is as follows. First, in formal aspects,『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』 learned to study according to the level of the learner by dividing the numbers and presenting items. And『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』 made it easy to learn using a rhyming word. Second, in terms of selecting Chinese characters, 『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』 removed Chinese characters from the Buddhist scriptures and eliminated the words that were not used in the mid 16C Joseon Dynasty. And 『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』s elected the words in real life and redeployed them into consideration. As a result, in『Sinjeung-Yuhap(新增類合)』, I was able to discern the significance of the Joseon Dynasty in the middle of the 16th century in terms of presenting a Neo-Confucianism worldview.

AB  - In this study, 81 Landsat-8 scenes acquired from 2013 to 2015 were used to estimate the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Orinoco River at its main hydrological station at Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela. This gauging station monitors an upstream area corresponding to 89% of the total catchment area where the mean discharge is of 33,000 m(3).s (1). SSC spatial and temporal variabilities were analyzed in relation to the hydrological cycle and to local geomorphological characteristics of the river mainstream. Three types of atmospheric correction models were evaluated to correct the Landsat-8 images: DOS, FLAASH, and L8SR. Surface reflectance was compared with monthly water sampling to calibrate a SSC retrieval model using a bootstrapping resampling. A regression model based on surface reflectance at the Near-Infrared wavelengths showed the best performance: R-2 = 0.92 (N = 27) for the whole range of SSC (18 to 203 mg.l (1)) measured at this station during the studied period. The method offers a simple new approach to estimate the SSC along the lower Orinoco River and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of remote sensing images to map the spatiotemporal variability in sediment transport over large rivers.

TI  - Comparison of vegetation regeneration after wildfire between Mediterranean and tundra ecosystems by using Landsat images
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a major natural hazard with tremendous implications for the Earth's ecosystems. Investigating fire regimes and fire-vegetation dynamics using remote-sensing techniques is becoming increasingly common because of their large-scale coverage and data availability. However, there is still scarce study to compare vegetation regeneration between different ecosystems after wildfires due to lack of data. This study used time series of Landsat images to explore and compare post-fire vegetation recovery in a Mediterranean (Witch Creek Fire) and tundra (Anaktuvuk River Fire) ecosystem. After 8 years of disturbance, the vegetation in the Mediterranean ecosystem had still not yet recovered, whereas the tundra ecosystem recovered in just 3 years. Higher degree burning leads to quicker vegetation recovery rate. However, ecological retrogression was also detected. Spatial heterogeneity in post-fire vegetation recovery observed in both sites can be attributed to topographic factors, soil water availability and the thermokarst process.

AB  - This study explores the antecedents of proactive innovation which is required to sustain firm’s longitudinal performance and survival. The proactive innovation means the innovation strategy targeting the new markets-entry, and it has high uncertainty and difficulties in actions.This study suggests the bi-dimensional effects of inter-firm networks on the success of proactive innovation. Prior researches have argued the positive effects of inter-firm networks on the firm’s performance and innovations, because it can provide the diverse and valuable resources and capabilities to the challenge of specialized firms. But researches alos argue the conservative effects of inter-firm networks because it suggests the channels of information exchange to avoid the relative risks.This study discriminates the two types of inter-firm networks as the collaborate networks having formal cooperating structure and information networks exchanging information through the social relations. Using these conceptual disjunction, this study suggests the positive effects of collaborate networks on the performance of proactive innovation because of its resource mobilizing capacity from multiple participants. Also, this study suggests the negative effect of industry-dedicated information networks on the performance of proactive innovation because it accelerates the mimetic and conservative activities. The empirical test using the survey data of 1,078 firms shows the significant effects of all suggested independent variables of this study.

AB  - Near land surface atmospheric water vapor content is an import factor for land-atmosphere exchange, evapotranspiration and environment assessment. Currently it is lack of effective method for estimation of near land surface atmospheric water vapor content with a high spatial resolution and a large coverage area. This paper has proposed methods combining MODIS, NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and DEM data for estimation of the near surface water vapor content. The proposed methods take advantage of NCEP/NCAR stratified pressure level data, MODIS high spatial resolution data, and DEM terrain analysis data for the estimation of near surface water vapor content. The methods are effectiveness and viable for water vapor estimation in high spatial resolution and large coverage area. An example is given for the illustration of the methods.

AB  - Satellite images are commonly used for defining thermal urban environment and heat islands in urban areas. The objective of this study was to analyze and evaluate thermal environment of Uzundere-Erzurum using satellite images provided by the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on board Landsat 5 satellite. In respect to land use and urban surface features, spatial characterization of thermal urban environment was defined. In order to define the link between surface emissivity, land surface temperatures (LST), and urban surface characteristics more effectively, the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database for Uzundere was also used. Based on the Landsat satellite images, different land cover categories are defined, and the alterations of heat islands are identified according to these categories. The minimum and maximum surface temperatures were obtained from open spaces, non-vegetated bare rocky areas (- 1.8 and 29.1 degrees C, respectively). The surface temperature in the water areas was much better (7.5 and 21.9 degrees C) and followed by green areas surface temperature (- 0.9 and 28 degrees C). Surface temperatures should be considered energy-focused planning.

AB  - Land cover classification and change detection plays an important role and significance in geographical conditions and environmental monitoring, which is a hot and difficult remote sensing topic. The difficulties in land cover remote sensing are how to realize the detecting by a quantitative and automatic way. At present, there is no general classification algorithm which is proper for different multi-remote sensing data's quantitative processing. In this paper, a multi-source remote sensing image classification method based on spectral reflectance characteristics is studied. Using the geometric and radiometric calibration parameters, sensor spectral response function and satellite-earth-sun's orbit parameters, multi remote sensing data's ground reflectance and land cover monitoring classification could be realized automatically. In earthquake evaluation, two GF2 multi-spectral remote sensing images are processed. The typical land cover elements, including vegetation, water and bare land, are detected and classified. The evaluation of land cover change proportion is calculated quantitatively and automatically.

AB  - Land surface reflectance is the fundamental variable for the most of earth observation (EO) missions, and corrections of the atmospheric disturbs from the cloud, gaseous, aerosol help to get accurate spectral description of earth surface. Unlike the previous empirical ways of atmospheric correction, we propose a data fusion method for atmospheric correction of satellite images, with an initial attempt to include the uncertainty information from different data source. It takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of MODIS observations to get BRDF description of the earth surface as the prior information of the earth surface property, uses the ECMWF CAMS Near-realtime as the prior information of the atmospheric sates, to get optimal estimations of the atmospheric parameters. It guarantees the correction is consistent cross different satellites image tiles and even cross different sensors. The validations against the AERONET sites are also show high correlation at around 0.9, with a RMSE of about 0.02.

TI  - Spatiotemporal fusion through the best linear unbiased estimator to generate fine spatial resolution NDVI time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) technologies are commonly used to acquire high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing observations. However, most STF technologies fail to consider the nonlinear variation in vegetation in the time domain. Based on the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE), this paper proposed a novel STF algorithm (referred to BLUE) which accounts for the phenological characteristics of vegetation. First, annual time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution is fitted using a double logistic function and used as the background field. Then, NDVI data with low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution is used as the observation field. The information in the background and observation fields is fused using the BLUE to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution NDVI data. The proposed algorithm was used to produce dense time series of 30m resolution NDVI data for a 10km x 10km experimental area in 2014. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of fusion results from the proposed BLUE method are higher than those from the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and Linear Mixing Growth Model (LMGM), especially when the temporal component of surface heterogeneity is dominant. The proposed algorithm has broad prospects in vegetation monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution.

AB  - Using remote sensing (RS) data to monitor the onset, proliferation and decline of green tide (GT) has great significance for disaster warning, trend prediction and decision-making support. However, remote sensing images vary under different observing conditions, which bring big challenges to detection missions. This paper proposes an accurate green tide detection method based on an Elegant End-to-End Fully Convolutional Network (E3FCN) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In preprocessing, RS images are firstly separated into subimages by a sliding window. To detect GT pixels more efficiently, the original Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) architecture is modified into E3FCN, which can be trained end-to-end. The E3FCN model can be divided into two parts, contracting path and expanding path. The contracting path aims to extract high-level features and the expanding path aims to provide a pixel-level prediction by using a skip technique. The prediction result of whole image is generated by merging the prediction results of subimages, which can also improve the final performance. Experiment results show that the average precision of E3FCN on the whole data sets is 98.06%, compared to 73.27% of Support Vector Regression (SVR), 71.75% of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and 64.41% of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).

TI  - Land use and land cover change in Inner Mongolia - understanding the effects of China's re-vegetation programs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past decades, overuse of land resources has increasingly contributed to environmental crises in China. To mitigate wide-spread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore ecologically valuable landscapes such as natural forests. However, the effects of the various vegetation protection policies that have been implemented in China since the late 1990's still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we therefore focus on mapping land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Inner Mongolia, one of the key regions targeted by Chinese ecological restoration programs. We used 250-m MODIS time series and a random forest classification approach to generate annual probabilities for each land cover class between 2000 and 2014. We then applied a trajectory-based change detection approach based on a modified version of the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to the probability time series and mapped land cover change trajectories. We found that our trajectory-based approach achieved high accuracies (overall accuracy 0.95 +/- 0.02). It provides spatial-temporal land change maps that allow a land-use related interpretation of change patterns. Our change maps show that i) forest loss decreased rapidly after 2000 (from 15,717 1770 ha in 2001 to 1313 165 ha in 2014) and forth gain (190,645 28,352 ha during 2001-2014) occurred in the ecological program zones, leading to a net forest increase in Inner Mongolia, and ii) cropland retirement (212,979 54,939 ha during 2001-2014) mostly occurred at the early stage of ecological programs and mainly concentrated in drier environments and steep terrain. Overall, land cover mapping and trajectory-based land use analyses allowed a consistent characterization of LULCC over large areas, which is crucial for gaining a better understanding of environmental changes in the light of rapidly changing environmental policies and governance regimes in China.

AB  - On 10 August 2016 China launched the GF-3, its first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, which was put into operation at the end of January, 2017. The GF-3 polarimetric SAR has many advantages such as high resolution and multi-polarization imaging capabilities. Polarimetric SAR can fully characterize the backscatter property of targets, and thus it is of great interest to explore the physical scattering mechanisms of terrain types, which is very important in interpreting polarimetric SAR imagery and for its further usages in Earth observation. Both Radarsat-2 and Gaofen-3 satellites operate in C-band and are designed for similar missions. In this study, we compare the performances of fully polarimetric Gaofen-3 and Radarsat-2 data in representation of terrain types. By using several classic polarimetric features and the iterative Wishart-distribution based classifier, Gaofen-3 and Radarsat-2 data are compared in the aspects of polarimetric property preservation and capability of terrain classification.

TI  - Analyzing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration changes and their influencing factors in Indonesia by OCO-2 and other multi-sensor remote-sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We used OCO-2 products and considered three factors that potentially affect CO2 concentration in Indonesia: sea surface temperature (SST), forest fires and vegetation. From 2014 to 2016, CO2 concentration in Indonesia showed a trend of increase, which is consistent with the global increase reported by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Project. As an archipelago country, the results indicate that SST has a direct effect on the CO2 concentration in Indonesia. Their changing exhibits similar fluctuations; meanwhile, CO2 concentration and SST also presented positive correlation. In 2015, the number of fire hotspots suddenly increased to 140,699, because of occurrence of the worst forest fire. Due to special geographic conditions, forest fires did not induce CO2 concentration changes in Indonesia, but CO2 concentration in the corresponding islands showed a trend of increase. CO2 concentration increased in Kalimantan during the occurrence of forest fire in September-October 2014, and CO2 concentration increased in Kalimantan and Sumatra during the occurrence of forest fire in September-October 2015. Vegetation indices were stable and presented no correlation with CO2 concentration. This study demonstrated that OCO-2 is capable of monitoring CO2 concentration at a regional scale; additionally, an effective method for using OCO-2 Level 2 products is proposed.

AB  - ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data acquired in full polarimetric mode at the rice heading and well-grown seasons were analyzed to classify agricultural areas according to their use. Eigenvalue-eigenvector and four-component decompositions were used to classify the PALSAR-2 data and discriminate different agricultural parcels. Threshold analysis was applied for the polarimetric decomposition components. Polarimetric decomposition parameters, alpha angle, double bounce scattering component ratio, and surface scattering component ratio, were applied to classify areas according to their use for paddy rice or other crops including soybean. The same threshold value used for analysis using the double bounce scattering component ratio was useful for all PALSAR-2 data analyzed in this study. However, the efficient threshold for alpha angle discrimination was different between the analyzed datasets. Differences in data observation direction, incidence angle, and the growth situation of paddy rice at observation time are conceivable reasons for this difference.

TI  - Common Retrieval of Aerosol Properties for Imaging Satellite Sensors
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a common algorithm to retrieve aerosol properties, such as aerosol optical thickness, single-scattering albedo, and Angstrom exponent for various satellite sensors over land and ocean. The three main features of this algorithm arc: (1) automatic selection of the optimum channels for aerosol retrieval by introducing a weight for each channel to the object function, (2) setting common candidate aerosol models over land and ocean, and (3) preparing lookup tables for every 1 nm in the range of 300 to 2500 nm in the wavelength and weighting the radiance using the response function for each sensor. This method was applied to the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the Japan Meteorological Agency's geostationary satellite Himawari-8, and the results depicted a continuous estimate of aerosol optical thickness over land and ocean. Furthermore, the aerosol optical thickness estimated using our algorithm was generally consistent with the products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). In addition, we applied our algorithm to MODIS on board the Aqua satellite and compared the retrieval results to the results obtained from AIR The comparisons of the aerosol optical thickness, retrieved from different sensors with the different viewing angles onboard the geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, suggest an underestimation of aerosol optical thickness at the backscattering direction (or overestimated in other directions). The retrieval of aerosol properties using a common algorithm allows in identifying a weakness in the algorithm, such as the assumptions in the aerosol model (e.g., sphericity or size distribution).

TI  - Sensitivity and resilience of ecosystems to climate variability in the semi-arid to hyper-arid areas of Northern China: a case study in the Heihe River Basin
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and climate extremes are important climatic determinants of plant growth, species distribution and net primary productivity. A comprehensively quantitative analysis of the sensitivity and resilience of ecosystems to climate variability is vital to identify which regions and species are most in danger in response to future climate change. Here, we proposed an empirical approach to assess the relative sensitivity and resilience of ecosystems to short-term climate variability in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) which is the second largest inland river basin in the northern China and contains ecosystems of semi-arid, arid and hyper-arid types. Based on the monthly time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperatures (LST) and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration (AET/PET) derived from MODIS sensor from 2000 to 2013, we developed a multiple linear regressive and autoregressive model to determine the sensitivity of NDVI anomalies to climate variability indicated by monthly LST anomalies (temperature variability) and monthly AET/PET anomalies (water variability). We included 1 month time lag of NDVI anomalies in order to reflect ecosystem resilience. We found that the sensitivity and resilience to climate variability were different in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the HRB. Temperature variability dominantly controlled vegetation anomalies in the upper reach, but water variability was the dominant climatic factor in the middle and lower reaches. The different responses of semi-arid to hyper-arid ecosystems to climate variability depended much on the distinct climatic conditions and diverse vegetation types. Ecosystems in drier condition tended to show higher sensitivity to water variability, and ecosystems with colder climate were likely to be more sensitive to temperature variability. The most sensitive vegetation type to water variability and temperature variability in the HRB was crop and meadow, respectively. Grass had been proved to have the lowest resilience. Our research on the sensitivity and resilience of semi-arid to hyper-arid ecosystems is helpful for formulating and implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies in response to climate change.

AB  - Despite great scientific interest since at least the 1920's, the THz frequency range remains one of the least tapped regions of the EM spectrum. Many scientists and engineers do research in THz, from source to transmission and receiver to imager. Up to now compared with traditional and optical technologies, the applications of THz is relatively narrow. In the space field, SWAS (The Sub-millimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite) was launched in 1998, which NASA to study molecular cloud composition in the galactic plane by examining sub-millimeter(500GHz) spectral lines. Planck/Herschel explorer launched by ESA in 2009, for receiving CMB(cosmic microwave background) between microwave to THz(similar to 1THz), search relics of Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. These projects all are focusing on scientific research. In China, GEO meteorological satellite FY-4 launched in 2016, has 424GHz instrument for testing. This uses give THz a dawn of applications. But THz still face huge challenges which compare to traditional microwave particular in space. This paper reviews some programs of THz in space. In addition to present applications, such as upper atmosphere research, water cycle, cosmos research(CMB),the future applications of air plane communication and monitoring of hazard asteroids for Earth are suggested in this paper.

AB  - Unlike general VHR (Very-High-Resolution) satellite sensors that are mainly for panchromatic and MS (Multispectral) imaging, Worldview-3 sensor additionally provides eight SWIR (Short Wavelength Infrared) bands in wavelength range from 1198 nm to 2365 nm. This study investigates the effect of informative Worldview-3 SWIR bands for wetland classification performance. Worldview-3 imagery acquired over Sunchon Bay, which is a coastal wetland located in South Korea, is used to implement the classification. Land-cover classes for the scene are determined by referring to national land-cover maps, which are provided by the Ministry of Environment, overlapped with the scene. After that, training data for each determined class are collected. In order to analyze the effect of SWIR bands, classifications with and without SWIR bands are carried out and the results are then compared. In this regard, a SVM (Support Vector Machine) is utilized as their classifier. As a result of the accuracy assessments performed by test data that are independently extracted from training data, it was confirmed that classification performance was improved when the SWIR bands are included as input features for SVM-based classification.

AB  - Purpose: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are important for staging of patients with node-positive breast cancer. However, these can be avoided in select micrometastatic diseases, preventing postoperative complications. The present study evaluated the ability of axillary lymph node maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to predict axillary metastasis of breast cancer.Methods: The records of invasive breast cancer patients who underwent pretreatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy) PET-CT between January 2006 and December 2014 were reviewed. ALNs were preoperatively evaluated by PET-CT. Lymph nodes were dissected by SLNB or ALND.SUVmax was measured in both the axillary lymph node and primary tumor. Student t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze sensitivity and specificity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) analyses were performed.Results: SUV-tumor (SUV-T) and SUV-lymph node (SUV-LN) were significantly higher in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) group than in other groups (SUV-T: 5.99, P<0.01; SUV-LN: 1.29, P=0.014). The sensitivity (0.881) and accuracy (0.804) for initial ALN staging were higher in fine needle aspiration+PET-CT than in other methods. For PET-CT alone, the subtype with the highest sensitivity (0.870) and negative predictive value (0.917) was TNBC. The AUC for SUV-LN was greatest in TNBC (0.797).Conclusion: The characteristics of SUV-T and SUV-LN differed according to immunohistochemistry subtype. Compared to other subtypes, the true positivity of axillary metastasis on PET-CT was highest in TNBC. These findings could help tailor management for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe Buddhist counseling methodology in terms of characteristics of Buddhist counseling, attitude of Buddhist counselor, process, mechanism and technique of Buddhist counseling. Buddhist counseling is characterized by goal oriented, open and wide, removable, universal, and fundamental. Buddhist counseling is a counseling oriented toward the ultimate goal of Buddhism, counseling to open the knowledge and view of the client, counseling to remove unwholesome mental factors, and counseling to deal with the universal theme at a fundamental level.The attitude of Buddhist counselors should have an understanding of the original appearance of the mind and strive to eliminate the defilement that acts dysfunctionally to the counselor and the client. The space where the counselor and the client meet can be seen as a dynamic space where by the Buddhist worldview is vitalized and opened. The process of Buddhist counseling initially aims at realistic goal, orienting toward the ultimate goal, and opens understanding and awareness of the suffering of the client in a universal and fundamental dimension. In the middle period, the process of opening and removing is complementarily continued. In the latter period, this process is maintained continuously. There are two mechanisms in Buddhist counseling: openness and removal. Openness is associated with a monistic tendency among the two tendencies of mind, and removal is connected with pluralistic tendency. The technique of Buddhist counseling can be seen centered on mind-centered technique, open technique, and unraveling technique. The mind-centered method of trying to pay attention to the mind has the awareness technique and reflection technique. The open technique that opens and broadens the viewpoints has the technique of right view and the technique of dependent origination. Unraveling techniques to dismantle obstacles and shackles include right doing techniques, right thought techniques, right language techniques, and replacement techniques.

AB  - This article focuses on the spirituality of Calvin and Hildegard. Calvin and Hildegard have much in common in terms of Christian spirituality. But the gap between genders, times in the 16th and 12th centuries, and the resulting differences in society, culture and worldview between men and women, pastor and nun, can not be ignored. Nevertheless, the reason why Calvin and Hildegard are dealt with together is that Calvin has an important status of Protestant theology, and Calvin's spirituality is largely discussed in Protestant spirituality. Hildegard’s spirituality could show feminine aspect of spirituality which does not be revealed to Calvin, and Medieval Christian heritage. We study Hildegard with Calvin to examine Christian spirituality with various spiritual understandings.So we examine the relationship between Calvin 's spirituality and Hildegard’s spirituality focusing on knowledge of God, and knowledge of ourselves exploring Calvin’s Institutes and Hildegard' s three Vision books. There are similarities and differences in the spirituality of Calvin and Hildegard. We can know that we gain knowledge of God and ourselves in the process of spiritual formation. We also see that spirituality is formed by acquiring knowledge of God and ourselves from Calvin’s spirituality and Hildegard’s spirituality.Thus, we apply this to Christian education, and propose that the direction of Christian spirituality education is centered on 'knowing', and extend the field of education from the community of faith to outside the community of faith.

AB  - Confucianism is the study of scholars who actively participate in the real world and place emphasis on moving into what they learn. MogEun LeeSack (李穡, 牧隱 1328~1396)consistently emphasized the participation and practice spirit of Confucianism and compared Taoism with Buddhism from a Confucian point of view. Confucianism is the role of government that governs countries and people. In other words, it became the main force that governed the world that it was able to correct the order of the Goryeo society which was confused at that time and to be able to edify it as a national religion.In other words, MogEun said about Confucius that he succeeded the Way of King Yo Sun, revealed the law of WenWu, organized and compiled the Book of Odes the Canon of History, enacted ProprityMusic to come true Right politics. He taught people correctly and taught them to be right and to have a good temperament, so that they provided a basis for enjoying peace and happiness.He also praised the fact that people have not been better than Confucius since the beginning of the world. At the same time, he expressed his legitimacy of the Way. In addition, he was a pure Confucian with a firm will to inherit the intention of YoSun and partly recognized the idea of ​​Buddhism and Taoism in a neo-Confucian worldview.From his early age, 牧隱 had learned from many mountains and temples including Sungjusan, and cultivated his academia and friendship with many monks. The monks, however, threw out their positions and official uniforms, broke the tie endowed by Heaven between the father and the son, and abandoned the human bondage in the brotherhood. He revealed his Buddhist image that the Confucian had rejected Buddhism as they became a group like a fowl.The reason why they did not reject Buddhism was that Confucianism could not play a role in correcting the social order, and that Buddhism would play a role of reforming the deterioration of the beautiful and fine custom. In other words, Buddhism has been able to save rebirth from misery and suffering, to be mentally dependent, and to be able to take on the role of salvation even further.It accepts Taoism from a Confucian point of view. Confucianism has to thoroughly discipline self-discipline, emphasize strict courtesy and law, and yet, the Way of Laozi is natural to do so. He seemed to recognize Taoism as a reliever who relieved the people from the harm caused by the social laws and regulations that people made.However, as an improvement of Taoism, it is difficult to follow the true truth of Laozi, to make some people hate and disturb the world with strange and impractical methods. And he stressed that the false Taoists who deceive the people and confuse their minds should try to understand and uncover the teachings of Lozai. In other words, he warned Taoism that he borrowed the Way of Laozi and taught the reality in a way totally different from that of Laozi, and to dishonor the Master.In MogEun’ thought, there is no Way to leave the reality. If people see only what is visible, or if they follow the ideal quibbling over too much reason, they will fall into a heresy. In criticizing Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, MogEun regareded it as the most important thing whether they are escaped from the Truth(the Way). Among the ideas of the Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, MogEun took something that he could take, and criticized the words that fell into the heresy or were absent-minded. The words of Confucius, Buddha and Laozi are not much different. Therefore, he could embrace Buddhism and Taoism in a futuristic way without being greatly rejected.

T2  - Research journal of Korean Church History
T2  - 교회사연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - The historicity of mission-act can be exposed properly when the culture, institution, and norm of the society entering is understood and utilized strategically as a symbolic system to root down the mission, not by just categorizing it as adaptation or non-adaptation of the mission-act. Accommodationism is the Christian religion seeking a proper action-strategy for a successful mission goal (evangelization, cultural preemption) within the societal and cultural context. Thus, the creator of East Asia’s mission norm, Alessandro Valignano’s (1593-1606) Japan mission perception and action-strategy is studied as one model of methodological accommodationism.As Valignano developed deep respect for the Japanese culture, especially their personalities, dwellings, food culture, work and leisure, and personal relationships, he expressed the superiority of Japanese civilization through comparisons to other non-European mission countries such as India and Mozambique. With the basis of high respect and comprehension of Japan’s culture, elite action-strategy is pursued in three institution levels: first, strengthening of the elite lord’s concentration of the evangelization ; second, strengthening of Christian hegemony instituting diffusion of elite positivity through school education ; and third, the competition with the Buddhist in influencing the society’s ethical and norm. The deployment of the three institution levels between the missionary and the indigenous agents is a mutual action, a struggle of recognition, to become the culture’s prominent religion, or in another words, to gain symbolic power. Mission can be understood as the process of a accepting the worldview and culture of the class of missionaries as universal and just. This process is configured with the missionaries’ recognition of culture and action-strategy. Valignano’s such recognition and methodological action-strategy then becomes East Asia missionaries’ path-dependent model. Even though, Valignano’s accommodationism emerges from Japan’s special cultural context, later on, the effects of the methodological action-strategy is also seen in China and other areas as well, and is normalized to become a model of accommodationism in missions.

TI  - Chaotic genetic algorithm and Adaboost ensemble metamodeling approach for optimum resource planning in emergency departments
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long length of stay and overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) are two common problems in the healthcare industry. To decrease the average length of stay (ALOS) and tackle overcrowding, numerous resources, including the number of doctors, nurses and receptionists need to be adjusted, while a number of constraints are to be considered at the same time. In this study, an efficient method based on agent based simulation, machine learning and the genetic algorithm (GA) is presented to determine optimum resource allocation in emergency departments. GA can effectively explore the entire domain of all 19 variables and identify the optimum resource allocation through evolution and mimicking the survival of the fittest concept. A chaotic mutation operator is used in this study to boost GA performance. A model of the system needs to be run several thousand times through the GA evolution process to evaluate each solution, hence the process is computationally expensive. To overcome this drawback, a robust metamodel is initially constructed based on an agent-based system simulation. The simulation exhibits ED performance with various resource allocations and trains the metamodel. The metamodel is created with an ensemble of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), feedforward neural network (FFNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) using the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) ensemble algorithm. The proposed GA-based optimization approach is tested in a public ED, and it is shown to decrease the ALOS in this ED case study by 14%. Additionally, the proposed metamodel shows a 26.6% improvement compared to the average results of ANFIS, FFNN and RNN in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal evolution and the causes of the formation of urban heat island (UHI) is of great significance to ease the urban thermal environment and improve the comfortability for human settlement. The land surface temperature (LST) of Beijing downtown is retrieved based on Landsat thermal infrared images, and the LST is graded to obtain multi-grade heat island intensity (HII) for analyzing the evolution law and spatial pattern of UHI. The Beijing downtown was divided into 30 ring buffers, and the proportion of ground feature types and the information on HII in each ring buffer was analyzed. Also, the relationship between the influence factor and the HII is established based on the statistical data onto each ground feature type and the distance from the downtown. The results showed that the overall HII is increasing every year in Beijing downtown. The impervious surface has a great impact on the HII, the strength of HII becomes greater with the growth of impervious surface percentage (ISP). The strength of HII decreases gradually with the increasing distance from the center of the city.

TI  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction using a GPS-based iterative tropospheric decomposition model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric effects represent one of the major error sources of repeat-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and could mask actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. The tropospheric delays vary both vertically and laterally and can be considered as the sum of (i) a vertically stratified component highly correlated with topography and (ii) a turbulent component resulting from turbulent processes in the troposphere varying both in space and time. In this paper, we outline a framework to routinely use pointwise GPS data to reduce tropospheric effects on satellite radar measurements. An Iterative Tropospheric Decomposition (ITD) model is used and further developed to separate tropospheric stratified and turbulent signals and then generate high-resolution correction maps for SAR interferograms. Cross validation is employed to assess the performance of the ITD model and act as an indicator to users of when and where correction is feasible. Tests were carried out to assess the impact of GPS station spacing on the ITD model InSAR correction performance, which provides insights into the trade-off between station spacing and the achievable accuracy. The appliCation of this framework to Sentinel-1A interferograms over the Southern California (USA) and Southern England (UK) regions shows approximately 45-78% of noise reduction even with a sparse (similar to 50-80 km station spacing) GPS network and/or with strong and non-random tropospheric turbulence. This is about a 50% greater improvement than previous methods. It is believed that this framework could lead to a generic InSAR atmospheric correction model while incorporating continuous and global tropospheric delay datasets, e.g. numerical weather models.

AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data contain more material information for each endmember due to the complexity of the natural object and the limitation of spatial resolution, resulting in the existence of a large number of mixed pixels, which increases the difficulty of data analysis. Abundance estimation is one of the most important topics in hyperspectral unmixing, it can be used to analyze the proportion of mixed pixels accurately. In order to improve the processing speed of hyperspectral image abundance estimation, in this paper, the parallel mode of Recursive Orthogonal Vector Projection (ROVP) algorithm based on NVIDIA's graphic processing unit (GPU) is proposed. The ROVP-C (ROVP-on-CUDA) algorithm based on CPU / GPU heterogeneous system and the ROVP-L (ROVP-on-Library) algorithm based on CUBLAS (CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library are designed and implemented. The experimental results showed that these two algorithms have achieved obvious speed-up ratio compared with the traditional serial algorithms, and it showed that GPU has a great advantage in the field of estimating the hyperspectral abundance.

TI  - Air Quality Model-Based Methods for Estimating Human Exposures: A Review and Comparison
T2  - AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND ITS APPLICATION XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 35th International Technical Meeting on Air Pollution Modelling and its Application (ITM)
CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - Determining estimates of human exposure is increasingly relying on the use of air quality models and satellite observations to provide spatially and temporally complete pollutant concentration fields. Air quality models, in particular, are attractive as they capture the emissions and meteorological linkages. Additionally they can provide source impact information and concentration fields for a range of species not currently provided from satellite-based observations (e.g., MODIS and MAIAC), and are not subject to cloud interference. Multiple methods based on air quality modeling (including using CMAQ and/or RLINE) with and without data fusion, have been developed and are being used in health studies as part of the EPA-funded Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology Clean Air Research Center. The methods include CMAQ-Data Fusion where concentrations fields are blended with observations to provide spatially and temporally complete pollutant concentrations fields of PM2.5, EC, CO, and NO2. To improve the spatial resolution, this method was extended to include RLINE fields for fine scale (250 m) exposure assessment. Another method was developed to estimate spatial exposure estimates of emissions source categories using CMAQ-derived source impacts for 16-32 sources, along with observations of individual PM species. Each of these approaches have individual strengths and weaknesses. The methods that use a data fusion approach to blend observations and air quality model fields are found to best capture the spatiotemporal trends in the observations, reducing the standard error in the exposure estimates. In the past, such methods were limited by the availability of air quality model fields over long periods, but such fields are becoming more routinely available from air quality forecasting activities.

AB  - Dongchuan County in Yunnan Province, China is a typical debris flow area in China and even in the world. The occurrence of debris flow has a great impact on the land cover. At present, remote sensing monitoring has been widely used in land use surveys due to its characteristic of non-directly contacting with the measured objects. Therefore, the use of remote sensing technology is a safe and efficient method for land cover surveys in debris flow area. Based on the 2016 Landsat remote sensing image, this paper selected the tributary of Xiaojiang River- Dabaini River Basin in Dongchuan County as the research object, monitored the land cover in the basin through the remote sensing interactive interpretation and then revealed the current status of land use. The results showed that: (1) According to the land cover of the Dabaini River Basin presented by remote sensing image, the land in the basin can be divided into two categories: debris flow area and non-debris flow area. (2) The remote sensing interpretation marks were established for debris flow area. The debris flow area was divided into three sections: source section, with an area of 174.70 ha; circulation section, with an area of 94.87 ha; accumulation section, with an area of 98.74 ha. Different sections exhibited different shapes and structural features. (3) The land use of non-debris flow area was divided into four types, including 767.61 ha of cultivated land, 682.33 ha of forest land, 112.78 ha of construction land, 414.87 ha of bare land. The spatial distribution of four land use types presented a variety of features. (4) However, there was still an irrational land use in the Dabaini River Basin, such as free to occupy cultivated land and indiscriminate felling of trees which caused inefficient and unsustainable land use. This phenomenon should be controlled and improved in order to reduce soil erosion and optimize the allocation of land resources, to make the land use in the Dabaini River Basin be intensive and rational. This paper has an important scientific significance for the study of debris flow land cover monitoring and land use evaluation in the Dabaini River Basin.

AB  - The explosion of available Remote Sensing data resources in a wide range of Earth Observation application domains is shifting the paradigm of Earth Data Science. To exploit and acquire further insights and knowledge, the development of standard-based collaborative analytics services is considered as one of potential solutions and is becoming indispensable to strengthen integration among Earth observation application systems. In this study, a standard-based collaborative analytics method based on Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) and R are proposed by considering standardized web communication protocols, making it possible to effectively improve the interoperability of Spatial Data Infrastructures in terms of Earth Science System monitoring and forecasting.

CL  - Tokyo, JAPAN
AB  - The anisotropic behavior of two typical cold rolled Al alloy sheets, AA5182-O and AA6016-T4, were investigated and used to predictive the yield surface by the well-known yield criteria: Hi1190, Barlat89 and Barlat2000. Uniaxial tensile tests with axial and wide extensometers were carried out at different angles to the rolling direction (RD). Then the yield stress a e and anisotropic coefficient tau(theta) were obtained. Biaxial tensile tests of cross-shaped specimens under certain liner loading paths were conducted on the well-designed biaxial tensile testing machine. The loading paths includes F-x:F-y =1:4, 2:4, 3:4, 4:4, 4:3, 4:2, 4:1. Yield stresses points (sigma(x) , sigma(y)) and their strain ratios in the yield locus plane can be obtained from the strain-stress curves of the biaxial tensile tests. Parts of tested values were used to determinate the yield locus according to different yield functions. All experimental data was used to evaluate the precisions of the yield functions by taking into account of the accuracy of sigma(theta) and r theta and the yield stress and strain ratios of biaxial tensile tests.

AB  - Soil sealing in urban areas imposes a large impact on vegetation health and its functioning in providing ecosystem services. Yet, quantitative assessment of soil sealing effect on urban tree health status remains challenging. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using airborne imaging spectroscopy and leaf reflectance for assessing the effect of soil sealing on leaf chlorophyll content of trees and their spectral responses. Results showed that soil sealing decreased the leaf total chlorophyll content and the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll. Chlorophyll spectral indices extracted from airborne and leaf reflectance data were both highly correlated with chlorophyll. Spectrally predicted chlorophyll variations allowed for the discrimination of different soil sealing conditions. This study demonstrates the. great potential of using airborne remote sensing data to assess the health status of urban vegetation as well as for biomonitoring soil sealing impacts.

TI  - Difficult to map regions in 30 m global land cover mapping determined with a common validation dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The free availability of decametre global satellite images and high-performance supercomputing provides opportunities for the development of many global products, including land cover, forest change, water, and cropland. However, some regions are particularly hard to map. Identification of these regions aids the understanding of map accuracy issues. In this study, we analysed seven maps produced with different algorithms/approaches but using the same classification system and training samples. A common validation dataset was used to identify regions incorrectly classified by all maps. These were defined as difficult to map regions (DMRs). They covered around 16% of the world's ice-free terrestrial areas. Our analysis indicated that (1) grassland, shrubland, forest, and cropland were the most common land-cover types that could not be correctly classified, but impervious surfaces had the greatest proportion of misclassification; (2) incorrect classification mainly occurred in tropical/subtropical grassland/savanna/shrubland and desert/xeric shrubland; (3) the spatial distribution of DMRs was almost consistent with slope/elevation changes along latitude/longitude; and (4) the hotspot areas of land-cover mapping studies did not align with the DMRs. Our results suggest that there is a need for further work on DMRs to improve global land-cover mapping accuracy.

AB  - The ship targets affected by sea conditions and other environment factors have complex non-cooperation movement, which cause serious defocusing phenomena in high resolution space-borne SAR images. In this paper, a novel ISAR-based imaging algorithm for moving ship target is presented. Firstly, the spatial geometric model of space-borne SAR is given, and the motorial characteristics of moving ship target are analyzed. Then, a novel imaging algorithm is derived, where the range alignment is solved by minimum information entropy criterion, and the accurate focusing is achieved through inverse SAR (ISAR) processing. Experiments based on the simulation and real data of TerraSAR-X are performed to validate the presented algorithm.

TI  - Detecting Shoot Beetle Damage on Yunnan Pine Using Landsat Time-Series Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomicus yunnanensis and Tomicus minor have caused serious shoot damage in Yunnan pine forests in the Yunnan Province of China. However, very few remote sensing studies have estimated the shoot damage ratio (SDR). Thus, we used multi-date Landsat satellite imagery to quantify SDRs and assess the possibility of using spectral indices to determine the beetle outbreak time and spread direction. A new threshold-based classification method was proposed to identify damage levels (i.e., healthy, slightly to moderately infested, and severely infested forests) using time series of moisture stress index (MSI). Permanent plots and temporal field inspection data were both used as references for training and evaluation. Results show that a single threshold value can produce a total classification accuracy of 86.38% (Kappa = 0.80). Furthermore, time series maps detailing damage level were reconstructed from 2004 to 2016. The shoot beetle outbreak year was estimated to be 2013. Another interesting finding is the movement path of the geometric center of severe damage, which is highly consistent with the wind direction. We conclude that the time series of shoot damage level maps can be produced by using continuous MSI images. This method is very useful to foresters for determining the outbreak time and spread direction.

T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of the vegetation growing season in the Three-Rivers Headwater Region of the Tibetan Plateau has recently become a controversial topic. One issue is that the estimated local trend in the start of the vegetation growing season (SOS) based on remote sensing data is easily affected by outliers because this data series is short. In this study, we determine that the spring minimum temperature is the most influential factor for SOS. The significant negative linear relationship between the two variables in the region is evaluated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data for 2000-13. We then reconstruct the SOS time series based on the temperature data for 1960-2013. The regional mean SOS shows an advancing trend of 1.42 d (10 yr)(-1) during 1960-2013, with the SOS occurring on the 160th and 151st days in 1960 and 2013, respectively. The advancing trend enhances to 6.04 d (10 yr)(-1) during the past 14 years. The spatiotemporal variations of the reconstructed SOS data are similar to those deduced from remote sensing data during the past 14 years. The latter exhibit an even larger regional mean trend of SOS [7.98 d (10 yr(-1))] during 2000-13. The Arctic Oscillation is found to have significantly influenced the changing SOS, especially for the eastern part of the region, during 2000-13.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of carbon fractions in the Chinese Yellow River estuary
T2  - MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and consistent carbon fraction estimates are crucial in studying the role of coasts in the global carbon cycle. Remote sensing offers the potential to estimate carbon fractions with its advantages of large spatial coverage and real-time surveys. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption was generally used as a proxy to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, the CDOM-DOC relationship varies by region and remains inconstant. Thus, the correlation between the reflectivity of visible band and DOC concentration was directly adopted in DOC estimation and performed well in former studies. Atomic groups of the various components of carbon fractions produce electronic transition by absorbing photons, and this process occurs both in the visible bands and in the near-infrared bands. Thus, the wide range of absorption band provides an approach to estimate carbon fractions using the correlation between the reflectivity of the whole visible/near-infrared bands of optical satellite sensors and carbon fractions. A new ratio band combination was developed and performed well in carbon fraction concentration retrievals, and the yielded estimation accuracies (R-2>0.77, RPD >2.02) were sufficient to map the spatial distributions of carbon fractions with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer image.

AB  - This paper presents an inspiring approach for accurate estimation of impervious surfaces, which exploits the strength of two kind of heterogeneous features, i.e., physical features derived from satellite images and social features derived from social media datasets, respectively. On the one hand, we use a morphological attribute profiles guided spectral mixture analysis model to achieve estimates of physical features. On the other hand, we mine the social features from textual information of social media datasets. Then, a multi variable linear regression model is conducted to obtain the impervious surfaces. Experiment results, conducted with multi-spectral images collected by LANDSAT-8 and social media datasets scraped from Sina Weibo of Guangzhou city, suggest that our approach could lead to reliable and good estimation of the imperviousness.

AB  - Land use and land cover maps are essential to study how the earth surface change over time and how human activities interact with environments. The growing amount of available remote sensing images, especially the well archived Landsat images with 30 meters resolution, have been used to conduct supervised classification for land use and land cover maps. However, to achieve high classification accuracy, ground truth samples with fine quality and large quantity are required. Collecting ground truth samples is both time-consuming and expensive and sometimes even unviable when ground truth samples are needed for the past years. In this paper, we provided a way of using the GlobeLand30 (GLC30) 2000 and 2010 products as ground truth instead of manually labeling ground truth samples to produce land use and land cover maps for 2005 in our study area, Bangladesh country on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment is conducted on randomly generated samples from GlobeLand30 products, and the overall accuracy is around 84.8%.

TI  - A Comparison of Regression Techniques for Estimation of Above-Ground Winter Wheat Biomass Using Near-Surface Spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) provides a vital link between solar energy consumption and yield, so its correct estimation is crucial to accurately monitor crop growth and predict yield. In this work, we estimate AGB by using 54 vegetation indexes (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and eight statistical regression techniques: artificial neural network (ANN), multivariable linear regression (MLR), decision-tree regression (DT), boosted binary regression tree (BBRT), partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RF), support vector machine regression (SVM), and principal component regression (PCR), which are used to analyze hyperspectral data acquired by using a field spectrophotometer. The vegetation indexes (VIs) determined from the spectra were first used to train regression techniques for modeling and validation to select the best VI input, and then summed with white Gaussian noise to study how remote sensing errors affect the regression techniques. Next, the VIs were divided into groups of different sizes by using various sampling methods for modeling and validation to test the stability of the techniques. Finally, the AGB was estimated by using a leave-one-out cross validation with these powerful techniques. The results of the study demonstrate that, of the eight techniques investigated, PLSR and MLR perform best in terms of stability and are most suitable when high-accuracy and stable estimates are required from relatively few samples. In addition, RF is extremely robust against noise and is best suited to deal with repeated observations involving remote-sensing data (i.e., data affected by atmosphere, clouds, observation times, and/or sensor noise). Finally, the leave-one-out cross-validation method indicates that PLSR provides the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 1.20 t/ha, MAE = 0.90 t/ha, NRMSE = 0.07, CV (RMSE) = 0.18); thus, PLSR is best suited for works requiring high-accuracy estimation models. The results indicate that all these techniques provide impressive accuracy. The comparison and analysis provided herein thus reveals the advantages and disadvantages of the ANN, MLR, DT, BBRT, PLSR, RF, SVM, and PCR techniques and can help researchers to build efficient AGB-estimation models.

AB  - In this study, we tested the performance of averaged Stokes parameters in rape biomass inversion over Radarsat-2 data. Five time series Radarsat-2 data were acquired and they covered the whole rape growth season. At each growth stage, 16 Stokes and its child parameters were extracted to analyze their sensitivity to rape biomass. When it comes to biomass inversion, random forest (RF) algorithm were chosen for the rape biomass inversion. The results showed that the total scattered intensity g(0) has highest coherence with rape biomass during the whole growth cycle. R-2 between them was 0.704. Other parameters including degree of polarization m, the degree of depolarization (1- m), the degree of linear polarization (P-l) and the linear polarization ratio (U-c) showed secondary higher coherence with R-2 between 0.3 to 0.4. These parameters also showed higher importance for the parameter importance analysis with RF method. RF method showed potential performance for rape biomass inversion with R-2 of 0.585 and RMSE of 71.86 g/m(2).

AB  - Sentinel-2 is a very new programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) that is designed for fine spatial resolution global monitoring. Land cover-land use (LCLU) classification tasks can take advantage of the fusion of radar and optical remote sensing data, leading generally to increase mapping accuracy. Here we propose a methodological approach to fuse information from the new European Space Agency Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for accurate land cover mapping of a portion of the South Solok region, West Sumatera. Data pre-processing was carried out using the European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform and the SEN2COR toolboxes. The two main objectives of this study are to evaluate the potential use and synergetic effects of ESA Sentinel-1A C-band SAR and Sentinel-2A Optical data for classification and mapping of LCLU. As a result of the research, two main advantages. First, the pre-processing chain supported by sensor-specific toolboxes developed by ESA represents a reliable and fast approach for the preparation of ready-to-process imagery. Second, investigation to derive a methodological framework to integrate Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for land cover mapping by integrating of radar and optical imagery have been set up and tested.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing data collected from urban and landscape areas have been extensively studied over the past decades. Recent applications pose an emerging need of analyzing the land cover types based on high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing data originating from remote sensory devices. Toward this goal, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) classifier in this paper. The DNN is constructed by combining a stacked autoencoder with desired numbers of autoencoders and a softmax classifier. Our experimental results based on the hyperspectral remote sensing data demonstrate that the presented DNN classifier can accurately distinguish different land covers including the mixed deciduous broadleaf natural forest and different land covers such as agriculture, roads, buildings, etc. We test the proposed method by using three different benchmark data sets. The proposed method showcases the huge potential of deep neural networks for hyperspectral data analysis.

AB  - For a reason of limitations of optical data depending on weather conditions, the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been regarded as a complementary tool for understanding disaster field situations in recent years. Coincidentally, there were two large-scale earthquakes above magnitude 5.0 within the last a year in Korea. In this study, a Differential Interferometry SAR(DInSAR) technique is applied to analyze the ground deformation and its influence range by Pohang earthquake in Korea. Then the direction of the deformation was estimated in 3-dimension. Results show that the maximum of 5 cm uplift is observed in area covering 10km radius from the epicenter, and the principal direction appeared in north-northeast. More elaborated and continuous monitoring based on SAR data will need to make proper measures for expected future earthquakes.

AB  - The reconstruction of ocean surface wave characteristics, i.e. directional energy distribution and dispersion, from ocean sunglitter images is discussed. Wave spectral analysis is performed, through the definition of linear transfer functions, to relate image brightness variations and sea surface slopes. Surface-current Doppler shift modifies the wave dispersion relation and can be obtained from cross-correlating two images and tracking glint changes over a known time. The technique is tested on photographs, taken from an aircraft in the Gulf of Mexico, and from a drone in the Black sea. The method is further extended to satellite sunglitter imagery, taking advantage of the technical peculiarities of Sentinel-2 sensors helping to infer both the brightness gradient in the along-track direction. Wave dispersion information through the inter-channel time delay allows to reconstruct the current vector. The results demonstrate encouraging prospects of using the sunglitter imagery for the sea state monitoring, including formation of abnormally high waves and the study of wave-current interactions at different scales.

TI  - AN OVERTURE TO THE ROLE OF ARCHITECT WORLDVIEW IN CONFORMITY AND DIRECTION OF THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
T2  - ARCHIVES FOR TECHNICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The "product" of architecture, as something that is created by the architect in a "design process", along with other effective materialistic and environmental factors, depends on the worldview of the architect as the pioneer and director of the process. In fact, the architect's definition of human being and his aspects of existence on one hand and his needs and objectives on the other, determine "how" and "in what direction" the design process will proceed. It also reveals how the data intended for designing will be gathered, and "for achieving what goals" and "meeting what needs" they are processed. The present enquiry is an attempt to investigate how the character and characteristics of the architect's worldview will affect the steps and characteristics of the design process. Therefore, first, an architectural design process will be established step by step, and then, the effects of the worldview on them will be studied; and consequently the components influenced by the worldview will be analyzed. Based on the nature of this paper, the descriptive-analytical methodology and inductive reasoning were used. Also, the required data were gathered by desk study.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to formulate a comprehensive view of the legal regulation of relations between people of the same sex and an attempt to develop a common worldview, which has been formed in the scientific doctrine. The Russian doctrine ambiguously approaches the perception of relations of people of the same sex as a phenomenon that is naturally developed in the world community and its emergence and formation in Russia. A special conceptual apparatus used in the scientific research is subject to analysis. Graduation of scientific presentations is made in five groups: conservatives, liberals, extreme liberals, radicals and extreme radicals. Attention is drawn to the key factors affecting Russian science: political, social, religious. The authors' arguments on all groups are generalized and systematized. The sociological data of Russia and the USA are subject to research The authors come to the conclusion that ideologically, Russia is characterized by heteronormativity, that is, a worldview in which heterosexuality is understood as a social norm of sexual behavior of any person. Theoretical propositions and conclusions formulated by the authors can be useful for pedagogical purposes, popularization in the mass media, in the legislative, law enforcement practice and educational process.

AB  - The development of plants in rice fields has been monitored for years with remote sensing. The current trend in remote sensing research is towards precision agriculture, which aims to provide vitality information of plants in meter-scale resolution. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) plays a significant role in rice monitoring by relating the plant morphology to scattering behavior of electromagnetic waves. This relation can be used to improve rice monitoring applications by making the estimation of detailed plant morphology possible.In this study, we present the stochastic optimization of a metamodel-driven electromagnetic scattering model. This study involves the estimation accuracies for stalk height, leaf length and leaf width using co-polar TerraSAR-X data. The results that have been obtained are found to be successful for stalk height and leaf length with R-2 higher than 0.78 from the in-situ measured values.

We investigated the temporal patterns of two major crops, sugar beet, and winter wheat. The observations were conducted using both optical and SAR data in relation to temporal availability and potential agricultural applications. The combined use of both remote sensing methods is strongly emphasized reflecting the timely need of the information by farmers and the restrictions of the remote sensing data mainly due to weather conditions.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - ABSTRACT The upper Teles Pires River basin is a key hydrological resource for the state of Mato Grosso, but has suffered rapid land use and cover change. The basin includes areas of Cerrado biome, as well as transitional areas between the Amazon and Cerrado vegetation types, with intensive large-scale agriculture widely-spread throughout the region. The objective of this study was to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of land use and cover change from 1986 to 2014 in the upper Teles Pires basin using remote sensing and GIS techniques. TM (Thematic Mapper) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensor images aboard the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, respectively, were employed for supervised classification using the Classification Workflow in ENVI 5.0. To evaluate classification accuracy, an error matrix was generated, and the Kappa, overall accuracy, errors of omission and commission, user accuracy and producer accuracy indexes calculated. The classes showing greatest variation across the study period were Agriculture and Rainforest. Results indicated that deforested areas are often replaced by pasture and then by agriculture, while direct conversion of forest to agriculture occured less frequently. The indices with satisfactory accuracy levels included the Kappa and Global indices, which showed accuracy levels above 80% for all study years. In addition, the producer and user accuracy indices ranged from 59-100% and 68-100%, while the errors of omission and commission ranged from 0-32% and 0-40.6%, respectively. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Karachi, the biggest city of Pakistan, has undergone rapid urbanization since the creation of Pakistan in 1947. The city is expanding with an alarming rate placing pressure on the available natural resources and services with rising number of natural hazards. Urbanization brings not only multiple environmental challenges but also causes socioeconomic issues. One of the current environmental problems due to urbanization of Karachi is blockages in its natural drainage system causing localized floods after heavy rainfalls. In this paper, landuse/cover (LULC) changes of the Karachi city and their impacts on natural drains of one of its three major watersheds, Malir River Basin, over the last 23 years (1993-2015) have been studied. Historical satellite data and remote sensing tools were utilized to examine LULC changes of the Malir River Basin. The U.S.-based first earth observing satellite series of Landsat were selected for this purpose. Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission's Digital Elevation Model (DEM) along with the topographic sheets of 1975 was utilized to delineate the streams of the Malir Basin using geographical information system (GIS) tools. GIS overlay analyses were done to identify the blockages in the riverbed and flood damages. For flood simulation, historical (1985 to 2014) rainfall gauge observations of Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) were acquired. The results of the study showed that a significant portion of the riverbed, delineated from 1975 topographical sheets, has currently been occupied by urban and agricultural lands which have severely affected the natural drainage of stormwater causing localized floods in the basin.

AB  - Watershed is an ecosystem area confined by topography and has function as a catcher, storage, and supplier of water, sediments, pollutants and nutrients in the river system and exit through a single outlet. Various activities around watershed areas of Besitang have changed the land cover and vegetation index (NDVI) that exist in the region. In order to detect changes in land cover and NDVI quickly and accurately, we used remote sensing technology and geographic information systems (GIS). The study aimed to assess changes in land cover and vegetation density (NDVI) between 2005 and 2015, as well as obtaining the density of vegetation (NDVI) on each of the land cover of 2005 and 2015. The research showed the extensive of forest area of 949.65 Ha and a decline of mangrove forest area covering an area of 2,884.06 Ha. The highest vegetation density reduced 39,714.58 Ha, and rather dense increased 24,410.72 Ha between 2005 and 2015. The land cover that have the highest NDVI value range with very dense vegetation density class is the primary dry forest (0.804 to 0.876), followed by secondary dry forest (0.737 to 0.804) for 2015. In 2015 the land cover has NDVI value range the primary dry forest (0.513 to 0.57), then secondary dry forest (0.456 to 0.513) with dense vegetation density class

M3  - Article
AB  - The article attempts to capture the extent of Franc Grivec's engagement with the problems of scientifically determining Old Church Slavonic literacy. His project took into account both Slovenian participation in the historical period that saw the establishing of the so-called Slavonic liturgy (within linguistic and theological material of the Freising manuscripts) and research activities into Saints Cyril and Methodius - as well as the possibility of contact and connections between the two. The breadth of his scientific work will be denoted by means of examination into Grivec's personal manuscripts and a huge correspondence which upgrade his theological, Slavic and ecclesiastic research. In this way, it is possible to think deeper causes and motivations for Grivec's personal theological worldview.

AB  - The results of the interferometric data processing of Canadian Radarsat-2 spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquired over Tolbachik volcanic complex in summer-fall 2013 are discussed. The phase difference deviations being revealed on the interferograms may be removed in some cases using the phase screen information generated using the weather stations archival meteorological records. The corruptions caused by cloud layers' heterogeneities, variations of air refraction coefficient height profiles, and fast variations of atmosphere conditions during dusk/down are the most complicating factors because of the lack of detailed description of clouds spatial structure and atmosphere parameters. One of most unexpected effects is atmosphere heterogeneity because of mixture of illuminated and shaded areas in mountainous regions in the case of interferometric SAR observations during dusk.

AB  - In this work, we studied the properties of pigeon flight trajectories over combined cross-country and urban terrain. We considered GPS tracks of pigeons returning home from two distant sites; birds flew separately and finished at the same endpoint. Spatial analysis of flight paths and directions was used to identify "flight corridors" and regions of interest along the bird trajectories. The visual characteristics of the territories over which pigeons flew were calculated using remote sensing data from open sources. The resulting distinctive zones along flight trajectories and visual features of the landscape were compared. It was found that the "flight corridors" correspond to real objects and areas in the terrain. The results of study showed that spatial features of the terrain can be reflected in the routes of pigeon flights and it is possible to identify sets of significant objects and areas based on the data about flight paths. In the study spatial data were processed using the geographical information system QGIS.

TI  - Technetium-99m-based Radiopharmaceuticals in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Gynecologic Oncology Perspective
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
M3  - Review
AB  - Technetium (Tc-99m)-radiolabeled colloids are popular tracers used to map lymphatic vessels and regional lymph nodes (LNs). The regional LN status is a significant determinant of cancer stage and patient prognosis, and strongly influences treatment. Regional LN dissection has become a part of surgical treatment. However, not all patients with LN involvement benefit from extensive lymphadenectomy in terms of prolonged survival. Moreover, overtreatment of patients with localized disease carries the unnecessary risk of complications. It is believed that sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) allows to assess the involvement of the most representative LN of the lymphatic basin and to decide on radical LN dissection. Tc-99m is an easily available radionuclide emitting gamma rays. The value of Tc-99m for diagnostic procedures is associated with its relatively short half-life that makes it safe both for patients and medical personnel. A colloid presenting specific physical and biological properties, including optimal particle size, is a carrier for the radionuclide. When administered at the tumor site, a radiocolloid is absorbed by the lymphatics, and the first LN that it gets trapped in is referred to as the sentinel LN (SLN). The radiopharmaceutical must reach the SLN relatively quickly, but its storage within the SLN, and the radionuclide's half-life must be long enough to enable intraoperative imaging and evaluation. SLNB is currently the gold standard in breast cancer and malignant melanoma diagnosis, and is under extensive investigation in gynecological cancers. Here, we provide a historical perspective of the SLN concept and the clinical relevance of SLNB in gynecologic oncology. Moreover, we review the technical aspects of the application of Tc-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals in lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative lymphatic mapping.

AB  - Satellite imagery have always been "big" data. Array DBMS is one of the tools to streamline raster data processing. However, raster data are usually stored in files, not in databases. Respective command line tools have long been developed to process these files. Most of the tools are feature-rich and free but optimized for a single machine. The approach of partially delegating in situ raster data processing to such tools has been recently proposed. The approach includes a new formal N-d array data model to abstract from the files and the tools as well as new formal distributed algorithms based on the model. ChronosServer is a distributed array DBMS under development into which the approach is being integrated. This paper extends the approach with a new algorithm for the reshaping (tiling) of arbitrary N-d arrays onto a set of overlapping N-d arrays with a fixed shape. Cutting arrays with an overlap enables to perform a broad range of large imagery processing operations in a distributed shared-nothing fashion. Currently ChronosServer provides a rich collection of raster operations at scale and outperforms SciDB up to 80 x on Landsat data. SciDB is the only freely available distributed array DBMS to date. Experiments were carried out on 8- and 16-node clusters in Microsoft Azure Cloud.

TI  - On Statistical Approaches to Generate Level 3 Products from Satellite Remote Sensing Retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of trace gases such as carbon dioxide ( CO2) has increased our ability to observe and understand Earth's climate. However, these remote sensing data, specifically Level 2 retrievals, tend to be irregular in space and time, and hence, spatio- temporal prediction is required to infer values at any location and time point. Such inferences are not only required to answer important questions about our climate, but they are also needed for validating the satellite instrument, since Level 2 retrievals are generally not co- located with ground- based remote sensing instruments. Here, we discuss statistical approaches to construct Level 3 products from Level 2 retrievals, placing particular emphasis on the strengths and potential pitfalls when using statistical prediction in this context. Following this discussion, we use a spatio- temporal statistical modelling framework known as fixed rank kriging ( FRK) to obtain global predictions and prediction standard errors of column- averaged carbon dioxide based on Version 7r and Version 8r retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory- 2 ( OCO- 2) satellite. The FRK predictions allow us to validate statistically the Level 2 retrievals globally even though the data are at locations and at time points that do not coincide with validation data. Importantly, the validation takes into account the prediction uncertainty, which is dependent both on the temporally- varying density of observations around the ground- based measurement sites and on the spatio- temporal high- frequency components of the trace gas field that are not explicitly modelled. Here, for validation of remotely- sensed CO2 data, we use observations from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network. We demonstrate that the resulting FRK product based on Version 8r compares better with TCCON data than that based on Version 7r, in terms of both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

AB  - We propose a system for detecting clear-cuts in Sentinel-2 (S-2) images of the Indonesian forest by means of an adaptive and unsupervised multivariate Change Vector Analysis (CVA) method. By leveraging on the unique spatial and spectral characteristics of the S-2 mission, the proposed method characterizes a relevant portion of the target change as lying in a Gaussian neighborhood of the spectral stacked bi-temporal domain of the change. The processing system analyzes all the available bi-temporal pairs in the time series, enabling us to: (1) partially recovering lost information due to cloud coverage, and (2) providing a representation of the change evolving in time. The system is fully automated and potentially operational ready, so it can be used to provide accurate information about clear-cuts at the country scale in Indonesia.

T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The problems of the spread of unscientific knowledge and pseudoscience in modern Russia are considered on the basis of the discourse analysis of the struggle against pseudoscience. Necessity of developing correct theoretical bases for the separation of unscientific forms of knowledge (mysticism, esotericism) from pseudoscience as unreasonable, unreliable theories, claiming to be scientific is substantiated. It is shown that the sociocultural transformations of post-Soviet Russia and Russian academic science have undermined credibility of scientific knowledge in society. This contributes to the spread of mythological, religious, everyday knowledge, which gives answers to worldview questions of mass audiences replacing the scientific picture of the world. Necessity of researching reasons for actualization of unscientific knowledge and archaic cognitive layers of public consciousness in modern society is argued for. The latent consequence of the traditional trust of non-professional audiences towards science are the scientification of unscientific knowledge and the spread of pseudoscience, based on the authority of scientific degrees and titles. It justifies a necessity of not only criticizing unscientific forms of knowledge and exposing pseudoscience, but also revealing their latent functionality, which is the reason for their spread in society today.

AB  - A method based on the 2D Continuous Wavelet Transform has been developed and applied to 30 Sentinel-1 SAR images to retrieve the wind direction. The resulting wind directions have been compared with ECMWF model winds. The 2D-CWT method produces good direction estimates: in 90% of cases the SAR-ECMWF wind direction difference is < +/- 30%, while in 83% of cases it is < +/- 20%, with a mean direction bias of 8 degrees and a RMS error of 19 degrees. Among others, the knowledge of the wind direction is essential to retrieve the wind speed by using the radar-backscatter versus wind speed algorithms.

AB  - Image registration is used by the remote sensing community to align images for the purposes of examining changes in a scene. The application in this paper involves finding anomalies associated with human activity for the purpose of detecting underground nuclear explosions. This paper presents a non-rigid image registration algorithm that can be easily implemented using publicly available tools such as python, numpy, scipy, openCV and SIFT. SIFT is used to find feature correspondences between images. An approach based on Mahalanobis distance is used find a subset of robust correspondences. Comparisons are made to the RANSAC algorithm. The imagery was collected by DigitalGlobe's Worldview-II satellite. One image pair is orthorectified. A second image pair is only geo-registered. Both image pairs were collected over mountainous desert regions, the second image pair has much rougher terrain and presents a challenging situation. The non-rigid property of the image registration algorithm allows for robust registration in mountainous terrain under different viewing geometries. Image differencing of the PAN-chromatic band is used to find changes, some of which are shown in detail for both sets of images. Overall registration improvement is quantified by using the standard deviation of the difference image.The non-rigid warping map was also applied to the multispectral bands of the DigitalGlobe data. This dataset made use of a multivariate change detection algorithm that incorporates the spectral properties of each pixel.

TI  - Estimation of Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in the Major Urban Areas of Chongqing by Using FY-3C/MERSI
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is becoming increasingly serious with rapid economic development in China, and the primary pollutant has converted from PM10 to PM2.5, which is associated with more adverse impacts on human health. Satellite remote sensing, with help of its quantitative observations over large spatial and temporal extent, has become a significant supplement to the in situ measurements. This study exploits the aerosol optical depth (AOD) product retrieved from the Medium Resolution Spectrum Imager (MERSI) onboard Fengyun-3C satellite to estimate PM2.5 estimation over the major urban areas of Chongqing, a metropolitan city in the Southwestern China. A semi-empirical model and the linear mixed effect (LME) model are combined based on in situ observations from local air quality and meteorological networks from May 2014 to May 2015. This combined model is able to explain about 90% of the variation of the estimated PM2.5, and performs better than LME model by achieving higher correlation and smaller deviations between the satellites estimated PM2.5 and in situ measurements. Benefiting from the high resolution of 1 km x 1 km, MERSI AOD achieves much more detailed spatial distribution of ground-level PM2.5 over the major urban areas of Chongqing, compared to most of concurrent satellite products, such as the MODIS L2 AOD. According to the estimation, PM2.5 concentration is higher in cold seasons than in warm seasons in Chongqing. Peak levels of PM2.5 is found in Yuzhong District, the center of Chongqing urban area, while the concentration gradually decreases in surrounding areas, indicating that air pollution in Chongqing is highly contributed by local anthropogenic emissions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Workshop on Breast Imaging (IWBI)
CL  - Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA
AB  - Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is a prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer. Metastasis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) indicates ALN involvement. In this study, our purpose is to develop a quantitative approach in characterizing the metastasis of ALN on spectral CT using the largest SLN (LSLN) as the surrogate. With IRB approval, a data set of 185 patients with breast cancer was retrospectively collect at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital in Guangzhou, China. Each patient underwent a preoperative spectral CT scan. A chest and axillary dual-phasic contrast media enhanced scan were acquired with a GE Discovery CT750HD CT scanner while the patient was in supine position. The LSLN was manually identified by radiologists for quantitative image analysis. We used a total of 6 sets of dual-phasic scans including 40 keV monochromatic images, 70 keV monochromatic images, and gemstone spectral images obtained at arterial and venous phases. 82 patients were positive to biopsy-proven cancer metastasis and the remaining 103 were negative. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was used to extract quantitative image features as the image representation of SLN. To assess the efficacy of quantitative image features in characterization of SLN, three machine learning classifiers including KNN, SVM, and random forest were compared. Ten-fold cross validation was used for model selection. Results indicated that the AUCs on the 6 CT images for classification of LSLN metastasis ranged from 0.71-0.78 in which the best classification were observed on 70 keV monochromatic images at arterial phase. The overall classifications in arterial phase were better than those in venous phase for low (40 keV) and mixture energy setting while the findings were reversed for high (70 keV) energy setting. Future work is underway to assess our quantitative measures in axillary staging.

AB  - With the abundance of spectral information and texture information of remote sensing images, the feature variables applicable to land cover classification also increase. But the high-dimensional features will deteriorate the classifier performance. In this paper, an improved selection method was proposed by considering separability and redundancy between feature variables. The study area - You County was divided into eight land cover types based on the SPOT-5 remote sensing image in 2009 combined with the continuous inventory data of forest resources during the same period. A total of 3,921 sample plots containing classification information were selected, of which 2/3 were used as training data, 1/3 as testing data. Waveband operations and texture extraction were performed on the images and a total of four bands information, eight texture factors, and nine vegetation indices were extracted as candidate feature variables subset. Calculate the weighted average of the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance between different classes of each feature variable, as the measure of class separability, and select the variable ordered first. Then calculate the PEARSON correlation coefficient between the remaining variables and the selected variables as the measure of variables redundancy. The ratio of separability and redundancy is referred to as the improved JM distance, which is successively substituted into the Bayesian classifier in descending order. The results show that (1) From the JM distance, the spectral features are more suitable for the land cover classification in the study area than the texture features. (2) The overall classification accuracy can be improved through the feature variables selected by improved JM distance. (3) The number of feature variables using the improved JM distance to achieve stable classification accuracy is far less than traditional JM distance, which effectively reduce feature dimensions. Therefore, the improved selection method proposed in this paper not only retains the class separability but also avoids the information redundancy, and can effectively select the feature variables.

AB  - Cloud is always the weak and even uninformative area inevitably existing in the remote sensing images, and greatly limits the development of remote sensing application. Accurate and automatic detection and segmentation of clouds in satellite scenes is a key problem for the application of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) based on deep learning framework for cloud segmentation from remote sensing images. First, the obtained remote sensing image is pre-processed by using band merging and size cropping. Second the image is input into the FCN to achieve the cloud segmentation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we conduct experiments on Landsat-8 satellite dataset. The overall accuracy of our proposed method for cloud segmentation is higher than 88%. Experimental results demonstrate that both thin and thick cloud can be well segmented with higher accuracy and robustness by using our method.

AB  - Cloud is always the weak and even uninformative area inevitably existing in the remote sensing images, and greatly limits the development of remote sensing applications. Accurate and automatic detection of clouds in satellite scenes is a key problem for the application of remote sensing images. Most of the previous methods use the low-level feature of the cloud, which often generate error results especially with thin cloud or in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud detection method based on deep learning framework for remote sensing images. The designed deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which can mine the deep features of cloud consists of three convolution layers and three fully-connected layers. Using the designed network model, we can predict the probability of each image that belongs to cloud region, and then generate the cloud probability map of the image. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we test it on Landsat-8 satellite images. The overall accuracy of our proposed method for cloud detection is higher than 95%. Experimental results indicate that both thin and thick cloud can be well detected with higher accuracy and robustness using our method.

TI  - REMOTE MONITORING OF MINING SITUATION AND DISTURBED LAND ECOLOGY AT THE TEISK AND ABAGAS IRON ORE DEPOSITS
T2  - EURASIAN MINING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific research recently undertaken either in Russia or in other countries increasingly uses remote Earth sensing techniques. At the next stage of our studies, we assess ecology of disturbed land represented by open pit mines, external dumps and tailings pond in the area of depleted iron ore deposits in the Republic of Khakassia. Monitoring of vegetation ecosystem in the specified area used free-access remote sensing data.Based on the interpretation of satellite images over the monitoring period from 1998 to 2016, the change in the bold area at the depleted deposits is determined. The dynamics and structure of vegetable blanket in the open pit mines, at the dumps and tailings pond is revealed. An insignificant increase in the disturbed land area from 595 ha in 1999 to 633,3 ha in 2916 resulted in the proportional growth of the bold area of mining and dumping from 559.9 to 571.1 ha. By the end of the monitoring period in 2016, the vegetation ecosystem recovery coefficients without special reclamation of the distributed land were 0.031, 0.05 and 0.11 for the areas of the Teisk and Abagas open pit mines and the land occupied by external overburden dumps and tailings ponds, respectively.The article illustrates application of satellite survey data in solving such critical problems as environmental impact of open pit iron ore mining. By our estimates, self-recovery of two separate industrial landscapes formed under mining of the Teisk and Abagas iron ore deposits on the eastern shoulder of the Kuznetsky Alatau has very low and environmentally unacceptable rates. Such conclusion is confirmed by the determined averaged coefficient of vegetation ecosystem recovery at the very low level of 0.088, which means healing and stable vegetation cover in the area making merely 8.8% of the total disturbed land.

TI  - Temporal Dynamics of the Driving Factors of Urban Landscape Change of Addis Ababa During the Past Three Decades
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and quantifying urban landscape dynamics and the underlying driving factors are crucial for devising appropriate policies, especially in cities of developing countries where the change is rapid. This study analyzed three decades (1984-2014) of land use land cover change of Addis Ababa using Landsat imagery and examined the underlying factors and their temporal dynamics through expert interview using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Classification results revealed that urban area increased by 50%, while agricultural land and forest decreased by 34 and 16%, respectively. The driving factors operated differently during the pre and post-1991 period. The year 1991 was chosen because it marked government change in the country resulting in policy change. Policy had the highest influence during the pre-1991 period. Land use change in this period was associated with the housing sector as policies and institutional setups were permissive to this sector. Population growth and in-migration were also important factors. Economic factors played significant role in the post-1991 period. The fact that urban land has a market value, the growth of private investment, and the speculated property market were among the economic factors. Policy reforms since 2003 were also influential to the change. Others such as accessibility, demography, and neighborhood factors were a response to economic factors. All the above-mentioned factors had vital role in shaping the urban pattern of the city. These findings can help planners and policymakers to better understand the dynamic relationship of urban land use and the driving factors to better manage the city.

TI  - Comparison of Pixel- and Object-Based Approaches in Phenology-Based Rubber Plantation Mapping in Fragmented Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing expansion of rubber plantations throughout East and Southeast Asia urgently requires improved methods for effective mapping and monitoring. The phenological information from rubber plantations was found effective in rubber mapping. Previous studies have mostly applied rule-pixel-based phenology approaches for rubber plantations mapping, which might result in broken patches in fragmented landscapes. This study introduces a new paradigm by combining phenology information with object-based classification to map fragmented patches of rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna. This research first delineated the time windows of the defoliation and foliation phases of rubber plantations by acquiring the temporal profile and phenological features of rubber plantations and natural forests through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. To investigate the ability of finer resolution images at capturing the temporal profile or phenological information, 30 m resolution Landsat image data were used to capture the temporal profile, and a phenology algorithm to separate rubber plantations and natural forests was then defined. The derived phenology algorithm was used by both the object-based and pixel-based classification to investigate whether the object-based approach could improve the mapping accuracy. Whether adding the phenology information to the object-based classification could improve rubber plantation mapping accuracy in mountainous Xishuangbanna was also investigated. This resulted in three approaches: rule-pixel-based phenology, rule-object-based phenology, and nearest-neighbor-object-based phenology. The results showed that the rule-object-based phenology approaches (with overall accuracy 77.5% and Kappa Coefficients of 0.66) and nearest-neighbor-object-based phenology approach (91.0% and 0.86) achieved a higher accuracy than that of the rule-pixel-based phenology approach (72.7% and 0.59). The results proved that (1) object-based approaches could improve the accuracy of rubber plantation mapping compared to the pixel-based approach and (2) incorporating the phenological information from vegetation improved the overall accuracy of the thematic map.

AB  - China has experienced a rapid urbanization in the past several decades, and urban sprawl has induced dramatic land use and land cover (LULC) changes and raised great concerns on ecological environment. Evaluation of the influence of urbanization to the ecological environment can help us better understand urban sustainability and human activities. In this regard, in this paper, we carry out an integrated research to explore the urbanization patterns in a typical area, the western part of Tiaoxi Basin, Zhejiang Province, China, in period 1995-2014, and its feedbacks to agricultural production and local environment. This research is based on the time series of land use mapping with Landsat images, utilizing an object-based image analysis method by taking full advantage of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) technologies. We developed a new environmental evaluation index (EEI) based on the vegetation cover area (VCA) and water cover area (WCA), derived from the land use maps, to monitor the change of local environmental quality. This study witnessed large land cover changes induced by a rapid urban sprawl in period 1995-2014. The urban area of 2014 increased to more than three times of that of 1995, after 20 years' high speed urbanization. As a result, a large amounts of farmland were occupied, which greatly affected the agricultural production. However, fortunately, the local environment was not affected much by rapid urbanization and was not obviously degraded in period 1995-2014. The EEI changed little with few natural habitats reduction during the period relative to vegetation and water, which was different from many cases in China and other developing countries.

TI  - Sustainable Strategy: Comprehensive Computational Approach for Wind Path Planning in Dense Urban Area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that assesses the urban heat environment and formulates urban wind paths. Compared with other ecosystems, the wind environment and heat environment in urban areas can be much more complicated and dynamic. Nonetheless, it is of great concern considering the agglomerated population and industries at stake. Hence, multiple computational techniques are developed to assess the contemporary heat environment, and to formulate feasible policies to improve it to a more liveable state by introducing the solution of natural wind. Three key factors are considered: solar radiation, which is the major source of heat; wind direction and wind speed, which transports heat in space; and urban land surface, which may affect radiation reflection, contain auxiliary heat sources or cause vertical air flow. Hence, mesoscale meteorological data are applied to provide information about solar radiation, and are used for simulating local wind flow; Landsat images can be translated into land surface temperature figures; and building and land use databases provide information about built-up features. These combined, the local heat environment in urban areas can be mapped and monitored in a periodic fashion, with wind path analysis providing possibilities in cooling down the hotspots. Practices in cities including Fuzhou and Wuhan have proved constructive, with some others still underway.

AB  - Satellite observations are affected by clouds, aerosol and other factors, resulting in temporal discontinuities and spatial incompleteness in leaf area index (LAI) products. Furthermore, the currently available LAI products are generally retrieved from mono-temporal remote sensing data acquired by a single sensor, without comprehensive utilization of multi-source satellite observations. This paper proposes a new data assimilation method to retrieve temporally continuous LAI at different spatial scales from time-series multi-source remote sensing data with different spatial resolutions using an ensemble multiscale tree model (EnMsT). A dynamic model was constructed to describe the change rule of LAI in time series. At each time-step, the forecast of LAI from the dynamic model was used to construct an initial EnMsT. Then, satellite surface reflectance data with different spatial resolutions were used to update the LAI at each node of the EnMsT using an ensemble multiscale filter (EnMsF) technique. The final results demonstrate that this new method can estimate temporally continuous LAI at different spatial scales and the retrieved LAI values are in good agreement with the field measurements.

T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series remote sensing data have been found very useful in discriminating crops due to its temporal character that map the whole stages of crops. In order to analyze their performances, a range of different time series i.e. 16-day, 32-day, 48-day and 64-day interval was built from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 250-m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. These times series were used to discriminate five crops i-e alfalfa, corn, sorghum, soybean and winter wheat in the United State, Kansas in 2010. The time series data were used to test the discriminating ability of different classifiers like Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Minimum Distance (MD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF) for crop classification. The results showed that the high temporal resolution time series returned high classification accuracy and vice versa. The results comparison showed that RF classifier returned high accuracy (overall accuracy 92.61%) followed by SVM and Neural Network. However, minimum distance and MLC returned low accuracy showing their less adoptability towards different time series data. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Delaware Basin, an evaporite sequence spanning west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is well known for the mining of potassium salts, known as potash. Several companies operate mines in the region, primarily using room-and-pillar techniques. However, the region's karst topography is prone to ground subsidence and sinkhole development when triggered by anthropogenic activities. We explored a region of significant ground subsidence encompassing a potash mine. Incorporating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the advanced land-observing satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A sensors, we used interferometric SAR techniques to detect a significant amount of subsidence located in several distinct areas from 2007 to 2011 and from January to November 2016. To investigate the origin of this subsidence, we considered potash mining by analysing the mine operator's production records. We observed a strong correlation between the total subsidence rate in our area and the potash production rate during 2007-2011. Furthermore, we observed a considerable amount of continuous subsidence during 2016, despite the mine operator suspending potash production on 6 May 2016. As such, the observed subsidence could result in deleterious consequences throughout the region if further action is not taken.

AB  - The last two decades have witnessed a dramatic development of the satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology in both the theoretical methods and operational platforms. The propagation errors of SAR signal in the ionosphere is one of the problematic issues for the low-frequency SAR systems, such as L-band and P-band, and can also seriously degrade the accuracy of InSAR. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the range split-spectrum method for the ionopheric correction after some critical issues are resolved. In this study, we used the ultra-fine observation mode (80 MHz) of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) phased array-type L-band synthetic aperture radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data over the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake to evaluate the performance of an asymmetric split-spectrum method for the ionospheric correction. The presented works demonstrate the effectiveness of two types of the asymmetric split-spectrum method for mitigating the ionospheric artifact in InSAR, as compared with the conventional split-spectrum method. Additionally, this study provides practical insight into the ionospheric correction strategies of the scheduled NASA-ISRO synthetic aperture radar (NISAR) mission.

TI  - Quantification of sawgrass marsh aboveground biomass in the coastal Everglades using object-based ensemble analysis and Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale biomass quantification of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) marsh is critical to understand the carbon and energy cycle in the Florida Everglades. There is also a need to monitor biomass changes in the coastal Everglades due to continuing sea level rise. Previous research in biomass estimation of coastal marshes has focused on pixel-based parametric modeling methods. In this study, an object-based ensemble analysis approach was developed to map sawgrass biomass at multiple scales using Landsat data. Four machine learning regression algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were evaluated and compared to the commonly used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method for both live and total sawgrass biomass estimation. A weighted combining scheme was developed to integrate predictions from comparable models for ensemble analysis. Nonparametric machine learning models had better performance than the parametric approach. ANN and SVM produced similar results in live biomass estimation with the correlation coefficient (r) larger than 0.9, while ANN achieved the best result for the total biomass estimation (r = 0.94). Sawgrass biomass maps were produced for two harvest seasons in 2014 and 2016 at three detail levels, which successfully revealed the spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) sawgrass biomass variations. Ensemble analysis of the ANN and SVM predictions of live sawgrass biomass not only made the estimation more reliable, but also generated an uncertainty map to identify the regions with a robust biomass prediction, as well as challenging areas for biomass quantification. It is concluded that the object-based ensemble analysis is a promising alternative to the commonly used pixel-based biomass modeling techniques.

TI  - Retrieving Leaf and Canopy Water Content of Winter Wheat Using Vegetation Water Indices
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the capability of spectral indices for estimating winter wheat leaf and canopy water content using radiative transfermodeling and field measurements. An irrigation treatment experiment was conducted to investigate response of crop growth to water supply in 2014 and 2015. Plant sampling and canopy spectral reflectance were measured in the two growing seasons. The main goal was to evaluate the potential of selected spectral indices formulated with the Sentinel-2 bands for winter wheat water status assessment. A global sensitivity analysis using reflectance simulated by the PROSPECT-5 and SAILH models showed that leaf water contributed the most to the variation of spectral water indices derived from leaf reflectance but had reduced contribution when the indices were derived from canopy reflectance. Correlation between canopy water content (C-w,C- C) and canopy spectral water indices was significant, although it was impacted by canopy structural descriptors such as the leaf inclination angle and the leaf area index. Satisfactory estimation of (w, C) could be achieved using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) (R-2 = 0.68, RMSEcv = 0.148 kg.m(-2), and n = 463). The estimated C-w,C- C at the jointing stage was significantly correlated with grain yield. A map of C-w,C- C was generated from Sentinel-2 image acquired on March 30, 2016, showing spatial variation of winter wheat canopy water status comparable with the drought indicators reported by the Meteorological Bureau at the regional scale. It also showed variations at the field scale. Hence, there is a great potential to use the NDWI derived from Sentinel-2 data for detecting crop response to water stress and provide support to irrigation decision.

AB  - Paddy rice serves as one of the most important crop food globally. The spatial distribution of paddy rice fields plays a fundamental role in describing the rural landscapes, and the precise location and extent of paddy rice fields are of key importance to analyze the subsequent resource allocation, rice yield prediction, and food security. Paddy rice has a distinct character relative to other crops in that the paddy fields need flooding during the initial period of rice seeds preparing and rice transplanting. In order to map paddy rice, remote sensing techniques have long been used to extract and monitor rice crops. Throughout many approaches, phenology-based paddy rice mapping algorithms have been introduced and tested in coarser remote sensing images such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and Landsat images. However, the average size of paddy rice fields is commonly smaller than 0.09 ha (e.g., the area of a Landsat pixel). Therefore, a large number of mixed pixels exist, which leads to misclassification. Meanwhile, the phenological indicators used in the previous studies such as LSWI (Land Surface Water Index), and MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) are not feasible to detect the land surface water content at the initial stage of paddy rice seeds preparation and transplanting. Therefore, this study first proposes a new index PMI (Perpendicular Moisture Index) to identify the irrigation in paddy rice fields, and then combines other Vegetation Indices to map paddy rice in Jianghan Plain using time stacks of Sentinel-2 imagery. The results indicates that the proposed PMI can be effectively used as phenological indicator for paddy rice mapping and the Sentinel-2 images provide more detailed spatial distributions. The accuracy assessment suggests that our method has a high accuracy with Overall Accuracy (>97%) and Kappa (>93%).This study suggests that the Sentinel-based automated paddy rice mapping algorithm could potentially and effectively be applied at large spatial scales to monitor paddy rice agriculture.

AB  - Snowfall as an important global freshwater resource, especially for Xinjiang Altai region in the snow all the year round, accurate and convenient snow thickness monitoring is particularly important, at present, the snow monitoring is divided into the time and space analysis of the macro snow cover and the micro snow depth monitoring. Macro monitoring are mainly composed of MODIS snow product, the micro snow depth monitoring from use of discrete meteorological point monitoring initially, laser detection, with the development of technology, satellite remote sensing monitoring has become the main trend. With the development of technology, satellite remote sensing monitoring has become a major trend. With the continuous improvement of GPS-MR snow remote sensing theory in recent years, in this paper, Altay GPS monitoring station as a demonstration using GPS-MR technology for snow monitoring research. Using the monitoring data from January 1 to March 31, 2017 for statistical analysis. The selection of satellite height Angle increase, due to the multipath effect will gradually reduce with the increase of altitude Angle, higher SNR ratio will lead to the inversion precision is decreased obviously. GPS data sampling rate has little effect on the inversion accuracy. Based on Altay GPS snow monitoring experimental station, Satellite elevation angle selection 5 degrees-20 degrees, the sampling rate is set to 15 s, the GPS-MR snow depth obtained is better than 0.027 m. Therefore, it is possible to make full use of the ground-based GNSS water vapor monitoring station for snow depth detection, GNSS remote sensing application potential will be brought into full play in the future environmental meteorological monitoring in our country.

AB  - People in Huaihe River Basin and Shanghai have been suffering from severe air pollution of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide due to the development of heavy industry. Traditional ambient monitoring station measurements can provide real-time accurate data, but it is limited due to the less number of monitoring sites. Satellite observation data from remote sensing can provide a wide range opollutants concentrations in long-time sequence. Top-down approaches based on satellite data can be effectively applied to estimate the ground concentrations of pollutants. In this paper, the tropospheric pollutants columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument(OMI) were used to analyse the seasonal variation of NO2 and SO2 in 2015. Moreover, the ground-level NO2 and SO2 concentrations of the Huaihe River Basin and Shanghai at this time were estimated by the data and meteorological data. The results show that: the concentrations of NO2 and SO2 are highest in winter, and high-value areas are mainly located in Shandong and Northern Henan. Estimating the ground-level NO2 and SO2 concentrations based on satellite observations is reliable with the validation R-2 0.48 and 0.47 respectively. Finally, The spatial distribution of satellite-derived annual mean NO2 and SO2 has a similar characteristics to the satellite columns.

AB  - There is no pansharpening method that can be applied to all kinds of images at present due to the principle of fusion processing and the characteristics of sensors that acquire images. In order to explore the suitable fusion method for the "Gaofen-2" satellite image, PCA, HPF, Gram-Schmidt and NNDiffuse four kinds of fusion methods were selected to merge the panchromatic and multi spectral data of Gaofen-2 satellite images, the fusion results of the image were synthetically compared and evaluated with subjective evaluation and quantitative analysis. The test results show that the NNDiffuse transform method has the best combination effect and is very prominent in the fusion effect of the visible light band; And in the fusion of near-infrared band, Gram-Schmidt method can be considered. The research results of this paper can provide reference for the fusion processing and application of Gaofen-2 satellite image data.

TI  - A simple automated dynamic threshold extraction method for the classification of large water bodies from landsat-8 OLI water index images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional manual methods of extracting water bodies from remote sensing images cannot satisfy the requirements for mass processing of remote sensing data, and new automated methods are complicated and require a large amount of auxiliary data. The histogram bimodal method is a frequently used objective tool for threshold selection in image segmentation. However, automatically calculating the threshold is difficult because of complex surfaces and image noise, which lead to imperfect twin peaks. To overcome these difficulties, we developed an operational automated water extraction method. This method does not require the identification of twin histogram peaks but instead seeks minimum values in the threshold range to achieve an automated dynamic threshold. We calibrated the method for 18 lakes in China using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images, for which the relative error (RE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) for threshold accuracy were 2.1% and 0.96, respectively. The RE of area accuracy was 0.59%. The advantages of the method lie in its simplicity and minimal requirements for auxiliary data while still achieving an accuracy comparable to that of other automatic water extraction methods. It can be applied to mass remote sensing data to calculate water thresholds and automatically extract large water bodies.

TI  - Correction of Pushbroom Satellite Imagery Interior Distortions Independent of Ground Control Points
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compensating for distortions in pushbroom satellite imagery has a bearing on subsequent earth observation applications. Traditional distortion correction methods usually depend on ground control points (GCPs) acquired from a high-accuracy geometric calibration field (GCF). Due to the high construction costs and site constraints of GCF, it is difficult to perform distortion detection regularly. To solve this problem, distortion detection methods without using GCPs have been proposed, but their application is restricted by rigorous conditions, such as demanding a large amount of calculation or good satellite agility which are not met by most remote sensing satellites. This paper proposes a novel method to correct interior distortions of satellite imagery independent of GCPs. First, a classic geometric calibration method for pushbroom satellite is built and at least three images with overlapping areas are collected, then the forward intersection residual between corresponding points in the images are used to calculate interior distortions. Experiments using the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide-field view-1 (WFV-1) sensor demonstrate that the proposed method can increase the level of orientation accuracy from several pixels to within one pixel, thereby almost eliminating interior distortions. Compared with the orientation accuracy by classic GCF method, there exists maximum difference of approximately 0.4 pixel, and the reasons for this discrepancy are analyzed. Generally, this method could be a supplementary method to conventional methods to detect and correct the interior distortion.

T2  - Sichuan Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - The migration of subadult Egretta eulophotes was studied by using satellite tracking during June in 2016 at Fantuozi island, Dalian city, Liaoning province. A total of 13 transmitters were installed on the subadult E. eulophotes, and the full domestic data were collected from only 5 transmitters with loss rate of 61. 54% . The result showed that the subadult E. eulophotes started migrating in the end of July and the beginning of August. There were 2 main migratory routes, and one of which was the coastal migration route along the coastline of China and the west of North Korea. The important stopover sites were the coastal wetlands and the islands of southern Dalian, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guang-dong, Hong Kong and Hainan. Another migratory route was along the inland of China, and the important stopover sites were Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi and Yunnan. Especially, Xinyang city ( Henan province) and Wanfeng Lake ( Xingyi city, Guizhou province) were identified as 2 new stopover sites of E. eulophotes. In addition, the absence reasons of returning satellite data in 2017 in China were analyzed.

TI  - Vicarious Radiometric Calibration of the Hyperspectral Imaging Microsatellites SPARK-01 and-02 over Dunhuang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two wide-swath hyperspectral imaging microsatellites, SPARK-01 and -02, were launched on 22 December 2016. Radiometric calibration coefficients were determined for these two satellites via a calibration experiment performed from the end of February to the beginning of March 2017 at the high-altitude, homogenous Dunhuang calibration site in the Gobi Desert in China. In-situ measurements, including ground reflectance, direct transmittance, diffuse-to-global irradiance ratio, and radiosonde vertical profile, were acquired. A unique relative calibration procedure was developed using actual satellite images. This procedure included dark current computation and non-uniform correction processes. The former was computed by averaging multiple lines of long strip imagery acquired over open oceans during nighttime, while the latter was computed using images acquired after the adjustment of the satellite yaw angle to 90 degrees. This technique was shown to be suitable for large-swath satellite image relative calibration. After relative calibration, reflectance, irradiance, and improved irradiance-based methods were used to conduct absolute radiometric calibrations in order to predict the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance. The SPARK-01 and -02 satellites passed over the calibration site on 7 March and 28 February 2017, during which time fair and non-ideal weather occurred, respectively. Thus, the SPARK-01 calibration coefficient was derived using reflectance- and irradiance-based methods, while that of SPARK -02 was derived using reflectance- and improved irradiance-based methods. The sources of calibration uncertainty, which include aerosol-type assumptions, transmittance measurements, water vapor content retrieval, spectral wavelength shift and satellite image misregistration, were explored in detail for different calibration methods. Using the reflectance and irradiance-based methods, the total uncertainty for SPARK-01 was estimated to be 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively, in the <1000 nm spectral range. For SPARK-02, total uncertainties of 8.1% and of 5.9% were estimated using the reflectance- and improved irradiance-based methods, respectively. The calibration methods were also verified using MODIS images, which confirmed that the calibration accuracies were within the expected range. These in-situ measurements, analyses, and results provide a basis for in-orbit radiometric calibration of the SPARK-01 and -02 satellites. These experiments strongly support the use of diffuse-to-global ratio measurements in in-situ vicarious calibration experiments and the addition of spectrally continuous measurements for direct transmittance, which is important for hyperspectral satellite sensors.

TI  - Accurate Star Centroid Detection for the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager of Fengyun-4A
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Star observation can be used for the image navigation of certain instruments aboard the three-axis stabilized geostationary satellites. How to extract the accurate star centroids in the observed star images is one of the key problems. In this paper, a high precision star centroid detection method is proposed for the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI) of Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), the first experimental satellite of the new generation of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellites FY-4 series. Different from star sensors which are deliberately defocused with relatively large star spot, AGRI is focused for the purpose of earth observation, making it challenging to extract accurate star centroids. To solve the problem, we take the advantage of continuous observing and improve the precision of star centroiding by trajectory fitting and energy response curve fitting. Extensive experiments have been performed on simulated star images and the actual observation data of AGRI aboard FY-4A over ten months in-orbit tests. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract star centroids with the error less than 0.3 pixels, laying a solid foundation for image navigation of FY-4A.

AB  - In this paper, a novel solution is introduced for accurate sub-pixel star centroiding of the focused geostationary Earth observing sensor on a three-axis stabilized satellite. Lambda small 2-dimensional array is utilized to better capture the star spot than the linear array of detectors. The popular center of mass method is used to compute star centroid in a single frame. Then the subpixel accuracy of star centroiding can be improved by fitting the linear trajectory of the observed star according to exact imaging time produced from time awarding system of the satellite. Experimental results on simulated star images in various conditions validate the effectiveness and robustness of our star centroiding method.

TI  - An Accelerated Backprojection Algorithm for Monostatic and Bistatic SAR Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The backprojection (BP) algorithm has been applied to every SAR mode due to its great focusing quality and adaptability. However, the BP algorithm suffers from immense computational complexity. To improve the efficiency of the conventional BP algorithm, several fast BP (FBP) algorithms, such as the fast factorization BP (FFBP) and Block_FFBP, have been developed in recent studies. In the derivation of Block_FFBP, range data are divided into blocks, and the upsampling process is performed using an interpolation kernel instead of a fast Fourier transform (FFT), which reduces the processing efficiency. To circumvent these limitations, an accelerated BP algorithm based on Block_FFBP is proposed. In this algorithm, a fixed number of pivots rather than the beam centers is applied to construct the relationship of the propagation time delay between the new and old subapertures. Partition in the range dimension is avoided, and the range data are processed as a bulk. This accelerated BP algorithm benefits from the integrated range processing scheme and is extended to bistatic SAR processing. In this sense, the proposed algorithm can be referred to simply as MoBulk_FFBP for the monostatic SAR case and BiBulk_FFBP for the bistatic SAR case. Furthermore, for monostatic and azimuth-invariant bistatic SAR cases where the platform runs along a straight trajectory, the slant range mapping can be expressed in a continuous and analytical form. Real data from the spaceborne/stationary bistatic SAR experiment with TerraSAR-X operating in the staring spotlight mode and from the airborne spotlight SAR experiment acquired in 2016 are used to validate the performances of BiBulk_FFBP and MoBulk_FFBP, respectively.

TI  - A magnitude weighting process for bistatic SAR digital beamforming implementation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital beamforming (DBF) technology splits the receiving antenna into multiple sub-apertures, which makes a promising candidate for imaging with a wide swath and high gain. Combining bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) configuration with DBF technology provides more flexibility in designing microwave remote sensing missions, and which leads to a new bistatic SAR digital beamforming (BiSAR-DBF) approach. In this paper, a BiSAR-DBF implementation with magnitude weighting process is proposed. The effect of spatially variant heights and the corresponding modification are also analyzed. In the DBF experiment based on spaceborne-stationary bistatic configuration with TerraSAR-X as an illuminator has been successfully conducted in June 2013 by the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Using the proposed method, the signal-to-noise (SNR) of BiSAR imagery is greatly improved.

AB  - Changes in water storage of the lakes at the Tibetan Plateau are regarded as one of the most critical indicators of regional hydrological response to climate change. Different to the conventional hydrological approaches, in this study, we investigate the storage change of four lakes basing on a conceptual lake storage model and the most recent (2001-2016) available satellite observation that cover the lakes. The water surface areas and water levels are derived from MODIS and LEGOS altimetry data, respectively. Based on the regression function between water level and lake area, the net water budgets of the four lakes are estimated for the period. The results show that the storage of Ziling Co rose the fastest at the rate of 8.24 billion m(3)/a in the past decades, and the rising rate of Qinghai lake has also reached 4.5billion m(3)/a. The Ngoring Lake which located in the same region with Qinghai Lake changed fluctuatingly, but the water storage has risen 4.9 billion m(3) from 2001 to 2016. The water storage of Dogaicoring QC increased steadily at the rate of 1.2 billion m(3)/a.

TI  - Clinical risk analysis of non-visualized sentinel lymph node in breast cancer
T2  - CANCER BIOMARKERS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the positive rate of non-visualized sentinel lymph nodes (non-vSLN) [1] in breast cancer (BC) patients and the discrepancy of non-vSLN among different molecular subtypes, in order to further evaluate the clinical risk of non-vSLNs.METHODS: A total of 627 patients were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were pathologically confirmed with invasive breast cancer and underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Various factors were compared using chi-square test. The positive rate of SLNs between non-vSLNs and visible sentinel lymph nodes (vSLNs) were compared. Moreover, factors that influenced the prognosis, such as ER, PR, HER-2, histological grade and lymph node metastasis were compared between these two groups.RESULTS: Among the 627 patients who underwent SLNB, 196 patients had non-vSLNs, accounting for 31.26% (196/627) and 113 patients had positive SLNs, accounting for 18.02% (113/627). Furthermore, 40.71% (46/113) of patients with positive SLNs had non-vSLN, and 17.39% (8/46) of patients with non-vSLN had HER-2+BC. In contrast, 35.82% (24/67) of patients with vSLNs had HER-2+BC. Moreover, 23.91% (11/46) of patients with non-vSLN and 5.97% (4/67) of patients with vSLNs had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The metastasis rate was 41.30% (19/46) in the non-vSLN group and 43.28% (29/67) in the vSLN group. The difference in the rate of positive SLNs between the non-vSLN and the vSLN groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05), in which the positive rate of SLNs in the non-vSLN group was remarkably higher than that in the vSLN group. The differences in the proportion of HER-2+BC and TNBC between the non-vSLN and the vSLN groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05), in which HER-2+BCwas evidently higher in the vSLN group than in the non-vSLN group. Meanwhile, TNBC was markedly higher in non-vSLN group than in the vSLN group. Furthermore, differences in Luminal A subtype, Luminal B subtype and non-SLN metastasis between these two groups was not statistically significant. In addition, the difference in non-SLN metastasis rate was not statistically significant among breast cancers of different molecular subtypes and between the non-vSLN and the vSLN groups.CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients with positive non-vSLNs are more likely to have a TNBC subtype relative to patients with positive vSLN. Breast cancer patients with non-vSLN have higher positive rate of SLNs. The non-SLN metastasis rate in positive SLN patients was not correlated to the molecular subtype of breast cancer.

AB  - Fog detection has becomes more and more important in recent years, real-time monitoring information is very beneficial for people to arrange production and life. In this paper, based on meterological satellite data (Himawari-8 standard data, HSD8), Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to detect fog. Since HSD8 consists of 16 channels, the original CNN is extended to multiple channels for HSD8. Multiple Channels CNN (MCCNN) can make the full exploitation of spatial and spectral information effectively. A dataset is created from Anhui Area which consists of ground station data and grid data. Different image sizes and convolutional kernels are used to validate the proposed methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 91.87% accuracy.

TI  - Simultaneous Spectral-Spatial Feature Selection and Extraction for Hyperspectral Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In hyperspectral remote sensing data mining, it is important to take into account of both spectral and spatial information, such as the spectral signature, texture feature, and morphological property, to improve the performances, e.g., the image classification accuracy. In a feature representation point of view, a nature approach to handle this situation is to concatenate the spectral and spatial features into a single but high dimensional vector and then apply a certain dimension reduction technique directly on that concatenated vector before feed it into the subsequent classifier. However, multiple features from various domains definitely have different physical meanings and statistical properties, and thus such concatenation has not efficiently explore the complementary properties among different features, which should benefit for boost the feature discriminability. Furthermore, it is also difficult to interpret the transformed results of the concatenated vector. Consequently, finding a physically meaningful consensus low dimensional feature representation of original multiple features is still a challenging task. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel feature learning framework, i.e., the simultaneous spectral-spatial feature selection and extraction algorithm, for hyperspectral images spectral-spatial feature representation and classification. Specifically, the proposed method learns a latent low dimensional subspace by projecting the spectral-spatial feature into a common feature space, where the complementary information has been effectively exploited, and simultaneously, only the most significant original features have been transformed. Encouraging experimental results on three public available hyperspectral remote sensing datasets confirm that our proposed method is effective and efficient.

AB  - Due to China's fast urban expansion rate, many scholars have used various data to study the expansion dynamics of urban construction land in China. As a new data source, night light remote sensing data are more suitable for the background of rapid urbanization in China, however, current methods to extract urban construction land from night light data still have certain disadvantages. This study proposed a new method to extract urban construction land from night light data, extracted the urban construction land in Jiangsu Province during the period 2000-2013, and made temporal-spatial analyses of the results. The proposed new method to extract urban construction land from night light data proved to be feasible, and it overcame certain disadvantages of current methods. The analyses revealed that urban construction land in Jiangsu Province expanded rapidly from 2000 to 2013, but the expansion speed slowed down after 2003. And the expansions mainly took place in the southern part of Jiangsu Province, especially in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou.

TI  - An automated method for glacial lake mapping in High Mountain Asia using Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) are sensitive to global warming and can result in much more severe flood disasters than some largesized lakes. An accurate and robust method for the extraction of glacial lakes is critical to effective management of these natural water resources. Conventional methods often have limitations in terms of low spectral contrast and heterogeneous backgrounds in an image. This study presents a robust and automated method for the yearly mapping of glacial lake over a large scale, which took advantage of the complementarity between the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and the nonlocal active contour model, required only local homogeneity in reflectance features of lake. The cloud computing approach with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to process the intensive amount of Landsat 8 images from 2015 (344 path/rows and approximately 7504 scenes). The experimental results were validated by very high resolution images from Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1) panchromatic multi-spectral (PMS) and appeared a general good agreement. This is the first time that information regarding the spatial distribution of glacial lakes over the HMA has been derived automatically within quite a short period of time. By integrating it with the relevant indices, it can also be applied to detect other land cover types such as snow or vegetation with improved accuracy.

CP  - 10th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS)

AB  - Currently, how to efficiently exploit useful information from multi-source remote sensing data for better Earth observation becomes an interesting but challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an collaborative classification framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data via image-to-image convolutional neural network (CNN). There is an image-to-image mapping, learning a representation from input source (i.e., HSI) to output source (i.e., LIDAR). Then, the extracted features are expected to own characteristics of both HSI and LIDAR data, and the collaborative classification is implemented by integrating hidden layers of the deep CNN. Experimental results on two real remote sensing data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - Large-scale high-quality, standardized, measurable and accurate data is the key to promote the progress of the algorithm in the radar remote sensing. Data scaling is a widespread technology that increases the size of a labeled training set dataset through specific data transformations. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image simulators based on computer-aided mapping models play an important role in SAR applications such as automatic target recognition and image interpretation, but the accuracy of this simulator is due to geometric errors and simplification of electromagnetic calculations. In order to achieve a SAR image datasets with the known target and azimuth angles, we can generate the desired image directly from a known image database. We can realize the augmentation of SAR image data set through linear synthesis and Generative Adversarial Networks, which can generate SAR images for the specified azimuth.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Hyperspectral GCAS Airborne Measurements Over the North Atlantic Ocean and Louisiana Shelf
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events Airborne Simulator (GCAS) instrument has been used as a precursor for a hyperspectral instrument on the future geostationary satellite, yet its ability to "measure" ocean reflectance needs to be evaluated. Here, we demonstrate its capacity through vicarious calibration and atmospheric correction of data collected during flight campaigns over the Louisiana shelf in September 2013 and over the North Atlantic Ocean in November 2015. GCAS-measured at-sensor radiance was first vicariously calibrated using concurrent measurements by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and radiative transfer simulations with the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN). Then, atmospheric correction has been implemented using MODTRAN-developed lookup tables and the traditional Gordon and Wang "black pixel" approach but with nonzero water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared accounted for through iteration. The atmospheric correction algorithm was applied to the vicariously calibrated GCAS imagery, with resulting R-rs compared with concurrent MODIS R-rs and in situ R-rs. The comparison shows a mean relative difference of about 25% (N = 11) between GCAS and in situ R-rs in the blue-green bands for clear to moderately turbid waters.

T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a back-propagation neural network model (BP model) was developed with the aim of predicting the sea ice spatial evolution in Liaodong Bay. In addition to air temperature and wind speed, two new variables wind direction and wind duration were used to train the BP model. Validation of the BP model with measurements showed that the BP model can effectively predict the spatial evolution of sea ice. The sensitivity studies indicated that wind direction and wind duration can obviously improve the prediction accuracy of sea ice edge in heavy ice years. Moreover, the BP model was easy to set up as it only used four yearlong periods, 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2009-2010, and the results were not very sensitive to the training dates over the four years. The BP model results were not very sensitive to the training algorithms as well. By comparison with a least-square-based method (LSM), the BP model clearly outperformed the LSM during the period of ice melt with nonlinear characteristics caused by the frequent appearance of cold waves. Furthermore, the BP model had a higher accuracy in estimating the spatial evolution of sea ice compared with a logit model, especially for the ice edge, which is more easily affected by the complex ocean environment.

AB  - Different application conditions applied for different models used in satellite-based terrestrial latent heat estimation. Therefore, great uncertainties exist in large-scale application of such methods. BMA fusion algorithm, which has combined three commonly used models (including Penman Monteith LE algorithm, Priestly-Taylor LE algorithm and Semi-empirical Penman LE algorithm), is then carried out in this study. It can effectively reduce the uncertainty and improve the accuracy of terrestrial latent heat estimation comparing with single algorithm itself after testing with 190 eddy covariance tower site data (Fluxnet site data). The error of mean square root (RMSE) has decreased by 5W/m(2) and the value of average correlation coefficient (R-2) has increased by 0.05 for most of observation points in this test. The fusion model has applied in China to carry out a monthly-based latent heat estimation and mapping for data achieved from 1989 to 2006. The estimation result, after analyzed quantitatively, returns sound precision and stability, which can make up the shortage of current latent heat products. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution analysis shows that: latent heat spatial distribution is the combined contribution of temperature, precipitation and vegetation together. The temporal distribution of latent heat has obvious seasonal characteristic, which is low in winter and high in summer. The latent heat value is declined by 0.07 W/m(2) per year for past 18 years.

AB  - In this paper, a unified spatial-temporal-spectral framework of missing information reconstruction in remote sensing images is proposed. Based on an end-to-end non-linear mapping structure, the proposed method employs a unified deep convolutional neural network combined with joint spatial-temporal-spectral supplementary information. It should be noted that the proposed model can use multisource data (spatial, spectral, and temporal) as the input of the unified framework. The results of real-data experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits high effectiveness in missing information reconstruction tasks like dead lines in Aqua MODIS band 6, Landsat ETM+ SLC-off and thick cloud removal.

AB  - In this paper, we firstly analyze some disadvantages in current spaceborne synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Because the traditional processing pattern of "satellite data acquisition-ground station receiving and processing-data distribution-professional application" can't satisfy the time effective flexible requirements of environment and disaster emergency response monitoring, this paper proposes the concept of "intelligent sensing high resolution spaceborne SAR system", design the system framework with intelligent remote sensing and onboard real-time data processing ability, which consists five modules: (1) afore-looking pre-judgment module for space electromagnetic environment and observation scene; (2) an adaptive transmitted signal formation module; (3) an adaptive antenna reconfiguration module; (4) an adaptive returns data sampling module; (5) an onboard real-time data processing and analysis module. It also introduces the work process flow involved. Then, we conclude four key technologies, they are: (1) observation scene afore-looking pre-judgment technology; (2) adaptive SAR payload parameter setting technology; (3) adaptive transmitted signal formation technology; (4) onboard real-time data processing and information generation technology.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sliding spotlight work mode can achieve high resolutions and wide swath (HRWS) simultaneously by steering the radar antenna beam. This paper aims to obtain well focused images using sliding spotlight mode with the Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR sensor. We proposed an integrated imaging scheme with sliding spotlight echoes. In the imaging scheme, the two-step approach is applied to the spaceborne sliding spotlight SAR imaging algorithm, followed by the Doppler parameter estimation algorithm. The azimuth spectral folding phenomenon is overcome by the two-step approach. The results demonstrate a high Doppler parameter estimation accuracy. The proposed imaging process is accurate and highly efficient for sliding spotlight SAR mode.

AB  - With the background of global change, forests are a significant resource for economic activities. In order to investigate the spatial characteristics and heterogeneity in the pattern and dynamic of forests, the forests ecosystem pattern in 1990, 2000, 2015 were rebuilt based on satellite images from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI. Results indicated that forests in Liaoning Province, China, during 1990 to 2015 was observed to be 61885.9, 61617.7, and 61783.8 thousand square kilometers, respectively. Most of the disappeared forests were converted to cropland. Based on the changing trends of forest, climate, and human factors, human activities were the leading driving forces for the losses of forest.

TI  - Development of S-NPP VIIRS global surface type classification map using support vector machines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)/Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite in October 2011, many of the terrestrial remote sensing products generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), such as the global land cover map, have been inherited and expanded into the JPSS/S-NPP mission using the new Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. In this study, an improved algorithm including the use of a new classifier support vector machines (SVM) classifier was proposed to produce VIIRS surface type maps. In addition to the new classification algorithm, a new post-processing strategy involving the use of new ancillary data to refine the classification output is implemented. As a result, the new global International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) map based on the 2014 VIIRS surface reflectance data was generated with a 78.5 +/- 0.6% overall classification accuracy. The new map was compared to a previously delivered VIIRS surface type map, and to the MODIS land cover product. Validation results including the error matrix, overall accuracy, and the user's and producer's accuracy suggest the new global surface type map provides similar classification accuracy compared to the old VIIRS surface type map, with higher accuracy achieved in agricultural types.

TI  - Single Image Thin Cloud Removal for Remote Sensing Images Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets
T2  - TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING (ICDIP 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Conference on Digital Image Processing (ICDIP)
CL  - E China Normal Univ, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Remote sensing images play a critical role in modern Earth Observation missions, but the interpretations of remote sensing images are easily to be obstructed by the existence of cloud and haze. In this paper, a novel end-to-end generative Single-image thin Cloud and haze Removal Network, referred to as SCR-net, is proposed. The designed SCR-net is a generative model based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (C-GANs), which uses a generator network G to learn the conditional distribution of the cloud-free data and a multi-scale discriminator D to distinguish between real and fake images. Through supervised training, the generator G can predict a cloud-free image using the input noise and a cloud-contaminated image of the same spot. An adversarial minimax objective is used to drive G to learn the distribution of real cloud-free data, and a distance objective in both feature space and image space ensures the quality of the generated image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on the synthesized images and real images. Results reveal that the proposed method can effectively remove even and uneven thin cloud in remote sensing images of various scenes, along with good color consistency.

TI  - Combinational Biophysical Composition Index (CBCI) for Effective Mapping Biophysical Composition in Urban Areas
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current spectral indices for estimating urban biophysical compositions still have several limitations. First, most of those indices can highlight one urban biophysical composition, such as impervious surfaces, vegetation, or water. Furthermore, most of those indices depend on short-and mid-wave infrared and thermal infrared bands and thus have limited availability in high-resolution imagery. Finally, the separability between impervious surfaces and bare soil still needs to improve. Therefore, this paper proposed a combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI) for effective highlighting the four-major urban biophysical compositions. Correlation analyses were performed to estimate the relationship between the CBCI values and biophysical compositions, and the spectral discrimination index (SDI) was conducted to test the separability degree between impervious surfaces and bare soil. Moreover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index, BCI, and the combinational build-up index were utilized to perform the comparative analyses. Moreover, this paper investigated the applicability of the CBCI in different spatial resolution remote sensing images. Our results indicated that the CBCI had a much closer relationship with impervious surface fraction than the other four indices and had a stronger correlation with vegetation abundances when compared with the NDVI. In addition, the CBCI had much higher SDI values than the other indices. This paper proved that the CBCI was an effective index for highlighting the four-major urban biophysical compositions and had good performance for separating impervious surfaces and bare soil.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In recent years, the water area of Huangqihai Lake, which is located in Inner Monggolia of China, has changed dramatically mostly due to human factors and decreasing precipitation. Change monitoring of lake area is necessary in this case as well as a prior section for further environmental research of lake ecology. Development of space-geodetic monitoring synthetic aperture radar in the past few decades has made it possible for the access to wide-scale, fine resolution and short revisit interval data resources. In opposed with optical radar, synthetic aperture radar is relatively insensitive to atmospheric conditions and independent from sun illumination. In this paper, a modified narrow-band-section active contour model has been exploited based on a series of SAR images from sentinel-1 to detect the changing area of Huangqi Lake. This approach is generally implemented in three steps. In preprocessing, image radiometric calibration and data co-registration has been done in advance. Then speckle noise has been removed using FANS filtering, which can keep local information with relatively high calculation efficiency compared to traditional spatial filtering and transform domain filtering. After speckle filtering the lake area is extracted with active contour method in a narrow band along lake level. Since this method is sensitive to initial contour, a modified active contour is proposed, combine the region-based model and the edge-based model with a coarse-to-fine scheme to improve segmentation efficiency. Meanwhile, the narrow band is divided into segments to conduct the approach. Quantitative analysis will be given in the results during 2014-2017. The area of Huangqi lake has changed approximately 20 km2 in 3 years and calcification occurs in dry areas, which cause widely concern.

AB  - The lightning imager is one of the three main loads of FY-4 Meteorological Satellite. It is the first optical remote sensing device for lightning detection at high altitude in our country. It runs on the geostationary orbit, and the technical index of lightning detection has reached the international leading level. Aiming at the characteristics of high orbit lightning detection, this paper analyzes the methods of lightning detection. The lightning imager uses spectral features, time and space differences between transient lightning and slowly changing clouds, land and ocean background noise. The lightning signal is detected by combining spectral filtering, time filtering, spatial filtering and frame frame background removal, and the continuous multi frame data is in real time on orbit. Theory, target extraction and coding. Through orbit verification, the lightning imager can detect the lightning signals of different intensity in the coverage area in real time, and predict, warn and track the strong convective weather in the region more timely and accurately.

TI  - Factors related to HIV infection among unmarried youth in rural areas of Southwest China

M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated HIV prevalence among unmarried youth in rural areas of Liangshan Prefecture in southwest China over the period of 2011-2015, and the interactions between behaviors associated with HIV risk. We used HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) data for our analysis. We used questionnaires to investigate information among unmarried youth aged 15 to 25 years and performed HIV testing. Multivariate logistic regression and path analysis were applied to explore associations between behavioral factors related with HIV infection. A total of 9536 unmarried youth were enrolled in this study, of whom 2.75% (262/9536) tested positive for HIV infection. Multivariate logistic regression showed that male gender, Yi ethnicity, illiteracy, out-migrating for work, needle sharing, and engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors were risk factors. Path analysis revealed that needle sharing had the greatest effect on HIV infection (0.267), followed by drug use (0.171), out-migrating for work (0.079), and high-risk sexual behavior (0.064). The epidemic of HIV infection among unmarried youth in rural areas of Liangshan Prefecture is severe, and prevention efforts should focus on high-risk groups such as youth who are male, Yi, illiterate, and out-migrating for work, and those who engage in high-risk sexual behaviors and needle sharing.

AB  - This paper illustrates the repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR) results of Gaofen-3 (GF-3), a Chinese civil SAR satellite. The SAR images are acquired in November 2016 and March 2017 from Ningbo and Nanjing area, particularly, the images in Nanjing area are the first meter degree interferometric pair. With the spatial baseline about 600 m and time baseline 116 days, the coherence of the most urban areas still achieves good enough to generate the digital elevation model (DEM), whereas for the mountain areas, the decoherence phenomenon is serious. During the InSAR processing, we compared several baseline estimating methods and obtained a good flat-earth phase removed interferogram map. By using the latest SAR interferogram filter and phase unwrapping method we proposed, we improved the coherence up to 0.8 in urban area. To reduce the spread unwrapped phase errors coursed by low coherence area, we partitioned the unwrapped phase map and calibrated the baseline and phase offset parameters based on the partitioned image. Then the DEM of high coherence areas were retrieved in each block, and for low coherence areas, the existing DEM auxiliary method was used. In addition, after the orthorectification, we evaluated the elevation model by comparing with the elevation values extracted from SRTM and field measured GPS elevation. And the result shows that accuracy of the elevation map is about 10 m (RMSE) in most of the studied region.

AB  - In this article, a novel interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) baseline estimation method based on ground control points (GCPs) and partitioning is proposed. Instead of introducing the existing low-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) to correct the phase jumps between high and low coherence regions in the process of phase unwrapping, we use the high coherence regional block to calibrate the interferometric parameters. In the process of calibration, the GCPs can reference for low resolution DEM, also can be obtained through the filed measurement. Because the interferometric parameters calibration does not change the absolute phase, which avoids the local DEM restriction by low resolution DEM. In addition, the block based on the coherence map avoids DEM inversion error due to overall absolute phase deviation. Gaofen-3 InSAR data of Ningbo area are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - The ZiYuan-3 02 (ZY-3 02) is the subsequent satellite of ZY-3 01, which is the first civilian high-resolution stereo mapping satellite of China. Since its launch on May 30, 2016, it has been in operation for 2 years. The ZY-3 02 has similar characteristics comparing with ZY-3 01 except a higher spatial resolution for the forward and backward panchromatic images. Image quality assessment is very important for the promotion and application of satellite images. Considering the quality of ZY-3 01 images have been evaluated in previous studies, several objective factors were introduced to compare the image quality between ZY-3 01 and ZY-3 02. In this study, the images of ZY-3 01 and ZY-3 02 with same season and spatial extent were used. The objective factors in different land cover types, e.g., forest, urban, farmland, were then analyzed. The difference of objective factors between two satellite images was expected to explore the image quality of ZY-3 02. The results have shown that the image quality of ZY-3 02 is almost the same and sometimes ever better comparing with that of ZY-3 01.

T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND COMPUTER VISION, PT II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (PRCV)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Extraction of built-up area (e.g., roads, buildings, and other Manmade object) from remotely sensed imagery plays an important role in many urban applications. This task is normally difficult due to complex data in the form of heterogeneous appearance with large intra-class variations and lower inter-class variations. In order to extract the built-up area of 15-m resolution based on Landsat 8-OLI images, we propose the convolutional neural networks (CNN) which built in Google Drive using Colaboratory-Tensorflow. In this Framework, Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides massive remote sensing images and preprocesses the data. In this proposed CNN, for each pixel, the spectral information of the 8 bands and the spatial relationship in the 5 neighborhood are taken into account. Training this network requires lots of sample points, so we propose a method based on the ESA's 38-m global built-up area data of 2014, Open Street Map and MOD13Q1-NDVI to achieve rapid and automatic generation of large number of sample points. We choose Beijing, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Suzhou and Guangzhou of China as the experimentation sites, which represent different landforms and different urban environments. We use the proposed CNN to extract built-up area, and compare the results with other existing building data products. Our research shows: (1) The test accuracy of the five experimental sites is higher than 89%. (2) The classification results of CNN can be very good for the details of the built-up area, and greatly reduce the classification error and leakage error. Therefore, this paper provides a reference for the classification and mapping of built-up areas in large space range.

TI  - GWAS of L-arginine levels
T2  - GWAS Central
M3  - Data study
AB  - L-arginine is the essential precursor of nitric oxide, and is involved in multiple key physiological processes, including vascular and immune function. The genetic regulation of blood L-arginine levels is largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic factors determining serum L-arginine levels, amongst 901 Europeans and 1,394 Indian Asians. We show that common genetic variations at the KLKB1 and F12 loci are strongly associated with serum L-arginine levels. The G allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs71640036 (T/G) in KLKB1 is associated with lower serum L-arginine concentrations (10 mol/l per allele copy, p=1*10-24), while allele T of rs2545801 (T/C) near the F12 gene is associated with lower serum L-arginine levels (7 mol/l per allele copy, p=7*10-12). Together these two loci explain 7% of the total variance in serum L-arginine concentrations. The associations at both loci were replicated in independent cohorts with plasma L-arginine measurements (p<0.004). The two sentinel SNPs are in nearly complete LD with the nonsynonymous SNP rs3733402 at KLKB1 and the 5'-UTR SNP rs1801020 at F12, respectively. SNPs at both loci are associated with blood pressure. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic regulation of L-arginine and its potential relationship with cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Owing to the unique advantages of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in high sensitivity, specificity, multiplexing capability and photostability, it has been widely used in many applications, among which SERS biosensing and bioimaging are the focus in recent years. The successful applications of SERS for non-invasive biomarker detection and bioimaging under in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo conditions, offer significant clinical information to improve diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. This review provides recent developments and applications of SERS, in particular SERS nanotags in biosensing and bioimaging, describing case studies in which different types of biomarkers have been investigated, as well as outlining future challenges that need to be addressed before SERS sees both pathological and clinical use.

AB  - A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of competitive artificial neural network, which projects the high-dimensional input space of the training samples into a low-dimensional space with the topology relations preserved. This makes SOMs supportive of organizing and visualizing complex data sets and have been pervasively used among numerous disciplines with different applications. Notwithstanding its wide applications, the self-organizing map is perplexed by its inherent randomness, which produces dissimilar SOM patterns even when being trained on identical training samples with the same parameters every time, and thus causes usability concerns for other domain practitioners and precludes more potential users from exploring SOM based applications in a broader spectrum. Motivated by this practical concern, we propose a deterministic approach as a supplement to the standard self-organizing map. In accordance with the theoretical design, the experimental results with satellite cloud data demonstrate the effective and efficient organization as well as simplification capabilities of the proposed approach.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval over East Asia Using Himawari-8/AHI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new algorithm to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from a Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). Six typical aerosol models that derived from the long-term ground-based observations of East Asia are used in AOD retrieval. To accurately determine the surface reflectance, improved channel relationships between red, blue, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) are built up according to the infrared Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVISWIR). Based on the new derived aerosol models and improved channel relationships, AOD over East Asian is retrieved by using the AHI data. The results are compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products (MOD04 and MYD04) and yielded a correlation coefficient lager than 0.8 (R = 0.87 and 0.92, respectively). In addition, the retrieved AOD values are also validated by ground-based measurements at 12 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) locations and revealed a good agreement between them (R = 0.86).

TI  - Effective Fusion of Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Data in a Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic Labeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) have led to a great improvement of semantic labeling for various applications including multi-modal remote sensing data. Although different fusion strategies have been reported for multi-modal data, there is no in-depth study of the reasons of performance limits. For example, it is unclear, why an early fusion of multi-modal data in FCN does not lead to a satisfying result. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of individual layers inside FCN and propose an effective fusion strategy for the semantic labeling of color or infrared imagery together with elevation (e.g., Digital Surface Models). The sensitivity and contribution of layers concerning classes and multi-modal data are quantified by recall and descent rate of recall in a multi-resolution model. The contribution of different modalities to the pixel-wise prediction is analyzed explaining the reason of the poor performance caused by the plain concatenation of different modalities. Finally, based on the analysis an optimized scheme for the fusion of layers with image and elevation information into a single FCN model is derived. Experiments are performed on the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D Semantic Labeling dataset (infrared and RGB imagery as well as elevation) and the Potsdam dataset (RGB imagery and elevation). Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.

TI  - Multitemporal Soil Moisture Retrieval over Bare Agricultural Areas by Means of Alpha Model with Multisensor SAR Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to optimize the Alpha approximation model for soil moisture retrieval using multitemporal SAR data, The Alpha model requires prior knowledge of soil moisture range to constrain soil moisture estimation. The solution of the Alpha model is an undetermined problem due to the fact that the number of observation equations is less than the number of unknown parameters. This research primarily focused on the optimization of Alpha model by employing multisensor and multitemporal SAR data. The disadvantage of the Alpha model can be eliminated by the combination of multisensor SAR data. The optimized Alpha model was evaluated on the basis of a comprehensive campaign for soil moisture retrieval, which acquired multisensor time series SAR data and coincident field measurements. The agreement between the estimated and measured soil moisture was within a root mean square error of 0.08 cm(3)/cm(3) for both methods. The optimized Alpha model shows an obvious improvement for soil moisture retrieval. The results demonstrated that multisensor and multitemporal SAR data are favorable for time series soil moisture retrieval over bare agricultural areas.

TI  - Physical-based soil moisture retrieval method over bare agricultural areas by means of multi-sensor SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is to develop, test and validate soil moisture retrieval method based on multi-source SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for bare agricultural areas. The Radardat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A SAR data were applied to retrieve soil moisture content in combination with the integral equation model (IEM) or calibrated integral equation model (CIEM). A straightforward inversion scheme was developed, which does not require the prior knowledge of surface roughness. The soil moisture content can be directly estimated using a look-up table (LUT) optimization method with multi-source SAR data as inputs. For validation purpose, in situ soil moisture content was measured during the period of SAR data acquisitions. The effectiveness and reliability of the soil moisture retrieval methods were evaluated based on the in situ measurements and cost function distribution graph. The experimental results indicate that the developed approach provided accurate soil moisture estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3) to 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3) over the experimental areas. The distribution graphs of the cost function demonstrate the uniqueness and convergence of the estimated results based on multi-source SAR data. Either IEM or CIEM was employed to estimate soil moisture content, more accurate results were obtained with Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A data as inputs. The experimental results preliminary illustrate that the multi-source SAR data are promising for soil moisture retrieval over bare agricultural areas. The novelty of the presented research can be summarized as two aspects. Firstly, the multi-sensor SAR with different incidence angle, different frequency and different polarization were combined to estimate soil moisture content by means of the physical-based methods. The combination of the multi-sensor SAR data can effectively solve the ill-posed problem of soil moisture retrieval using physical models. Secondly, the CIEM was utilized to establish the soil moisture retrieval model, which transforms the three unknown parameters to two unknown parameters. Furthermore, the convergence and uniqueness of the estimated soil moisture were validated through distribution graphs of the cost function.

TI  - Phenological metrics-based crop classification using HJ-1 CCD images and Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type data are an important piece of information for many applications in agriculture. Extracting crop type using remote sensing is not easy because multiple crops are usually planted into small parcels with limited availability of satellite images due to weather conditions. In this research, we aim at producing crop maps for areas with abundant rainfall and small-sized parcels by making full use of Landsat 8 and HJ-1 charge-coupled device (CCD) data. We masked out non-vegetation areas by using Landsat 8 images and then extracted a crop map from a long-term time-series of HJ-1 CCD satellite images acquired at 30-m spatial resolution and two-day temporal resolution. To increase accuracy, four key phenological metrics of crops were extracted from time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index curves plotted from the HJ-1 CCD images. These phenological metrics were used to further identify each of the crop types with less, but easier to access, ancillary field survey data. We used crop area data from the Jingzhou statistical yearbook and 5.8-m spatial resolution ZY-3 satellite images to perform an accuracy assessment. The results show that our classification accuracy was 92% when compared with the highly accurate but limited ZY-3 images and matched up to 80% to the statistical crop areas.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) immensely affects the energy balance and water cycle on the earth's surface. Merging thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (MW) remote sensing provides the possibility to obtain all-weather LST with moderate resolutions. However, due to difficulties in downscaling MW LST, current methods merging TIR LST and MW LST into such an all-weather LST are limited over large areas with very complicated land surfaces (e.g. the Tibetan Plateau). By fully considering the influence of the topography on estimation of merged LSTs, this study revises the recently-developed physical method for generating the 1-km all-weather LST and applies it over the Tibetan Plateau to merge MODIS (1 km) and AMSR2 (10 km) observations. Results show that the merged LST has accuracy of 0.99 K-3.22 K when validated against insitu LSTs from five ground stations with various land cover types. This study would be beneficial for continuously monitoring LST and improving spatio-temporal resolutions for associated land surface process studies requiring high-quality all-weather LST over large scales.

TI  - Spatial and temporal shoreline changes of the southern Yellow River (Huanghe) Delta in 1976-2016
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 364 Landsat satellite images were utilized to study the spatial and temporal shoreline changes of the southern Yellow River Delta in 1976-2016, and a new method revised and improved after Zhang et al. (2016) was proposed. By employing that method, the calculated sea levels calculated from simulated tidal heights and instantaneous shoreline positions rather than simulated tidal heights were used to correct fluctuations in instantaneous shoreline positions caused by tidal height and seasonal sea level changes and other random sea level fluctuations. When calculating the shoreline erosion rates and beach slopes, a statistical analysis of a large number of corrected shoreline positions was used to reduce the influence of random errors that were mainly caused by waves and other casual factors. The shoreline erosion rates and beach slopes presented in this paper are therefore more precise and reliable than those derived in previous studies, which only used two satellite images.The results of this study show that the shoreline of the southern Yellow River Delta primarily experienced gradual erosion during 1976-2016, with an average erosion rate of 26.9 m/year. The average shoreline erosion rate increased from 24.9 m/year in 1976-1996 to 34.9 m/year in 1996-2016-an increase of 40%-probably due to the reduction in sediment discharge and shifting northward course of the Yellow River after 1996. The shoreline erosion rate of the central coast decreased from 50.2 m/year in 1976-1996 to 27.1 m/year in 1996-2016-a decrease of 46%-probably due to the protection offered by coastal hard structures. The average shoreline erosion rate caused by relative sea level rise was 8.5 m/year or 32% of the total average shoreline erosion rate. Relative sea level rise plays an important role in the erosion of the southern Yellow River Delta due to its flat beach. The beach slope of the southern Yellow River Delta was flat and stable in 1976-2016, and the average slope over most of the beach was 0.043%.

AB  - Understanding spatio-temporal changes of urban environments is essential for local planning and environmental management. In this study, Landsat TM/OLI images covering Luoyang region were used as the main data source. The method of spectral indices was used to extract impervious surfaces in 1990 and 2016. The results show that the area of impervious surfaces in Luoyang showed a rapid increase trend, from 62.77 km(2) in 1990 (accounting for 7.79% of the total area of the study area) to 149.37 km(2) in 2016 (accounting for 18.55%). Luolong District has the largest impervious surface area change, followed by Yibin Development Zone and Jianxi District, while old cities of Laocheng District, Xigong District and Chanhe District have not changed much. The establishment of Luolong New District in 2000 gradually shifted Luoyang's urban center from the north bank of Luohe River to the south bank, forming a rapid growth of urban construction land in Luolong District from 2000 to 2010. Old cities mainly expanded northward to varying degrees, and its road network has a rapid growth in the surrounding area. Yibin Development Zone was a remote, small population village in 1990, and recently it has become a new urban expansion area. The main driving forces of changes in impervious surfaces in Luoyang include natural and geographical conditions such as topography, and tourist resources, and the policy as one dominant factor controlling the spatial pattern of impervious surface expansions in Luoyang City.

AB  - In ocean surveillance, ship targets are the focus of attention. The ship target segmentation of SAR images is still challenging due to not only speckle noise but also the variations of backscattering intensities. A new segmentation method for ship targets is proposed in this paper, based on the nonlocal processing principle. The level set is implemented by using nonlocal comparison of patches. In the procedure of pairwise interaction, only the local homogeneity of image features is utilized, and this is important in optimizing regions with homogeneous features. In order to make the method applicable for SAR images, a distribution metric is incorporated into the energy function to suppress the multiplicative noise. Experimental results based on TerraSAR data illustrate the effective performance of the proposed method on the ship target segmentation: It can overcome the speckle noise and intensity variations.

TI  - LANDSAT-BASED TWO DECADES LAND COVER CHANGE IN DONGTING LAKE REGION
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover in Dongting Lake region has been faced high variations during recent decades. Therefore, there has a strong need to investigate and understand the land cover changes in Dongting Lake region between land cover types. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) classification method was employed to detect changes in land cover dynamic in Dongting Lake region using Landsat images for the year 1995, 2006 and 2015. Land cover information was classified to five categories: waterbody, wetland, built-up, cropland and forestland. Quantitative analysis, change detection matrix and land cover dynamic degree were utilized for investigating and assessing the land cover changes in Dongting Lake region. The overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the land cover classification results were over 96% and 0.9, respectively. The results indicated that in 1995 about 11.32% of study area was covered by water body together with 13.31% of wetland. Nearly 50% of the area was covered by cropland and remaining 2.59% was covered by built-up. During the period 1995-2015, the change rate of the waterbody was evaluated at -0.29%, at -0.67% for the wetland and at -2.47% for the built-up. On the contrary, the forestland and cropland increased by 0.72% and 0.03%, respectively. In addition, the results of this study can provide scientific information for government to formulate policy for sustainable land use management in Dongting Lake region.

TI  - SURFACE WATER AREA VARIATIONS MONITORING AND FLOOD HAZARDS USING LANDSAT IMAGE DATA IN DONGTING LAKE FROM 1988 TO 2016
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake is the second largest freshwater lake in China, with rapid seasonal surface water area fluctuations in the middle reach of the Yangtze River and downstream from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The marked variation of the lake's surface water area is considered to have been affected by the TGR over the past decades. In this study, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI time-series imagery data were employed to estimate the wet season total surface water area variation in South Dongting Lake and East Dongting Lake from 1988 to 2016. The surface water area was extracted from Landsat data using Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The results indicated that the surface water area variation was accordant with the variation of precipitation and runoff of Xiangtan, Taojiang, Taoyuan, Shimen, Shadaoguan, Mituosi, Ouchikou and Chenglingji five hydrological stations. Most of the large surface water areas were observed during the pre-TGR period, whereas the small surface water areas were observed during the post-TGR period. Surface water area data, precipitation and runoff from the four hydrological stations (except Shimen station) all indicated downward trends, with reduction rates of 5.866 km(2).year(-1), 0.802 mm.year(-1), 3.950 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 2.834 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 0.377 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 1.282 10(8)m(3).year(-1), 2.715 10(8)m(3).year(-1) , 0.318 10(8)m(3).year(-1) and 16.114 10(8)m(3).year(-1), respectively. The results of correlation analyses indicated precipitation and water from the Yangtze river may affect the fluctuation in the surface water area to a large extent. The results of flood inundation probability analysis indicated that approximately 502.9 km(2) of the study area was in the high flood hazard zone. In addition, the results of this study can provide scientific information to understand the effect of the TGR on downstream lakes and achieve better water resources and flood hazard management in this region.

AB  - Anti-spoofing technology is currently a hot spot in the field of navigation. In comparison with the traditional GNSS receiver, vector receiver takes the advantage of the coupling of satellite signals in a combining way regarding the state of receiver. Limited to attack conditions and implementation complexity, spoofing signals are generally not coupled with authentic satellite signals. This means that vector receiver is likely to have anti-spoofing capability. To validate this conception, we develop a real-time GNSS vector receiver on FPGA platform and test its response to spoofing signals. The experimental results show that the vector receiver is insensitive to the spoofing attacks when the number of satellites is four. While if the number is five, some loops of the vector receiver will lose lock on the condition that spoofing signals delays are greater than 2 similar to 15 mu s. It demonstrates preliminarily that the vector receiver can detect spoofing attack to a certain extent. Moreover, we also investigate the influence of satellite geometrical distribution, spoofing signal delay and other factors on the anti-spoofing capability of vector receiver.

AB  - Forest ecosystem is the main component of the terrestrial biosphere, and the estimation of forest biomass is a necessary condition for the analysis of carbon cycle and regional carbon budget in land ecosystem. As an active detection method, space borne Lidar can directly obtain the information of vertical structure of vegetation, and its retrieval of forest biomass has obvious advantages compared with optical and microwave remote sensing methods. The Lidar obtains the forest three-dimensional structure through the discrete radiation of the echo data in the spot, and then collectively invert the amount of the forest biomass and its spatial distribution pattern through a number of discrete sampling data in a certain region. Obviously, the density of Lidar discrete sampling points is an important factor that determines the fine degree of forest biomass and its spatial distribution pattern. The first generation vegetation measurement Lidar uses linear detection system, which has a large power consumption, limited power supply capacity, and volume and heat dissipation of the satellite platform. The density of the observation point is low, usually 1 to 2 points per square kilometer, which leads to the poor mapping ability of the regional forest biomass. In order to solve the low density of observation points and improve the mapping ability of Lidar in the region of forest biomass, this paper proposes a kind of second generation of vegetation Lidar based on few-photon mode. The application background, the principle of small photon detection and the composition of the system is discussed. The demand for the energy of the laser emission pulse is lower than that of the linear system. Under the condition of the same resource on the satellite, the density of the sampling point is higher than that of the linear system. Therefore, the second generation vegetation Lidar can better depict the number and spatial distribution pattern of regional forest biomass.

TI  - A temperature and vegetation adjusted NTL urban index for urban area mapping and analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information regarding the extent and spatial distribution of urban areas on regional and global scales is crucially important for both scientific and policy-making communities. Stable night-time light (NTL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) provides a unique proxy of human settlement and activity, which has been used in the mapping and analysis of urban areas and urbanization dynamics. However, blooming and saturation effects of DMSP/OLS NTL data are two unresolved problems in regional urban area mapping and analysis. This study proposed a new urban index termed the Temperature and Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (TVANUI). It is intended to reduce blooming and saturation effects and to enhance urban features by combining DMSP/OLS NTL data with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra satellite. The proposed index was evaluated in two study areas by comparison with established urban indices. The results demonstrated the proposed TVANUI was effective in enhancing the variation of DMSP/OLS light in urban areas and in reducing blooming and saturation effects, showing better performance than three established urban indices. The TVANUI also significantly outperformed the established urban indices in urban area mapping using both the global-fixed threshold and the local-optimal threshold methods. Thus, the proposed TVANUI provides a useful variable for urban area mapping and analysis on regional scale, as well as for urbanization dynamics using time-series DMSP/OLS and related satellite data.

TI  - Observations of internal waves with high sampling data of radar altimetry and MODIS images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 20 Hz high sampling radar altimetry data and quasi-synchronous satellite images are applied to investigate internal waves in the South China Sea (SCS) and the Sulu Sea. The response characteristics and band sensitivities of radar altimetry data to the modulation of internal waves were analysed. With quasi-synchronous observations, the responses of Sigma0 and significant wave height (SWH) in the Ku band and the C band to the modulation were discussed, respectively. The results demonstrate that for Sigma0, the Ku band is more sensitive, whereas the C band is more sensitive for SWH. The propagation speeds of internal waves in the SCS and the Sulu Sea were calculated with quasi-synchronous observation of radar altimetry high sampling data and MODIS images. The calculated speed of the internal waves is close to the phase speed obtained from the KdV equation. This work indicates that the quantitative parameter of internal waves could be extracted from radar altimetry high sampling data. The altimetry data could serve as an additional data source for the investigation of internal waves.

AB  - The cold island effect caused by urban ecological land can effectively relieve the urban heat island effect brought about by impervious surface expansion. This paper takes Shijiazhuang as the study area and Landsat5 remote sensing image as the data source. It uses RS technology to invert surface temperature and interpret urban ecological land use. On this basis, this paper make the spatial correlation fitting between them, and study the relationship between urban ecological land and surface temperature for different particle size grades and different shape indices, find out the difference between Internal and external surface temperature in the different ecological land types. The results show that there are significant differences in land surface temperature for different types of land use, the lowest temperature is water and the highest temperature is impervious ground. The same types of ecological land use increased with the increase of particle size, and the cooling and cooling effect gradually increased. For different ecological lands, with the increase of particle size, the cold effect in descending order is urban water, urban lawn, and urban forest. The critical regions of cold effect is 1200 meters in urban water, 800 meters in urban forest, and 500 meters in urban lawn. And with the increase of distance, the effect of cold water in urban water is particularly obvious.

TI  - Influence of landscape pattern on epidemic of rice sheath blight disease at regional scale

AB  - The forecast of occurrence and prevalence of rice sheath blight disease at regional scale is important to disease administration and prevention. The occurrence and epidemics of rice sheath blight are related to several aspects, including meteorological conditions, host distribution, amount of pathogens and some factors. From the perspective of landscape ecology, the crop fields can be viewed as patches and the landscape pattern can be depicted by a number of landscape parameters that may affect the epidemics of the disease. The experimental data consisted by 20 scenes of Landsat TM-8 images over 9 regions in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces were used to conduct the landscape analysis. Firstly, a decision tree method was used to produce the classification map over the study area. Then, some landscape feature indices such as patch density, fractal dimension and fragmentation index etc. were extracted at class level and landscape level, respectively, which indicated the landscape pattern and function. Based on data from 2013 to 2015, the influence of the landscape pattern on the occurrence and epidemics of rice sheath blight was analyzed and understood. The results showed that the disease exhibited different occurrence and prevalence behaviors in regions with different landscape characteristics. Those regions with high connectivity and low fragmentation are most favorable habitats for the disease since they may spread rapidly within these regions. The LJI index exhibited a statistical significant difference between regions with disease occurring fast and severe and regions with disease occurring slow and slight. Such a landscape index may serve as a responsible indicator for the occurrence and epidemics of rice sheath blight at a regional scale, and thus has a potential to be incorporated into a comprehensive disease forecasting model in future.

TI  - Water Loss Due to Increasing Planted Vegetation over the Badain Jaran Desert, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources play a vital role in ecosystem stability, human survival, and social development in drylands. Human activities, such as afforestation and irrigation, have had a large impact on the water cycle and vegetation in drylands over recent years. The Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) is one of the driest regions in China with increasing human activities, yet the connection between human management and the ecohydrology of this area remains largely unclear. In this study, we firstly investigated the ecohydrological dynamics and their relationship across different spatial scales over the BJD, using multi-source observational data from 2001 to 2014, including: total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), lake extent from Landsat, and precipitation from in situ meteorological stations. We further studied the response of the local hydrological conditions to large scale vegetation and climatic dynamics, also conducting a change analysis of water levels over four selected lakes within the BJD region from 2011. To normalize the effect of inter-annual variations of precipitation on vegetation, we also employed a relationship between annual average NDVI and annual precipitation, or modified rain-use efficiency, termed the RUEmo. A focus of this study is to understand the impact of the increasing planted vegetation on local ecohydrological systems over the BJD region. Results showed that vegetation increases were largely found to be confined to the areas intensely influenced by human activities, such as croplands and urban areas. With precipitation patterns remaining stable during the study period, there was a significant increasing trend in vegetation greenness per unit of rainfall, or RUEmo over the BJD, while at the same time, total water storage as measured by satellites has been continually decreasing since 2003. This suggested that the increased trend in vegetation and apparent increase in RUEmo can be attributed to the extraction of ground water for human-planted irrigated vegetation. In the hinterland of the BJD, we identified human-planted vegetation around the lakes using MODIS observations and field investigations. Four lake basins were chosen to validate the relationship between lake levels and planted vegetation. Our results indicated that increasing human-planted vegetation significantly increased the water loss over the BJD region. This study highlights the value of combining observational data from space-borne sensors and ground instruments to monitor the ecohydrological dynamics and the impact of human activities on water resources and ecosystems over the drylands.

AB  - An at-sensor radiance simulation environment based on the atmosphere-ocean coupled model OSOAA for case-I and case-II waters is set up for evaluation of arbitrary combinations of sensors. Simulated results show that the 385 nm and 355 nm channels are sensitive to chlorophyll when it is less than 2.5 mg/m(3), sensitive to suspended sediment when it is less than 2.5 mg/L, and sensitive to CDOM when a(CDOM) is less than 0.08 m(-1) The quantification of dynamic range for TOA (top of atmosphere) radiances should help to design the forthcoming ultraviolet ocean-color satellite sensors, e.g. the UVI (UltraViolet Imager) on HY-1/C (HaiYang-1/C) of China, as well as correctly exploit the satellite data acquired by the future ultraviolet satellite sensors.

AB  - In recent years, along with the rapid development of economy and the intensification of human activities, the eutrophication of inland lakes has become increasingly serious, leading to frequent occurrence of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria monitoring has become an important part of water quality control. Compared with traditional artificial water quality monitoring methods, remote sensing technology has more means to obtain information, which is faster and shorter in cycle time, and more conducive to monitor large-scale waters rapidly. In this study, Landsat-8 image of Taihu Lake in 2014 was taken as data foundation. The BP neural network algorithm was used as the extraction method of cyanobacteria in Taihu Lake. It provided a reliable technical support for the follow-up application field of cyanobacteria treatment and lake ecological protection.

AB  - Daihai is the third largest lake in Inner Mongoliait is a typical inland lake, located in Liangcheng County at the junction of Wulanchabu City and Shanxi Province, with an area of 160km(2). In recent years, due to the decrease of precipitation and the intensification of eutrophication, Daihai is faced with the problems of shrinking lake area, water storage capacity weakening, ecological deterioration and so on, which have seriously affectted the daily life of the people living in the basin and the sustainable socio-economic development. It is very important to monitor and protect Daihai water area. Remote sensing technology overcomes the disadvantages of large workload, long period and high cost of artificial observation. However, the traditional optical remote sensing images are limited to the weather conditions and the sun exposure angle to a great extent. Because of the shadow, the variation of the sun exposure angle and the existence of the geometric distortion, the detection process of lake area based on optical images may introduce large measurement errors. In contrast, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology can effectively identify camouflage and penetrate coverings and achieve high resolution microwave imaging by using the principle of synthetic aperture. It has the characteristics of all-day, all-weather, high-resolution, large-format and so on. To some extent, the above problems of traditional optical images can be avoided. Based on the satellite data of GF-3 and neural network algorithm, the boundary of Daihai is extracted effectively and its water area is calculated in this study, which provides a theoretical basis for environmental protection and management of Daihai Lake in the future.

AB  - The daily dataset of coherent total column ozone were created from FY3/TOU from 2008 to 2017. Using total column ozone from FY3/TOU and tropospheric and stratospheric column ozone from AURA OMI/MLS satellite data, the seasonal variations of the climatological ozone in the region (40 degrees E-160 degrees E, 0-60 degrees N) are analyzed for the total, tropospheric and stratospheric column, respectively. Differences of ozone and circulation pattern between strong and weak East Asian summer monsoon year are also investigated. Variation of total, tropospheric and stratospheric column ozone is dominated by a low value center over the Tibetan Plateau and abnormal distribution in the monsoon region. There are significant differences of ozone concentration and circulation pattern during strong and weak monsoon in summer The combination of the monsoon anomaly and the upper westerly jet anomaly affects obviously distribution of the tropospheric and stratospheric ozone during summer in the East Asia and the western Pacific regions.

TI  - RiskSens: A Multi-view Learning Approach to Identifying Risky Traffic Locations in Intelligent Transportation Systems Using Social and Remote Sensing
T2  - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - Seattle, WA
AB  - With the ever-increasing number of road traffic accidents worldwide, the road traffic safety has become a critical problem in intelligent transportation systems. A key step towards improving the road traffic safety is to identify the locations where severe traffic accidents happen with a high probability so the precautions can be applied effectively. We refer to this problem as risky traffic location identification. While previous efforts have been made to address similar problems, two important limitations exist: i) data availability: many cities (especially in developing countries) do not maintain a publicly accessible database for the traffic accident records in a city, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the accidents in the city; ii) location accuracy: many self-reported traffic accidents (e.g., social media posts from common citizens) are not associated with the exact GPS locations due to the privacy concerns. To address these limitations, this paper develops the RiskSens, a multi-view learning approach to identifying the risky traffic locations in a city by jointly exploring the social and remote sensing data. We evaluate RiskSens using a real world dataset from New York. The evaluation results show that RiskSens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in identifying risky traffic locations in a city.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The accuracy of the temperature and humidity profiles is important for the atmospheric duct estimation, which is a special atmosphere layer for the radio-wave propagation. In order to use the dataset of satellite to monitor the atmospheric duct, we compare the temperature and humidity profiles between the radiosonde observation data (RAOB) and the NOAA-Unique CrIS/ATMS Product System (NUCAPS), and analyze the result of the atmospheric duct. Results show that the retrieved temperature and humidity profiles have higher accuracy under various weather conditions. However, the atmospheric duct can be observed from RAOB data, but it is difficult to monitor the same situation from satellite data. The temperature inversion and humidity's sharp decrease with height are the main synoptic conditions for the formation of atmospheric waveguides. Currently, the temperature and humidity profile of satellite inversion still lack capturing of turning point information. In order to effectively improve the application of satellite inversion data in atmospheric duct estimation, it is necessary to strengthen the profile's vertical resolution and humidity inversion accuracy.

AB  - Based on the Landsat-5 TM data in Chengguan District of Lhasa City from 1994 to 2011, this study interpreted and analyzed these remote sensing image using Envi4.7 and Arcgis9.3 in different periods. The results show: woodland was decreased by 2.71%, while grassland and construction land area were increased significantly by 4.55% and 6.98% respectively in 1994 and 2011. The maximum rate of change of land use types was construction land, with an average annual rate of 14.43%. In 1994 similar to 2011, the area of woodland and unused land were decreased rapidly by 10.76% and 10.59%, however construction land and grassland were rapidly increased by 23.30% and 21.09%, respectively. In 2006 similar to 2011, the forest had the maximum growth rate of 21.07%, followed by the water body, with an increase of 11.39 %. This conclusion echoes that the urbanization of Lhasa belongs to the "elastic urbanization" model.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture Index Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Images over Poyang Lake Ungauged Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The C-band radar instruments onboard the two-satellite GMES Sentinel-1 constellation provide global measurements with short revisit time (about six days) and medium spatial resolution (5 x 20 m), which are appropriate for watershed scale hydrological applications. This paper aims to explore the potential of Sentinel-1 for estimating surface soil moisture using a multi-temporal approach. To this end, a linear mixed effects (LME) model was developed over Poyang Lake ungauged zone, using time series Sentinel 1A and 1B images and soil moisture ground measurements from 15 automatic observation sites. The model assumed a linear relationship that varied with both time and space between soil moisture and backscattering coefficient (SM-sigma(0)). Results showed that three LME models developed with different polarized sigma(0) images all meet the European Space Agency (ESA) accuracy requirement for GMES soil moisture product (<= 5% in volume), with the vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarized model achieving the best performance. However, the SM-sigma(0) relationship was found to depend strongly on space, making it difficult to predict absolute soil moisture for each grid. Therefore, a relative soil moisture index was then proposed to correct for site effect. When compared with those of the linear fixed effects model, the soil moisture indices predicted by the LME model captured the temporal dynamics of measured soil moisture better, with the overall R-2 and cross-validated R-2 being 0.68 and 0.64, respectively. These results indicate that the LME model can be effectively applied to estimate soil moisture from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images, which is useful for monitoring flood and drought disasters, and for improving stream flow prediction over ungauged zones.

AB  - In this paper, based on RS and GIS technology and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the soil erosion dynamic changes during the two periods of 1990 and 2010 in Bin County was analyzed by using the Landsat TM data of the two periods, so as to reveal the soil erosion spatial distribution pattern and spatial and temporal dynamic evolution rule in the region. The results showed that: the overall patterns of soil erosion were basically the same in both periods, mainly featuring slight erosion and mild erosion, with the area proportions of 80.68% and 74.71% respectively. The slight and extremely intensive erosion changing rates showed a narrowing trend; mild, moderate and intensive erosion was increasing, with a trend of increased soil erosion; mild and intensive erosion were developing towards moderate erosion and moderate and extremely intensive erosion were progressing towards intensive erosion.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon in glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau: Insights into concentrations and possible sources
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from glaciers has an important role in the biogeochemistry of glacial ecosystems. This study focuses on DOC from glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, where glaciers are experiencing rapid shrinkage. We found that concentrations of DOC in snowpits (0.160.054 mug g1), aged snow (0.160.048 mug g1), and bare ice (0.180.082 mug g1) were similar across the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, but were slightly lower than those in other glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. Vertical variations of DOC, particulate organic carbon, black carbon, and total nitrate in snowpit showed no systematic variations in the studied glaciers, with high values of DOC occurring in the ice or dusty layers. We estimated the export of DOC and particulate organic carbon from glaciers to be 1.960.66 Gg yr-1 and 5.882.15 Gg yr-1 in this region, respectively, indicating that organic carbon released from glacier meltwater may be affecting downstream ecosystems. Potential sources of the air masses arriving at the southeastern Tibetan glaciers include South Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, and northwest China. Emissions from biomass burning of South Asia played an important role in the deposition of DOC to the glacier, which can be evidenced by backward trajectories and fire spot distributions from MODIS and CALIPSO images. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosols contribute abundant DOC to glaciers on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The pronounced rate of glacial melting in the region may be delivering increased quantities of relic DOC to downstream rivers. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - The traditional network information update depends on the field measurement or artificial interpretation of surveying and mapping in remote sensing image. The shortcomings are obvious: high cost, long cycle, and consume a large amount of manpower. In order to solve this problem, we use the convolution neural network in the deep learning to complete road information extraction from high resolution image. The road training database combines two kinds of high resolution remote sensing data which are the GaoFen-2 and World View. Two different training models are used to compare the results. Furthermore, the results of the two models are combined to obtain more accurate and improved road extraction results.

AB  - The intertidal zone, a change zone of land and sea interaction, has abundant land reserves, tourism and other resources, which has a location advantage of great engineering construction in China's coastal areas and thus is very important to investigate and monitor the topography of the tidal zone and also keep track of its topographic changes. In this study, the new section of the Bohai sea coastal zone from Nanpu to Tianjin Bohai sea area has been chosen as an example. Based on the terrain feature of the information expressed by the multi-period remote sensing image information and the tidal water level information as well as the tidal data acquisition time in the remote sensing image data, we have been calculated the water line (or edge point) digital elevation topography inversion analysis, and also constructed the digital terrain elevation model, and most importantly have provided a kind of quantitative method to get tidal zone (tide beach) terrain information.

TI  - A coupled atmospheric and topographic correction algorithm for remotely sensed satellite imagery over mountainous terrain
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric correction is an important issue in the quantitative remote-sensing community. By integrating dark object subtraction (DOS)-based atmospheric correction with physics-based topographic correction, a coupled land surface reflectance retrieval algorithm (coupled atmospheric and topographic correction algorithm, named the CAT algorithm) for rugged mountainous regions is proposed. Terra MODIS-derived atmospheric characterization data (including aerosol optical depth, integrated precipitable water, surface pressure, and ozone concentration) are employed as inputs for the proposed algorithm. A physics-based path radiance estimation model is proposed and embedded in the CAT algorithm, and band-specific per-pixel path radiance values are calculated. After the CAT algorithm was performed, the correlation between reflectance and terrain was dramatically reduced, with correlation coefficients nearly equal zero, especially for the near infrared and short-wave infrared bands, meanwhile the image information content increased over 20%. To provide a comparison with previous studies, two commonly used methods in the literature (DOS+Cosine and DOS+C) were employed. The results of the comparison show that the proposed algorithm performed better in both atmospheric and topographic corrections without empirical regression.

TI  - Extraction of Earth Surface Texture Features from Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth surface texture features referring to as visual features of homogeneity in remote sensing images are very important to understand the relationship between surface information and surrounding environment. Remote sensing data contain rich information of earth surface texture features (image gray reflecting the spatial distribution information of texture features, for instance). Here, we propose an efficient and accurate approach to extract earth surface texture features from remote sensing data, called gray level difference frequency spatial (GLDFS). The gray level difference frequency spatial approach is designed to extract multiband remote sensing data, utilizing principle component analysis conversion to compress the multispectral information, and it establishes the gray level difference frequency spatial of principle components. In the end, the texture features are extracted using the gray level difference frequency spatial. To verify the effectiveness of this approach, several experiments are conducted and indicate that it could retain the coordination relationship among multispectral remote sensing data, and compared with the traditional single-band texture analysis method that is based on gray level co-occurrence matrix, the proposed approach has higher classification precision and efficiency.

AB  - This paper attempted to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) from Gaofen (GF)-5 satellite simulation data using 6 common used vegetation indices. The canopy reflectances from 0.4-2.5 mu m were simulated from the combination of vegetation leaf model PROSPECT and four-stream scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (4SAIL) model. GF-5 satellite spectral response functions (SRF) were used to calculate the band reflectances in visible and near infrared regions. Polynomial regression was used to establish the relationships between the vegetation indices and LAI, and coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the relationships. The results showed that DVI among those indices is the best to retrieve LAI from GF-5 data with R-2 of 0.964. The results also showed that the retrieval accuracy can be as high as 0.338.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze the Dagu River channel migration and its change causes using multi-temporal remote sensing data since 1973 to 2016. The research was based on six periods of wet season's cloud free Landsat images which are Landsat MSS for 1973, 1980, Landsat TM for 1992, Landsat ETM+ for 2002, 2010 and Landsat OLI/TIRS for 2016.Ratio method and Modified Normalized Differences Water Index (MNDWI) method were used to extract the channel information because they can avoid possible shadowing by mountains and terrain differences. Human-computer interaction was then used to refine the result after the channel information were converted into vector layers in Arcgis. Furthermore, several characteristic factors were applied to describe the migration of river channel based on GIS layers. They include river's length, average width, river area, area change rate and river bend coefficient. Through directly comparing the changes between characteristic factors of six images, we achieved the final result of river channel migration process.The dynamic change of Dagu River channel shows different characteristics during different phases. During the period of 1973-2002, the area and the width of Dagu River generally showed an decreasing trend, although its length presented slightly change. Meanwhile, the river bend coefficient increased continuously.The river channel migration reasons are probably as follows: 1) Water supply decreased since there was an obvious increasing of annual temperature. As a result, evaporation and irrigation water increasd and the flow decreased. 2) The over-exploitation of Dagu River water resources for urban and rural water supply has led to the lowering of water level and flow reduction in Dagu River Basin. And it even presented zero flow in some river sections.For the second stage (2002-2016), the area and the average width of the river channel showed an increasing trend. The average width continuously increased from 220.41 m in 2002 to 395.35 m in 2016. The river bend coefficient is obviously reduced. The average precipitation increased, but there was a slight increasing trend. More recent changes have been attributed to improved hydrologic conditions as a result of river dredging, building sluice and dams, widening the river and curve cutoff works.The changes of the river are the reaction of natural and human factors. This analysis of research relating to the change causes of the Dagu River channel from 1973 to 2016 showed that human activities have come to be as the controlling factor.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Landsat 8 OLI image, hydroxyl and the concomitant ferrous alterations in and around the Dexing porphyry polymetal deposit were preliminarily delineated by the fractal summation model, and the false anomalies therein unrelated to ore were successfully eliminated by the hot-spot analysis that can quantitatively reflect the clustering degree of the anomaly patches. Sequentially, the ratio vegetation index anomalies related partly to the mine exploitation were also delineated, and they closely edge the mining zones, namely the alteration anomaly patches. Finally, the field spectral survey for near-ore vegetation was conducted, and several lines of evidence showed that the ecological degradation surrounding the Dexing ore fields appears to be more severe and extensive than its counterparts miles away. A holistic remote-sensing schema for regional ore prospecting and associated environmental evaluation was put forward and we believe that the elimination of false anomalies may be more important than extraction of true anomaly in this carefully researched ore-district.

AB  - Subway underground construction generally carried out at urban downtown areas. It has various buildings and facilities, and complicated underground pipe network condition. Underground projects such as the construction of new metro line and deep foundation pit excavation will cause damage to the geological environment which has balance stress. And it also easily lead to deformation in the project construction area, and even surface collapse. Therefore, it is of great significance for the regular deformation monitoring of the surrounding environment during the construction of the metro line.Taking Beijing Metro Line 6 (Phase II) as the research object, 33 scenes TerraSAR-X data in 2011-2015 were collected, and IPTA technology was used to obtain the deformation results in the study area. The spatial statistics method was used to analyze the results of InSAR, and the reliability of the results was evaluated. And with the leveling results as a standard, the accuracy of the deformation results was evaluated. Based on the achievement of InSAR, combined with geological structure, hydrogeology, engineering geology, groundwater information and engineering construction progress, etc, the rule of settlement development along Beijing Metro Line 6 (Phase II) was studied to explore the impact of railway engineering on the surrounding environment.The research show that the deformation results obtain by IPTA technology can achieve high precision. Compared with leveling results,the absolute deviation is less than 10mm/year and the standard deviation is within 6mm/year. Beijing Metro Line 6 (Phase II) project passes through the key subsidence area of Beijing. The Section analysis method was used to extract the deformation profile, so as to express the degree of uneven settlement by the gradient of the profile. As a result, the fluctuation of uneven degree was presented along the surface line, and some sections have higher values.Overlaying the engineering geological profile of subway lines and the location information of subway stations, it was found that the excavation of subway station has a great impact on the surrounding environment, and the influence is more obvious with the increase of clay layer thickness. The groundwater level along the Line 6 (Phase 2) gradually increased from Caofang Station to Dongxiaoying Station. Overall, the sedimentation rate of low groundwater level is higher.The deformation monitoring of underground rail transit surrounding environment based on multi-discipline crossing is conducive to guiding engineering construction and engineering operation protection. It is signiflcanct to the safety of railways. This research can also provide reference for other subway construction and monitoring.

AB  - It is important to detect oil slicks from the sea. Compared to traditional multispectral imager, such as MODIS, MERIS, and AVHRR, operational land imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 satellite is more suitable for detecting floating oil slicks for its high signal-noise ratio. However, traditional detection indices were not generic for oil slicks from different sources in different seas using OLI images. To precisely detect them, this paper proposed an index, named Landsat 8 oil slick detection index (L8OSDI), to identify oil slicks using Landsat 8 OIL images. Three images of different sea areas with oil slicks from different sources were used to test the applicability and superiority of L8OSDI. The experimental results indicated that the proposed index was applicable for detecting oil slicks from different sources in different sea areas, especially for oil slicks formed by oil exploration and natural seepage.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of vegetation processes in rain-runoff (RR) models significantly affects runoff response by influencing evapotranspiration in mesoscale catchments. However, it is impossible to interpret the impacts of vegetation processes on runoff simulations in macroscale catchments using results from mesoscale catchments. Few studies involved vegetation process impacts on hydrological simulations by integrating daily vegetation information into conceptual RR models of macroscale catchments. In this study, we integrated the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into a daily Distributed Time-Variant Gain Model (DTVGM). Then, this study assessed the performances of two DTVGM versions, with and without vegetation processes, in the Wei River catchment, China. The results showed that: (1) Integration of MODIS-LAI into the DTVGM model improved the calibration and runoff simulation results of the initial DTVGM model. (2) Inclusion of vegetation processes in the DTVGM changed the simulated proportions of water balance components in the hydrological model and made the simulation of water balance components more accurate. (3) The fact that inclusion of vegetation processes could improve the hydrological simulation performance of the daily conceptual RR model in the macroscale catchment was consistent with studies in mesoscale catchment.

AB  - Diverse storage formats, archive dispersal, and inconsistent naming make it difficult for researchers and the general public to find and access remote sensing data. To facilitate the use of remote sensing data, this paper provides an integrated framework for direct reading remote sensing data in a widely compatible and analysis-ready format, NumPy ndarray. The framework is composed of two main components. One is the raster data processing and storage model. All the operational gridded remote sensing data are split into tiles, and reorganized in n-dimensional array. Then the N-Dimensional data array is serialized into netCDF and stored into distributed file system. The other is the spatiotemporal filter to achieve parallel query, and it has been encapsulated into Internet-accessible application programming interfaces (APIs). The scenario of calculating NDVI of a specified spatiotemporal range given at last illustrate the efficiency and convenience of our platform provided for remote sensing data analysis.

AB  - Global leaf area index (LAI) generally produced based on the satellite sensors with 1 km spatial resolution, such as the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and VEGETATION. At present, there isn't a LAI product estimated from the Chinese Feng Yun No. 3 (FY-3) images. This study aims to generate a 10-day composite LAI product from FY-3A with a medium resolution spectral imaging (MERSI) at global scale in 2011. Making use of the land cover type as priori knowledge, the LAI for pure vegetation types was inversed from a lookup-table (LUT) based on an stochastic three-dimensional radiative transfer model (3D RTM). For the mixed water and vegetation types, LAI was inversed based on an improved linear decomposition method. The accuracy of LAI inversion from FY-3A MERSI was assessed by LAI field measurements from the Chinese ecosystem research network (CERN) in 2011.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Chinese HJ-1 CCD, GF-1 WFV and ZY-3 MUX Sensor Data for Leaf Area Index Estimations for Maize
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, China has developed and launched several satellites with high spatial resolutions, such as the resources satellite No. 3 (ZY-3) with a multi-spectral camera (MUX) and 5.8 m spatial resolution, the satellite GaoFen No. 1 (GF-1) with a wide field of view (WFV) camera and 16 m spatial resolution, and the environment satellite (HJ-1A/B) with a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor and 30 m spatial resolution. First, to analyze the potential application of ZY-3 MUX, GF-1 WFV, and HJ-1 CCD to extract the leaf area index (LAI) at the regional scale, this study estimated LAI from the relationships between physical model-based spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and LAI values that were generated from look-up tables (LUTs), simulated from the combination of the PROSPECT-5B leaf model and the scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves with the hot-spot effect (SAILH) canopy reflectance model. Second, to assess the surface reflectance quality of these sensors after data preprocessing, the well-processed surface reflectance products of the Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) sensor with a convincing data quality were used to compare the performances of ZY-3 MUX, GF-1 WFV, and HJ-1 CCD sensors both in theory and reality. Apart from several reflectance fluctuations, the reflectance trends were coincident, and the reflectance values of the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands were comparable among these sensors. Finally, to analyze the accuracy of the LAI estimated from ZY-3 MUX, GF-1 WFV, and HJ-1 CCD, the LAI estimations from these sensors were validated based on LAI field measurements in Huailai, Hebei Province, China. The results showed that the performance of the LAI that was inversed from ZY-3 MUX was better than that from GF-1 WFV, and HJ-1 CCD, both of which tended to be systematically underestimated. In addition, the value ranges and accuracies of the LAI inversions both decreased with decreasing spatial resolution.

AB  - Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) on wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most common and devastating foliar diseases, which has resulted in significant reductions in wheat production. The study discusses an assessment of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data products for forecasting the incidence of wheat powdery mildew at a provincial scale. Firstly, the wheat areas were identified using 8-day interval Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset at 250 m resolution. A decision tree was then constructed to identify four infection severities (healthy, mild, moderate and severe) using three kinds of forecasting factors including wheat growth situation (NDVI), habitat factors (land surface temperature, LST) and meteorological conditions (rainfall and air temperature). The results show that the coefficient of determination (R (2)) is 0.999 between the remote sensing based and the statistical data. Wheat-growing areas were primarily distributed in Fuyang, Bozhou, Suzhou and Huaibei of Wanbei (54.38%) and the northern part of Wanzhong. The overall forecasting accuracy was 83.33% and the infected wheat areas showed a spatial spread from the capital city to surrounding regions. The overall infection rate of Anhui Province was 15.64% and the mildly affected wheat areas accounted for 65.07%.

AB  - It is of great importance to monitor and evaluate the dynamics of ecological environment due to severe human activities. In our study, three remote sensing based ecological factors were selected to generate an integrated index for estimating the natural ecological environment at a city scale, specifically including vegetation coverage, soil index and slope. Vegetation coverage was derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) imagery. Soil index was generated by the greenness above bare soil (GRABS). Slope was derived from 30 meters resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM). An integrated index with the method of weighting average was obtained by normalizing the three indicators. The results show that Hefei has a relatively good ecological environment. The ratio of excellent and good levels accounts for 71.00% of the study area. In general, the ecological environment is better in the southern part than that in the northern part.

TI  - A Cascade Coupled Convolutional Neural Network Guided Visual Attention Method for Ship Detection From SAR Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have found applications in ship detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, there are some challenges hamper their advance. First, the detected bounding boxes are not very compact. Second, there are quite a few missing detections for small and densely clustered ships. Third, objects with analogical scatterings on land are detected as ships by making mistake. This is due to: 1) the CNN-based SAR ship detectors cannot utilize the spatial information very sufficiently; 2) features learned from CNNs only describe SAR images in space domain while neglecting the information hidden in frequency domain; and 3) information contained in the meta-data file, which may link to other sources, is not taken into account. To overcome these problems, in this paper, a cascade coupled CNN-guided (3C2N-guided) visual attention method for SAR ship detection is proposed. This method considers the newly presented 3C2N model as a qualified ship proposal generator because the images' spatial information is utilized more sufficiently. The 3C2N model, with coupled CNN as the baseline, consists of a sequence of cascade detectors for training. Complementally, a pulse cosine transformation-based visual attention model in frequency domain is operated on the adaptive regions for ship discrimination. This could further refine the proposals' locations and could significantly reduce the missing detections and false alarms. In addition, the digital elevation model data are adopted to remove ship-like targets on land. Experimental evaluations on 25 Sentinel-1 images demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantificationally analyzes and assesses the land-use status and the value of ecosystem services (ESV) in Nanping City and various counties (districts) within the area. It uses the Landsat 5 TM/Landsat 7ETM images of Nanping City taken in 1995, 2005, and 2015, the object-oriented land-use classification method, and the revised table of the equivalent value per unit area of ecosystem services for China We also use the coefficient of sensitivity to verify the mutual dependence between ESV and the service value index per unit area. Lastly, we use the coordination degree between environment and economy (CDEE) to measure the environment and economic coordination of the study area. The results showed that the ESV increased significantly in Nanping City, mainly from 2005 to 2015. Concerning various counties (districts), the ESV showed an increase in most areas, but a decrease in Jian'ou City. The coefficient of sensitivity analysis showed that the ESV in Nanping City was highly dependent on the service value index per unit area, and that the service value index per unit area selected was accurate in this study. Considering all the factors, the CDEE value of Nanping City was 0.0080, and the environment and economic development was at a low harmonic level during the study period. In various counties (districts) studied, there were 3 types of conversion: persistent low harmonic level, low disharmonic to low harmonic, and low harmonic to low disharmonic.

AB  - Estimation of surface net radiation (SNR) is essential for understanding the land surface energy transformation, snow melting calculations, modeling crop growth, and addressing water resource management. In this study, two sets of experiments were performed to identify, respectively, the impacts of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products, ground-based incoming shortwave and long-wave radiation and albedo measurements, as well as the performance of CoLM with respect to modeling SNR in the Tibetan Plateau at three timescales (half-hourly, hourly, daily, and monthly). The results show that the two experiments provide nearly the similar results and are obvious higher than ground measured SNR validations at three different timescales. SNRs obtained at half-hourly and hourly timescales closely match the real data fluctuations, while daily timescale is too large to catch the short-term fluctuations according to the peak values at the three timescales. Moreover, compared with Method 2, Method 1 is more accurate at different timescales.

AB  - The periodic surface are often seen in agriculture, such as the planting fields of potato, sugarcane, and green onion. There are strong coherent scattering for the fields whose aligning direction is perpendicular to radar's light of sight (LOS). Enhanced backscattering coefficients induced by coherent scattering on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images hinder the retrieval of soil moisture. The paper investigated the capability of different retrieval models in the inversion of soil moisture for bare periodic fields. The results show that the copolarized ratio and HV backscattering coefficient, which are less affected by the periodic structure, can be used to reduce the effect of coherent scattering on soil moisture inversion.

Polyethylenimine (PEI) was selected as a platform to conjugate with diethylene triamine pentacetate acid (DTPA) and polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether to synthesize Au PENPs, followed by acetylation or hydroxylation modification of the remaining PEI surface amine groups and radiolabelling of Tc-99m. The generated multifunctional Tc-99m-Au-PENPs with different surface groups (acetyl or hydroxyl) were characterized via different methods. The Au PENPs before Tc-99m labelling are colloidally stable, haemocompatibility and noncytotoxic at an Au concentration up to 100M. The Tc-99m-labelled Au PENPs exhibit high radiochemical purity, good stability and SPECT/CT imaging performance of different organs and lymph node. The designed strategy to use the radionuclide labelling technique and PEI-facilitated versatile nanoplatform may be extended to develop various novel nanoprobes for precision imaging applications.

TI  - AN INCIDENT DETECTION METHOD CONSIDERING METEOROLOGICAL FACTOR WITH FUZZY LOGIC
T2  - ENGINEERING REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the performance of automatic incident detection algorithm under extreme weather conditions, this paper introduces an innovative method to quantify the relationship between multiple weather parameters and the occurrence of traffic incident as the meteorological influencing factor, and combines the factor with traffic parameters to improve the effect of detection. The new algorithm consists of two modules: meteorological influencing factor module and incident detection module. The meteorological influencing factor module based on fuzzy logic is designed to determine the factor. On the basis of learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network, the new incident detection module uses the factor and traffic parameters to detect incidents. The algorithm is tested with data collected from a typical freeway in Chongqing, China. Also, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by the common criteria of detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR) and mean time to detection (MTTD). The experiments conducted on the field data study the influence of different algorithm architectures exerted on the detection performance. In addition, comparative experiments are performed. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has higher DR, lower FAR than the contrast algorithms, and the proposed algorithm has a better potential for the application of freeway automatic incident detection.

AB  - In this work, we investigate the evolution of ground deformation in the Shanghai coastal region, China, over the last decade. We performed a Small BAseline subset DInSAR analysis based on the exploitation of three independent SAR datasets acquired by the ASAR/ENVISAT (ENV), COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), and Sentinel-1A (S1A) sensors, spanning the time frame between 2007 and 2017. More precisely, we used a time-dependent geotechnical centrifuge model of the subsidence signals to combine the available time-gapped CSK and ENV datasets, and hence we produced a long-term CSK, ENV, and S1A displacement time-series. The maximum subsidence rate calculated by the combined long-term ENV+CSK+S1A deformation time-series is about 30 mm/year. The achieved results are beneficial for future studies assessing the environmental risk (e.g., due to flooding) of the population living in the coastal area of Shanghai.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable in the processes of energy and water balance between Earth's surface and atmosphere. To date, considerable researches have been focused on this issue, especially the thermal infrared (TIR) methods. Whereas TIR measurements are only limited to clear-sky condition, no observation is possible under cloudy conditions. While, passive microwave (PMW) as an alternative to the TIR measurements can penetrate the clouds. In this paper, the optical LST was derived from AMSR-E brightness temperatures by building a strong linear relationship over the continental United States. Unlike the previous studies, the algorithm was conducted by further using the corresponding ground measured LSTs which consist of both clear and cloudy conditions. The linear relationships were built on three sub-regions which is defined by NDVIs. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of derived LST ranges from 2.50K to 3.23K for ascending overpass and 1.54K to 2.71K for descending track. This accuracy is proven to be better than existing work.

AB  - The remote sensing image is usually polluted by atmosphere components especially like aerosol particles. For the quantitative remote sensing applications, the radiative transfer model based atmospheric correction is used to get the reflectance with decoupling the atmosphere and surface by consuming a long computational time. The parallel computing is a solution method for the temporal acceleration. The parallel strategy which uses multi-CPU to work simultaneously is designed to do atmospheric correction for a multispectral remote sensing image. The parallel framework's flow and the main parallel body of atmospheric correction are described. Then, the multispectral remote sensing image of the Chinese Gaofen-2 satellite is used to test the acceleration efficiency. When the CPU number is increasing from 1 to 8, the computational speed is also increasing. The biggest acceleration rate is 6.5. Under the 8 CPU working mode, the whole image atmospheric correction costs 4 minutes.

AB  - In this study, a quantitative Freeze/thaw (F/T) index from passive microwave observations is defined, and is assumed to be linearly correlated with land surface temperature from thermal infrared observations. Thus, a linear regression method is proposed and verified to be effective over a multiscale network of Naqu of the Tibetan Plateau. Then, we implement and test the proposed approach to generate daily F/T state maps at a 5-km spatial resolution through the fusion of AMSR2 and MODIS data. It is found the high resolution F/T maps agreed well with ground reference observations of 0-cm soil temperature, with an overall accuracy of 86.6%. This study provides new insights for high-resolution F/T mapping beyond the (Soil Moisture Active Passive) SMAP mission.

AB  - In mountainous areas, land surface temperature (LST) shows significant terrain effect, which can be directly reflected by the spatial distribution associated with the change of topographic factors (elevation, slope, and aspect). By the way, the terrain effect diminishes the impacts from the differences in surface water and heat fluxes, and influences their comparison or estimation over complex terrain. In this study, a practical way to reduce the terrain effect is proposed based on the random forest method with datasets from MODIS products, which is used to build a LST prediction model instead of the previous model developed based on some numerical model or empirical method. The results indicates that the constructed LST model shows a good performance in predicting LST with the R-2 of 0.93 and the RMSE lower than 2.0 K for four selected days. Corrected LST maps are compared with the original LST map, which presents a preliminary correction results with an obvious correction on pixels with significant terrain effect.

AB  - Remote-sensing of ocean colour has an advantage over any other biological data source for monitoring long-term global changes in phytoplankton biomass, due to its spatial and temporal sampling capabilities. Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) provide a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) is a multispectral radiometer hosted on the recently launched Landsat8 satellite, which is a potential tool for ocean color radiometry because it includes narrow band, high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the addition of a band centered at 443 nm, has competitive advantage in phytoplankton pigment Chl-a estimation compare with previous Landsat instruments. The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of the standard NASA algorithm OC3 type for Landsat-8 OLI in determining Chl-a concentrations in both turbid estuary and clear open sea waters of the north South China Sea, in which the empirical coefficients were tuned by using field data and used 443-, 561-, and 655nm bands instead of 443-, 482 and 561nm bands. The standard OC3-based algorithm for OLI performed well in the Southeast continental shelf of Hainan Island (HNI). While empirical algorithm should be developed in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and the comparisons between estimated and in situ measured Chl-a produced R-2 reaching 0.88 and APD <30%. Furthermore, we assessed Chl-a products by conducting cross-validation with concurrent MODIS-Aqua and NPP VIIRS data, which demonstrate good consistency and minor deviation in HNI waters, while demonstrate good consistency but large deviation in the PRE waters. Our findings demonstrate the potential of high resolution OLI Chl-a products to study short-lasting events and capture fine-scale features in the marine environment in different cases waters. The OLI Chl-a products using standard OC3-based algorithm performed well in the case I waters, while regional algorithm should be developed basing on large field data in the estuary waters.

AB  - The majority of the research using night-time data has focused on the terrestrial environment, while the light flooding our oceans is less studied. Meanwhile, given the rapid development of imaging technology at night, remotely sensed night-time light data can now provide a great opportunity to improve understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of light over large areas. In this article, we used monthly cloud-free night-time imagery from the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band, collected from 2014 to 2016, to explore the spatial distribution of night-time light in marine ecosystems. Morphological methods were used to extract light agglomeration areas. Using the Empirical Mode Decomposition method, we detected seasonal change patterns. Our results show that the distribution of light at night is clustered, and mainly concentrated in coastal and offshore waters, with about 70% of the total light found in 0.3% of the global marine waters. Flares from oil and gas well may not create a distinctive seasonal pattern, although fishing lights may show a seasonal pattern. The five largest agglomeration areas of light are centred in the eastern and southeast waters of Asia with little seasonal fluctuation. The cyclical light pattern of the entire marine system had a period of about 0.94 years, while varied from 0.5 to 1.1 years in the agglomeration areas. The proportions of seasonal energy for 49% of the top 100 agglomeration areas were below 10%, while the areas located in the waters near northern Japan, North Korea, eastern Indonesia, and eastern Argentina experienced large seasonal changes.

TI  - A System Analysis on Steppe Sustainability and Its Driving Forces-A Case Study in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Steppe is an indispensable component for terrestrial ecosystems and it is of great significance to systematically analyze steppe sustainability and its driving forces. In this study, we propose a steppe dynamics ranking method based on Pauta criterion and a steppe sustainability assessment method with an effect matrix. The natural driving forces on steppe sustainability were systematically analyzed using the copula model, and the anthropogenic driving factors, including land use, were analyzed by using spatial overlay and statistical analysis methods. The results showed the following: (1) in general, steppe sustainability showed a trend of improvement from 2001 to 2010 in China. However, there were still some degraded areas scattered within the study area; (2) the consistent effect of steppe dynamics on steppe sustainability was significant on the whole, although there was a diverse effect on it; (3) among the natural factors, precipitation was the strongest positive driving force, followed by temperature average, while sunshine duration had strong negative driving force. The impact caused by land use factors was controlled during that decade, and the steppe land that evolved from urban and built-up land, cropland, and forest was vulnerable and resulted in steppe sustainability degradation.

AB  - Large scale Landsat image classification is the key to acquire national even global land cover map. Traditional methods typically use only a small set of samples to train the classifier and result in unsatisfied classification results. To improve the performance of large scale Landsat image classification, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method named PSPNet in this paper to learn spectral-spatial features from a large training set. By considering the complexities and the various sizes of objects captured in large scale Landsat images, PSPNet can utilize the global information as well as consider the targets with different sizes. In addition, the research area is oversampled with a small offset which can increase the amount of training samples in order to improve the performance of PSPNet on Landsat images. Moreover, PSPNet is finely tuned on the pretrained Resnet50. Experimental results show the efficiency of the CNN based methods for the large-scale land cover mapping. In particular, PSPNet can produce better results even than the provided reference land cover map, with overall accuracy reaching 83%.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of remote sensed rain-use efficiency as an indicator of ecosystem functioning in semi-arid ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ecological functioning is a significant step towards detecting changes in ecosystem attributes that could be linked to desertification processes in drylands. The remote sensing proxies of ecological functioning, attract substantial attention due to its advantage on large spatial and increasingly long temporal scales. Remote sensed Vegetation Indices (VIs) have been proposed as the approach to plant productivity to be indicators of ecosystem functioning in local drylands. However, VIs are easily affected by rainfall, a limiting source in arid and semi-arid areas. Therefore, they may not be suitable indicators of ecosystem functioning when applied at large scales, with different rainfall regimes. To overcome the influence of precipitation, the performance of the remote sensing Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE, defined as aboveground net primary production divided by rainfall) was evaluated in 78 global drylands (of which 74 are located in semi-arid areas), as an indicator of multiple ecosystem functions, quantified by ecological multifunctionality index (EMI, integrated by carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles). The correlation analysis showed that during the growing season, the linear relationships of summed EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and RUE with EMI are both significant positive. However, RUE explained more variation (about 44%) in EMI than summed EVI (about 32%) did. The results obtained by partial correlation analysis by controlling the rainfall showed that correlation coefficient between summed EVI and EMI, increased about 20%, while correlation coefficient between RUE and EMI increased very slightly (about 3%). Similar results were also found by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These facts indicated that both remote sensed VIs and RUE could be indicators of ecological multi-functioning. However, RUE was better due to its robustness to rainfall. Also, we must take care that the core assumptions related to the RUE should be fulfilled before using it as an indicator. The relationships between RUE and nutrient cycles showed that in comparison to phosphorus cycle, the carbon and nitrogen cycles had an apparent higher weight in determining the relationship between RUE and EMI. Our findings support the use of remote sensed RUE to monitor ecosystem functioning which could be linked with alternative dryland states and early detection of desertification in drylands.

TI  - High Spatiotemporal Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration Estimation with Satellite and Ground Observations A case study in New York City
T2  - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING (EE)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Environmental Engineering (EE)
CL  - Milan, ITALY
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) enables accurate and detailed air quality monitoring, especially for metropolitan cities with high levels of population density. Although ground air quality monitoring stations can provide timely and accurate observations, they are usually very sparsely distributed, and cannot provide PM2.5 concentration data with continuous spatial coverage. Instead, satellite observations, e.g., Landsat 8/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), can both obtain data with continuous coverage. However, there is a trade-off between satellite sensors' spatial and temporal resolution. Hence, this study presents an estimation model for PM2.5 concentrations that combines these multi-source data to produce high spatiotemporal resolution concentration maps in urban area. The approach is tested on New York City, NY, USA. Specifically, we first use cloud-free MODIS thermal band images and the corresponding ground-station PM2.5 records to build a local PM2.5 prediction model. Then, we exploit a spatiotemporal image fusion technique to obtain Landsat-like thermal band image series from Landsat 8/TIRS (100 m spatial resolution) and Terra/MODIS (1 km spatial resolution) sensors. Finally, we convert the fused high spatiotemporal resolution thermal band images to PM2.5 concentration maps by the prediction model from step 1. The validation between the estimated and the real PM2.5 values shows that the detailed Landsat-like high spatial resolution PM2.5 estimations are more accurate than the original blurred MODIS one.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Smart City and Systems Engineering (ICSCSE)

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has been studied extensively. There are also urban cool island bodies, such as water and green spaces, but relatively fewer reports explored the urban cool island (UCI) phenomenon. The goal of this work is to find the effective urban channel water pattern to bring down the temperature in summer. The relevant elements of water cooling effect were identified by Dalton's law of evaporation, and "land's cool island region" was put forward to indicate the cool island's effect on exploitable land. The landsat+Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) date and Envi softwear were applied to obtain the land surface temperature and the spatial characters. Analysis results indicated that with the increase of water's width, the range of "land's cool island region" is amplified, but the efficiency of unit width water's land's cool island region is decreasing. This work puts forward "narrow section, dense water network" as an urban water environment planning layout pattern based on the efficiency of unit width water.

TI  - Using Red Edge Position Shift to Monitor Grassland Grazing Intensity in Inner Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Red edge parameters including wavelength, amplitude and area of the red edge peak are important remote sensing-based descriptors of vegetation which have been widely used for evaluating plant chlorophyll content, biomass and even vegetation stress. This paper investigates the possibility of monitoring grazing intensity based on red edge position (REP) shift. At an experimental site located in the Inner Mongolia Grassland Research Station (E116A degrees 42', N43A degrees 38'), five methods were used to extract REP, which ranged from 703 to 725 nm depending on the extraction method chosen and the degree of grazing intensity (GI). The results showed that grazing can cause REP to shift toward shorter wavelengths, and the amplitude of the shift is related to GI. The likely reason for the REP shift is the "green loss" of grass leaf caused by the grazer. Based on the use of broadband satellite remote sensing data, linear extrapolation is recommended as a relatively optimum method for extracting REP.

AB  - A novel algorithm of strong clutter suppression for spaceborne dual-channel SAR/GMTI is proposed in this paper. First, the adaptive two-dimensional (2D) channel calibration is performed to calibrate difference between channels. Then, the amplitude correction is performed cell by cell to balance channels amplitude. At last, the refined phase correction based on the selected strong clutter is performed to correct phase error between channels. Through the process, channel error is corrected. Clutter, especially strong clutter, is well suppressed. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by GaoFen-3 SAR real data.

AB  - Waterfowl habitat analysis is significant to understand species behavior and make conservation plans, especially for Bar headed Geese, which was involved in the large-scale outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in the year 2005 in China. Many studies have demonstrated there is a significant correlation between wildlife habitat and remote sensing data. The various reflectance data contain substantial ecological information that is valuable to model the habitat selection of wildlife. In this paper, we investigate the habitat use patterns of Bar-headed Geese by combining multi-source satellite images with bird GPS records, using Log-likelihood chi-square test to explore the waterfowl habitat preferences. The results show the bird's favorites are significant in various habitatcategories, which confirm previous surveys. This work helps to manage species and make disease control strategies for this sensitive waterfowl.

AB  - Oriental migratory locust seriously threatens agricultural production in croplands and can lead to substantial yield losses. Located in the northern part of Shandong Province and in proximity to the Yellow River Delta, Dongying City is one of areas most prone to the migratory locust plague in East of China. Traditional methods on monitoring and preventing outbreaks of locust are mainly based on field activities. It costs a lot of labors and time actually. Therefore, to generate data that would guide policies aimed at timely prevention and control of such a plague efficiently, we have monitored locust habitat distribution in this area using multi-temporal Landsat OLI images acquired from February to October in 2015. There are six Landsat OLI images were used all. A decision tree classification approach was employed to discriminate locust habitat from the surrounding land-cover based on the seasonal variation of different land-cover types. There are two commonly used spectral vegetation indices in decision tree classification algorithms for this study including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Based on the production rules from the decision tree algorithms, seven land-cover categories were identified in this study as follows: locust habitat, dry land, water, paddy rice, urban, forest, and others. The classification results were evaluated by 327 random verification points from yield investigated (forest and locust habitat) and Google Earth images (dry land, water, paddy rice, urban, and others) respectively. According to the classification mapping result, approximately 8.5% of the total area was extracted as "oriental migratory locust habitat". Also, locust habitat mainly distributed in Hekou district and Kenli district near the Yellow river especially. The accuracy assessment of the resultant classification map indicated an overall accuracy of 87.16% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.849 from the error matrix, which is typically higher than traditional supervised classification methods such as maximum likelihood. Also, water produced the highest accuracy as expected. For locust habitat land-cover types, the classification result produced the producer accuracy and the user accuracy with 81.25% and 92.86% respectively. These results have demonstrated that multi-temporal-data based decision tree mapping methods can well exploit the tremendous potential of different vegetation phenological characteristics for extracting oriental migratory locust habitat and improving overall land-cover classification accuracy to some degree. In general, the classification result from decision tree method can be used for early locust damage prevention and produce a scientific guidance in Dongying city further.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Macroalgae plays an important role in coastal ecosystems. The accurate delineation of macroalgae areas is important for environmental management. This study compared the pixel- and object-based methods using Gaofen satellite no. 2 image to explore an efficient classification approach. Expert system rules and nearest neighbour classifier were adopted for object-based classification, whereas maximum likelihood classifier was implemented in the pixel-based approach. Normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, mean value of the blue band and geometric characteristics were selected as features to distinguish macroalgae farms by considering the spectral and spatial characteristics. Results show that the object-based method achieved a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient than the pixel-based method. Moreover, the object-based approach displayed superiority in identifying Porphyra class. These findings suggest that the object-based method can delineate macroalgae farming areas efficiently and be applied in the future to monitor the macroalgae farms with high spatial resolution imagery.

AB  - The Kuroshio is the western boundary current of the North Pacific Ocean. Kuroshio intrudes into the north of South China Sea (SCS) through the Luzon Strait. The intruded Kuroshio often forms an anticyclonic current loop north of the Luzon Strait. Previous studies confirmed co-variability of sea surface temperature (SST) influence on the local atmosphere. In this study, by using satellite data and numerical modeling, the impact of Kuroshio intrusion (KI) entering north Luzon Strait on the local atmosphere is investigated. First, satellite data analysis shows that KI causing increased local sea surface temperature and enhanced intensity of wind speed and rainfall off southwestern Taiwan during easterly winds (from November to April). Moreover, based on vertical velocity (w) of atmosphere derived from reanalysis data, the result shows that higher local SST (associated with KI) triggering enhanced wind speed and rainfall by enhancing lower atmosphere vertical motion and thus decreasing vertical wind shear, which leads to intensify of vertical mixing.

The results show that the runoff is more consistent and the model efficiency coefficient is 0.59 after the parameters are determined. The model can better simulate the rainfall runoff process in the study area. Through the determined sensitivity parameters, the sensitivity parameters of the rain season runoff in the study area were identified which will provide reference for the hydrological modeling of the Nanxi river state.

TI  - REMOTE SENSING ESTIMATION OF DAILY AVERAGE TEMPERATURE IN NORTHWESTERN CHINA BASED ON ADVANCED MICROWAVE SCANNING RADIOMETER FOR THE EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is one of the most important parameters in the study of the natural environment, hydrology and climate. Remote sensing is often used to estimate air temperature in response to agricultural meteorological disasters to monitor agricultural resources. In this study, we established estimation models using passive microwave remote sensing data. Specifically, the study employed the 6-band brightness temperature data set of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) over 8 years (2003-2010) and daily average temperature data (field-measured temperature) from meteorological stations within three provinces/regions in Northwestern China (Gansu, Ningxia Hui and Shaanxi). We analysed the influence of site, surface classification and elevation on temperature estimation, investigated changes in the correlation of microwave brightness and field-measured temperatures under sunny and cloudy weather conditions, and established an estimation model by using a multi-band combination. The results showed that the correlation coefficient between microwave brightness and daily average field-measured temperatures differed significantly between single-and multi-band remote sensing data, and between various types of surfaces at different elevations. The correlation between microwave brightness and field-measured temperatures was significantly better without clouds than with clouds; without cloud cover the root mean square error (RMSE) was within the range of 2-3 degrees C. Lastly, the 2011 data that were not involved in the modelling were used to test the accuracy of the model. The findings indicate that the model could be applied to agricultural production (R-2 = 0.887).

AB  - The aim of this study was the analysis of the peculiarities of the growth of oak and pine stands in the city of Ufa and its suburbs in the spring by using visual monitoring of the development of leaves of the crown, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and thermal satellite channels in the spectral range of 10.4-12.5 microns. Analysis of cloudless Sentinel-2, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images and the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (GDEM V2) was used. It was found that the oak and pine stands had faster seasonal growth within the urban area than outside the city. It was impossible to fully capture the average daily differences between various areas, including the temperature differences between day-time and night-time temperatures, through the thermal satellite channels. Yet, some temperature differences between various areas can be estimated by using thermal satellite channels.

AB  - The comparative analysis of main ideas of mystical teachings and modern post-nonclassical science is realized in the article. Modern post-nonclassical science has come to the conclusions that resonate with mystical worldview. Being exists as Integrity according to the principle of "all in every part". Integrity is understood as the unique property of unity of the world (holism). Being develops in the relationship of stability and instability, linear and nonlinear, order and chaos. There are gaming and creative moments in the development of the Universe. Consciousness is a nonlinear system, which requires the self-regulation mechanisms for its development. Consciousness develops on the principle of complication. It is designed to fight chaos (entropy) on the scale of the Universe.

TI  - The influence correction of boreal forest vegetation on SRTM data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital elevation model based on SRTM is very convenient for a wide range of studies but requires correction due to the influence of forest vegetation. The present study was conducted to analyse the effect of boreal forests on altitudes, aspects and slopes calculated from the SRTM. A DEM based on topographic maps at 1:100000 scale was used as a reference. The linear regression analysis showed low data correlation in forested areas. The presence of different types of forests and felling in the woods leads to a complex distribution of deviations from the SRTM. A simple correction method was proposed, using a forest mask, built according to Landsat, and forest heights indicated on the topographic maps. After correction, the correlation coefficient between the altitudes increased by 0.05-0.14, the share of matching aspects by 1-4% and the share of matching slopes by 2-8%.

TI  - Downscaling of passive microwave soil moisture retrievals based on spectral analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of soil moisture from passive microwave remote-sensing data is presently one of the most effective methods for monitoring soil moisture. However, the spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products is generally low; thus, existing soil moisture products should be downscaled in order to obtain more accurate soil moisture data. In this study, we explore the theoretical feasibility of applying the spectral downscaling method to the soil moisture in order to generate high spatial resolution soil moisture based on both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Fengyun-3B (FY3B) data. We analyse the spectral characteristics of soil moisture images covering the east-central of the Tibetan Plateau which have different spatial resolutions. The spectral analysis reveals that the spectral downscaling method is reliable in theory for downscaling soil moisture. So, we developed one spectral downscaling method for deriving the high spatial resolution (1 km) soil moister data from the FY3B data (25 km). Our results were compared with the ground truth measurements from 15 selected experimental days in 16 different sites. The average coefficient of determination (R-2) of the spectral downscaling increased nearly doubled than that of the original FY3B soil moisture product. The spectral downscaled soil moister data were successfully applied to examine the water exchange between the land and atmosphere in the study regions. The spectral downscaling approach could be an efficient and effective method to improve the spatial resolution of current microwave soil moisture images.

TI  - Cross-calibration of reflective bands of major moderate resolution remotely sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The major global biogeophysical products obtained from remote sensing are usually composites of 8 or 16 days, and are almost always retrieved from a single sensor. Subsequently, the applications of these products are limited in cases requiring higher temporal frequency. With the increasing number of freely available moderate resolution remote sensing datasets, multi-sensor synergy to increase temporal sampling is warranted. However, radiometric consistency of multi-sensor data is not as good as expected; therefore, first the constituency should be evaluated. A new cross-calibration approach of reflective bands for moderate resolution remotely sensed data is proposed in this paper. The new approach uses a time series of MODIS data from both Terra and Aqua to retrieve both the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) simultaneously over an invariant desert target. The MODIS retrieved BRDF and AOD are then used to cross calibrate the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) and visible and infra-red radiometer (VIRR) onboard FengYun3-A and B satellites (FY3A/B) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) onboard NOAA-16, 17, and 18. The cross-calibration method is validated in two ways: 1) by comparing with the vicarious calibration; and 2) the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance before and after calibration, which show that the calibration error of this new approach is consistent within 5%. Compared with most cross -calibration methods, our new method is generic and better consider on BRDF models; furthermore, the well-built BRDF of the calibration site and simultaneously retrieved AOD make the method fully automatic and cost effective for the calibration of most moderate resolution remote sensors, especially Chinese sensors.

AB  - An effective way to obtain large areas of crop area information is the space sampling method constructed by combining remote sensing data with traditional sampling methods. However, the traditional sampling method requires that the sampling units should satisfy the principle of mutual independence, and does not take into account that regional crops are spatially attributed to spatial autocorrelation due to natural conditions, socioeconomic factors, and other factors. In the past, it has not been reported whether the spatial autocorrelation has influence on the sampling efficiency of agricultural crops and how it affects the extent of impact, thus limiting the further improvement of the spatial sampling efficiency of crop acreage. In response to this problem, this study selected Fengtai County of Anhui Province as a research area. Through the combination of remote sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods, three spatial sampling schemes (simple, systematic, and stratified sampling) were designed, 10 sampling unit scale levels, and the spatial autocorrelation of winter wheat area in different sampling units is quantitatively evaluated using the global spatial autocorrelation index (Moran's I); based on different sampling unit scales, three kinds of spatial sampling schemes are used to conduct sample selection, overall extrapolation and error estimation; the overall relative error (r) of the sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total value estimate and the sample size (n) were selected as the evaluation index of the sampling efficiency to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of the three spatial sampling schemes. The research results show that the winter wheat planting area spatial autocorrelation gradually decreases with the increase of sampling unit size in the sampling unit, but it still shows a strong spatial autocorrelation, The variation range of Z-Score is indicating that the winter wheat in the study area shows significant aggregation characteristics at different sampling unit sizes in the study area. Using 3 sampling methods to extrapolate the total population of cells at different sampling unit sizes, compared with the same sampling, the relative sampling error in the winter wheat area estimation first increases and then decreases with the increase of sampling unit size (decreased spatial autocorrelation), 1) For each method, the sampling error average under the four sampling fractions is conducted, and the average sampling error reaches the lowest point at 2000mx2000m, the variation coefficient increases with the size of the sampling unit. When the sampling unit size is controlled within 2000 m X 2000 m, the average variation coefficient basically controlled within 15%. 2) Relative sampling error of the crop area estimation, variation coefficient, and average relative sampling error and average variation coefficient are all presented as stratified sampling was the smallest, followed by systematic sampling, and simple random sampling was the largest, where the mean variation coefficient of average sampling relative to stratified sampling has the smallest change in average variation coefficient. 3) When the sampling method is determined, the relative sampling error of the estimated crop area decreases as the sampling ratio increases.When the fraction reaches 5%, the sampling error amplitude is basically stable within 7%, the variation coefficient is stable within 5%, and within the 2000 mx2000 m sampling unit scale, continuing to increase sampling ratio has little effect on sampling error and variation coefficient. 4) Through the above three kinds of evaluation indicators, a quantitative sampling extrapolation efficiency evaluation model, spatial autocorrelation and sampling schemes are obtained. This study can provide a reference for rationally designing spatial sampling efficiency of crops in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.

AB  - Timely and accurate acquisition of crop area is of great significance for monitoring crop growth and estimation of crop yields. And it's important for strengthening agricultural management, ensuring food security and supply of agricultural products. The combination of remote sensing data with traditional sampling methods is an effective way to monitor and estimate crop area on a large scale. The traditional sampling method, on the basis of traditional statistics theory which studies the laws of random variables, requires that the sampling units should satisfy the principle of mutual independence. However, the regional crops, which are affected by natural conditions and socioeconomic factors, are often spatial variable. There is no report on whether and how spatial variability will influence the sampling efficiency of crop acreage. Therefor the further improvement of sampling efficiency is limited. To solve this problem, a variation function model was constructed with the area ratio between maize or rice and sampling units as object variable on 10 sampling unit scales combining remote sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods with Dehui, Jilin as study area. Selecting base value as index for spatial variability within the sampling unit, the effect of sampling unit scales on spatial variability of maize and rice were quantitatively analyzed. Three commonly used sampling schemes (random sampling, systematic sampling and stratified sampling) were selected for sample selection, overall extrapolation and error estimation. The sampling efficiency was quantitatively evaluated using overall relative error (r) of the sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total estimate and the sample size (n) on different sampling unit scales. The results show that the spatial variability of maize and rice decreases with the increase of the sampling unit scale. The range of base value is [0.15, 0.20] and [0.05, 0.14] for maize and wheat respectively. Using the three sampling methods to extrapolate the maize and rice area separately: 1) Under the same sampling ratio, the relative sampling errors of the two crops' area estimations gradually increase with the decrease of spatial variability (the sampling unit size increases), the coefficient of variation also shows an increasing trend, and the sampling accuracy and extrapolation stability is affected by spatial variability; 2) The relative error in estimation of the two crop areas varies with the sampling method,when using simple random sampling and systematic sampling, the relative error of the two crops was within the range of (1`)/0, 50%) and (0.5%, 40%), and the coefficient of variation was limited to (1%, 75 A) and In the range of (1%, 88%), the relative errors at all scales were limited to 10% or less with stratified sampling, and the fluctuations of the coefficient of variation were small (both within 0.3% and 20%). Therefore, the stratification was selected. Sampling is the best sampling method; 3) When the sampling method is determined, the sampling ratio is the main factor determining the sampling efficiency.As the sampling ratio increases, the rate of change of the relative error of the two crop area estimators gradually decreases, when the sampling fraction reaches S%, The relative error is basically limited to 5%, and the coefficient of variation is stable within 12% On this basis, the effect of increasing the sampling ratio to increase the sampling progress is minimal; 4) According to the conclusions of 2) and 3), Stratified sampling method is used to extrapolate crop area by 5% sampling ratio. The sampling efficiency decreases with the increase of sampling unit size. When the sampling unit size is limited within 3500mx3500m, the overall sampling satisfies 95% sampling accuracy requirements., And the coefficient of variation is stable within 7%, the stability of the extrapolation of the area is also high; 5) Based on the above research conclusions, the quantitative evaluation sampling efficiency scheme and the optimal sampling model composed of the combination of sampling unit scale (spatial variability), sampling fraction, extrapolated total relative error, and variation coefficient were finally obtained. This study provides a reference for the design of a rational spatial sampling schemes of spatial variable crops.

AB  - Drought is a weather phenomenon widespread worldwide due to the water shortage or unbalance of supply and demand, and it's also one of the most serious natural disasters for human life and agricultural production. The middle reach of Yangtze river, one of China's most important grain producer, subjected to the sub-tropical monsoon climate, is prone to have droughts. This paper has practical implications as it build a model by depending on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 2005 and 2009. Firstly, the 8-day LST and 16-day NDVI data, 8-day LST and 30-day NDVI data were utilized to construct the LST/NDVI feature space. Secondly, the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) images of the reach were derived respectively. Thirdly, the temporal evolution and spatial variation of drought was analyzed. Finally, the results of two different years were compared to analyze the drought in the reach. Our study showed the drought in May was more severe than that in other months. Therefore, a severe drought event is more likely to happen in May in the middle reach of Yangtze river and more measures should be taken to alleviate the loss for the governments.

AB  - Accurate assessment of Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) in large scale is significant for crop productivity estimation and climate change analysis. The object of study is to simulate FAPAR in the rice growth period for exploring photosynthetic capacity of rice in large-scale. The daily FAPAR is calculated based on a coupled model consisting of the leaf-canopy radiative transfer model (PROSAIL) and the World Food Study Model (WOFOST). Due to the limitation of the PROSAIL and WOFOST model, we introduced the remote sensing data assimilation method, which assimilated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) into the coupled model, to improve the prediction accuracy and carry out the large-scale application. The results show high correlation between the simulated FAPAR and the measured data, with the determinate coefficient (R-2) of 0.75 in the study area. The spatial distribution of FAPAR is uniform in flat area, which indicates that the rice in the whole study area has well growth condition and photosynthetic capacity. This study suggest that the coupled model (PROSAIL + WOFOST) assimilated with remote sensing data could accurately simulate daily FAPAR during the crop growth period.

AB  - Land surface albedo (LSA) is an important parameter charactering the land surface energy balance. The prevailing LSA products have supplied a well understanding of the global weather change but for regional use, it is difficult to capture the patch-size change induced by human activities. In this paper, we estimate the high resolution LSA from GF-1 WFV data based on a direct estimation algorithm. Results compared with field observation indicate that the estimation accuracy is high with the coefficient of determination of 0.705 and Bias of 0.008. When compared with Landsat LSA data, a high consistency is performed, the coefficients of determination for black and white sky albedo are 0.943 and 0.941 respectively.

TI  - Design of a Novel Spectral Albedometer for Validating the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Spectral Albedo Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface shortwave broadband albedo is a key parameter in general circulation models and surface energy budget models. Multispectral satellite data are typically used to generate broadband albedo products in a three-step process: atmospheric correction, for converting the top-of-atmosphere observations to surface directional reflectance; angular modeling, for converting the surface directional reflectance to spectral albedo of each individual band; and finally, narrowband-to-broadband conversion, for transforming the spectral albedos to broadband albedos. Spectroradiometers can be used for validating surface directional reflectance products and pyranometers or broadband albedometers, for validating broadband albedo products, but spectral albedo products are rarely validated using ground measurements. In this study, we designed a new type of albedometer that can measure spectral albedos. It consists of multiple interference filters and a silicon detector, for measuring irradiance from 400-1100 nm. The linearity of the sensors is 99%, and the designed albedometer exhibits consistency up to 0.993, with a widely-used commercial instrument. A field experiment for measuring spectral albedo of grassland using this new albedometer was conducted in Yudaokou, China and the measurements are used for validating the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) spectral albedos. The results show that the biases of the MODIS spectral albedos of the first four bands are -0.0094, 0.0065, 0.0159, and -0.0001, respectively. This new instrument provides an effective technique for validating spectral albedos of any satellite sensor in this spectral range, which is critical for improving satellite broadband albedo products.

TI  - Monitoring of recent ground surface subsidence in the Cangzhou region by the use of the InSAR time-series technique with multi-orbit Sentinel-1 TOPS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By collecting 39 scenes of descending images and 26 scenes of ascending images of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), we monitored the ground subsidence situation of Cangzhou in China during the period from March 2015 to February 2017 with the advanced synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) time-series technique and obtained the time-series subsidence rates of Cangzhou. We then selected the two sets of results of the monitoring obtained during the same period (from July 2015 to December 2016) to verify the results' accuracy, considering three overlapping areas (Xinhua District, Botou County, and Dongguang County). This analysis clearly indicated that both types of results have good consistency, and the maximum subsidence occurred in Dongguang County. By further study of the central area of Dongguang and the related urban development, we found that the subsidence reached about 80.0 mm over the study period and there was a close relationship between the subsidence trend and the main direction of the city development. Moreover, by combining the two sets of results, we confirmed that there has been subsidence of the high-speed railway line in the whole of the Cangzhou area, among which the most obvious subsidence has occurred in Dongguang and Qing Counties. Finally, it was proved that the Sentinel-1 data can be used to monitor ground surface subsidence, and the data are especially effective in identifying persistent scatterer points along a linear feature. Therefore, this article could provide reliable data to assist with important decisions about urban development projects in the Cangzhou area in the next few years.

AB  - Air pollutants can cause serious effects on human health, especially fine particles in air, which can easily cause respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, and also increase the probability of lung cancer and heart disease. The disease surveillance of the residents around the chemical plant is an effective means to understand the effects of the discharged pollutant on the health of the surrounding residents. The research area, Shanghai Chemical Industry Park is located at the junction of Jinshan and Fengxian, as the South Center of the six industrial bases of Shanghai. Applying the spatial distribution of population obtained from the extraction of residential land by using GF-2 data, and the disease data after cleaning treatment, can reach to the spatial distribution of the above two diseases. Through the integration of spatial characteristics and attribute characteristics, the disease surveillance of the surrounding residents can be realized, which directly reflects the impact of chemical industry on the health of the surrounding residents.

TI  - Trends and Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early-stage Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Population-based Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To compare trends and outcomes between lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in node-negative early-stage vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using a population-based cancer registry.Methods: Patients with vulvar SCC registered on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program between 2003 and 2013 were identified. Statistical analysis was performed using Cox regression proportional hazards to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) method was performed to minimize selection bias.Results: A total of 1475 patients were identified, including 1346 (91.3%) who received lymphadenectomy and 129 (8.7%) who underwent SLNB. The proportion of patients receiving SLNB increased between 2008 and 2013 compared with the years 2003-2007 (13.9% vs. 3.7%, p < 0.001). Five-year cause-specific survival (CSS) in patients who received lymphadenectomy and SLNB was 91.8% and 92.9%, respectively (p = 0.912), and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 77.5% and 82.5%, respectively (p = 0.403). SLNB was not associated with an decrease in CSS (HR 1.024, 95% CI 0.474-2.213, p = 0.952) or OS (HR 0.874, 95% CI 0.541-1.410, p = 0.581) in univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 115 pairs were selected by PSM and survival analysis also showed comparable CSS (p = 0.481) and OS (p = 0.545) between lymphadenectomy and SLNB.Conclusions: There is an increasing trend toward SLNB in the treatment of patients with node-negative early-stage vulvar SCC, and survival is comparable between lymphadenectomy and SLNB.

TI  - Extraction of Alteration Mineral Information from Moderate Remote Sensing Images Using MPS Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although alteration minerals related to metallogenesis is very important in mineral exploration, information of alteration mineral is weakly expressed in remote sensing imagery, which is often subject to interfering noise and sometimes limited in spectral and spatial resolutions. Because of easy access, moderate images are the main sources of alteration mineral information. Therefore, it is very important to develop alteration mineral information extraction methods from remote sensing images. In this paper, a combined method based on Mask, principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine method (SVM) was used to extract alteration mineral information from Enhanced thematic mapper plus remote sensing data with limited spectral and spatial resolutions. First, a mask image of the remote sensing imagery was created to remove interference information such as vegetation, shadow and water. Then, PCA was employed to collect sample data relating to iron, argillic, and carbonatization alteration. Finally, SVM was used to deal with alteration anomaly and build a feature extraction model of high accuracy. The Mask-PCA-SVM model is used to extract alteration mineral information from remote sensing images of Hatu area, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions, China. The results show that the new methods proposed in this paper can coincide well with known deposits occurrences, rate reached 86.51%. While, the consistent rate with known deposits of the ratio model, PCA model and Spectral angle mapper model were only 3.37, 65.08 and 69.05% respectively. This suggests that the proposed model can find the actual distribution of mineral deposits more effectively by reducing interference to a greater degree.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of Seasonality on Urban Land-Cover Mapping Using Multi-Season Sentinel-1A and GF-1 WFV Images in a Subtropical Monsoon-Climate Region
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the impact of seasonality on urban land-cover mapping and to explore better classification accuracy by using multi-season Sentinel-1A and GF-1 wide field view (WFV) images, and the combinations of both types of images in subtropical monsoon-climate regions in Southeast China. We obtained multi-season Sentinel-1A and GF-1 WFV images, as well as the combinations of both data, by using a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest (RF) classifier. The backscatter intensity, texture, and interference-coherence images were extracted from Sentinel-1A images, and different combinations of these Sentinel-1A-derived images were used to evaluate their ability to map urban land cover. The results showed that the performance of winter images was better than that of any other season, while the summer images performed the worst. Higher classification accuracy was achieved by using multi-season images, and satisfactory classification results were obtained when using Sentinel-1A images from only three seasons. The best classification result was achieved using a combination of all Sentinel-1A data from all four seasons and GF-1 WFV data from winter, with an overall accuracy of up to 96.02% and a kappa coefficient reaching 0.9502. The performance of textures was slightly better than that of the backscatter-intensity images. Although the coherence data performed the worst, it was still able to distinguish urban impervious surfaces well. In addition, the overall classification accuracy of RF was better than that of SVM.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Surface radiation balance plays a vital role in the earth surface system and affects many biogeophysical processes. As one of components of surface energy balance, longwave downward radiation (LWDR) is considered as the most poorly estimated radiation component, and its uncertainty is regarded as substantially larger than other terms of surface energy budget. In this paper, we applied the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) method to derive LWDR based on MODIS thermal infrared bands top of atmosphere radiances and ground-based LWDR measurements. In model fitting process, the RMSE, bias and R-square value are 25.49 W/m(2), -0.000 W/m(2) and 0.88, respectively; and in model validation stage, the RMSE, bias and R-square value are 25.63 W/m(2), 0.481 W/m(2) and 0.87, respectively. The newly proposed model demonstrates comparable accuracy with other LWDR estimating methods and proves that MARS method is very useful in remote sensing based LWDR estimation.

AB  - Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle and natural air conditioning. Monitoring and mapping of forest distribution are of great significance. With the successive launch of new synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, microwave remote sensing data acquisition methods have been developed from single-band, single-polarization and single-angle to multi-frequency, multi-polarization, multi-angle, multi-temporal and so on. That provides an unprecedented potential and opportunity for SAR in the research and application of forest identification. In this paper, the data source mainly included the quad-polarization C-band GaoFen-3(GF-3) and dual-polarization L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR. First, the single-look complex (SLC) data was preprocessed with multi-look, filtering, radiation calibration, geocoding, registration and clipping. Three polarization characteristic parameters of entropy (H), scattering angle (alpha) and anisotropy (A) were obtained by using Cloude-Pottier polarization decomposition, and three texture features of the mean (MEAN), variance (VAR) and dissimilarity (DIS) were extracted based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM). Combined with the advantages of GF-3 high-resolution quad-polarization and PALSAR L-band, multi-dimensional information including frequency, polarization, temporal and texture features was used synthetically. Then support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier was used to obtain the four classification results, including coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and others. The experimental result shows that proposed method achieved a better classification result based on multi-dimensional POLSAR, the overall accuracy of forest type identification is approximately 89.47% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.85.

TI  - Development of a stochastic runoff model considering spatial variability of rainfall
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Two negative exponential difference functions were introduced to estimate the probability distribution of rainfall for describing the spatial variability of rainfall over the basin. Then calculation formula of probability distribution of total runoff was conducted by a vertically-mixed runoff yield model. The joint distribution of rainfall and infiltration capability was deduced to calculate surface runoff according to the infiltration excess mechanism. Furthermore, the groundwater runoff was estimated with mean value of infiltration according to the saturation excess mechanism to improve the practicability. Thus, the probability distribution function of total runoff could be deduced. In the flow concentration calculation, the basin was generalized to a linear reservoir, and the probability function of discharge at any time interval could be obtained according to the stochastic differential equation theory. Therefore, a complete stochastic runoff model was developed. As an example, this model was applied to flood simulation in the Huangnizhuang Basin locating at a tributary of Huaihe River. Results showed that the model could provide the probabilistic flood forecasts for the risk analysis of flood control. Meanwhile, the deterministic result ( i.e. , the mathematical expectation of discharge probability distribution function) had a high forecast accuracy.

TI  - Estimating <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> fractional vegetation cover and aboveground biomass in a coastal wetland using SPOT6 satellite and UAV data
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) is one of the most serious invasive species in some coastal wetlands of China, and its fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) are important parameters that affect the ecology of these wetlands. Because of inaccessibility, field surveys are time-consuming, labor intensive, and difficult to implement, especially on a regional scale. Thus, satellite remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) techniques are the better methods to obtain accurate FVC and AGB information in coastal wetlands. In this study, FVC and AGB of S. alterniflora were estimated based on the SPOT6 satellite remote sensing images with 6 m spatial resolution, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with 0.1 m spatial resolution, over Sansha Bay, a coastal wetland in China. In addition, some field-based samples were also collected. Results showed that most of the FVC ranged from 40% to 80%, indicated a medium-high and high level; while AGB varied from 0 to 15 kg m(-2). Spatial distribution pattern of FVC and AGB were mainly influenced by the ecological and geographical environment. Meanwhile, the local distribution characteristics in the near-shore area also had close relation with anthropogenic activities. Accuracy analysis showed that, the root mean square errors (RMSE) of FVC and AGB were 0.108 and 0.415, and the coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.905 and 0.898, respectively. The results suggest that it is feasible and effective to estimate FVC and AGB of S. alterniflora in coastal wetland using SPOT and UAV data with high accuracy.

AB  - Deep learning technology such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) can extract the distinguishable and representative features of different land cover from remote sensing images in a hierarchical way to classify. However, in the field of agriculture, there are few application of crops classification from multi-spectral remote sensing images based on deep learning. In this context, we compared the classification methods of CNN and support vector machines (SVM) in extracting the spatial distribution of crops planting area from Sentineal-2A multi-spectral remote sensing images in Yuanyang county, China. For the region of study, both methods obtained reasonable spatial distribution of different crops, the verification results show that the overall accuracy of CNN is 95.6% which is superior to SVM.

AB  - Deep learning technology such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) has achieved outstanding results in the field of crops classification for remote sensing images. The way of land cover or crop types remote sensing classification using CNN is mainly pixel-based classification which is often affected by the phenomenon of "salt and pepper". In order to reduce this effect, an object-oriented crops classification method based on CNN is proposed in this paper. By combining image segmentation technology and CNN model, we use this method to obtain the results of crops classification from Sentinel-2A multi-spectral remote sensing images in Yuanyang County, Henan Province, China. The experiment show that, compared with the pixel level classification based on CNN which only consider the spectral and temporal characteristics of the crops, the method we proposed comprehensively utilizes more detailed information such as spectral feature, texture feature, spatial relationship, and color space. Thus, it gains a better discriminability for some specific crop and achieves higher classification accuracy.

AB  - Data assimilation is one effective method of integrating the advantages of multiple observation data from ground stations and remote sensing, optimizing the land surface process model parameters and promoting the regional simulation capability of land surface models, which is of great significance for improving the simulation effect of the process of hydrological cycle and obtaining effective temporal-spatial continuous hydrological factors so as to provide effective data supporting for efficient agricultural water management. We develop a multi-objective parameters optimization method for land surface models based on multi-element data assimilation. Taking two interrelated factors, soil moisture and land surface brightness temperature as examples, we build multi-element data assimilation scheme of soil moisture and land surface brightness temperature based on Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and Noah land surface model, for the purpose of eventually improving temporal-spatial continuous soil moisture simulation. Then we build multi-objective optimization function which is set by using observed values, simulated values and assimilation values of soil moisture and land surface brightness temperature based on multi-objective optimization concept. Meanwhile, the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCEUA) algorithm is used to minimize the multi-objective function value of the soil moisture and land surface brightness temperature, so as to achieve best fit between the observed values, simulation values, and assimilation values of the soil moisture and land surface brightness temperature and optimize the parameters related to soil moisture (saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated soil water potential, Clapp and Hornberger constant, vegetation roughness, etc.). Finally, we evaluate the validation of optimization results. Taking Hetao irrigation district as an example, we obtain the soil moisture data retrieved by multi-remote sensing data through the TVDI index method and land surface brightness temperature derived from single-window algorithm. We set up a data assimilation model and carry out method tests. The result shows that the method of multi-objective model parameters optimization based on data assimilation of multi hydrological factors is better than the original model simulation, which has indeed improved the simulation capability of the land surface model. We provide the valuable experience for study on multi-objective parameters optimization method and multi-element data assimilation method based on land surface model.

AB  - An iterative algorithm is used to simultaneously determining the aerosol optical thickness(AOT) and the exponent of Junge power-law from AATSR L1B reflectance data of channel 0.87um and 1.61um over Taiwan Strait, in this paper. Considering the variation of aerosol complex refractive index(ACRI) with wavelength, the retrieval of aerosol is implemented under constant and variable ACRI. Suppose the MODIS aerosol product values are accurate. For constant ACRI, there are 47.87% and 96.96% pixels with acceptable retrieval AOT and the exponent of Junge power law value, respectively. Likewise, there are 61.02% and 67.01% pixels for variable ACRI. Compared with the retrieval error under constant ACRI, there are 91.79% and 8.3% pixels with smaller AOT and Junge power-law index retrieval error under variable ACRI, respectively. Besides, the precision of AOD retrieved under constant ACRI is equivalent with variable ACRI when AOT product is less than 0.3. However, both constant and variable ACRI can obtain consistant spatial and temporal distribution of AOT.

TI  - Distinguishing Cyanobacterial Bloom From Floating Leaf Vegetation in Lake Taihu Based on Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on field measurements of water surface reflectance spectra in Lake Taihu, we construct a model for distinguishing between cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation by combining a chlorophyll spectral index with a baseline of phycocyanin. In situ Rrs measurements validation results show that this model performs well in distinguishing cyanobacterial bloom from floating leaf vegetation in Lake Taihu. We apply this model to 52 remote sensing images from the Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) from 2003 to 2011. Using two different accuracy evaluation methods, we find an average recognition accuracy of more than 80% for cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation when using optimal index thresholds. Using an average index threshold to extract cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation from the images, the relative accuracies are 78.8% and 74.6%, respectively. If more efficiency is desired, these average thresholds can be used, which is convenient for batch processing and automated extraction of cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation from remote sensing data. The overall distribution of cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation in Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2011 is determined by overlapping the distribution maps from individual images, and the results of our analysis are consistent with previously published results. In addition, our analysis shows that this model is immune to perturbations from thin clouds and aerosols.

AB  - Polar-orbit satellites have the limitation of observed frequency, so the method of PM2.5 concentration estimation based on MODIS AOD is difficult to capture the variation in trend and distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in a day. Himawari-8 geostationary satellite with the advantage of high temporal resolution can obtain the hourly aerosol optical depth(AOD). This paper selected AOD from 2km Himawari-8 Standard Data to estimate the PM2.5 concentration based on Geographically Weighted Regression(GWR) model, and used the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations as training samples of the model. In addition to AOD, the model also took meteorological data such as height of the planetary boundary layer (HPBL) and relative humidity (RH) as parameters to participate in model training to improve the reliability of the results. At the end of the paper, it utilized the model to estimate PM2.5 concentration over eastern China in July 2018 and executed the validation with ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The result indicated there is a basic consistency in the change trend between them (R=0.74, RMSE=10.07 mu g/m(3)).

TI  - Fusion of Multisensor SSTs Based on the Spatiotemporal Hierarchical Bayesian Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on merging MODIS-mapped SSTs with 4-km spatial resolution and AMSR-E optimally interpolated SSTs at 25-km resolution. A new data fusion method was developed-the Spatiotemporal Hierarchical Bayesian Model (STHBM). This method, which is implemented through the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique utilized to extract inferential results, is specified hierarchically by decomposing the SST spatiotemporal process into three subprocesses, that is, the spatial trend process, the seasonal cycle process, and the spatiotemporal random effect process. Spatial-scale transformation and spatiotemporal variation are introduced into the fusion model through the data model and model parameters, respectively, with suitably selected link functions. Compared with two modern spatiotemporal statistical methods-the Bayesian maximum entropy and the robust fixed rank kriging-STHBM has the following strength: it can simultaneously meet the expression of uncertainties from data and model, seamless scale transformation, and SST spatiotemporal process simulation. Utilizing multisensors' complementation, merged data with complete spatial coverage, high resolution (4 km), and fine spatial pattern lying in MODIS SSTs can be obtained through STHBM. The merged data are assessed for local spatial structure, overall accuracy, and local accuracy. The evaluation results illustrate that STHBM can provide spatially complete SST fields with reasonably good data values and acceptable errors, and that the merged SSTs collect fine spatial patterns lying in MODIS SSTs with fine resolution. The accuracy of merged SSTs is between MODIS and AMSR-E SSTs. The contribution to the accuracy and the spatial pattern of the merged SSTs from the original MODIS SSTs is stronger than that of the original AMSR-E SSTs.

AB  - Efficiently locating offshore platforms is essential for management and safety maintenance of marine environment. Performance of the existing offshore platform detection methods with optical remote sensing image rely on large number of time-series images for false positive and false negative are serious in the step of capturing platform with single image. To improve the accuracy of platform detection with single image, a method based on Harris detector and intensity-texture feature image (HIT) is proposed. The intensity-texture feature image is first generated by combining intensity saliency feature and Gabor texture. Then, the Harris detector is employed to seek for platform candidates on the feature image. Eventually, offshore platforms were located according to the corner strength and geometrical morphology of the candidates. Experiments performed with Sentinel_2A images of different sea and weather condition demonstrated that the proposed method is more accurate with less false positive and false negative mistakes compared with the state-of-the-art global threshold method.

TI  - Change detection in multispectral images based on multiband structural information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change vector analysis (CVA) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) are usually used to generate difference image in change detection of multispectral images. Although CVA and SAM can describe the difference between multispectral images, they are defined mathematically and lack support of human visual system (HVS) theory. Advanced structural similarity (ASSIM) complies with the pattern that human perceives the changes occurred in an objective scene. Nevertheless, ASSIM was designed for single band images and cannot be used for extracting multiband structural information from multispectral images directly. Therefore, we first propose two strategies to extract multiband structural information from multiband images. Then, we propose the approaches based on multiband structural information for change detection in multispectral images. Experimental results from one semisynthetic data set and two real data sets acquired by Sentinel-2A and QuickBird satellites validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

TI  - THE TENDENCY OF "A HIDDEN PAINTING" IN LITERATURE (EKPHRASIS IN LEONOV'S ART)
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The given article deals with an issue of arts fusion in Leonov's works, in particular synthesis of literature and painting. The problem of relation between visual and verbal is investigated; important characteristics of the verbal expression of the visual image are highlighted. At the centre of attention are intertextual poetics issues solved by analyzing the works of Leonid Leonov. The concept of ekphrasis and a quick overview of the term history are introduced. The article includes the term "painting ekphrasis". The urgency of ekphrasis as an object of literary research is determined. Ways and forms of the painting presence as well as peculiarities of the painting ekphrasis functioning in Leonov's works and other writers are revealed. An ekphrastic representation of objects of fine art in the literature on the example of Leonov's prose is presented and painting composition devices are revealed. Leonov is a writer with a pronounced visualization of the worldview and, a poetic word accordingly. The search for common ground between Leonov's works and the works of Brueghel the Elder, conceptualization of the artistic and spiritual representation and ekphrastic descriptions interpretation of the artist's paintings in Leonov's texts are the central problems of this article. According to Leonov, Bruegel's paintings can be read like a work of literature. He noted the deapth, the polysemy of his paintings, their "literary character". In addition, this article mentions the works of Giovanni Battista Piranesi-a representative of Western European painting as well as Frans Snyders and other artists of the Flemish painting school of the Baroque period. It is important to emphasize that Leonov's ekphrasis is not a simple description of the picture, it is more than an ordinary verbal representation of the image. Leonov's word has a philosophical sense. Leonov creates a verbal and philosophical semiotics of the literary text. The ekphrasis of painting in Leonov's works is not elements of the artistic space, but they are rather important structural and semantic units of the text that reveal the writer's philosophical views.

TI  - MYTHOPOETICS OF SPACE IN THE NOVELS BY YURI RYTKHEU
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines mythopoetic basis of the spatial imagery in the novels by a Chukchi writer Yuri Rytkheu. It reveals the specificity of the worldview of the author and his characters as well as the evolution of the writer's creativity. The author argues that mythological representation of space in Rytkheu's novels follows such general principles of the genesis of myths as anthropomorphism, "the law of participation" (communion), and late animism (Levy-Bruhl). Rytkheu projected traditional mythological spatial forms and images onto the poetics of the text with the help of mythologemes and archetypal binaries (top-bottom, friend-stranger, close-distant, life-death). The analysis of his two novels written with a gap of forty years - Aivangu and In the Mirror of Oblivion - reveals two different approaches to spatial substrates. In the first novel (1964), there prevails "real" space as the novel's setting and mythologism of images veiled. The second novel written in the 1990s, the years of Rytkheu's temporary emigration in Europe (Denmark, Germany), undergoes influence of postmodernism and neomythologism. In this novel, mysterious, multi-faceted space becomes a meaningful object of representation shown from a variety of perspectives.

AB  - The reliability of the measurement of ultraviolet radiation has always been a hot spot of research. The observation of ultraviolet radiation is not only affected by the solar elevation angle, aerosol thickness, ozone, dioxide, there is also a great connection with the systematic error of the measuring instrument. In fact, in the ultraviolet radiation observation, due to the lack of routine maintenance and periodic calibration, the radiation meter will obviously decline after a period of time, and the longer the use time, the more obvious the attenuation. Therefore, in order to obtained the consistent time series of the stable observational values, some reasonable methods must be adopted to correct the measured values. The data source of this research was part of the UV-MFRSR type ultraviolet radiometer observations from 2003 to 2010. These data were obtained by these daily time series calibration method. In theory, these time series points represent the response time of the instrument, and they should be stable for several months or even years. However, the performance of the in-situ calibration method was influenced by the aerosol / ozone loading mode in practice. The purpose of this study was to get a smooth observation curve by eliminating some observational anomalies. In addition, the actual data in the observation process, some date data is missing, so the reasonable prediction model is used to estimate the value of these data. In this paper, the ARIMA and GARCH models were used to predict the missing data and compared between the predicted value and the true value, it is found that the fitting degree of the predicted value and the true value based on the AR-GARCH model is higher.

AB  - Sufficient remote sensing observation data during crop main growing season is of great importance in improving the accuracy of data assimilation of crop model. The optical remote sensing data are susceptible to cloud and rain, so the amount of clear optical data is very limited in cloudy weather or rainy day. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is not dependent on cloud cover or light conditions, it can penetrate through clouds and have all-weather capabilities. This allows for a more reliable and consistent crop monitoring and yield estimation in terms of radar sensor data. So, the aim of this article is to improve the accuracy for winter wheat yield estimation by joint assimilation of SAR and optical satellite images into crop model. In this study, SAR images are acquired by C-band SAR sensor boarded on Sentinel-1 satellites, and optical images are obtained from Sentinel-2 satellites. Remote sensing data and ground data are all collected during the main growth and development stages of winter wheat. Both normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 images and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators computed from Sentinel-1 images are used in water cloud model to derive soil moisture (SM) time series images. To improve the prediction of crop yields at filed scale, we incorporate remotely sensed soil moisture into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model using Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. In general, the results show that data assimilation schemes of remotely sensed soil moisture slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R-2 = 0.30; RMSE =782 kg ha(-1)) compared to the situation without data assimilation (R-2 = 0.14; RMSE = 1398 kg ha(-2)). Results of this study indicate that the potential for assimilation SAR and optical remote sensing data to improve field yield estimates is relatively low, limitations are due to insufficient no-cloud optical remotely sensed data and root zone soil moisture information. Consequently, the results of this study demonstrate the potential and usefulness of assimilating both SAR and optical remote sensing data into crop model for crop monitoring and yield estimation. Moreover, this also provides the reference for crop yield estimation with data assimilation in other agricultural landscapes.

AB  - One of the most important preprocessing methods for remote sensing data and geometrical distrortion is the geometric correction. In this research, several mathematical models were used in two dimensions case and were compared to each other to determine the accuracy of each mathematical model when used in three different regions with different terrains. Three high-resolution satellite images of the QuickBird satellite (a flat area, a hilly area and a mountain area) of Iraq have been used in this work. The flat area is chosen in Baghdad, while the hilly and mountain areas are chosen in Irbil in the north of Iraq. In this research, the mathematical models used are the first and second order polynomials, as well as the projective transform. All of these models were applied to all different topographic areas and their accuracy was assessed based on the Matlab program. The results of the models in the three areas studied indicate that the best precision is achieved with the second order polynomial model, while the worst precision is obtained with the first order polynomial model. On the other hand, the precision of the projective transformation is almost similar to the precision of the first order polynomial.

AB  - This article is concerned with Hosea's political counsel in 5:12-15, and explores the content and unique meaning of the lion imagery presented in this unit. The prophet's words and their theological root are clarified through a discussion of the meaning of the lion imagery in the book of Hosea, as well as through comparison with similar imagery found in the book of Isaiah and extra-biblical sources. This analysis illuminates the unique theological perspective that Hosea wishes to impart to the people: Through the image of a lion, Hosea conveys that God exercises full, absolute control over Israel. He emphasizes, however, that God's power is not extended over other nations. Hosea's worldview, as will demonstrate in the article, challenges biblical notions of the God of Israel's universality, as well as certain extra-biblical notions of the power of other deities and authorities.

AB  - In this work we implement a completely automatic interferometric processing chain, based on the well-known advanced DInSAR algorithm referred to as Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS), for the generation of Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) deformation mean velocity maps and time-series of very wide areas, implemented within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute environment. Our processing chain consists of the initial data query to the S-1 archive that we created on the AWS S3 storage, then the data transfer to the AWS computing nodes, the data processing and, finally, the transfer of the obtained interferometric results back to the original S3 storage.In order to demonstrate the capability of the implemented Cloud-based processing chain to deal with massive amount of data, we focus our analysis on the whole Italian territory by processing all the available data acquired both from ascending and descending orbits within the October 2014 March 2017 time interval. As final result we combine the retrieved LOS displacements in order to compute the mean velocity maps and time-series of the vertical and East-West surface deformation components.

TI  - Trends in herpes zoster epidemiology in Germany based on primary care sentinel surveillance data, 2005-2016.
T2  - Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster-virus (VZV). Childhood varicella vaccination, as recommended in Germany in 2004, may reduce the risk of HZ in vaccinated children but also virus circulation and thus the booster possibility of latent infected persons. In this context we analyzed age-specific trends in HZ epidemiology in Germany using data on HZ-associated outpatient consultations in participating sentinel sites and HZ-associated cases in all hospitals since 2005. We analyzed two separate time periods that differed in sentinel management and data integrity. For the period 2005-2010, we found a decrease in HZ-associated outpatient consultations in 1- to 4-year-olds (IRR = 0.72, 95%CI 0.63-0.81, p<0.001). For the period 2013-2016, we observed a decrease in HZ-associated outpatient consultations in 10- to 14-year-olds (IRR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.78-0.93, p<0.01). Moreover, we detected an increase in the age groups 20years and older except for the group 30-39years. HZ-associated hospitalizations showed similar trends for the second time period (here 2012-2015). The decrease in HZ-associated outpatient consultations and hospitalizations in children started and continued over cohorts eligible for varicella vaccination and could be a result of their reduced HZ-risk. Whether the observed steady increasing HZ incidences for adults are associated with the varicella vaccination in children remains unclear and could not be investigated with our data.

AB  - On online social media users tend to aggregate in echo chambers, where they shape and reinforce their worldview by discussing and interacting with like-minded people. Such a scenario fosters misinformation spreading, which may influence public opinion. To determine the main factors behind narratives' emergence, characterizing polarization dynamics and users' emotional response to social contents is, thus, crucial. In this paper, we address such a challenge by looking at two different and contrasting narratives, science and conspiracy. We introduce a new metric, the bipolarity, and show how it can help in finding non-trivial proxies of the debate's polarization. Our approach may provide interesting insights for a better understanding of both emotional and polarization dynamics on online social media.

AB  - The paper deals with the attempt to assess the changes in plant species activity as a result of anthropogenic transformation of landscapes. The approaches of the Russian-Soviet school of landscape cartography and land cover mapping based on remote sensing data are used. The species activity was determined by standard methods accepted in the Russian-Soviet floristics. Using the specific examples, the main trends of the species activity changes from the natural condition of the territory to the present moment and in the last 40 years are shown.

TI  - Typhoon diverged forest succession from natural trajectory in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Windthrow is a typical gap phrase disturbance that changes forest composition but rarely alter succession trajectories of a forest stand. Catastrophic windthrow such as typhoons is a large but infrequent disturbance that can have long-lasting effects on forest ecosystems. Whether catastrophic windthrow resets successional pathways of forest ecosystems remains inconclusive. We compared forest structure and regeneration patterns between undisturbed and disturbed stands 30 years after a typhoon event in the treeline ecotone of the Changbai Mountains, Northeastern China. Measurements were made using World View-1 satellite imaging and fieldwork in two types of large plots, one located in areas affected by the typhoon event and the other in adjacent undisturbed areas. Results showed that community divergence at landscape scale occurred following the typhoon. In non wind-disturbed stands, forest development followed the successional pathway of both broadleaved and coniferous trees. By contrast, the late-successional coniferous rather than the early successional broadleaved trees occupied the wind-disturbed stands. The alteration mechanism on the forest succession pathway was that herbs formed tall, dense, and persistent mono-dominant thickets after the typhoon, which inhibited the regeneration of broadleaved trees. In contrast to the common knowledge that forest would return to initial successional stage after catastrophic disturbance, we concluded that catastrophic windthrow, different from gap phase windthrow, altered forest successional trajectory.

AB  - Earthquake science has entered a new era with the development of space-based technologies to measure surface geophysical parameters and deformation at the boundaries of tectonic plates and large faults. Satellite time-series data, coupled with ground based observations where available, can enable scientists to survey pre-earthquake signals in the areas of strong tectonic activity. Cumulative stress energy in seismic active regions under operating tectonic force manifests various earthquakes' precursors. Space-time anomalies of Earth's emitted radiation (thermal infrared in spectral range measured from satellite months to weeks before the occurrence of earthquakes, radon in underground water and soil, etc.), and electromagnetic anomalies are considered as pre-seismic signals. This paper presents observations made using time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and NOAA-AVHRR satellite data for derived multiparameters land surface temperature (LST), outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR), net surface latent heat flux (LHF), mean air temperature (AT), Relative Humidity (RH), and reanalysis data sets for some moderate or strong seismic events recorded in Vrancea region in Romania, which is one of the most active intracontinental seismic areas in Europe. Starting with almost one week prior to a moderate or strong earthquake a transient thermal infrared rise in LST of several Celsius degrees (degrees C) and the increased OLR values higher than the normal have been recorded around epicentral areas, function of the magnitude and focal depth, which disappeared after the main shock. These observations support seismic LSAIC (Lithosphere - Surfacesphere - Atmosphere - Ionosphere Coupling) Model.

AB  - In this paper, the negative impact of extreme climate events and urbanization and the subsequent effects on increasing trend of land surface temperature and degradation of urban green system of Bucharest metropolitan region in Romania was assessed using the geospatial and field survey data. Due to anthropogenic and natural factors, urban land covers changes are reflected in the land surfaces albedo changes. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the urban green albedo patterns dynamics due to the impact of atmospheric pollution, deforestation and climate variations on urban green land cover of Bucharest metropolitan area based on satellite remote sensing Landsat TM/ETM/OLI and MODIS Terra/Aqua time series data over 2000-2017 time period. This study is based on MODIS derived biogeophysical parameters land surface BRDF/albedo, LST (land surface temperature) and NDVI products and in-situ monitoring ground data (as air temperature, aerosols distribution, relative humidity, etc.). Due to deforestation in the periurban areas albedo change appears to be the most significant biogeophysical effect in temperate forests. Satellite data and climate station observations show that surface albedo changes of Baneasa forested zone placed close to a large urban area highly respond to atmospheric pollution influence and climate variations. As the physical climate system is very sensitive to surface albedo, urban/periurban vegetation systems could significantly feedback to the projected climate change modeling scenarios through albedo changes.

AB  - Sustaining forest resources in Romania requires a better understanding of forest ecosystem processes, and how management decisions and climate and anthropogenic change may affect these processes in the future. This paper aims to provide an application of time series anomalies and harmonic analysis to extract information about vegetation phenology from NDVI/EVI and LAI time series for a forest ecosystem Prahova Valley, placed in Carpathian Mountains, Romania, from MODIS Terra/Aqua data over 2000 -2017 period. Spatio-temporal forest vegetation dynamics have been quantified also based on LANDSAT TM/ETM/OLI satellite data. Several daily climatic variables, were used as explanatory variables for the discussion of the vegetation phenology behavior. For investigated test area, considerable NDVI/EVI and LAI decline were observed for drought events during 2003, 2007, and 2012 years. The vegetation phenology analysis was correlated with associated time series of climatic variables in order to detect recorded anomalies. Temperature, rainfall and radiation were significantly correlated with almost all forest land-cover classes, while vegetation phenology was not correlated with climatic variables for the same period of analysis, suggesting a delay between climatic biophysical parameters variations and forest vegetation response. Under stress conditions, it is evident that environmental factors such as soil type, parent material, and topography are not correlated with NDVI/EVI dynamics.

AB  - A spatio-temporal analysis of the aerosol concentrations in two size fractions (PM10 and PM2.5) in relation with air quality (AQI) and meteorological parameters was done through synergy of in-situ monitoring data as well as MODIS Terra/Aqua time-series satellite data for Bucharest metropolitan area during 2012 year. The C005 (version 5.1) Level 2 and Level 3 Terra MODIS AOD550 time-series satellite data for period 01/01/2012-31/12/2012 have been used. ORIGIN 8.0 and ENVI 5.0 software were used. All these methods are important and complementary. It was found that Particle Materials PM2.5 and PM10 aerosols exhibit their highest concentrations mostly in the central part of the town, due to road traffic as well as in the industrialized periurban areas. In addition to the local and regional anthropogenic PM sources, both the levels and composition of air PM depend on meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, precipitation, winds etc.), and season of the year. The results revealed a significant month-to-month variability in all AOD550 values, underlying the influence of varying aerosol load function of season. The AOD550 values (Level 3) lie in a wide range, as low as 0.2 up to 0.5. The influence of aerosol particles on climate, and how their properties are perturbed by anthropogenic activity, is one of the key uncertainties in climate change assessments. These results contribute to a better understanding of urban decision makers through considering the specific characteristics of different urban sectors for air quality improvement.

AB  - Earthquakes are dynamic phenomena that can be predicted by some geophysical and geochemical anomalies occurring in lithosphere, surfacesphere, atmosphere and ionosphere during preparation phase. These seismic LSAIC (Lithospheric-Surfacespheric-Atmospheric-Ionospheric Coupling) perturbations are widely considered as earthquake presignals. The most important earthquake precursors which can be detected from space are: a) temperature changes (detected through air and land surface temperature, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) as well as anomalies recorded by outgoing long-wave radiation and latent heat flux from TIR (Thermal InfraRed) spectral bands of time-series satellites MODIS Terra/Aqua, NOAA AVHRR, ASTER, Landsat TM/ETM data; b) ground surface deformations detected through Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) radar satellite (Sentinel 1) and high quality in-situ GPS monitoring data as well as from time series satellite data in optical range (VIS and IR) from Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, MODIS Terra/Aqua, IKONOS, and Quickbird etc. for geologic lineaments changes location; c) electric and magnetic fields anomalies developed weeks to hours-before the main shock (ionospheric TEC-Total Electron Content, solar and geomagnetic indices which can be detectable from SWARM, GOCE satellites, and in-situ monitoring radon, gamma rays, etc. This paper aims to present analysis of seismic multi-presignals detected through changes of geophysical and geochemical parameters from time-series geospatial and field data for some moderate earthquakes recorded in Vrancea seismic region in Romania. As Vrancea zone in Carpathians has a significant regional tectonic activity in Romania and Europe, the joint analysis of satellite and in-situ geophysical information is revealing new insights in the field of hazard assessment.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to analyze the potential use of Sentinel-1 (S1) radar data for the estimation of soil moisture in agricultural areas. Simultaneously to several S1 acquisitions made between 2015 and 2017 over different sites, ground measurements of soil roughness, soil water content, LAI and crop height were recorded. The sensitivity of S1 signal to variations in soil moisture is discussed. A modelling based on Water Cloud Model was proposed to simulate radar signal backscattered over covered vegetation surfaces. Three inversion approaches were proposed to retrieve surface soil moisture at field scale.

AB  - If we interpret 'death' in Heidegger not, like most readers, as the end of a particular person's life or culture's way of life, but more broadly as the absolute end of any capacity for sense-making whatsoever, I argue that we can best account for its role in Being and Time's ontology of Dasein; find a systematic place for the various, more 'local' forms of breakdown that get called 'death' on the most prominent readings of the text; and highlight the continuity between Heidegger's early concerns about death and his later worries about nihilism and the technological worldview he calls 'enframing' (Gestell).

AB  - As the flagship of the "Belt and Road", the development and construction of the "China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)" are related to the common interests of the country along the line. Gwadar port, which lies at the end of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, is extremely important for the CPEC project. The impervious surface percentage (ISP) is an important indicator of urban development assessment and urban ecological environment evaluation. In this study, the ISP of the Gwadar city is estimated by using the Chinese high spatial resolution GF-1/2 images and fine spatial resolution HJ-1A/B images from 2009 to 2017. The growth magnitude of the ISP in Gwadar is then analyzed. Results reveal that the estimated ISP are highly reliable for detecting and characterizing change trends. The R-2 (Correlation coefficient-squared) of imitating and predicting by using Random Forest method are 0.96 and 0.76 respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimating results are approximately 12.52%. The results indicate that there are two stages in Gwadar's impervious surface growth. First stage is that there is a period of rapid growth from 2009 to 2014. The construction of residences and roads cause the fast increase at a rate of 2.3% per year. The other stage begins with the development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The greatest growth is in the port area from 2014 to 2017, and the growth magnitude is 0.06% per year.

TI  - Resource Allocation for Cognitive Satellite Communications Downlink
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive satellite communications (SatCom) is considered to be able to alleviate the bottleneck of spectrum resource shortage due to traditional spectrum allocation. This paper focuses on a special scenario where the frequency band of SatCom is recommended by the terrestrial terminal according to its spectrum sensing results. Further speaking, frequency bands preferred by terminals in each coverage beam of the satellite may be random, which on the whole forms diverse recommended channels problem that poses a great challenge to traditional multi-beam satellites. To make reasonable use of available resources in this scenario, this paper targetedly proposes a beam hopping (BH) scheme, which is capable of providing services on each frequency band. Based on the BH scheme, two 4-D [i.e., time, frequency, power, and dedicated spot (DS) beam] resource allocation (RA) schemes are presented, which adopt maximizing throughput (MT) and minimizing demand-supply variance (MDSV) as objectives, respectively, corresponding to the fact that satellite resources may be relatively rich or scarce. Both of the RA problems belong to mixed-integer nonlinear programming By decomposing them, three levels of problems, namely, frequency band selection (FBS) problem, dedicated beam allocation (DBA) problem, and time-power allocation (TPA) problem are successively formed. For the FBS and DBA problems, we correspondingly propose heuristic algorithms to quickly distribute frequency bands and dedicated beams. Whereas for the TPA problem, Lagrangian dual algorithm and water-filling-assisted Lagrangian dual algorithm are respectively adopted to solve the convex problem for MT and the nonconvex problem for MDSV. Taking also spectrum sensing errors into account, numerical simulations show that the proposed schemes and algorithms perform well, and a significant gain can be achieved in cognitive SatCom.

AB  - The current study presents the impact of DEM's accuracy in the tectonic activity designation of an area. The classification of the activity of a fault, after the calculation of a variety of geomorphic indices, consist a common tool in tectonics. These indices provide relatively quick recognition of actively deformed areas that rely on the DEM accuracy used for the delineation and the quantification of the geomorphic attributes in the area. The present study considers the case of a known active fault in the Gulf of Corinth, Greece, that is featuring in six different DEMs, including digitations of conventional 1: 5000 topographic maps, satellite imageries (SRTM 90, SRTM 30, ALOS, ASTER) and aerial photographs. The calculated indices are represented by the basin elongation Bs/Rf, the basin asymmetry Af, the valley width to valley height Vf and the stream length - gradient index SL. Based on the evaluation of the data and the assessment process different findings for each DEM are concluded. Thus, the means that are used in order to draw conclusions on an area's tectonic activity can have different importance and outcome on the calculation of separate components of the indices. As technology advances rapidly, it is rather clear that much more accurate DEMs will be available in future. However, as these products are acquired rather slowly, ALOS products can be regarded as accurate DEM basis for the purposes of the tectonic geomorphology.

AB  - The present study focused on the worldview of Russian preschoolers (n= 150) who attended daycare centres in Moscow in 2009-2010. The method of a structured interview was used. The results were compared to the previous periods of the study: the year of 1992 was a period of radical reforms; the year of 1995 saw relative stabilization; the year of 1998 was the time of a powerful financial and economic crisis; in 2009-2010 the country experienced the influence of the global economic crisis. Since 1992 the opinions of preschoolers about wealth and poverty became more realistic and less clearcut. The ratio of the answers "the rich are good," "bad," "different" was about 7:6:4. The respondents practically never mentioned the topic of the criminal origin of wealth. In the opinion of the children, the main sources of material well-being were work, one's own efforts, and the redistribution of wealth. The children generally viewed themselves and their families as "average" or "normal," neither rich nor poor. Most of them viewed the future optimistically: "We cannot become poorer." Money for the children was a means to achieve financial and psychological well-being. Importantly, we found that the preschoolers felt equally happy, protected and sheltered during the time of economic stability as during the time of crises. The preliminary assessment of the data collected in 2015-2016 showed that this trend remained, as parents guarded their children against social problems, the children viewed the world around them in a happy and harmonious way.

AB  - The article describes the results of the Moscow longitudinal study of attitudes of senior preschool children. The study has been conducted for more than 25 years. Its objective is to analyze the impact of changes taking place in the country on the lives of preschool children and on their perceptions of it. This study is an example of a modern approach to studying the characteristics of young children. The primary method of the study is the qualitative analysis that enables to "hear the voice of a child" and look at the life of children with their eyes. To date, seven surveys (reviews) have been performed, each of which included interviews with senior preschool children: the children talked about how they live currently, what they think about what is happening, and about what they see their life in the future, about what they like, what they dream about, what they fear, what they know about politics and the economy, what they want to become when they grow up, etc. The results of this study testify to the impact of social changes on a number of children's perceptions about the world and themselves, as well as the stability of certain representations. It is also shown that, in general, the well-being of preschool children does not depend on social changes. Family members such as parents constitute a buffer that protects children from the negative consequences of crises. (C) 2018 Published by Future Academy

TI  - Reign(統治), Righteousness(義), and Self-Cultivation(修養) : A Christian Appraisal of the Confucian Ideals
T2  - ACTS Theological Journal
T2  - ACTS 신학저널
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the Confucian ideals from a Christian point of view by comparing Confucianism with the Christian worldview, focusing on the concepts of reign(統治), righteousness(義), and self-cultivation(修養). Confucianism dreamed of an ideal state ruled by a holy(聖) and sage(哲) king. A ruler who became self-cultivated(修己) could pursue the politics of “Kingly Way”(王道) that realizes a reign of virtue, the Rites, and benevolence. The ruler held ideal of practicing the Rites(禮) according to principle of righteousness(義理) rather than following his personal interests(私利). In order to realize such an ideal kingdom, the ruler was called to self-cultivation, and an important method in the self-cultivation was to stay in reverence(居敬) for controlling temperament. Confucianism is a this-worldly idealism in that it believes in the possibility of idealistic rule by the cultivated human being. This is based on the Confucian view of human nature as optimistic. Confucianism can be said to be humanistic in that it believes that perfect humanity and perfect society can be achieved by human efforts.Christianity does not see human nature as optimistic. Man was created in the image of God, but by the results of the Fall it became distorted and corrupt. The essentiality of human sinful nature is a rebellion against the reign of God, and the reign of man without God is bound to bring failure and frustration. However, Christianity proclaims that the kingdom of God, which is reigned by God, will ultimately come. The reign of God has already arrived with the First Coming of Jesus Christ and will come into its fullness by the Second Coming. The righteousness of man cannot be justified before God, and the righteousness of God is imputed to those who accept the atonement of Jesus Christ. The church must now display itself as a sign and instrument of God’s kingdom by representing the reign of God. Christians guided by the Holy Spirit are being sanctified by the Spirit’s reign, to show the restored image of God and God’s reign in this world. Christianity is theocentric in that it believes that ideal rule, justification, and sanctification are all possible with God’s grace.

AB  - This article highlights the uniqueness of the Christian worldview by analyzing and comparing the views on suffering in world religions. World religions deal with the problem of suffering. They try to identify the cause of suffering and suggest solutions. Hinduism and Buddhism reduce the problem of suffering to a question of perception, insisting that having a correct perception of the reality of the universe is a way to be liberated from suffering. These religions deal with the problem of suffering in terms of the existential, cognitive dimension, and are lack of dealing with social dimension. On the contrary, there are humanistic worldviews such as Confucianism, philosophical Taoism and Marxism which reduce the problem of suffering to a problem of reigning society. They discuss the proper structure of reign and the qualities of the ruler. These worldviews are this-worldly idealism that thinks that the problem of suffering is resolved under ideal rule, but it does not deal with the problem of self or personal misfortune.In animism, suffering is thought to be caused by supernatural spirits or forces, and therefore, develops sorcery to control or manipulate them. However, animism does not deal with the problem of self or reign in order to solve the problem of suffering. Islam, as a theistic religion, insists that suffering occurs because God punishes sin and to test faith. However, in the theistic religions, various theodicean issues are raised. The Christian view of suffering is comprehensive and integrated in nature by which the biased views of world religions can be corrected by it. The Christian worldview shows how the causes of suffering are eventually removed and the human desires are comprehensively accomplished in the Kingdom of God.

AB  - The early stage of counselling has similar procedural features as compared to the general counselling in Christian counselling. The counsellor attempts to figure out their client’s challenges while they also building relationships with their clients in their needs of consultation. However, there is a clear difference between searched contents and their meaning. Because The christian counsellor has an completely different approach to the basic viewpoint of man and world and the counseling ministry.This study examines the more biblically plausible outcomes of how the pivotal concepts and corresponding counselling realities are structured for this sturdy implementation in the early stage of Christian counselling. As a conclusion, the research suggests three things to search. The first is to explore human problems in God’s creation order(subject-centered contents). The second is to explore the counsellor and client experiences interacting with the Holy Spirit(other than the problems). The third is to explore the aspect of the direction from the Bible to the problem as well as the direction from the problem to the Bible(Bible-based contents). For this study, the researcher analyzed the eclectic approaches of general counseling and the practice of biblical counseling and Christian counseling, and also reviewed the biblical principles for the early exploration of counselling.

AB  - This study is to propose a developmental process of vocational training curriculum based on the core values of Christian education with curriculum design elements such as humanities, mentorship, and workshops, and to describe the way this program for secondary schoolers in Cheonan city is conducted.It is noticeable that a reductionistic perspective, which perceives career education as mere instrumental survey classes for selecting a group of college majors and future professions that correspond to the results of several vocational aptitude tests, has been generally accepted. Beside those test results, an individual learner's self-identity, family background, academic achievement, and health condition should be fully considered to set them the right direction in a life-long pathway. Also, a course of learning activities, which develops learners' attitude, enhances ethical decision making skills, and contains all of the subjects requisite for professional expertise, should be aimed for.The researcher proposed developmental process of vocational training curriculum, in which humanities courses and work-study programs are performed in small groups, with an intention to motivate learners' reflective thinking and to accelerate learning growth in depth. With a distinctive educational goal of cultivating Christian vocation, the literature, historical stories, and philosophical issues in relation to the humanities courses are pre-analysed on the basis of following a Christian worldview for the sake of stimulating critical reasoning in three aspects: recognizing the purpose of life, accepting life's challenges and exploring the meaning of vocation. Furthermore, intimate conversation and mentoring relationships are facilitated in small groups, reflecting the substantial feature that teenagers grow in their faith through observing, imitating and identifying themselves with role models in cohort groups.Then, the researcher described the whole conducting process of the vocational training curriculum for secondary schoolers struggling with low self-esteem, poor academic achievement and negative surroundings, who had been supported by Haenurim Center, a Cheonan-based social-welfare institution. The twelve sessions of this vocational training program were conducted biweekly on Saturday  from September 2013  to August 2014. The humanities courses, on-site surveys, and work-study programs proceeded favorably in cooperative relations of the management support team, career education practitioners, and the volunteer staff, who majored in Christian education and have consistently visited Haenurim Center after the completion of the whole program.The researcher observed positive progress in attendants' level of participation, interpersonal skills, and response to the inquiry of future preparation. It is a noteworthy fact that most of the participants expressed high satisfaction toward small group operation methods. Their reason was that it allowed them to present their opinion freely as well as conceptualize detailed contents easily. Finally, the researcher urged churches, social-welfare institutions, and public administrative departments to step up to support those who need caring and guidance for making right decisions in accordance with their own God-given life purpose.

TI  - Monitoring and Analyzing Water Area Variation of Lake Enriquillo, Dominican Republic by Integrating Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis and MODIS Data
T2  - Ecology and Resilient Infrastructure
M3  - research-article
AB  - Lake Enriquillo, the largest lake in the Dominican Republic, recently has undergone unusual water area changes since 2001 thus it has been affected seriously by local community’s livelihood. Earthquakes and seismic activities of Hispaniola plate tectonic coupled with human activities and climate change are addressed as factors causing the increasing. Thus, a thorough study on relationship between lake area changing, and those factors is needed urgently. To do so, this study applied MESMA on MODIS data to extract water area of Lake Enriquillo during 2001 and 2012 bimonthly, with six issues 12-year.MODIS provides high temporal resolution, and its coarse spatial resolution is compensated by MESMA fraction map. The increase in water area was 142.2 km2, and the maximum lake area was 338.0 km2 (in 2012). Water areas extracted by two Landsat scenes at two different times with three image classification approaches (ISODATA, MNDWI, and TCW) were used to assess accuracy of MODIS and MESMA results; it indicated that MESMA water areas are same as ISODATA’s, less than 0.4%, while the highest difference is between MESMA and TCW, 2.4%. A number of previously formulated hypotheses of lake area change were investigated based on the outcomes of the present study, though none of them could fully explain the changes.

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Plants face temporal and spatial variation in nitrogen (N) availability. This includes heterogeneity in soil nitrate (NO3-) content. To face these constraints, plants modify their gene expression and physiological processes to optimize N acquisition. This plasticity relies on a complex long-distance root-shoot-root signaling network that remains poorly understood. We previously showed that cytokinin (CK) biosynthesis is required to trigger systemic N signaling. Here, we performed split-root experiments and used a combination of CK-related mutant analyses, hormone profiling, transcriptomic analysis, NO3- uptake assays, and root growth measurements to gain insight into systemic N signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. By comparing wild-type plants and mutants affected in CK biosynthesis and ABCG14-dependent root-to-shoot translocation of CK, we revealed an important role for active trans-Zeatin (tZ) in systemic N signaling. Both rapid sentinel gene regulation and long-term functional acclimation to heterogeneous NO3- supply, including NO3- transport and root growth regulation, are likely mediated by the integration of tZ content in shoots. Furthermore, shoot transcriptome profiling revealed that glutamate/glutamine metabolism is likely a target of tZ root-to-shoot translocation, prompting an interesting hypothesis regarding shoot-to-root communication. Finally, this study highlights tZ-independent pathways regulating gene expression in shoots as well as NO3- uptake activity in response to total N-deprivation. We used microarrays to detail transcriptional reprogramming occurring in shoots in response to heterogeneous nitrate supply compared to homogeneous nitrate supply in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants and in two mutants affected in cytokinin biosynthesis and transport. Overall design: Plants were grown in homogeneous medium containing sufficient nitrogen and the root system was divided in two parts (around day 14 after germination). The plants were transferred in split-root plates (around Day 18) containing 1mM KNO3 on both sides of the plates (C.KNO3) or in heterogeneous media containing 1mM KNO3 on one side and 1mM KCl on the other side (Split). Plants (Col-0, ipt3,5,7 and abcg14) were collected 24hours after the beginning of the treatment. This experiment has been replicated 4 times (4 independent experiments) and in each experiment three plants have been pooled in one sample.

AB  - In 2015 and 2016 (the project's Technology Development Phase) the technical components of the project will be designed, and the project pipeline will be implemented and tested working together with a small number of local partners in the form of sentinel research projects. Specifically, DNA will be extracted from dried blood spot samples by our collaborating Laboratory at MORU, Bangkok, and shipped to WTSI for genotyping, capillary and whole genome sequencing. In 2017 (the Proof-of-concept [POC] Implementation Phase), technologies developed in the first phase of the project will be deployed at scale ; processing samples collected by an extensive network of clinics and village health workers across the GMS. The ongoing emergence of slow-clearing parasite strains in the GMS is considered the single greatest threat to to the use of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) to control malaria. The spread of artemisinin resistance to African parasites could roll back recent achievements, with disastrous effects a and thus major efforts are underway to eliminate Plasmodium falciparum malaria from the GMS. It is hoped that this work will benefit endemic regions across the world by helping to preserve the effectiveness of artemisinin, and by developing a technological platform deployable in other control and elimination contexts (in the Americas and in Africa). This data is part of a pre-publication release.

The number of reported new cases of gonorrhoea in China increased dramatically from 100,245 to 115,024. The increase of reported new gonorrhoea cases in China is related to several factors, one of which is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR in China was monitored by China Gonococcal Resistance Surveillance Program (GRSP), which is part of WHO west pacific region gonococcal antibiotic resistance surveillance program (WHO WPRO GASP). Here, we performed WGS in N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates collected from China GRSP sentinel sites to identify the predominant strains spread in China and compare the characteristics of these isolates with strains isolates in the world.

AB  - This dataset was created by re-compiling available open, gender/sex-disaggregated Feed the Future data for Ghana and applying standard processing methods to enhance their accessibility and interoperability. This process entailed the standardization of variable names and labels, the creation of derived socio-economic indicators such as dietary diversity scores, household dependency ratios, and household age and gender composition. This dataset allows researchers to easily use data for Ghana, as well as make cross-country comparisons with other standardized datasets. Moreover, the provision of household GPS coordinates (offset for confidentiality purposes) allows users to match data at different levels. This work combines multi-topic household and community socioeconomic and agricultural surveys with biophysical datasets from multiple sources, including remote sensing, for a thorough comparison of different phenomena. These biophysical sources include the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) World Soil Information, NASA MODIS vegetation indices and land surface temperature data, and the HarvestChoice spatially-disaggregated subnational crop production statistics database (Spatial Production Allocation Model; SPAM).

M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - This is a compiled unique long-term panel dataset that consists of data on (i) pest severity and insecticide applications per annum per county by pest species, and (ii) land cover/use data. The counties in the database are the 51 most important cotton-growing counties, by production, in the Yangtze River valley and Yellow River valley cotton production regions, while the data covered the years 1991-2015, with complete coverage of counties in all years when cotton was cultivated. Between 2011 and 2013, eight counties in our sample stopped cultivating cotton. The number increased to 11 and 12 counties in 2014 and 2015, respectively, resulting in 47 missing records. The national cotton pests monitoring network, maintained by the Ministry of Agriculture mandates the main cotton-producing counties to collect yearly data on pest infestation levels and insecticide applications for key cotton pests following national standardized monitoring and categorization methods. Tailored scouting methods were used for different pests. In each county, 10-20 fields were selected for pest monitoring in each year. Insect populations were recorded every 3-10 days from early June to late August each year, and the seasonal average abundance across the surveyed fields were used for scoring using a five-point scale of levels I-V. Data on the number of insecticide applications targeted at specific pests were collected by interviewing farmers at each scouting to estimate yearly pest-specific total number of sprays for each county. While the detailed data collection methods and protocols should inspire confidence in the data, the reliability of the pest level data depends on the accuracy, knowledge, and honesty of the respondents, as is the case with any non-first-hand data. County-level land use data were drawn from a national land cover/use database developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, using satellite remote-sensing data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper images. The database offers the most comprehensive coverage of Chinas land use/cover and has been used in a number of published studies. The land use data for 6 years (1990-2015) at 5 years interval were extracted. The proportional area for each six main land use classes as well as the Shannon index for land use diversity for each county for six years was computed. Land use proportions in the intermediate years (e.g., 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, etc.) were calculated by linear interpolation between the data.

AB  - The film, Along with the Gods, the text of first episode is original webtoon “Afterlife”, the text of second episode is “Present Life”. The time of present life, modern Korean society, the road to Hades, the space of seven hells and characters－Jahong, Suhong, three angels of death and the kings of underworld etc. are same for the first and second film. In the second AG, in particular, afterlife story of three angels of death unfolds with the background of 1000 years ago－Goryo dynasty era.Jahong(the first episode) and Suhong(the second episode) complete three-step itinerary of death, afterlife and reincarnation. Along with the Gods is modern storytelling of traditional worldview of after life through these steps. As Jeju shamanist song Chasabonpuri is webtooned, cinematized into film, the characters show humanity, stereoscopical figuration, and the narrative largely extends through traditional and modern factors. There occurs rhetoric, logical and historical transformation. In addition, unique worldview unfolds in front of audience as the film reflects contemporary trends.The characters could be divided into attacker, victim and resolver. When they’re divided into affirmative and negative ones, they conflict with each other. The film also shows us the poverty of people on the margins of society and our indifference to them.Chasabonpuri was influenced by Chinese Buddhist worldview of after life, however, however, it is the process of Korean shanmanist solution how we solve the problem of life and death. Along with the Gods was producted with the motifs of Korean myths and the worldview of after life, it shows the extensity and irony of after life and present life.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to suggest several possible directions in developing childhood ecological environmental education within the Church from a Christian point of view. The ecological problems of our planet is a serious issue that currently affects humans and will continue to affect mankind for the foreseeable future. From the Christian perspective, the overall problem of the environment is a crisis of the natural world that God has created; therefore, the Church should seek to deepen and to expand ecological environmental education, since as the current the ecological crisis is a realistic and serious concern of the Christian community. For Christians, it is a reasonable that the Church must do its part in maintaining the world that God has created.Ecological environmental education is highly appropriate for children because while growing up, they undergo cognitive development as their curiosity and interests with their surroundings unfold.Because personality and sociability are also rapidly developing during childhood, it is a formative period during which children build their Christian faith through imitation, experimental experiences, and activities. When taking these points into account, education regarding stewardship to preserve or to maintain God’s creations should be provided in church.This paper defines inappropriate human perceptions and attitudes regarding the underlying cause of the current environmental crisis.Based on this premise, chapter two deals with the crisis of the ecological systems and the importance of ecological environmental education grounded in the ecological worldview. Chapter three examines the ecological environment from the perspective of creation spirituality and the necessity of developing ecological environmental education for children in church. Chapter four presents the necessary considerations for an effective and efficient implementation of ecological environmental education among children in the Christian community.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the frequency of Asian dust occurrences and the factors related to dust rises in the source region using the MODIS Land Cover data, WMO SYNOP data, and climate index data. All dust rise cases at sites which experienced more than 20 time dust rise events during the 21 years from 1997 to 2017 are analyzed. The most frequent dust rise occurred over the barren region followed by grasslands and croplands. It is found that the frequency of Asian dust events is positively correlated with the number of days on which wind speed exceeds the threshold value. It is also found that the number of days over the threshold wind speed in the barren region is negatively correlated with the wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and that the number of days over the threshold wind speed in grassland is negatively correlated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in spring.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study explores nighttime heat stress in two Midwestern regions in the United States, encompassing the cities of Minneapolis and Milwaukee. Daily minimum temperature data were obtained from the MACAv2-METDATA dataset at a 4-km resolution. The dataset was downloaded both for the historical (1950-2005) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 (2006-2099) simulations from 11 global climate models. MODIS land cover data at a 5×5 resolution were used to delineate urban and non-urban areas. Heat stress was indicated by the occurrence of hot nights in two criterions. First, the number of days with daily minimum temperatures above 300K (27Â°C) was counted to calculate decadal frequency. Second, the 95th percentile of daily minimum temperatures in the historical period was used as a threshold to calculate the duration of hot nights. The study finds that (1) hot nights (> 300K) are practically non-existent in the historical simulation but are likely to occur typically 2-3 times per decade with the RCP4.5 simulations;(2) the frequency of such events in the future can exceed 25 per decade in urban areas whereas it can be just about 1 per decade in non-urban areas depending on models; and (3) hot nights (> 95th percentile threshold) are likely to last longer in the future simulations. Overall, heat stress is projected to increase both in frequency and duration, and the urban heat island effect in terms of heat stress is projected to intensify in the future.

AB  - This study aims to strengthen the basics of formation of east asis discussion in theater, as it is analysing and considering in few ways to represent war in modern Japanese theater. From war generation to ‘Dankai Generation’ who were born after war and didn’t experience it, and ‘Zero Generation’ who appear after 2000, how war has been thought, reacted and represented in theatrical aesthetic way. This matter is more than simple materialism and questioning aesthetic problem about ‘war without gunfire’, collective self-defense right, overseas dispatch of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, the US army troops in Okinawa, etc., which is now happening in Japan. It has been actively proceeding non-governmental spontaneous Korea-Japanese theatrical exchanging business more than ever. Now this matter gives an important implication even to contemporary Korean theatrical people too. It can be an important chance for building coexisting east asis discussion in theatre as we ask and share about direction and meaning of existence, formation methodology of east asia theater while facing war as a grobal problem.Plays dealing with war have been constantly released in japanese theatre from the 1945 war defeat until now. ‘Uzuru(1949)’, folk tale play of Zyunzi Kinoshita, has been performed over 2000 times until 1980’s, and it was interesting play that showed how the reaction for war had been changed in times and generations. Minoru Betsyaku asks responsibility for war and responsibility of the older generation in ‘The Little Match Girl’. There is only differences methodology and internalization aspect of experiencing war, war has always been an important topic in Japanese theatre.This study also aims to raise a possibility for discussion as the unbalance between practice and academical research in modern Japanese theatre is aesthetically, logically arranged. Ways to represent war in modern Japanese theatre can be largely divided into 4 aspects. Way that actively deliver message for anti-war adapting political agitating play of Sprechchor or epic theater technique of Brecht like Hisashi Inoue, Youzi Sakate. Way that embody eschatological worldview in absurdes theater technique like Chikao Tanaka, So Kitamura. Way that unconsciously reveal past imperialistic nostalgia through melodramatic mechanism like Kunio Kishida, Oriza Hirata. Way that represent war in a cynical attitude for catching features of rapid economical growth and mass consumption society sensitively like Kohei Tsuka, Toshiki Okada. It is also an important goal of this study that figure out differences between a way that think war as a matter of own history like Chikao Tanaka, Hisashi Inoue and another way that think war as a matter of global problem.

AB  - Pak Chonghong (1903~1976) is one of the main agents in founding Korean modern philosophy. His philosophical lineages are rooted in at least three different traditions. In his early years he studied the Chinese classics; then, during the Japanese colonial period, he pursued his education at the official public schools where he came into contact with the Meiji cultural nationalism. Later on, he studied at Keijo Imperial University where he learnt, through the Japanese translations and the German original texts, about the Western philosophy which included in particular that of Heidegger but also other early existentialists and formed the basis of his philosophical worldview. Pak had the firm conviction that his task was to offer a modern reinterpretation of the Korean philosophical tradition. Indeed, he made significant contributions towards modernizing the Buddhist and Confucian legacy by describing this pre-modern philosophy with modern philosophical terms. However, his approach to ‘modernity’ was as uncritical as the Japanese conservative cultural nationalist theories he had read and assimilated were. Not only did he de-historicize and embellish the traditional Korean ideology, but he selected and used this embellished ideology in constructing civic ethics for the development of modern authoritarianism. Ultimately, Pak Chonghong’s ‘modernization of tradition’ became part of Park Chong Hee’s patriotic discourse of ‘modernizing the nation’ and his cultural nationalism an underlying form of state-propagated nationalism.

AB  - (Background and Purpose) Excessive artificial nightlight is considered a pollutant that adversely affects human health and ecosystems. Since the enactment of the Light Pollution Prevention Law in Korea, central and local governments have made efforts to monitor exposure to night pollution and mitigate its damage. Monitoring nightlight emission levels and night pollution damage takes a substantial amount of time and effort in collecting data that are useful for designing light pollution mitigation policies. Various methods for diagnosing light pollution must be developed to manage and control light pollution effectively. In particular, the monitoring of light pollution in urban space is crucial since urban areas are night pollution hotspots. The purpose of this study is to diagnose light emission levels and systematically and quantitatively identify changing patterns in Seoul. This study also evaluates local characteristics of sub regions in Seoul that show rapid changes in their nightlight emission levels. (Method) This study uses satellite nightlight data to quantify and measure urban light emission levels from 2012 to 2016. We use the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Day and Night Band (DNB) data from the Earth Ovsercation Group (EOG) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We create yearly composite data to calculate the light intensity of Seoul to evaluate the city’s light pollution status and change patterns. We also use Getis- Ord-Gi* statistics to identify nightlight hotspot areas. (Results) The results show that the total nightlight emission amounts in Seoul slightly decreased between 2012 and 2016 due to reductions in the following areas: (1) the Gusan-Yeokchon-Nokbeon-Eungam-Susaek-Gajwa areas in the Eunpyeong District, (2) the Mokdong-Ilsang areas, (3) the Singil-Sindaebang-Sillim-Seoul National University areas, and (4) aged business districts in the Gangnam areas: Gangnam-Apgujeong-Cheongdam-Nonhyeon-Seolleung areas. The proportion of highly polluted urban spaces has increased over time due to two main reasons: (1) the development of existing and new commercial areas (e.g., Hongdae, Itaewon, Jong-ro) and (2) new urban land development projects organized for mass housing-supply projects (e.g., Magok and Segok district). (Conclusions) The results of this study provide basic evidence for current nightlight emission changes in Seoul and methodologies to monitor light emissions and manage light pollution. Finally, this study can also be used to supplement the criteria for designation of the current four categories of lighting management zones. The results of this study (1) present methodologies to monitor nightlight emissions at a macro urban scale; (2) provide basic understanding and evidence for current and changing nightlight emission patterns; and (3) identify areas that have a high probability of light pollution exposure.

AB  - In this study, we developed the Soil Moisture Data Assimilation (SMDA) scheme to extract Effective Soil Characteristics-ESC (Sand, Silt, Clay %) from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The SMDA scheme was applied to the MODIS-based Soil Moisture (SM) data during the summer (July to September) period. Then the ESC and soil erosion factors (K) were predicted, respectively. Several numerical experiments were conducted to test the performance of SMDA at the study sites under the synthetic and field validation conditions. In the synthetic experiment, the estimated soil moistures values(R: >0.990 and RMSE: <0.005) were identified well with the synthetic observations. The field validation results at the Bangdongri and Chungmicheon sites were also comparable to the TDR-based measurements with the statistics (R: 0.772/0.000 and RMSE: 0.065/0.000). The estimated ESC values were also matched well with the measurements for the synthetic and field validation conditions. Then we tested the SMDA scheme to extract the ESC from the MODIS-based soil moisture products. Although uncertainties exist in the results, the estimated soil moisture and ESC based on the SMDA were comparable to the measurements. Overall, the K factors were similarly distributed based on the derived ESC. Also, the K factors in the mountainous regions were higher than those of the relatively flat areas. Thus, the newly developed SMDA scheme can be useful to estimate spatially and temporally-distributed soil erosion and establish soil erosion management plans.

M3  - research-article
AB  - With increasing satellite-based RS(Remotely Sensed) techniques, RS soil moisture footprints have been providing for various purposes at the spatio-temporal scales in hydrology, agriculture, etc. However, their coarse resolutions still limit the applicability of RS soil moisture to field regions. To overcome these drawbacks, the LDA(Landsat-based Downscaling Algorithm) was developed to downscale RS soil moisture footprints from the coarse- to finer-scales. LDA estimates Landsat-based soil moisture(30m×30m) values in a spatial domain, and then the weighting values based on the Landsat-based soil moisture estimates were derived at the finer-scale. Then, the coarse-scale RS soil moisture footprints can be downscaled based on the derived weighting values. The LW21(Little Washita) site in Oklahoma(USA) was selected to validate the LDA scheme. In-situ soil moisture data measured at the multiple sampling locations that can reprent the airborne sensing ESTAR(Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer, 800m×800m) scale were available at the LW21 site. LDA downscaled the ESTAR soil moisture products, and the downscaled values were validated with the in-situ measurements. The soil moisture values downscaled from ESTAR were identified well with the in-situ measurements, although uncertainties exist. Furthermore, the SMAP(Soil Moisture Active & Passive, 9km×9km) soil moisture products were downscaled by the LDA. Although the validation works have limitations at the SMAP scale, the downscaled soil moisture values can represent the land surface condition. Thus, the LDA scheme can downscale RS soil moisture products with easy application and be helpful for efficient water management plans in hydrology, agriculture, environment, etc. at field regions.

AB  - In this study, we assessed meteorological and agricultural drought based on the SPI(Standardized Precipitation Index), SMP(Soil Moisture Percentile), and SMDI(Soil Moisture Deficit Index) indices using satellite-based TRMM(Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission)/GPM(Global Precipitation Measurement) images at the province of Chungcheongbuk-do. The long-term(2000-2015) TRMM/GPM precipitation data were used to estimate the SPI values. Then, we estimated the spatially-/temporally-distributed soil moisture values based on the near-surface soil moisture data assimilation scheme using the TRMM/GPM and MODIS(MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. Overall, the SPI value was significantly affected by the precipitation at the study region, while both the precipitation and land surface condition have influences on the SMP and SMDI values. But the SMP index showed the relatively extreme wet/dry conditions compared to SPI and SMDI, because SMP only calculates the percentage of current wetness condition without considering the impacts of past wetness condition. Considering that different drought indices have their own advantages and disadvantages, the SMDI index could be useful for evaluating agricultural drought and establishing efficient water management plans.

AB  - Climate change has caused changes in environmental factors that have a direct impact on agriculture such as temperature and precipitation. Themeteorological disaster that has the greatest impact on agriculture is drought, and its forecasts are closely related to agricultural production and watersupply. In the case of terrestrial data, the accuracy of the spatial map obtained by interpolating the each point data is lowered because it is based onthe point observation. Therefore, acquisition of various meteorological data through satellite imagery can complement this terrestrial based droughtmonitoring. In this study, Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) was used as satellite data for drought determination. The ESI was developed by NASA andUSDA, and is calculated through thermal observations of GOES satellites, MODIS, Landsat 5, 7 and 8. We will identify the difference between ESIand other satellite-based drought assessment indices (Vegetation Health Index, VHI, Leaf Area Index, LAI, Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI), and useit to analyze the drought in South Korea, and examines the applicability of ESI as a new indicator of agricultural drought monitoring.

AB  - As the urbanization ratio increases, the heat environment in cities is becoming more important due to the urban heat island. In this study, the heat island spatial analysis was calculated and conducted for analysis of urban thermal environment of Sejong city, which was launched in 2012 and has been developed rapidly. To analyze the ratio and change rate of urban area, a multi temporal land cover map (2013 to 2015 and 2017) of study area is generated based on Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager / Thermal Infrared Sensor) satellite imagery.Then, we select an TIR (Thermal Infrared) band from the two TIR bands provided by the Landsat-8, which is used for calculating the heat island potential, through the accuracy evaluation of the brightness temperature and AWS (Automatic Weathering Station) data. Based on the selected band and surface emissivity, land surface temperature is calculated and the estimated heat island potential change is analyzed. As a result, the land surface temperature of the high ratio and change rate of urban area was significantly higher than the surrounding area around 3℃ to 4℃, and the heat island potential was also higher around 4℃ to 5℃. However, the heat island phenomenon was alleviated in urban areas with high rate of change that also show high green area ratio.Therefore, we demonstrated that dense urban area increases the possibility of inducing heat island, but it can mitigate the heat island through green areas.

This guideline suggested making land surface temperature maps with satellite images(such as Landsat 8) by combining maximum temperature of each pixel among images taken for last 3 years. Land surface temperature maps in Cheongju-si,a pilot-test area, indicated the difference of temperature caused by land cover types. These maps helped to identify the distribution of heat islands(industrial complexes, etc.) and they also could contribute to establish plans for regulation of urban heat distribution.

TI  - A Critical Reflection and Challenge of the Korean Church’s Hermeneutical Pre-understandings for Preaching the Gospel: On the Basis of the Buddhist and Confucian Faith Tradition of Scripture

AB  - Preaching of the Korean Church (the Korean Church means the church as a whole, not a Korean church which means one building) is characterized by the practice of evoking people’s wills and pushing them forward to doing what they heard. This characteristics of Korean preaching is more demanding and justified as the secularization of the church and the discrepancy between faith and life become more serious. The question raised by such a character of preaching, however, is that whether it comes to being as the result of what the dynamical conversation between eisegesis and exegesis makes or not. It might be, as Stanley Fish notes, an interpretative strategy that the interpretative community to where the church belongs has been already sharing in common. The course of finding a reasonable answer to the question would be a theological work that helps the Korean Church to get to a more biblical and theological practice of preaching the gospel, which is the world of God to which the biblical text witnesses. This study is, as an attempt for such a journey, to examine the Buddhist and Confucian faith tradition of scriptures which has formed the hermeneutical pre-understandings of Korean preaching. As scriptural religions, the Buddhist and Confucian faiths have played an important role for shaping aspects of intellectual civilization such as social consciousness, ideology, worldview, thoughts of heaven and humans, and ethical and value systems of Korea over for 1700 years. Now, it works as a hermeneutical preunderstanding for Korean preaching to read the Christian scripture. Accordingly, this study would help the Korean Church identifying the intellectual foundations that have built the understandings of the scripture, humans, God, gospel, and salvation into Korean preaching.Furthermore, this study, in the sharply tensive position to universal religions, attempts a critical assessment of the hermeneutical premise, which is featured by moralistic, karmic, and human-centered view of faith. In some points of view, theological pre-understandings for biblical interpretation do not go along with that of the Buddhist and Confucian tradition.Closing to the study, this research presents some proposals for dealing with challenges that Korean preaching would face in preaching the world of Christ-gospel to which the church’s scripture witnesses.

AB  - The word ἐκκλησίαhas been used 114 times in the New Testament and the word bears witness to two backgrounds. Among 114 times in use in the New Testament only 3 times exceptional use has been found in Acts. These uses of 3 times in Acts bear witness to the Classical Greek background, which simply means ‘the assembly of the people of polis,’ not the Christian church. 3 times exceptional use has been found only in Acts 19: 32, 39, 41, and 3 times use of ἐκκλησίαin the context has nothing to do with the Christian church, and all three words in the context mean the assembly of the Ephesians shouting, gathered together in the theater. The remaining 111 times in the New Testament, including 20 times except for 3 times exception in Acts, are related to the Old Testament background. The background of the remaining 111 times out of all 114 in the New Testament is related to the two words, lh'q,e' which is translated into ‘assembly’ and hr[" ,e which is translated into ‘congregation’ in New Korean Revised Version. In the Old Testament the word lh'q'e is used in various meanings, but the the word is originally related to the covenantmaking or the covenant renewal assembly of the israelites, the then people of God, and the word hr"[e is related to the congregation around the Tent of Meeting, which means sacreficial community or worship community. Then Scripture presents the church as the people of God which is the covenant community and the worship community, and as the body of Christ, and as the temple of the Holy Spirit.And the attributes and marks of the church belong to two different dimensions, but are practically related to each other, and the one is called the inside of the church, and the other the outside of the church.The writer suggests three things for the future preparation of the Korean Church: 1) It is necessary to know what the church and the Christian life exactly means from the historical Reformed perspective. 2) It is necessary to bring up people who are faithful to the Reformed worldview. 3) It is necessary to foster the next generation of responsible leaders.

AB  - As animal welfare issue becomes important, the European Union bans conventional cages for laying hens from 2012. So the alternative housing systems like floor pens, aviaries or free range systems have been suggested. From 2011 to 2014, we monitored 20 welfare-oriented laying hen farms in South Korea to figure out serological status of major viral diseases. During this period, total 3,219 blood samples were collected from the randomly selected chickens to test and evaluate the hemagglutination inhibition titers for low pathogenic avian influenza, Newcastle disease and egg drop syndrome ’76. A total of 2,926 blood samples were tested through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess the serological status of infectious bronchitis (IB). The distribution of ELISA titers for IB was various from almost 0 to 20,000 through the all weeks of age. Also, the antibody coefficient of variation for most of the diseases in this study was higher than those of typical cage layers. As this study was the first surveillance for major avian viral diseases of the animal welfare-oriented farms in South Korea, the results obtained from this study will help to determine what information and resources are needed to maintain better biosecurity and to improve the health and welfare of laying hen flocks.

AB  - This thesis surveyed Doo-jin Park’s poems and Chun-soo Kim’s poems which unraveled the anguish of history and their times. Park expressed the man’s sin and salvation as a Christian endpoint. In the “Acts of the Apostles” series, he embodied the poet’s sense of solitude by breaking the wall of human existence. Kim focused on the ideological violence of history and grasped Jesus as a scapegoat of history. Jesus was a man of sorrow who endured the tragic life as the incarnation of love. When I looked over the notions of death on these two poets, I noticed that Park did not accept the death as merely a physical end, but hoped the body arisen of a resurrection someday. Kim understood the death of Jesus as an inevitable death with the flesh, and accepted Jesus as a psychological truth for mankind. The worldview that Kim explored the antinomy of history was resulted in a mythical world. Kim was interested in the son of man who was made up to Christ after death. But Park was interested in the Man-God who was Christ. The worldview of Du-jin Park was based on his christian belief and acted up to his literary spirit.

AB  - Shin Chae-ho expressed the problem of anarchist violence through Gung-hyeon in "An iron hammer of the King Ilmok". "A declaration of Korea's Revolution" also reflects the traces of Buddhist thought. However, after he realized that Buddhist thinking alone can not end colonialism, he accepted anarchism. Walter Benjamin presented Judaism anarchist violence by comparing mythical violence and divine violence in "Zur kritik der gewalt". However, in the "Franz Kafka" he recognized the violence of modern society from the perspective of Judaism, recognizing the limits of divine violence. In short, Shin Chae-ho tried to abolish the Buddhist worldview by combining Buddhism and anarchism and to practice anarchism directly. Walter Benjamin, on the other hand, fused Judaism with anarchism, critically recognizing the anarchist practice and mediating Judaism and historical materialism.

AB  - This paper examines the idea of Yi Byeongheon(李炳憲, 1870-1940)’s idea of the Heaven, which appears in his Cheon-hak(天學, Learning of the Heaven). While previous neo-Confucian(性理學) idea of the Heaven was being shaken by the introduction and spread of modern Western astronomy, Yi Byeongheon criticized the Li-qi theory(理氣論) of neo-Confucian metaphysics on the basis of modern astronomy and suggested his own unique idea of the Heaven which emphasized the transcendency and sovereignty of the Heaven. By accepting the knowledge of modern astronomy such as the terrestrial globe, the heliocentrism and the planetary movement, and by assuming the universe independent from the ‘qi’(氣) of the Yin-Yang Five Elements(陰陽五行), he denied both previous cosmology that insisted hemispheric sky and rectangular earth and geocentrism and the neo-Confucian idea of the Unity of Heaven and Human(天人合一論). However, he still recognized the Heaven as the source of religious faith in Confucianism. Recognizing the Heaven as the Heavenly Emperor(上帝) presiding over all things of the universe and by defining its attributes as “Deity(神)”, he emphasized the transcendency and sovereignty of the Heaven.Such a thought was a unique idea that recognized both the Western astronomy and the religious aspect of Confucianism as complementary, and synthesized both. And this came from the consciousness of the problem to establish the world-view base in seeking the restoration of Confucianism as the original form of Confucius. Such an idea of Yi Byeongheon can evaluate its originality as an example of attempting to solve the problem by strengthening the transcendency and sovereignty of the Heaven instead of responding to the challenge of modern science on the previous neo-Confucian worldview.

AB  - This study tried to suggest the development of a writing education model for Christian Universities based on both Hobbs’ media education model and Vanhoozer’s media text analysis model. This model consists of 6 steps- Christian worldview establishment, access, analysis and evaluation, creation, reflection and social action. This was developed in order to be applied for the class “reading and writing” of liberal arts. Also, this is an appropriate model for media text writing education aiming at an alternative creation activity through a critical comprehension of the complex texts consisting of sounds, images, letters and so on. Furthermore, this is designed to train the capable persons having intelligence, character, and spirituality balanced, whom the education of Chrisitian universities aims at. Finally, this model pursues the student-friendly and amalgamative text writing appropriate for a new era and has an advantage to raise the power of various forms of letter writing which all the universities should stress as well.

It revealed how young adult women discovered their own voice through narrative. Specifically, how counseling helped young adult women who were trying to find their own identity was examined. Following the qualitative case research method, two young adult women seeking help in the university counseling center were chosen as research participants, and gathered materials are from June, 2015 to December, 2016. Those cases were analyzed and interpreted through the narrative perspective. Kim, Mi Yeon decided to face the challenge of changing her major, which was against her father's wishes. This was the proof of her identity and was the identity trial to take responsibility of her own life. Lee, Min Hee was a young adult woman who was not sure about herself, but she wanted to satisfy everyone else's needs. However, her experience as a University Association leader made her realize that she has her own voice. Kim, Mi Yeon and Lee, Min Hee had a common experience that they couldn't raise their voice just because they are young women. However, by telling their own stories, they could start a journey of finding their own voice and identity. Finally, narrative’s contribution and limitations in this process of finding their identity were discussed.

AB  - Based on the Worldview Verification Theory (WVT), the purpose of this study was to examine whether belief in a just world would moderate the relationship between perceived gender discrimination and self-esteem. According to WVT, greater belief in a just world increases the negative effect of perceived discrimination on self-esteem. In study 1, we measured perceived gender discrimination, belief in a just world, and self-esteem among 200 women (aged at least 20). and the result indicated that the moderating effect of belief in a just world was significant. That is, as belief in a just world was greater, the negative effect of perceived gender discrimination on self-esteem increased. In study 2, using priming approach, we examined the moderating effect of belief in a just world. For this, 160 women (aged at least 20) randomly assigned to either gender non-discriminatory group or gender discriminatory group and completed priming tasks. Findings suggested that belief in a just world moderated the association between group and self-esteem. Specifically, the positive association between BJW and self-esteem was smaller in gender discriminatory group, compared to non-discriminatory group.

AB  - This paper’s purpose is to determine the political and discursive effect  inherent in contemporary artist Yinka Shonibare’s artistic practice who is ‘writing back’ colonialism which has been forgotten by many of the contemporaries and to consider aesthetic meaning based on his artistic practice which tells us not ‘politics itself’ but ‘politics by art’.In this paper, I will to analyze the meaning and effect of textual  politics based on hybridity, focusing on Shonibale’s work, <Gallantry and Criminal Conversation>(2002). By recognizing the discursive ‘hybridity’ in the process of production, Shonibale does not simply reverse the dichotomous hierarchy or play hasty the integration of social hostility and contradiction. Rather, it links the conditions of the given opposition and visualizes the process of negotiation of the existing ‘differences’ in the ‘in between’. Through this, Shonibale’s work provides an opportunity for understanding the political act that can tolerate and control the ‘difference’ structure and the moment of mutual intervention instead of the hostile and confrontational politics based on a dichotomical worldview that restricts our reason.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Christian self - leadership based on vocation vision can be an important tool in university mission. Christian Self-Leadership means that a college student sets his or her identity and purpose on the basis of the Bible, selects and prepares his or her vocation vision based on his talents given by God, so that they can develop their own influence to live a happy life, and contribute not only to businesses and Society, but to the kingdom of God. In terms of self-management, this leadership allows college students to design and lead their own lives through self-discovery, job search, matching, and specific roadmap on their mission and vision base. This leadership, at the organizational and community level, enables students to understand the mission and goals of the organization and community through self-leadership learning and experience, to be fully aware of their role in the organization, to work with other members to achieve organizational performance.The purpose of this paper is to propose a Christian self-leadership program based on job vision, which not only builds Christian students as self-leaders, but also provides meaningful leadership training for non-Christian students as a direct and indirect mission tool.

TI  - Monitoring ice variations in Qinghai Lake from 1979 to 2016 using passive microwave remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change. Based on the disparities between the brightness temperatures of lake ice and water, passive microwave data can be used to monitor the ice variations of a lake. With focus on the analysis of long time series variability of lake ice, this study extracts four characteristic dates related to lake ice (the annual freeze start, freeze completion, ablation start and ablation completion dates) for Qinghai Lake from 1979 to 2016 using Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave brightness temperature data. The corresponding freezing duration, ablation duration, complete freezing duration and ice coverage duration are calculated. Applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow products, the accuracy of the results derived from passive microwave data is validated. The validation analysis shows a strong agreement (R-2 ranges from 0.70 to 0.85, mean absolute error (MAE) ranges from 2.25 to 3.94 days) in the freeze start, ablation start, and ablation completion dates derived from the MODIS data and passive microwave data; the ice coverage duration also has a small error (relative error (RE) = 2.95%, MAE = 3.13 days), suggesting that the results obtained from passive microwave data are reliable. The results show that the freezing dates of Qinghai Lake have been delayed and the ablation dates have advanced. Over 38 years, the freeze start date and freeze completion date have been pushed back by 6.16 days and 2.27 days, respectively, while the ablation start date and ablation completion date have advanced by 11.24 days and 14.09 days, respectively. The freezing duration and ablation duration have shortened by 3.89 days and 2.85 days, respectively, and the complete freezing duration and ice coverage duration have shortened by 14.84 days and 21.21 days, respectively. There is a significant negative correlation between the ice coverage duration and the mean air temperature in winter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantitative estimation of 21st-century urban greenspace changes in Chinese populous cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal changes of urban greenspace is a critical requirement for supporting urban planning and maintaining the function of urbanities. Although plenty of previous studies have attempted to estimate urban greenspace changes in China, there still remain shortcomings such as inconsistent surveying procedures and insufficient spatial resolution and city samples. Using cloud-free Landsat image composites in circa years 2000 and 2014, and Defense Meteorological Program Satellite Program's Operational Line-scan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime lights dataset, we quantitatively estimated the urban greenspace changes regarding both administrative divisions and urban core boundaries across 98 Chinese populous cities. Results showed that a consistent decline of urban greenspace coverage was identified at both old and new urban areas in the majority of analyzed cities (i.e., 81.63% of cities regarding the administrative boundaries, and 86.73% of cities regarding the urban core boundaries). Partial correlation analysis also revealed that total urban greenspace area shrank as a linear function of the core urban expansion (R-2 = 0.28, P < 0.001), and a significant correlation was confirmed between population change and urban greenspace change across those Chinese populous cities included in this study (R2 = 0.11, P < 0.001).

TI  - Landscape determinants of spatio-temporal patterns of aerosol optical depth in the two most polluted metropolitans in the United States
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated concentration of atmospheric aerosols during severe urban air pollution episodes necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying determinants for a sustainable urban environment. The 15-year (2001-2015) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data for the Phoenix and Los Angeles Metropolitan Areas were applied to examine the spatio-temporal patterns and dynamics of urban aerosols. The strongly correlated temporal trends of AOD were observed due to the similar seasonal pattern of aerosol emissions and potential synoptic connections between two areas. Relatively higher mean value and lower decreasing trend of AOD were found in the PMA. Correlations reveal that topography is the predominant factor affecting the spatial pattern of AOD, as compared to the urban land use and vegetation. The effect of urbanization on air pollution varies with preexisting landscape, which apparently alleviates aerosol concentration in the PMA. Vegetation mitigates air pollution despite its emission of fine mode aerosols. As a cross-validation, the ground-measured concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) were compared against AOD. The abnormal weak positive or strong negative AOD-PM2.5 associations result from the relatively small portion of anthropogenic aerosols and the changing atmospheric boundary layer height.

TI  - Temporal trends of surface urban heat islands and associated determinants in major Chinese cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many studies focusing on spatial variations of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) in literature. In this study, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and China's Land Use/Cover Datasets (CLUDs) were used to examine the temporal trends of SUHIs in 31 major Chinese cities during 2001-2015 using three indicators: SUHI intensity (SUHII), area of the SUHI (Area(SUHI)) and percentage of area with increasing SUHII (PAISUHII). Correlation analyses between SUHII and background (rural) LST (extracted from MODIS LST), vegetation coverage (reflected by MODIS EVI data) and anthropogenic heat release (reflected by nighttime light data) were performed from temporal rather than spatial perspectives. Our findings showed that the SUHII and AreaSUHI in urbanized areas increased significantly in most cities in summer days, whereas they increased significantly in approximately half and more than half of the cities in summer and winter nights, respectively. In summer days, summer nights and winter nights, the PAISUHII was approximately 80% and over 50% in union areas and the 20 km buffer, respectively. Correlation analyses indicated that the SUHII in stable urban areas was negatively correlated with the background LST in summer and winter days for most cities, especially in northern China. A reduction in vegetation contributed to the increasing SUHII in urbanized areas in summer days and nights. The increasing anthropogenic heat release was an important factor for increases in the SUHII in urbanized areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Recent changes in Jadukata fan (Bangladesh) in response to Holocene tectonics
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Originating from the base of southern foothill of the Shillong Plateau, Jadukata fan is one of the largest fans situated in the mid-northern edge of Bangladesh. The area in and around Jadukata fan lies in the active and complex Himalayan tectonic zone as envisaged by the high seismicity in the area. The fan was studied with the main objective of understanding the formation and development of this tropical, humid alluvial fan in relation to Holocene tectonics. The geological and geomorphological inferences are based on multi-temporal remote sensing data. Information extracted from RS data were checked in the field and compared with other relevant data and information. Identified evidences are topographic expression, anomalous and preferred channel migration, aligned bends in consecutive channels, change in sediments distribution pattern etc. on the fan. These geological and geomorphological evidences as well as past and recent seismic events of the area strongly indicate that the alluvial fan building processes is being controlled by the neotectonic activities. The article also highlights the reasons for the occurrences of the natural hazard based on on-going tectonic activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To detect the knockdown resistance (kdr) gene mutations in Cu/ox tritae niorhyric has resist: ma or susceptible to DDT and deltamethrin, in order to elucidate the relationship between the resistant phenotype and kdr mutations. Methods C. tritaeniorhyne hus mosquitoes were captured in Zhaoyang, Mang Shi, jiang Cheng and.Meng Lian in Yunnan Province, and exposed to inn and deltamethrin, respectively. The resulting alive and dead ones were counted. Genomic DNA was extracted by individual mosquitoes. The k dr gene was amplified by PCB and analyzed. The frequency of k dr genotypes was estimated in resistant and susceptible samples. The relationship between kdr genotypes and resistant phenotypes was analyzed by Chi-square test. Results A total of 411 mosquitoes were genotyped for the kdr gene. Mutation was detected at codon 1014, yielding two alleles, the wihltype TTA/L and the mutant TTT/F, and three genotypes, the wild - type homozygote UL (frequency, 96.35%; 396/411), the mutant homozygote FY (0.73%; 3/411) and the wild/mutant heterozygous L/L (2.92%; 12/411). The frequencies of mutant genotype in DDT-resistant and -susceptible individuals were 3.42% (4/117) and 3.88% (4/103), respectively; While those in deltamethrin-resistant and -susceptible individuals were 3.96% (4/101) and 133% (3/90), 'respectively. Chi-square test revealed that there was no correlation between kdr genotype frequency and the resistance phenotypes to either DDT ([chi]2 = (0.034, P> 005) or deltamethrin ([chi]2 = 0.053, P > (LOS). Conclusion We found a novel L1014F mutant allele for kdr, albeit with a low frequency. There is no correlation between kdr gene mutation and the resistance phenotypes to either DDT or del tamethrin.

TI  - Late Pleistocene-Holocene strain release by normal faulting along the Main Boundary Thrust at Logar in the northwestern Kumaon Sub Himalaya, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A prominent NW-SE trending linear fault, the Logar Fault, which vertically displaced the Quaternary alluvial fan (Logar fan) was delineated previously at Logar village in northwestern Kumaon Sub Himalaya. Based on the surface expression of the discontinuous scarp, and its expression on the satellite data, the fault has been further extended on either sides to a total length of similar to 9.5 km, which in part lies in the older Himalayan mega thrust zone of weakness, the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT). The distinctive south side up scarp maintains linearity throughout its length, cut across the Logar mega fan and thus form as a normal fault within the compressive regime. Logar normal fault has truncated and uplifted a remnant of the Logar fan by > 15 m since its deposition similar to 20ka, based on the OSL dates of the fan sediments. A trench excavation survey across the Logar Fault scarp for paleoseismic investigation was carried out at Bairasari village. Variable height of the fault scarp along its strike suggests multiple faulting events that occurred along the same fault yielded a cumulative vertical height from 15-38 m. The OSL ages from the footwall show multilevel surfaces deposited between 20 and 8.7ka. However, in the hanging wall, the base of the vertically stacked deposits show an age similar to 20ka. The OSL age in the bottom unit of the trench in the hanging wall suggest commencement of post faulting deposition of the units after 20ka. In the footwall, younger ages of 11 and 8.7ka probably represent the youngest dated activity of the fault. The ages obtained across the fault shows that the 20ka deposits are displaced. The nature of faulting of Logar fan suggest its genetic link with seismic activity in this region. The geomorphic expression of the Logar Fault along the Himalayan mega thrust suggest subsequent tectonic activity along the MBT. The active Logar normal fault identified north of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) indicates that elastic strain released within the hanging wall is not limited to the front, but it is dispersed above the decollement over a broad area.

TI  - Dengue and yellow fever virus vectors: seasonal abundance, diversity and resting preferences in three Kenyan cities
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The transmission patterns of dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, especially in urban settings, are influenced by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquito abundance and behavior. Despite recurrent dengue outbreaks on the Kenyan coast, these parameters remain poorly defined in this and other areas of contrasting dengue endemicity in Kenya. In assessing the transmission risk of DENV/YFV in three Kenyan cities, we determined adult abundance and resting habits of potential Aedes (Stegomyia) vectors in Kilifi (dengue-outbreak prone), and Nairobi and Kisumu (no dengue outbreaks reported). In addition, mosquito diversity, an important consideration for changing mosquito-borne disease dynamics, was compared.Methods: Between October 2014 and June 2016, host-seeking adult mosquitoes were sampled using CO2-baited BG-Sentinel traps (12 traps daily) placed in vegetation around homesteads, across study sites in the three major cities. Also, indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes were sampled using Prokopack aspirators. Three samplings, each of five consecutive days, were conducted during the long-rains, short-rains and dry season for each city. Intercity and seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and diversity was evaluated using general linear models while mosquito-resting preference (indoors vs outdoors) was compared using Chi-square test.Results: Aedes aegypti, which comprised 60% (n = 7772) of the total 12,937 host-seeking mosquitoes collected, had comparable numbers in Kisumu (45.2%, n = 3513) and Kilifi (37.7%, n = 2932), both being significantly higher than Nairobi (17.1%, n = 1327). Aedes aegypti abundance was significantly lower in the short-rains and dry season relative to the long-rains (P < 0.0001). Aedes bromeliae, which occurred in low numbers, did not differ significantly between seasons or cities. Mosquito diversity was highest during the long-rains and in Nairobi. Only 10% (n = 43) of the 450 houses aspirated were found positive for resting Ae. aegypti, with overall low captures in all areas. Aedes aegypti densities were comparable indoors/outdoors in Kilifi; but with higher densities outdoors than indoors in Kisumu and Nairobi.Conclusions: The presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti near human habitations and dwellings, especially in Kilifi/Kisumu, is suggestive of increased DENV transmission risk due to higher prospects of human vector contact. Despite low abundance of Ae. bromeliae suggestive of low YFV transmission risk, its proximity to human habitation as well as the observed diversity of potential YFV vectors should be of public health concern and monitored closely for targeted control. The largely outdoor resting behavior for Ae. aegypti provides insights for targeted adult vector control especially during emergency outbreak situations.

TI  - Ribotype 078 <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection incidence in Dutch hospitals is not associated with provincial pig farming: Results from a national sentinel surveillance, 2009-2015
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIt has been suggested that the high incidence of ribotype 078 Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in the Netherlands is related to pig farming.MethodsWe used data of hospitalised CDI patients (> 2yrs of age) diagnosed between May 2009 and May 2015 in 26 hospitals participating in a national sentinel surveillance. We compared clinical and geographical characteristics of 078 CDI to other CDI. We investigated the association between 078 CDI incidence and four indicators of pig farming (piglet, pig, piglet farm and pig farm density) by mixed-effects Poisson regression. We used a space-time permutation model to search for community-onset 078 CDI clusters (using SaTScan).ResultsA total of 4,691 CDI were identified. Ribotype 078 was isolated in 493 of 3,756 patients (13.1%) including a typing result. These patients had slightly higher community-onset disease and a 35% increase of 30-day mortality compared to non-078 CDI patients. The pooled overall and 078 incidence rates were 2.82 (95% CI, 2.42-3.29) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.21-0.31) CDI per 10,000 patients-days respectively. Hospital 078 CDI incidence was not associated with provincial pig (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08), piglet (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75-1.19), pig farm (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.39), or piglet farm density (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.56-1.79). No clusters of community-onset ribotype 078 CDI were found.ConclusionsOur results do not indicate that the ribotype 078 CDI incidence in hospitals is related to pig (farm) or piglet (farm) density. However, transmission beyond provincial borders or in nonhospitalised patients cannot be excluded.

TI  - Sentinel-3A Views Ocean Variability More Accurately at Finer Resolution
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first multiplatform evaluation involving data from the new Sentinel-3A altimeter. An experiment was undertaken in the Algerian Basin, employing an ocean glider and a ship mission, along the same track and synchronous with an overpass of the Sentinel-3A mission. This provided three independent views of the ocean velocity field, along a section that encompassed three different oceanographic regimes. The results demonstrate the capacity of Sentinel-3A to retrieve fine-scale oceanographic features (similar to 20km). The intercomparison with in situ platforms showed a significant improvement, order 30% in resolution and 42% in velocity accuracy using a synthetic aperture radar mode with respect to lower-resolution mode of conventional altimetry. In addition, the three-platform view provided valuable insight into the variability of evolving oceanographic features, in an area of the Mediterranean that remains chronically under sampled.

TI  - Winter Sentinel-1 Backscatter as a Predictor of Spring Arctic Sea Ice Melt Pond Fraction
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring melt pond fraction (f(p)) has been shown to influence September sea ice extent and, with a growing need to improve melt pond physics in climate and forecast models, observations at large spatial scales are needed. We present a novel technique for estimating f(p) on sea ice at high spatial resolution from the Sentinel-1 satellite during the winter period leading up to spring melt. A strong correlation (r = -0.85) is found between winter radar backscatter and f(p) from first-year and multiyear sea ice data collected in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) in 2015. Observations made in the CAA in 2016 are used to validate a f(p) retrieval algorithm, and a f(p) prediction for the CAA in 2017 is made. The method is effective using the horizontal transmit and receive polarization channel only and shows promise for providing seasonal, pan-Arctic, f(p) maps for improved understanding of melt pond distributions and forecast model skill.

TI  - Volcano and Ship Tracks Indicate Excessive Aerosol-Induced Cloud Water Increases in a Climate Model
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interaction is the most uncertain mechanism of anthropogenic radiative forcing of Earth's climate, and aerosol-induced cloud water changes are particularly poorly constrained in climate models. By combining satellite retrievals of volcano and ship tracks in stratocumulus clouds, we compile a unique observational data set and confirm that liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosols are bidirectional, and on average the increases in LWP are closely compensated by the decreases. Moreover, the meteorological parameters controlling the LWP responses are strikingly similar between the volcano and ship tracks. In stark contrast to observations, there are substantial unidirectional increases in LWP in the Hadley Centre climate model, because the model accounts only for the decreased precipitation efficiency and not for the enhanced entrainment drying. If the LWP increases in the model were compensated by the decreases as the observations suggest, its indirect aerosol radiative forcing in stratocumulus regions would decrease by 45%.Plain Language Summary It remains unclear how much of the global warming induced by greenhouse gases is offset by aerosols because the effect of aerosol particles on clouds is the most uncertain mechanism of forcing of Earth's climate by human activities. Cloud water responses to aerosols are especially uncertain. Here we compare the properties of low marine clouds impacted by volcanic and ship emissions with the properties of the nearby unpolluted clouds in order to increase the understanding of aerosol impacts on clouds. Clouds impacted by emissions from volcanoes and ships lose or gain water depending on meteorological conditions, but on average the amount of water does not change much in the polluted clouds. These observations disagree with the systematic increases in cloud water in response to aerosols simulated by the Hadley Centre climate model. This model, like other contemporary climate models, only accounts for cloud water increases that result from decreased precipitation efficiency and does not account for the enhanced drying in polluted clouds. Our results suggest that the ability of aerosols to offset global warming might be overestimated. The observational constraints derived here on aerosol-induced cloud water changes would ultimately translate into reduced uncertainties in projections of the future climate.

TI  - Attitudes and norms affecting scientists' data reuse
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The value of sharing scientific research data is widely appreciated, but factors that hinder or prompt the reuse of data remain poorly understood. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action, we test the relationship between the beliefs and attitudes of scientists towards data reuse, and their self-reported data reuse behaviour. To do so, we used existing responses to selected questions from a worldwide survey of scientists developed and administered by the DataONE Usability and Assessment Working Group (thus practicing data reuse ourselves). Results show that the perceived efficacy and efficiency of data reuse are strong predictors of reuse behaviour, and that the perceived importance of data reuse corresponds to greater reuse. Expressed lack of trust in existing data and perceived norms against data reuse were not found to be major impediments for reuse contrary to our expectations. We found that reported use of models and remotelysensed data was associated with greater reuse. The results suggest that data reuse would be encouraged and normalized by demonstration of its value. We offer some theoretical and practical suggestions that could help to legitimize investment and policies in favor of data sharing.

TI  - Positive or Negative? Urbanization-Induced Variations in Diurnal Skin-Surface Temperature Range Detected Using Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important indicator for assessing the local climate change due to urbanization. Studies that focused on surface air temperature (SAT) have reported decreased DTRSAT in urban areas. However, this urbanization-induced effect becomes more complex with regard to land skin-surface temperature (LST), which is highly localized and extremely sensitive to land surface properties. We thus investigated the urban-rural DTRLST difference (DTRLST) over 354 cities across China using satellite-retrieved LSTs within 2008-2013. Our major findings include the following: (1) urban areas experience increased (decreased) DTRLST compared with rural areas on the annual average for the majority of cities located in southern (northern) China; (2) the DTRLST is mostly positive in warm months but negative in cold months. It generally becomes more positive from January to August and becomes more negative afterward; and (3) the DTRLST is positively related to the daytime surface urban heat island intensity; it is yet negatively correlated with the urban-rural difference in vegetation abundance. We consider these insights valuable for in-depth understanding urban thermal environment and will likely help improve urban planning.

TI  - A Method for Deriving All-Sky Evapotranspiration From the Synergistic Use of Remotely Sensed Images and Meteorological Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the water and energy cycle. The present study develops a practical approach for generating all-sky ET with the synergistic use of satellite images and meteorological data. In this approach, the ET over clear-sky pixels is estimated from a two-stage land surface temperature (LST)/fractional vegetation cover feature space method where the dry/wet edges are determined from theoretical calculations. For cloudy pixels, the Penman-Monteith equation is used to calculate the ET where no valid remotely sensed LST is available. An evaluation of the method with ET collected at ground-based large aperture scintillometer measurements at the Yucheng Comprehensive Experimental Station (YCES) in China is performed over a growth period from April to October 2010. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and bias over clear-sky pixels are 57.3W/m(2) and 18.2W/m(2), respectively, whereas an RMSE of 69.3W/m(2) with a bias of 12.3W/m(2) can be found over cloudy pixels. Moreover, a reasonable overall RMSE of 65.3W/m(2) with a bias of 14.4W/m(2) at the YCES can be obtained under all-sky conditions, indicating a promising prospect for the derivation of all-sky ET using currently available satellite and meteorological data at a regional or global scale in future developments.

TI  - Spatial Representativeness of Surface-Measured Variations of Downward Solar Radiation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - When using time series of ground-based surface solar radiation (SSR) measurements in combination with gridded data, the spatial and temporal representativeness of the point observations must be considered. We use SSR data from surface observations and high-resolution (0.05 degrees) satellite-derived data to infer the spatiotemporal representativeness of observations for monthly and longer time scales in Europe. The correlation analysis shows that the squared correlation coefficients (R-2) between SSR times series decrease linearly with increasing distance between the surface observations. For deseasonalized monthly mean time series, R-2 ranges from 0.85 for distances up to 25km between the stations to 0.25 at distances of 500km. A decorrelation length (i.e., the e-folding distance of R-2) on the order of 400km (with spread of 100-600km) was found. R-2 from correlations between point observations and colocated grid box area means determined from satellite data were found to be 0.80 for a 1 degrees grid. To quantify the error which arises when using a point observation as a surrogate for the area mean SSR of larger surroundings, we calculated a spatial sampling error (SSE) for a 1 degrees grid of 8(3)W/m(2) for monthly (annual) time series. The SSE based on a 1 degrees grid, therefore, is of the same magnitude as the measurement uncertainty. The analysis generally reveals that monthly mean (or longer temporally aggregated) point observations of SSR capture the larger-scale variability well. This finding shows that comparing time series of SSR measurements with gridded data is feasible for those time scales.

TI  - The Impact of Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) Cloud-Cleared Radiances on Hurricane Joaquin (2015) and Matthew (2016) Forecasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounders provide high vertical resolution atmospheric sounding information that can improve the forecast skill in numerical weather prediction. Commonly, only clear radiances are assimilated, because IR sounder observations are highly affected by clouds. A cloud-clearing (CC) technique, which removes the cloud effects from an IR cloudy field of view (FOV) and derives the cloud-cleared radiances (CCRs) or clear-sky equivalent radiances, can be an alternative yet effective way to take advantage of the thermodynamic information from cloudy skies in data assimilation. This study develops a Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)-based CC method for deriving Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) CCRs under partially cloudy conditions. Due to the lack of absorption bands on VIIRS, two important quality control steps are implemented in the CC process. Validation using VIIRS clear radiances indicates that the CC method can effectively obtain the CrIS CCRs for FOVs with partial cloud cover. To compare the impacts from assimilation of CrIS original radiances and CCRs, three experiments are carried out on two storm cases, Hurricane Joaquin (2015) and Hurricane Matthew (2016), using Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation assimilation system and Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research Version models. At the analysis time, more CrIS observations are assimilated when using CrIS CCRs than with CrIS original radiances. Comparing temperature, specific humidity, and U/V winds with radiosondes indicates that the data impacts are growing larger with longer time forecasts (beyond 72h forecast). Hurricane track forecasts also show improvements from the assimilation of CrIS CCRs due to better weather system forecasts. The impacts of CCRs on intensity are basically neutral with mixed positive and negative results.

TI  - A Simple and Universal Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm for Landsat Series Images Over Complex Surfaces
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are available at coarse spatial resolutions from several to tens of kilometers. These resolutions limit the application of these products for monitoring atmospheric pollutants at the city level. Therefore, a simple, universal, and high-resolution (30m) Landsat aerosol retrieval algorithm over complex urban surfaces is developed. The surface reflectance is estimated from a combination of top of atmosphere reflectance at short-wave infrared (2.22m) and Landsat 4-7 surface reflectance climate data records over densely vegetated areas and bright areas. The aerosol type is determined using the historical aerosol optical properties derived from the local urban Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site (Beijing). AERONET ground-based sun photometer AOD measurements from five sites located in urban and rural areas are obtained to validate the AOD retrievals. Terra MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer Collection (C) 6 AOD products (MOD04) including the dark target (DT), the deep blue (DB), and the combined DT and DB (DT&DB) retrievals at 10km spatial resolution are obtained for comparison purposes. Validation results show that the Landsat AOD retrievals at a 30m resolution are well correlated with the AERONET AOD measurements (R-2=0.932) and that approximately 77.46% of the retrievals fall within the expected error with a low mean absolute error of 0.090 and a root-mean-square error of 0.126. Comparison results show that Landsat AOD retrievals are overall better and less biased than MOD04 AOD products, indicating that the new algorithm is robust and performs well in AOD retrieval over complex surfaces. The new algorithm can provide continuous and detailed spatial distributions of AOD during both low and high aerosol loadings.

TI  - Assessment of NPP VIIRS Albedo Over Heterogeneous Crop Land in Northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the accuracy of Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface albedo, which is derived from the direct estimation algorithm, was assessed using ground-based albedo observations from a wireless sensor network over a heterogeneous cropland in the Huailai station, northern China. Data from six nodes spanning 2013-2014 over vegetation, bare soil, and mixed terrain surfaces were utilized to provide ground reference at VIIRS pixel scale. The performance of VIIRS albedo was also compared with Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedos (Collection 5 and 6). The results indicate that the current granular VIIRS albedo has a high accuracy with a root-mean-square error of 0.02 for typical land covers. They are significantly correlated with ground references indicated by a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.73. The VIIRS albedo shows distinct advantages to GLASS and MODIS albedos over bare soil and mixed-cover surfaces, while it is inferior to the other two products over vegetated surfaces. Furthermore, its time continuity and the ability to capture the abrupt change of surface albedo are better than that of GLASS and MODIS albedo.

TI  - Association of Short-term Exposure to Air Pollution With Mortality in Older Adults
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The US Environmental Protection Agency is required to reexamine its National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) every 5 years, but evidence of mortality risk is lacking at air pollution levels below the current daily NAAQS in unmonitored areas and for sensitive subgroups.OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between short-term exposures to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone, and at levels below the current daily NAAQS, and mortality in the continental United States.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between short-term exposures to PM2.5 and ozone (mean of daily exposure on the same day of death and 1 day prior) and mortality in 2-pollutant models. The study included the entire Medicare population from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012, residing in 39 182 zip codes.EXPOSURES Daily PM2.5 and ozone levels in a 1-km x 1-km grid were estimated using published and validated air pollution prediction models based on land use, chemical transport modeling, and satellite remote sensing data. From these gridded exposures, daily exposures were calculated for every zip code in the United States. Warm-season ozone was defined as ozone levels for the months April to September of each year.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality in the entire Medicare population from 2000 to 2012.RESULTS During the study period, there were 22 433 862 million case days and 76 143 209 control days. Of all case and control days, 93.6% had PM2.5 levels below 25 mu g/m(3), during which 95.2% of deaths occurred (21 353 817 of 22 433 862), and 91.1% of days had ozone levels below 60 parts per billion, during which 93.4% of deaths occurred (20 955 387 of 22 433 862). The baseline daily mortality rates were 137.33 and 129.44 (per 1 million persons at risk per day) for the entire year and for the warm season, respectively. Each short-term increase of 10 mu g/m(3) in PM2.5 (adjusted by ozone) and 10 parts per billion (10(-9)) in warm-season ozone (adjusted by PM2.5) were statistically significantly associated with a relative increase of 1.05%(95% CI, 0.95%-1.15%) and 0.51%(95% CI, 0.41%-0.61%) in daily mortality rate, respectively. Absolute risk differences in daily mortality rate were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.29-1.56) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.78) per 1 million persons at risk per day. There was no evidence of a threshold in the exposure-response relationship.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the US Medicare population from 2000 to 2012, short-term exposures to PM2.5 and warm-season ozone were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. This risk occurred at levels below current national air quality standards, suggesting that these standards may need to be reevaluated.

TI  - Changes in Vegetation Phenology and Its Elevation-Dependent Effects in the Yarlung Zangbo River Valley of Tibet, China
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yarlung Zangbo River Valley (YZR), stretching across the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau from west to east over a wide range of elevation from 147 m to over 7 000 m above sea level (a.s.l.) with an average elevation of 4 600 m, has been regarded as one of the ideal regions for the study on ecological response to climate change in alpine watershed. Based on the datasets of SPOT-VGT normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and SRTM digital elevation model (DEM), phonological features of the valley were extracted and elevation-dependent phenological change of the vegetation of the YZR during 1999-2013 was analyzed. The SPOT-VGT NDVI was first preprocessed with the non-symmetrical Gaussian function (AG) fitting method, and then the start date of growing season (SOG), the end date of the growing season (EOG) and the length of the growing season (LOG) of the vegetation was extracted, separately, through the threshold value method. Results show: (1) The SOG exhibited an advancing trend in 61.3% of the YZR, and a delaying trend in 38.8%, while the EOG did an advancing trend in 45.3% and a delaying trend in 54.7%. As a consequence, the LOG in the YZR was shortening, with the annual changing rate per pixel being -0.47 d.a(-1); (2) The SOG was gradually delaying, the EOG gradually advancing and the LOG gradually shortening along the river from the downstream up to the upstream. Besides, LOG and its annual changing rate is generally on a declining trend with rising elevation.

TI  - Satellite-based mapping and monitoring of heavy snowfall in North Western Himalaya and its hydrologic consequences
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is one of the most important land surface parameters in global water and energy cycle. Large area of North West Himalaya (NWH) receives precipitation mostly in the form of snow. The major share of discharge in rivers of NWH comes from snow and glacier melt. The hydrological models, used to quantify this runoff contribution, use snow-covered area (SCA) along with hydro-meteorological data as essential inputs. In this context, information about SCA is essential for water resource management in NWH region. Regular mapping and monitoring of snow cover by traditional means is difficult due to scarce snow gauges and inaccessible terrain. Remote sensing has proven its capability of mapping and monitoring snow cover and glacier extents in these area, with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, 8-day snow cover products from MODIS, and 15-daily snow cover fraction product from AWiFS were used to generate long-term SCA maps (2000-2017) for entire NWH region. Further, the long term variability of 8-daily SCA and its current status has been analysed. The SCA mapped has been validated using AWiFS derived SCA. The analysis of current status (2016-17) of SCA has indicated that the maximum extent of snow cover in NWH region in last 17 years. In 2nd week of February 2017, around 67% of NWH region was snow covered. The comparison of SCA during the 1st week of March and April in 2016-17 against 2015-16 indicates 7.3% and 6.5%, increased SCA in current year. The difference in SCA during 1st week of March 2017 and 1st week of April 2017 was observed to be 14%, which indicates that the 14% SCA has contributed to the snow melt during this period. The change in snow water equivalent retrieved using SCATSAT-1 data also validates this change in snow volume.

M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific scheduling of limited resource plays an important role in the remote sensing data processing. The remote sensing data processing task scheduling is characterized as one novel comprehensive multi-objective model. In this proposed model, the remote sensing data processing task scheduling problem is divided into task dispensation and task scheduling sub-problem with hundreds of variables being considered in it. In order to effectively solve this problem, Bayes belief model is applied to generate the initial dispensation plan, and learnable ant colony optimization is proposed to solve task scheduling sub-problem. Experimental results suggest that the proposed comprehensive multi-objective model and its solving methods are feasible and efficient to remote sensing data processing task scheduling, and it also promotes processing centers interoperability among heterogeneous and dispersed processing center. The model and the method of this paper can provide a valuable reference for solving other complex scheduling problem.

TI  - Quantifying the Potential for Low-Level Transport of Black Carbon Emissions from Cropland Burning in Russia to the Snow-Covered Arctic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Short lived aerosols and pollutants transported from northern mid-latitudes have amplified the short term warming in the Arctic region. Among those black carbon is recognized as the second most important human emission in regards to climate forcing, behind carbon dioxide, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 Wm(-2). Studies have suggested that cropland burning may be a large contributor to the black carbon emissions which are directly deposited on the snow in the Arctic. However, commonly applied atmospheric transport models rely on estimates of black carbon emissions from cropland burning which are known to be highly inaccurate in both the amount and the timing of release. Instead, this study quantifies the potential for the deposition of hypothetical black carbon emissions from known cropland burning in Russia, identified by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire detections, through low-level transport to the snow in the Arctic using wind vectors from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' ERA-Interim Reanalysis product. Our results confirm that Russian cropland burning is a potentially significant source of black carbon deposition on the Arctic snow in the spring despite the low injection heights associated with cropland burning. Approximately 10% of the observed spring (March-May) cropland active fires (7% annual) likely contribute to black carbon deposition on the Arctic snow from as far south as at least 40 degrees N. Furthermore, our results show that potential spring black carbon emissions from cropland burning in Russia can be deposited beyond 80 degrees N, however, the majority (similar to 90%-depending on injection height) of all potential spring deposition occurs below 75 degrees N.

TI  - Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for early stage breast cancer is a technique for partial breast irradiation. There are several technologies in clinical use to perform breast IORT. Regardless of technique, IORT generally refers to the delivery of a single dose of radiation to the periphery of the tumor bed in the immediate intraoperative time frame, although some protocols have performed IORT as a second procedure. There are two large prospective randomized trials establishing the safety and efficacy of breast IORT in early stage breast cancer patients with sufficient follow-up time on thousands of women. The advantages of IORT for partial breast irradiation include: direct visualization of the target tissue ensuring treatment of the high-risk tissue and eliminating the risk of marginal miss; the use of a single dose coordinated with the necessary surgical excision thereby reducing omission of radiation and the selection of mastectomy for women without access to a radiotherapy facility or unable to undergo several weeks of daily radiation; favorable toxicity profiles; patient convenience and cost savings; radiobiological and tumor microenvironment conditions which lead to enhanced tumor control. The main disadvantage of IORT is the lack of final pathologic information on the tumor size, histology, margins, and nodal status. When unexpected findings on final pathology such as positive margins or positive sentinel nodes predict a higher risk of local or regional recurrence, additional whole breast radiation may be indicated, thereby reducing some of the convenience and low-toxicity advantages of sole IORT. However, IORT as a tumor bed boost has also been studied and appears to be safe with acceptable toxicity. IORT has potential efficacy advantages related to overall survival related to reduced cardiopulmonary radiation doses. It may also be very useful in specific situations, such as prior to oncoplastic reconstruction to improve accuracy of adjuvant radiation delivery, or when used as a boost in higher risk patients to improve tumor control. Ongoing international clinical trials are studying these uses and follow-up data are accumulating on completed studies.

TI  - Fluorescence-Guided Surgery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgical resection of cancer remains an important treatment modality. Despite advances in preoperative imaging, surgery itself is primarily guided by the surgeon's ability to locate pathology with conventional white light imaging. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) can be used to define tumor location and margins during the procedure. Intraoperative visualization of tumors may not only allow more complete resections but also improve safety by avoiding unnecessary damage to normal tissue which can also reduce operative time and decrease the need for second-look surgeries. A number of new FGS imaging probes have recently been developed, complementing a small but useful number of existing probes. In this review, we describe current and new fluorescent probes that may assist FGS.

TI  - Vegetation Cover Dynamics and Resilience to Climatic and Hydrological Disturbances in Seasonal Floodplain: The Effects of Hydrological Connectivity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain wetlands are valuable ecosystems for maintaining biodiversity, but are vulnerable to hydrological modification and climatic extremes. The floodplain wetlands in the middle Yangtze region are biodiversity hotspots, particularly important for wintering migratory waterbirds. In recent years, extremely low winter water level events frequently occurred in the middle Yangtze River. The hydrological droughts greatly impacted the development and distribution of the wet meadows, one of the most important ecological components in the floodplains, which is vital for the survival of many migratory waterbirds wintering in the Yangtze region. To effectively manage the wet meadows, it is critical to pinpoint the drivers for their deterioration. In this study, we assessed the effects of hydrological connectivity on the ecological stability of wet meadow in Poyang Lake for the period of 2000 to 2016. We used the time series of MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) as a proxy for productivity to infer the ecological stability of wet meadows in terms of resistance and resilience. Our results showed that (1) the wet meadows developed in freely connected lakes had significantly higher resilience; (2) wet meadows colonizing controlled lakes had higher resistance to water level anomalies; (3) there was no difference in the resistance to rainfall anomaly between the two types of lakes; (4) the wet meadow in freely connected lakes might approach a tipping point and a regime shift might be imminent. Our findings suggest that adaptive management at regional-(i.e., operation of Three Gorges Dam) and site-scale (e.g., regulating sand mining) are needed to safeguard the long-term ecological stability of the system, which in term has strong implications for local, regional and global biodiversity conservation.

TI  - A case study of aerosol data assimilation with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model over the contiguous United States using 3D-Var and optimal interpolation methods
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applies the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) 3D-Var assimilation tool originally developed by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), to improve surface PM2.5 predictions over the contiguous United States (CONUS) by assimilating aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface PM2.5 in version 5.1 of the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. An optimal interpolation (OI) method implemented earlier (Tang et al., 2015) for the CMAQ modeling system is also tested for the same period (July 2011) over the same CONUS. Both GSI and OI methods assimilate surface PM2.5 observations at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 UTC, and MODIS AOD at 18:00 UTC. The assimilations of observations using both GSI and OI generally help reduce the prediction biases and improve correlation between model predictions and observations. In the GSI experiments, assimilation of surface PM2.5 (particle matter with diameter <2.5 mu m) leads to stronger increments in surface PM2.5 compared to its MODIS AOD assimilation at the 550 nm wavelength. In contrast, we find a stronger OI impact of the MODIS AOD on surface aerosols at 18:00 UTC compared to the surface PM2.5 OI method. GSI produces smoother result and yields overall better correlation coefficient and root mean squared error (RMSE). It should be noted that the 3D-Var and OI methods used here have several big differences besides the data assimilation schemes. For instance, the OI uses relatively big model uncertainties, which helps yield smaller mean biases, but sometimes causes the RMSE to increase. We also examine and discuss the sensitivity of the assimilation experiments' results to the AOD forward operators.

TI  - THE EVOLVING SPIRIT: MORALS AND MUTUALISM IN ARABELLA BUCKLEY'S EVOLUTIONARY EPIC
T2  - NOTES AND RECORDS-THE ROYAL SOCIETY JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporaries of Charles Darwin were divided on reconciling his theory of natural selection with religion and morality. Although Alfred Russel Wallace stands out as a spiritualist advocate of natural selection who rejected a natural origin of morality, the science popularizer and spiritualist Arabella Buckley (1840-1929) offers a more representative example of how theists, whether spiritualist or more orthodox in their religion, found reconciliation. Unlike Wallace, Buckley emphasized the lawful evolution of morality and of the soul, drawing from the theological tradition of traducianism. Significantly, Buckley argued for a mutualistic and deeply theistic interpretation of Darwinian evolution, particularly the evolution of morals, without sacrificing the uniformity of natural law. Though Buckley's understanding of the evolutionary epic has been represented as emphasizing mutualism (Gates 1998) and spiritualist theology (Lightman 2007), here I demonstrate that her distinctive addition to the debate lies in her unifying theory of traducianism. In contrast to other authors, I argue that through Buckley we better understand Victorian spiritualism as more of a religion than an occult science. However, it was a conception of religion that, through her evolutionary traducianism, bridged science and spiritualism. This offers historians a more complex but satisfying image of the Victorian worldview after Darwin.

TI  - Nutrient Content of Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Eggs and Comparisons Between Experimental Uses
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), has become a major pest. Seven experiments examined the nutrient content of their eggs in the context of female reproductive investment and use for experiments. Among 542 clusters examined, an average egg contained 23.50 +/- 0.561 mu g lipid, 3.17 +/- 0.089 mu g glycogen, and 3.08 +/- 0.056 mu g sugar. Mature eggs within a female's ovary can make up 61% of her total lipid, 35% of glycogen, and 20% of sugar levels. Eggs obtained from a colony reared on a steady diet are expected to have consistent nutrient content. The age of a parental female only slightly affected the lipid level of oviposited eggs but did not affect glycogen or sugar levels. However, egg nutrient content can differ substantially by the source of the parental females; wild eggs had higher lipid but lower sugar content than colony-produced eggs. Further, the length of time that eggs are frozen influenced egg nutrient content. Freshly laid eggs had higher lipid and lower sugar levels than eggs frozen for 1 or 2 yr. Whether an egg turned grey following removal from cold storage did not affect nutrient content, nor did being frozen within 1 or 3 d of oviposition. The temperature at which eggs were left exposed did not impact egg nutrient content, but glycogen decreased and sugar increased with deployment time. This information combined with how factors affect host selection by natural enemies will help refine future experiments that use BMSB egg clusters.

TI  - Partner notification and partner treatment for chlamydia: attitude and practice of general practitioners in the Netherlands; a landscape analysis
T2  - BMC FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chlamydia prevalence remains high despite scaling-up control efforts. Transmission is not effectively interrupted without partner notification (PN) and (timely) partner treatment (PT). In the Netherlands, the follow-up of partners is not standardized and may depend on GPs' time and priorities. We investigated current practice and attitude of GPs towards PN and PT to determine the potential for Patient-Initiated Partner Treatment, which is legally not supported yet.Methods: Multiple data-sources were combined for a landscape analysis. Quantitative data on (potential) PT were obtained from prescriptions in the national pharmacy register (2004-2014) and electronic patient data from NIVEL-Primary Care Database (PCD) and from STI consultations in a subgroup of sentinel practices therein. Furthermore, we collected information on current practice via two short questionnaires at a national GP conference and obtained insight into GPs' attitudes towards PN/PT in a vignette study among GPs partaking in NIVEL-PCD.Results: Prescription data showed Azithromycin double dosages in 1-2% of cases in the pharmacy register (37.000 per year); probable chlamydia-specific repeated prescriptions or double dosages of other antibiotics in NIVEL-PCD (115/1078) could not be interpreted as PT for chlamydia with certainty. STI consultation data revealed direct PT in 6/100 cases, via partner prescription or double doses. In the questionnaires the large majority of GPs (>95% of 1411) reported to discuss PN of current and ex-partner(s) with chlamydia patients. Direct PT was indicated as most common method by 4% of 271 GPs overall and by 12% for partners registered in the same practice. Usually, GPs leave further steps to the patients (83%), advising patients to tell partners to get tested (56%) or treated (28%). In the vignette study, 16-20% of 268 GPs indicated willingness to provide direct PT, depending on patient/partner profile, more (24-45%) if patients would have the chance to notify their partner first.Conclusion: GPs in the Netherlands already treat some partners of chlamydia cases directly, especially partners registered in the same practice. Follow-up of partner notification and treatment in general practice needs more attention. GPs may be open to implement PIPT more often, provided there are clear guidelines to arrange this legally and practically.

TI  - Infection dynamics of <i>Kudoa inornata</i> (Cnidaria: Myxosporea) in spotted seatrout <i>Cynoscion nebulosus</i> (Teleostei: Sciaenidae)
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kudoa inornata is a myxosporean parasite that develops in the somatic muscle of spotted seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus, an economically and ecologically important fish in estuaries and harbors in southeastern North America. In South Carolina (SC), USA, over 90% of wild adult spotted seatrout are infected. To inform potential mitigation strategies, we conducted 3 experiments using naive sentinel seatrout and infectious stages of K. inornata naturally present in raw water from Charleston Harbor, SC, to determine (1) if K. inornata infection follows a seasonal pattern, and (2) how long it takes for myxospores to develop in fish muscle. Infection by K. inornata was determined by visual detection of myxospores in fish muscle squashes, and any visually negative samples were then assayed for K. inornata ribosomal DNA using novel parasite-specific PCR primers. We observed that K. inornata infection in seatrout followed a seasonal pattern, with high prevalence when water temperature was highest (27-31 degrees C; July-September) and infections that were either covert (at similar to 13-15 degrees C) or not detected (<13 degrees C) at the lowest water temperatures in January-February. Myxospore development occurred within 476 degree-days, i.e. 2 wk in a typical SC summer. Infection was dependent on fish density, which limited presumptive actinospore dose. Our findings suggest that the life cycle of the parasite may be disrupted by preventing spore-rich seatrout carcasses (e.g. at angler cleaning stations) being thrown back into harbors and estuaries throughout the year.

TI  - Outcomes of Dabigatran and Warfarin for Atrial Fibrillation in Contemporary Practice A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) has been associated with lower rates of stroke than warfarin in trials of atrial fibrillation, but large-scale evaluations in clinical practice are limited.Objective: To compare incidence of stroke, bleeding, and myocardial infarction in patients receiving dabigatran versus warfarin in practice.Design: Retrospective cohort.Setting: National U.S. Food and Drug Administration Sentinel network.Patients: Adults with atrial fibrillation initiating dabigatran or warfarin therapy between November 2010 and May 2014.Measurements: Ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, extracranial bleeding, and myocardial infarction identified from hospital claims among propensity score-matched patients starting treatment with dabigatran or warfarin.Results: Among 25 289 patients starting dabigatran therapy and 25 289 propensity score-matched patients starting warfarin therapy, those receiving dabigatran did not have significantly different rates of ischemic stroke (0.80 vs. 0.94 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.28]) or extracranial hemorrhage (2.12 vs. 2.63 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.89 [CI, 0.72 to 1.09]) but were less likely to have intracranial bleeding (0.39 vs. 0.77 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.51 [CI, 0.33 to 0.79]) and more likely to have myocardial infarction (0.77 vs. 0.43 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.88 [CI, 1.22 to 2.90]). However, the strength and significance of the association between dabigatran use and myocardial infarction varied in sensitivity analyses and by exposure definition (HR range, 1.13 [CI, 0.78 to 1.64] to 1.43 [CI, 0.99 to 2.08]). Older patients and those with kidney disease had higher gastrointestinal bleeding rates with dabigatran.Limitation: Inability to examine outcomes by dabigatran dose (unacceptable covariate balance between matched patients) or quality of warfarin anticoagulation (few patients receiving warfarin had available international normalized ratio values).Conclusion: In matched adults with atrial fibrillation treated in practice, the incidences of stroke and bleeding with dabigatran versus warfarin were consistent with those seen in trials. The possible relationship between dabigatran and myocardial infarction warrants further investigation.

TI  - Agreement analysis and spatial sensitivity of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors in detecting vegetation stress at management scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery is commonly used to map and monitor large land areas based on the ability to detect vegetation stress. Many sensors are available, including both hyper- and multispectral, but have varying costs, convenience, and characteristics. There were two objectives in this study: (1) to compare a hyperspectral sensor to two multispectral sensors with regards to each sensor's ability to detect vegetation stress indicators in the visible, red edge, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared portions of the spectrum and (2) to determine the ability of coarser-resolution sensors to detect stress indicators in areas, where a finer resolution sensor detected stress indicators. Pairwise agreements between the sensors were similar to 80% in each case, but much of this agreement was a function of agreement where stress indicators were absent. Spatial sensitivity analysis supported a conclusion that coarser-resolution sensors were consistently able to detect stress indicators in areas much smaller than their pixel size.

TI  - Characteristics of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> adult mosquitoes in rural and urban areas of western and coastal Kenya
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector for yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Recent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya have been reported in Kenya. Presence and abundance of this vector is associated with the risk for the occurrence and transmission of these diseases. This study aimed to characterize the presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti adult mosquitoes from rural and urban sites in western and coastal regions of Kenya. Presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti adult mosquitoes were determined indoors and outdoors in two western (urban Kisumu and rural Chulaimbo) and two coastal (urban Ukunda and rural Msambweni) sites in Kenya. Sampling was performed using quarterly human landing catches, monthly Prokopack automated aspirators and monthly Biogents-sentinel traps. A total of 2,229 adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected: 785 (35.2%) by human landing catches, 459 (20.6%) by Prokopack aspiration and 985 (44.2%) by Biogents-sentinel traps. About three times as many Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected in urban than rural sites (1,650 versus 579). Comparable numbers were collected in western (1,196) and coastal (1,033) sites. Over 80% were collected outdoors through human landing catches and Prokopack aspiration. The probability of collecting Ae. aegypti mosquitoes by human landing catches was significantly higher in the afternoon than morning hours (P<0.001), outdoors than indoors (P<0.001) and in urban than rural sites (P = 0.008). Significantly more Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected using Prokopack aspiration outdoors than indoors (P<0.001) and in urban than rural areas (P<0.001). Significantly more mosquitoes were collected using Biogents-sentinel traps in urban than rural areas (P = 0.008) and in western than coastal sites (P = 0.006). The probability of exposure to Ae. aegypti bites was highest in urban areas, outdoors and in the afternoon hours. These characteristics have major implications for the possible transmission of arboviral diseases and for the planning of surveillance and control programs.

TI  - Metas-Chip precisely identifies presence of micrometastasis in live biopsy samples by label free approach
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the micrometastasis is a major challenge in patients' survival. The small volume of the biopsied tissue results in limited number of histopathological samples and might reduce the rate of accurate diagnosis even by molecular technologies. We introduce a microelectronic biochip (named Metas-Chip) to detect the micrometastasis in unprocessed liquid or solid samples. It works based on the tendency of malignant cells to track single human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)-sensing traps. Such cells detach themselves from the biopsied sample and invade the sensing traps by inducing membrane retraction and blebbing, which result in sharp changes in electrical response of the sensing elements. Metas-Chip identified the metastasis in more than 70 breast cancer patients, in less than 5 h. Moreover it detected the metastasis in lymph nodes of nine patients whom were missed by conventional pathological procedure. Multilevel IHC and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests confirmed the diagnosis.

AB  - Background: The 2015/2016 influenza season was characterized in Europe by the circulation of A(H1N1) pdm09 Glade 6B.1 and B/Victoria-lineage influenza viruses. The components of the vaccines used in the current and past two seasons in the Valencia region were similar but not well matched to the 2015/2016 dominant influenza-circulating strains. We estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) and interference of previous vaccination in preventing admission with A(H1N1)pdm09 or B/Victoria-lineage in this particular season.Methods: The Valencia Hospital Network for the Study of Influenza runs an active surveillance hospital based study to collect clinical and virological data from consecutive admissions possibly related to influenza. Combined nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs are analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the hemagglutinin is sequenced in a sample of positive influenza specimens. Vaccination is ascertained consulting a population vaccine information system. We estimate IVE using a test-negative approach.Results: During the 2015-2016 season, we recruited 1049 eligible admissions of patients 60 years or older, and 187 tested positive for influenza. The adjusted IVE in preventing admission with A(H1N1) pdm09 was 20.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.3-47.5% and -33.2%; 95% CI, -140.1-26.1% in preventing admission with B/Victoria-lineage. The majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 sequenced viruses belonged to the emerging 6B.1 subclade, defined by S162N and I216T mutations in the hemagglutinin protein. When we restricted our analysis to those not vaccinated in the previous year, unadjusted IVE was 84.9% (95% CI 9.9-100.0) overall, 77.9% (-32.7-100.0%) in preventing A(H1N1)pdm09 and 48.8% (-219.5-100.0%) in preventing B/Yamagata-lineage admission.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that IVE was low in preventing A(H1N1)pdm09 and strongly correlated with vaccination in the previous season. No effect in preventing admission with B/Victorialineage was observed. For the 2015/2016 season, IVE was low due to a mismatch and lack of concordance between the circulating and vaccine viruses.

TI  - Change in Land Use and Evapotranspiration in the Manas River Basin, China with Long-term Water-saving Measures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread application of water-saving measures, especially advanced drip irrigation technologies, may significantly impact on the land use, and further potentially alter regional ecological environments in an arid area. In this study, the remote sensing and geographic information system technology were used to analyze the LANDSAT images (1976-2015) and the MOD16 evapotranspiration data (2000-2015) in the Manas River Basin (MRB), China where the water-saving technologies have experienced the past 40 years. Our results show that the area of the cultivated land was approximately doubled from 1976 to 2015 with a dynamic degree of cultivated land ranging from 1.7% to 4%. The reclamation rates were estimated at 9.5% in 1976 and 21.8% in 2015 and the comprehensive index of land use degree shows an increasing trend in the MRB. The evapotranspiration in the MRB suggests that the cultivated land is becoming more humid while the other regions are becoming more arid. Long-term change in the land use is mainly promoted due to the multiple years' efforts on development of the water-saving technologies. This study greatly improves our understanding of the interactions between change in ecological environments and human activities and may provide policy makers guidance of sustainable development at an arid area.

TI  - Monitoring small reservoirs' storage with satellite remote sensing in inaccessible areas
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In river basins with water storage facilities, the availability of regularly updated information on reservoir level and capacity is of paramount importance for the effective management of those systems. However, for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world, storage levels are either not measured or not readily available due to financial, political, or legal considerations. This paper proposes a novel approach using Landsat imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs) to retrieve information on storage variations in any inaccessible region. Unlike existing approaches, the method does not require any in situ measurement and is appropriate for monitoring small, and often undocumented, irrigation reservoirs. It consists of three recovery steps: (i) a 2-D dynamic classification of Landsat spectral band information to quantify the surface area of water, (ii) a statistical correction of DEM data to characterize the topography of each reservoir, and (iii) a 3-D reconstruction algorithm to correct for clouds and Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure. The method is applied to quantify reservoir storage in the Yarmouk basin in southern Syria, where ground monitoring is impeded by the ongoing civil war. It is validated against available in situ measurements in neighbouring Jordanian reservoirs. Coefficients of determination range from 0.69 to 0.84, and the normalized root-mean-square error from 10 to 16% for storage estimations on six Jordanian reservoirs with maximal water surface areas ranging from 0.59 to 3.79 km(2).

TI  - Building damage assessment using airborne lidar
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of building damage following a natural disaster is a crucial step in determining the impact of the event itself and gauging reconstruction needs. Automatic methods for deriving damage maps from remotely sensed data are preferred, since they are regarded as being rapid and objective. We propose an algorithm for performing unsupervised building segmentation and damage assessment using airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data. Local surface properties, including normal vectors and curvature, were used along with region growing to segment individual buildings in lidar point clouds. Damaged building candidates were identified based on rooftop inclination angle, and then damage was assessed using planarity and point height metrics. Validation of the building segmentation and damage assessment techniques were performed using airborne lidar data collected after the Haiti earthquake of 2010. Building segmentation and damage assessment accuracies of 93.8% and 78.9%, respectively, were obtained using lidar point clouds and expert damage assessments of 1953 buildings in heavily damaged regions. We believe this research presents an indication of the utility of airborne lidar remote sensing for increasing the efficiency and speed at which emergency response operations are performed.
