TI  - Assimilation of satellite data in numerical weather prediction. Part I: The early years
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Developments in the assimilation of satellite data in numerical weather prediction (NWP), from the first experiments in the late 1960s to the present day, are presented in a two-part review article. This first part reviews the early years, up to about the year 2000. It includes summaries of the relevant satellite remote sensing technologies, the theoretical and practical challenges faced when assimilating their data within NWP systems, and the impacts on forecast skill. An important part of this story concerns developments in the assimilation of information on atmospheric temperature and humidity provided by data from passive infrared and microwave radiometers. Following early successes with the assimilation of retrieved temperature profiles, there followed a problematic period, as other aspects of NWP systems improved and the impacts of satellite sounding data declined. Positive impacts were re-established in the 1990s through moves towards more direct assimilation of radiance information. Another important theme concerns developments in the assimilation of wind information via atmospheric motion vectors, which underwent a series of improvements during these years. Additional contributions were provided by information on ocean surface wind from scatterometers. Some contributions from other technologies during this period are also summarised.

TI  - Preliminary study of real-time three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To investigate the clinical value of real-time three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D-CEUS) in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and drainage lymphatics in breast cancer patients. Method The prospective study was performed in women with pathology-confirmed T1/2 breast cancer between June 2016 and December 2017 who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and 3D-CEUS. The number, size, location, enhancement pattern of SLNs, and the lymphatic drainage patterns were reviewed. The routes, location of SLNs, and lymph channels (LCs) on the surface were marked. All patients underwent blue dye-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) finally. Results According to the postoperative pathology findings and the blue dye staining of the lymphatic drainage routes, there are six patterns of lymphatic drainage routes and the coincidence rate of the 3D-CEUS was 97.4%; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, the LN detection rate, and the correct diagnosis rate of the 3D-CEUS were 75%, 93.0%, 81.8%, 89.9%, 95.3%, and 87.7%, respectively. Conclusion 3D-CEUS is a new feasible and useful approach to detect the SLNs and LCs. 3D-CEUS can accurately localize the LCs and SLNs and estimate the presence of metastatic lymph nodes.

TI  - Detecting changes in understorey and canopy vegetation cycles in West Central Alberta using a fusion of Landsat and MODIS
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims To model regional vegetation cycles through data fusion methods for creating a 30-m daily vegetation product from 2000 to 2018 and to analyze annual vegetation trends over this time period. Location The Yellowhead Bear Management Area, a 31,180-km(2) area in west central Alberta, Canada. Methods In this paper, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a data fusion technique to combine Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra imagery, to quantify daily vegetation using Enhanced Vegetation Index at a 30-m resolution, for the years 2000-2018. We validated this approach, entitled DRIVE (Daily Remote Inference of VEgetation), using imagery acquired from a network of ground cameras. Results When DRIVE was compared to start and end of season dates (SOS and EOS respectively) derived from ground cameras, correlations were r = 0.73 at SOS and r = 0.85 at EOS with a mean absolute error of 7.17 days at SOS and 10.76 days at EOS. Results showed that DRIVE accurately increased spatial and temporal resolution of remote-sensing data. We demonstrated that SOS is advancing at a maximum rate of 0.78 days per year temporally over the 18-year time period for varying elevation gradients and land cover classes over the region. Conclusions With DRIVE, we demonstrate the utility of DTW in quantifying vegetation cycles over a large heterogeneous region and determining how changing climate is affecting regional vegetation. DRIVE may prove to be an important method to determine how carbon sequestration is varying within fine-scale individual plant communities in response to changing climate and likely will be beneficial to wildlife movement and habitat selection studies examining the varying response of wildlife species to changing vegetation cycles under shifting climatic conditions.

TI  - Use of Antidiabetic drugs during pregnancy among US women with Livebirth deliveries in the Mini-Sentinel system
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background As the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases in the population, the exposure to antidiabetic drugs (ADDs) during pregnancies is expected to grow, as has been seen over the last decade. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ADD use during pregnancy among women in the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database (MSDD) who delivered a liveborn infant. Methods We identified qualifying livebirth pregnancies among women aged 10 to 54 years in the MSDD from 2001 to 2013. ADD use was estimated using outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims and days-supplied among three cohorts: all livebirth pregnancies, pregnancies among women with pre-existing diabetes, and pregnancies among women without prior ADD use. Results Among the 1.9 million pregnancies in the MSDD that resulted in a livebirth from 2001 to 2013, 4.4% were exposed to an ADD. Of the 15,606 pregnancies (0.8%) with pre-existing diabetes, 92.8% were also exposed during the pregnancy period. The most commonly used product in these pregnancies was insulin (75.6% of pregnancies). In contrast, in pregnancies of women without prior ADD use, the most commonly used products were glyburide and insulin, and most of these users were diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Conclusions Patterns of ADD use during pregnancy described here, along with changes in disease incidence and management, highlight the importance of continuing surveillance of ADD utilization patterns and examining the safety and effectiveness of these products in pregnancy.

TI  - Can biophysical parameters derived from Sentinel-2 space-borne sensor improve land cover characterisation in semi-arid regions?
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the potential contribution of Sentinel-2 (S2) wavebands and biophysical parameters, i.e. Leaf Area Index (LAI), Chlorophyll content (Cab), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC) and Canopy Water Content (CWC) in mapping land use and land cover (LULC) in Zimbabwe. Random forest (RF) and naive Bayes (NB) were used to classify S2 imagery. S2 biophysical variables resulted in LULC overall accuracy (OA) of 96% and 86% for RF and NB respectively, whereas S2 wavebands produced slightly higher accuracies of 97% and 88% for RF and NB respectively. Combining wavebands and biophysical variables enhanced classification results (OA = 98%: RF and 91%: NB). Variable importance analysis showed that FAPAR, red-edge 2, green, red-edge 3, FVC and band 8a, are the most relevant in the classification. Our work shows the strength and capability of biophysical variables in discerning different LULC attributes in semi-arid environments.

TI  - Retrospective deformation of the Baige landslide using optical remote sensing images
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting slope deformations before major landslides is crucially important for mitigating landslide disasters. In this work, we explored the use of Sentinel-2 images and an image correlation method, Co-Registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr), to derive slope deformations before the 2018 Baige landslide along the Jinsha River. We found that larger sliding windows outperform smaller ones in extracting the moving slope. Different solar zenith angles in image pairs have an influence on the derived displacements. Although the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images is 10 m, uncertainties in estimating slope deformation are found within 2 m. Using the COSI-Corr technique, we monitored sub-pixel slope deformation in Sentinel-2 images from November 2015 to August 2018. We found that the slope moved faster in summer than in winter months, which was probably driven by the monsoon climate in this region. From 2015 to 2018, the slope movement became faster, and an acceleration stage was observed before the slope failed completely. To derive reliable slope displacements, this work suggests testing different sliding window size combinations in the use of image correlation methods, and optical images acquired with similar zenith angles are preferred. This work also demonstrated the capability of using optical remote sensing images to monitor large slope deformations before major landslides. As more optical images with high spatial resolution become available, monitoring minor slope deformations directly would be practicable for large remote mountain regions.

TI  - Heightened levels and seasonal inversion of riverine suspended sediment in a tropical biodiversity hot spot due to artisanal gold mining
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, rising gold prices have exacerbated the global proliferation of artisanal-scale gold mining (ASGM), with catastrophic consequences for human and ecological health. Much of this burgeoning industry has occurred in biodiversity hot spots, notably in the tropical forests of South America. While the loss of tropical forests and floodplains as a result of ASGM has been well characterized, ASGM impacts on riverine hydrological properties are less understood. Previous fieldwork on ASGM-affected and gully-eroded tropical streams and rivers has demonstrated that increases in suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) can substantially impact fish diversity and aquatic community structure, yet our understanding of the timing and scope of impacts of such increases is limited by the lack of long-term records of SSC. To address this challenge, we present a 34-y analysis of the direct effect of ASGM on 32 river reaches in the Madre de Dios region of Peru, which has been heavily impacted by ASGM since the 1980s. We evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of impacts using estimated SSC derived from Landsat satellite imagery. We find that 16 of 18 stretches of river impacted by ASGM show significant increasing trends in SSC (P < 0.05), while only 5 of 14 unaffected sites do so. Additionally, ASGM appears to reverse natural seasonal cycles of SSC, which may imperil aquatic species. Overall, our findings indicate that ASGM is fundamentally altering optical water quality dynamics of a critical tropical biodiversity hot spot and provide guidance for future regulation of these activities.

TI  - Spotted fever group rickettsiae canine serosurveillance near the US-Mexico border in California
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dogs are vulnerable to pathogens transmitted by brown dog ticks. An epidemic of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is underway in Mexicali, a Mexican city bordering California affecting people and dogs; several human cases have been reported in California residents who travelled to Mexico. To evaluate risks of RMSF, we conducted seroprevalence surveys in Imperial County in 2016 and 2017 using dogs as sentinels. Methods Blood was collected from 752 dogs and was tested for antibodies against R. rickettsii, E. canis and A. phagocytophilum (as a proxy for A. platys). Samples were considered seropositive to spotted fever group rickettsia (SFGR) if the R. rickettsia titre was >= 1:64 and seropositive to E. canis and A. phagocytophilum if the titre was >= 1:32. Owners provided information on dog age, exposure risks, health status and tick prevention. We assessed associations between SFGR seropositivity and driving distance to the nearest US-Mexico border crossing station, whether proximity to a border crossing increased likelihood of taking dogs across the border, and whether distance to the border was associated with seropositivity. Logistic regression was performed to assess relationships between the titre classes and other predictor variables. Results 12.2% of dogs were seropositive against SFGR. Dogs close to the border were significantly more likely to be taken across the border and to be seropositive. Risk factors that increased seropositivity included owners seeing ticks on the dog (OR = 1.9), being an adult dog, travel to Mexico (OR = 3.0) and living in a rural area (OR = 4.0). There was statistically significant co-exposure to SFGR and Anaplasma spp. Conclusion Surveillance for brown dog tick-vectored pathogens can help identify dogs and people at risk for RMSF. Tick prevention, particularly in dogs, and surveillance of tick-borne pathogens can help prevent the spread of rickettsioses and other diseases in this dynamic border region.

TI  - Flood hazard mapping and assessment in data-scarce Nyaungdon area, Myanmar
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Torrential and long-lasting rainfall often causes long-duration floods in flat and lowland areas in data-scarce Nyaungdon Area of Myanmar, imposing large threats to local people and their livelihoods. As historical hydrological observations and surveys on the impact of floods are very limited, flood hazard assessment and mapping are still lacked in this region, making it hard to design and implement effective flood protection measures. This study mainly focuses on evaluating the predicative capability of a 2D coupled hydrology-inundation model, namely the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, using ground observations and satellite remote sensing, and applying the RRI model to produce a flood hazard map for hazard assessment in Nyaungdon Area. Topography, land cover, and precipitation are used to drive the RRI model to simulate the spatial extent of flooding. Satellite images from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 onboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) are used to validate the modeled potential inundation areas. Model validation through comparisons with the streamflow observations and satellite inundation images shows that the RRI model can realistically capture the flow processes (R-2 >= 0.87; NSE >= 0.60) and associated inundated areas (success index >= 0.66) of the historical extreme events. The resultant flood hazard map clearly highlights the areas with high levels of risks and provides a valuable tool for the design and implementation of future flood control and mitigation measures.

TI  - Geospatial Science and Point-of-Care Testing: Creating Solutions for Population Access, Emergencies, Outbreaks, and Disasters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: (a) To understand how to integrate geospatial concepts when implementing point-of-care testing (POCT); (b) to facilitate emergency, outbreak, and disaster preparedness and emergency management in healthcare small-world networks; (c) to enhance community resilience by using POCT in tandem with geographic information systems (GISs) and other geospatial tools; and (d) to advance crisis standards of care at points of need, adaptable and scalable for public health practice in limited-resource countries and other global settings. Content: Visual logistics help integrate and synthesize POCT and geospatial concepts. The resulting geospatial solutions presented here comprise: (1) small-world networks and regional topography; (2) space-time transformation, hubs, and asset mapping; (3) spatial and geospatial care paths (TM); (4) GIS-POCT; (5) isolation laboratories, diagnostics isolators, and mobile laboratories for highly infectious diseases; (6) alternate care facilities; (7) roaming POCT-airborne, ambulances, space, and wearables; (8) connected and wireless POCT outside hospitals; (9) unmanned aerial vehicles; (10) geospatial practice-demographic care unit resource scoring, geographic risk assessment, and national POCT policy and guidelines; (11) the hybrid laboratory; and (12) point-of-careology. Value: Small-world networks and their connectivity facilitate efficient and effective placement of POCT for optimal response, rescue, diagnosis, and treatment. Spatial care paths (TM) speed transport from primary encounters to referral centers bypassing topographic bottlenecks, process gaps, and time-consuming interruptions. Regional GISs position POCT close to where patients live to facilitate rapid triage, decrease therapeutic turnaround time, and conserve economic resources. Geospatial care paths (TM) encompass demographic and population access features. Timeliness creates value during acute illness, complex crises, and unexpected disasters. Isolation laboratories equipped with POCT help stop outbreaks and safely support critically ill patients with highly infectious diseases. POCT-enabled spatial grids can map sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of epidemics for ring vaccination. Impact: Geospatial solutions generate inherently optimal and logical placement of POCT conceptually, physically, and temporally as a means to improve crisis response and spatial resilience. If public health professionals, geospatial scientists, and POCT specialists join forces, new collaborative teamwork can create faster response and higher impact during disasters, complex crises, outbreaks, and epidemics, as well as more efficient primary, urgent, and emergency community care.

TI  - Review of Chinese atmospheric science research over the past 70 years: Synoptic meteorology
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Synoptic meteorology is a branch of meteorology that uses synoptic weather observations and charts for the diagnosis, study, and forecasting of weather. Weather refers to the specific state of the atmosphere near the Earth's surface during a short period of time. The spatial distribution of meteorological elements in the atmosphere can be represented by a variety of transient weather phenomena, which are caused by weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales. Weather is closely related to people's life, and its development and evolution have always been the focus of atmospheric scientific research and operation. The development of synoptic meteorology is closely related to the development of observation systems, dynamical theories and numerical models. In China, observation networks have been built since the early 1950s. Up to now, a comprehensive meteorological observation system based on ground, air and space has been established. In particular, the development of a new generation of dense radar networks, the development of the Fengyun satellite series and the implementation of a series of large field experiments have brought our understanding of weather from large-scale environment to thermal dynamics, cloud microphysical structure and evolution characteristics of meso and micro-scale weather systems. The development of observation has also promoted the development of theory, numerical model and simulation. In the early days, China mainly used foreign numerical models. Lately, China has developed numerical model systems with independent intellectual property rights. Based on the results of high-resolution numerical simulations, in-depth understanding of the initiation and evolution mechanism and predictability of weather at different scales has been obtained. Synoptic meteorology has gradually changed from an initially independent development to a multidisciplinary approach, and the interaction between weather and the change of climate and environment has become a hot and frontier topic in atmospheric science. This paper reviews the important scientific and technological achievements made in China over the past 70 years in the fields of synoptic meteorology based on the literatures in China and abroad, from six aspects respectively including atmospheric dynamics, synoptic-scale weather, typhoon and tropical weather, severe convective weather, numerical weather prediction and data assimilation, weather and climate, atmospheric physics and atmospheric environment.

TI  - Temperature Spatiotemporal Correlation Scales in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence from High-Resolution In Situ and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean frontal systems may act both as barriers and mixers between different water masses, the latter thanks to very energetic structures with relatively short temporal and spatial scales. Here, we explore the high-frequency temperature variability in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence through the joint analysis of novel high-resolution SeaSoar measurements and sea surface temperature imagery. Surface spatiotemporal correlation scales range between 1.5 and 6 days and between 20 and 50 km, with the shortest scales along the shelf-break path of the Brazil Current and over the confluence and the longest ones along the Malvinas Current. The spatial scales display minima along the front, at the surface because of the presence of brackish shelf waters and at the subsurface due to both mesoscale and submesoscale thermohaline intrusions. The smallest cross-frontal vertical correlations, in the 5- to 10-m range, are associated with submesoscale processes. Overall, temperature variability is enhanced at depth in the frontal system.

TI  - Optical classification of inland waters based on an improved Fuzzy C-Means method
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water optical clustering based on water color information is important for many ecological and environmental application studies, both regionally and globally. The fuzzy clustering method avoids the sharp boundaries in type-memberships produced by hard clustering methods, and thus presents its advantages. However, to make good use of the fuzzy clustering methods on water color spectra data sets, the determination of the fuzzifier parameter (m) of FCM (fuzzy c-means) is the key factor. Usually, the m is set to 2 by default. Unfortunately, this method assigned some membership degrees to non-belonging water type, failing to obtain the unitarity of cluster structure in some cases, especially in inland eutrophic water. To overcome this shortcoming, we proposed an improved FCM method (namely FCM-m) for water color spectra classification by optimizing the fuzzifier parameter. We collected an inland data set containing 1280 in situ spectral data and co-measured water quality parameters with a wide range of biogeochemical variability in China. Using FCM-m, seven spectrally distinct water optical clusters on Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Imager) bands were obtained with the optimized fuzzifier (m =1.36), and the well-performed clustering result is assessed by the validated index (Fuzzy Silhouette Index =0.513). Also, the FCM-m-based soft classification framework was successfully applied to the atmospherically corrected OLCI images, which was evaluated by previous case studies. Besides, by testing FCM-m on three coastal and oceanic data sets, we verified that the optimized m should be adjusted based on the data set itself, and in general, the value gradually approaches 1 with the increase of the band number (or dimension). Finally, the effect of the improved method was tested by Chlorophyll-a concentration estimation. The results show that the algorithm blending by FCM-m performs better than that by original FCM, which is mainly because the FCM-m reduces the estimation error from non-belonging clusters by a stricter membership value assignation. To sum up, we believe that FCM-m is an adaptive algorithm, whose R codes are available at https://github.com/bishun945, and needs to be tested by more public data sets.

AB  - In this article, we explore the worldview of the pilgrim and how it relates to the drama of human existence. The worldview of the pilgrim is the starting point in our explorations of the postmodern conundrum and interrelated subjects such as epistemology, ethics, religious symbolism, hospitality and practical life strategies from a narrative and confessional perspective. These elaborations will serve the ultimate goal of this article, which is to contribute to the philosophy of education (including educators and educationists) and consequently to equip individuals with skills and substantial knowledge that would allow them to understand, define and pursue their own life goals as well as to participate with integrity in their community as full-fledged, responsible citizens.

TI  - The Cumulus And Stratocumulus CloudSat-CALIPSO Dataset (CASCCAD)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Low clouds continue to contribute greatly to the uncertainty in cloud feedback estimates. Depending on whether a region is dominated by cumulus (Cu) or stratocumulus (Sc) clouds, the interannual low-cloud feedback is somewhat different in both spaceborne and large-eddy simulation studies. Therefore, simulating the correct amount and variation of the Cu and Sc cloud distributions could be crucial to predict future cloud feedbacks. Here we document spatial distributions and profiles of Sc and Cu clouds derived from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and CloudSat measurements. For this purpose, we create a new dataset called the Cumulus And Stratocumulus CloudSat-CALIPSO Dataset (CASCCAD), which identifies Sc, broken Sc, Cu under Sc, Cu with stratiform outflow and Cu. To separate the Cu from Sc, we design an original method based on the cloud height, horizontal extent, vertical variability and horizontal continuity, which is separately applied to both CALIPSO and combined CloudSat CALIPSO observations. First, the choice of parameters used in the discrimination algorithm is investigated and validated in selected Cu, Sc and Sc Cu transition case studies. Then, the global statistics are compared against those from existing passive- and active-sensor satellite observations. Our results indicate that the cloud optical thickness as used in passive-sensor observations is not a sufficient parameter to discriminate Cu from Sc clouds, in agreement with previous literature. Using clustering-derived datasets shows better results although one cannot completely separate cloud types with such an approach. On the contrary, classifying Cu and Sc clouds and the transition between them based on their geometrical shape and spatial heterogeneity leads to spatial distributions consistent with prior knowledge of these clouds, from ground-based, ship-based and field campaigns. Furthermore, we show that our method improves existing Sc Cu classifications by using additional information on cloud height and vertical cloud fraction variation. Finally, the CASCCAD datasets provide a basis to evaluate shallow convection and stratocumulus clouds on a global scale in climate models and potentially improve our understanding of low-level cloud feedbacks. The CASCCAD dataset (Cesana, 2019, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2667637) is available on the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GIS S) website at https://data.giss.nasa.gov/clouds/casccad/ (last access: 5 November 2019) and on the zenodo website at https://zenodo.org/record/2667637 (last access: 5 November 2019).

TI  - The importance of physiological, structural and trait responses to drought stress in driving spatial and temporal variation in GPP across Amazon forests
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity of Amazon forests to sequester carbon is threatened by climate-change-induced shifts in precipitation patterns. However, the relative importance of plant physiology, ecosystem structure and trait composition responses in determining variation in gross primary productivity (GPP) remain largely unquantified and vary among models. We evaluate the relative importance of key climate constraints to GPP, comparing direct plant physiological responses to water availability and indirect structural and trait responses (via changes to leaf area index (LAI), roots and photosynthetic capacity). To separate these factors we combined the soil-plant-atmosphere model with forcing and observational data from seven intensively studied forest plots along an Amazon drought stress gradient. We also used machine learning to evaluate the relative importance of individual climate factors across sites. Our model experiments showed that variation in LAI was the principal driver of differences in GPP across the gradient, accounting for 33% of observed variation. Differences in photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax and J(max)) accounted for 21% of variance, and climate (which included physiological responses) accounted for 16 %. Sensitivity to differences in climate was highest where a shallow rooting depth was coupled with a high LAI. On sub-annual timescales, the relative importance of LAI in driving GPP increased with drought stress (R-2 = 0.72), coincident with the decreased importance of solar radiation (R-2 = 0.90). Given the role of LAI in driving GPP across Amazon forests, improved mapping of canopy dynamics is critical, opportunities for which are offered by new satellite-based remote sensing missions such as GEDI, Sentinel and FLEX.

TI  - Analysis of Ecological Environment Changes in Hydropower Development Zone Based on RSEI: A Case Study in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Qingjiang River, China
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to timely monitor the ecological environment changes during the development of water energy and coordinate the relationship between hydropower development and ecological environmental protection, Landsat TM/OLI images in 1987, 2004 and 2015 were selected according to the timeline of Qingjiang hydropower cascade development. Four evaluation indexes, namely, modified adjusted soil vegetation index (MASVI), wet index (WET), land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference soil index (NDSI), were extracted to represent the four aspects of greenness, humidity, heat and dryness. A new remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was generated using principal component analysis to evaluate the ecological environment of Qingjiang hydropower development zone. Results show that: (1) The RSEI of the middle and lower reaches of the Qingjiang River in 1987, 2004 and 2015 were 0.443, 0.664, and 0.515, showing a trend of first rising and then declining. (2) The ecological environment improvement areas are mainly distributed in the low hilly areas and flat plain areas, while the ecological environment degraded areas are mainly distributed in the water conservancy hubs and their affiliated reservoir areas, the Karst mountains along the coast, and the hilly areas where the Qingjiang River afflux into the Yangtze River. (3) The ecological environment of Qingjiang hydropower development area is most closely related to the MASVI and the NDSI. The average correlation of the 3 years between ecological environment and these two indexes is 0.879 and -0.916, respectively. Improving vegetation coverage and controlling bare and dry surface are the keys to the environmental restoration of hydropower construction areas.

TI  - The Psychoactive Surveillance Consortium and Analysis Network (PSCAN): the first year
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aimsThe Psychoactive Surveillance Consortium and Analysis Network (PSCAN) is a national network of academic emergency departments (ED), analytical toxicologists and pharmacologists that collects clinical data paired with biological samples to identify and improve treatments of medical conditions arising from use of new psychoactive substances (NPS). The aim of this study was to gather clinical data with paired drug identification from NPS users who presented to EDs within PSCAN during its first year (2016-17).DesignObservational study involving patient records and biological samples.SettingSeven academic emergency medical centers across the United States.ParticipantsED patients (n = 127) > 8 years of age with possible NPS use who were identified and enrolled in PSCAN by clinical providers or research personnel.MeasurementsClinical signs, symptoms and treatments were abstracted from the patients' health records. Biological samples were collected from leftover urine, serum and whole blood. Biological and drug samples, when available, were tested for drugs and drug metabolites via liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS).FindingsPatients in whom synthetic opioids were detected (n = 9) showed higher rates of intubation (four of nine), impaired mental status (four of nine) and respiratory acidosis (five of nine) compared with the rest of the cohort (nine of 118, P-value < 0.05). Patients in whom synthetic cannabinoid (SC) were found (n = 27) had lower median diastolic blood pressures (70.5 versus 77 mmHg, P = 0.046) compared with the rest of the cohort. In 64 cases of single drug ingestion, benzodiazepines were administered in 25 cases and considered effective by the treating physician in 21 (84%) cases.ConclusionsDuring its first year of operation, the Psychoactive Surveillance Consortium and Analysis Network captured clinical data on new classes of drugs paired with biological samples over a large geographical area in the United States. Synthetic cannabinoids were the most common new psychoactive drug identified. Synthetic opioids were associated with a high rate of intubation and respiratory acidosis.

TI  - Difference and cause analysis of water storage changes for glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are very sensitive to dimate change and have expanded rapidly in recent decades. In this study, lake water storage change (LWSC) of 150 lakes since 1976 was estimated based on multi-temporal Landsat images and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. The lakes were then separated into glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes based on the second Chinese glacier inventory and basin boundaries. The results indicate that most lakes had a shrinking trend and total water storage decreased by 5.53 +/- 0.4 km(3) from 1976 to 1990; however, most lakes expanded and increased in total water storage by 110.15 +/- 7.93 km(3) from 1990 to 2013. The water storage increase in glacier-fed lakes was 84% of the total increase in water storage from 1990 to 2013. An analysis of the relationship between the lakes and climate indicators suggests that both precipitation and glacial meltwater were the most important factors in lake change, in contrast, changes in evaporation had a limited influence on lake level and volume changes. Based on an assumption of similar precipitation and evaporation across neighbouring closed basins, we compared differences in LWSC between glacier-fed and nonglacier-fed lakes to analyze the cause of lake change. Our results suggest that less precipitation was the primary cause for lake contractions from 1976 to 1990. Glacial meltwater contributed at least 435%, 46.4% and 58.7% to the total increased water storage for the periods 1990-2000, 2000-2005 and 2005-2013, respectively. The results further suggest that increasing glacial meltwater had a contribution to lake expansion equivalent to that of precipitation-evaporation during 1990-2013. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of axillary ultrasound and standard breast MRI for differentiation between limited and advanced axillary nodal disease in clinically node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative differentiation between limited (pN1; 1-3 axillary metastases) and advanced (pN2-3; >= 4 axillary metastases) nodal disease can provide relevant information regarding surgical planning and guiding adjuvant radiation therapy. The aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of preoperative axillary ultrasound (US) and breast MRI for differentiation between pN1 and pN2-3 in clinically node-positive breast cancer. A total of 49 patients were included with axillary metastasis confirmed by US-guided tissue sampling. All had undergone breast MRI between 2008-2014 and subsequent axillary lymph node dissection. Unenhanced T2-weighted MRI exams were reviewed by two radiologists independently. Each lymph node on the MRI exams was scored using a confidence scale (0-4) and compared with histopathology. Diagnostic performance parameters were calculated for differentiation between pN1 and pN2-3. Interobserver agreement was determined using Cohen's kappa coefficient. At final histopathology, 67.3% (33/49) and 32.7% (16/49) of patients were pN1 and pN2-3, respectively. Breast MRI was comparable to US in terms of accuracy (MRI reader 1 vs US, 71.4% vs 69.4%, p = 0.99; MRI reader 2 vs US, 73.5% vs 69.4%, p = 0.77). In the case of 1-3 suspicious lymph nodes, pN2-3 was observed in 30.4% on US (positive predictive value (PPV) 69.6%) and in 22.2-24.3% on MRI (PPV 75.7-77.8%). In the case of > 4 suspicious lymph nodes, pN1 was observed in 33.3% on US (negative predictive value (NPV) 66.7%) and in 38.5-41.7% on MRI (NPV 58.3-61.5%). Interobserver agreement was considered good (k = 0.73). In clinically node-positive patients, the diagnostic performance of axillary US and breast MRI is comparable and limited for accurate differentiation between pN1 and pN2-3. Therefore, there seems no added clinical value of preoperative breast MRI regarding nodal staging in patients with positive axillary US.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As oneness reflects the much-needed worldview in the 21st century, exploring how oneness behaviors might play out in different cultures seem a worthwhile scientific pursuit in the service of humanity. The main purpose of the present study is to test whether factor structure and measurement construct of Oneness Behaviors Scale is valid on the Indian sample. A total of 1040 participants (651 from Turkey 389 from India) participated in the study for testing the cross-cultural equivalence of the scale. The results demonstrated limited partial invariance of oneness scale across Turkish and Indian samples with suggesting most of items have been perceived and understood differently, even factorial structure is similar. With the very limited findings of invariant items between these cultures, making further tests would add to our understanding of oneness behaviors in terms of both research and practice.

T2  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple to use nuclear magnetic resonance analysis method has been tested on complex H-1, F-19, and C-13 multiplets. This open-source line-shape analysis method analysis of total lineshape (ANATOLIA)(1) provides some significant advantages over traditional assign-iterate methods of NMR spectral analysis by avoiding false minima and progressing optimisation to the global minimum. The target molecules are 1-perfluorotol-4-yl-2-perfluorotol-4-yl-oxymethyl-1H-benzimidazole (molecule-I) and 1-tetrafluoropyrid-4-yl-2-tetrafluoropyrid-4-yl-thio-1H-benzimidazole (molecule-II) which were produced as part of a family of fluorinated drug scaffolds prepared for anticancer and antiparasitic screening. Spectra display significant second-order effects with H-1 Delta delta = 3.68 and 4.67 Hz for the aromatic hydrogen "triplets", with F-19 (4)J(AA'), (4)J(BB'), (4)J(XX'), and (4)J(YY') coupling constants range from +4.8 to -14.0 Hz and for C-13-isotopomers F-19 Delta delta of up to 111.56 Hz. A spin-system of six coupling nuclei (HaHbHcHd FYFY') was analysed in 12 s, a spin-system of nine coupling fluorine nuclei (AA'BB'CCC-YY') was analysed within 2 min, and 10 coupling nuclei (XX'YY'ZZZ-BB'-H-d) was optimised in 6 min using a laptop computer. ANATOLIA was also robust enough to be able to yield accurate spectral values from inaccurate input values. In both compounds, a fluorine-fluorine coupling constant was identified between the two fluoro-aromatic rings (F-BB' and F-YY') of +4.05 and +4.67 Hz and attributed to a through-space interaction. Ab initio structure optimisations and coupling constant calculations provided useful input data for spectral analysis. A modern F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of perfluorotoluene (octafluorotoluene) and analysis from 1975 was used as a test data set to assess ANATOLIA.

TI  - Mapping cotton fields using data mining and MODIS time-series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton is the most important fibre culture in the world. In Brazil, cotton cultivation is concentrated in the Cerrado biome, the Brazilian savanna, and is one of the most important commodities in the country. As an annual crop, the updating frequency of the spatial distribution data of cotton fields is extremely important for crop monitoring systems. In order to provide fast and accurate information for crop monitoring, time series of remote- sensing data has been used in the development of several applications in agriculture, since the high temporal resolution of some orbital sensor allows monitoring targets with high spectral-temporal variations in the land surface. However, there are still some challenges to systematize the processing of such a large amount of data available by long time series of remote-sensing imagery. Thus, this study contributes to the construction of models to identify and separate specific crop types with similar spectral behaviour to other crops practised in the same period. The objective of this study was to develop a systematic methodology based on data mining of time series of vegetation indices (VI) to map cotton fields at the regional scale. Field reference data and time series of NDVI and EVI images, obtained from MODIS sensor products during four cropping seasons (from 2012-2013 to 2015-2016), were used to construct mapping models based on decision tree algorithms. Phenological metrics were calculated from the VI time series and used to build classification rules for mapping cotton fields. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method to map cotton fields achieve high accuracy when field data and visual interpretation of NDVI temporal profiles were used for validation (accuracy higher than 95% and 93%, respectively). Comparisons with the official statistics indicated an optimal fit, with linear correlation (r) and coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.93. Therefore, the proposed method was efficient to distinguish cotton fields from other crop types with similar spectral behaviour. In addition, this method can also be applied to other cotton-producing regions and other production seasons, by reusing the models generated through machine learning approaches.

TI  - Analysis of the applicability of multi-temporal full polarimetric airborne L-band SAR scattering to paddy rice field mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an all-weather imaging system that is often used for mapping paddy rice fields and estimating the area. Fully polarimetric SAR is used to detect the microwave scattering property. In this study, a simple threshold analysis of fully polarimetric L-band SAR data was conducted to distinguish paddy rice fields from soybean and other fields. We analysed a set of ten airborne SAR L-band 2 (Pi-SAR-L2) images obtained during the paddy rice growing season (in June, August, and September) from 2012 to 2014 using polarimetric decomposition. Vector data for agricultural land use areas were overlaid on the analysed images and the mean value for each agricultural parcel computed. By quantitatively comparing our data with a reference dataset generated from optical sensor images, effective polarimetric parameters and the ideal observation season were revealed. Double bounce scattering and surface scattering component ratios, derived using a four-component decomposition algorithm, were key to extracting paddy rice fields when the plant stems are vertical with respect to the ground. The alpha angle was also an effective factor for extracting rice fields from an agricultural area. The data obtained during August show maximum agreement with the reference dataset of estimated paddy rice field areas.

TI  - Fewer tumour draining sentinel nodes in patients with progressing muscle invasive bladder cancer, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To examine the relationship between the number of tumour draining sentinel nodes (SNs) and pathoanatomical outcomes, in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and radical cystectomy (RC). Materials and Methods In an ongoing prospective multicenter study, we included 230 patients with suspected urothelial MIBC from ten Swedish urological centers. All underwent TURb and clinical staging. From the cohort, 116 patients with urothelial MIBC; cT2-cT4aN0M0, underwent radical cystectomy (RC) and lymphadenectomy with SN-detection (SNd). 83 patients received cisplatin-based NAC and 33 were NAC-naive. The number and locations of detected SNs and non-SNs were recorded for each patient. The NAC treated patients were categorized by pathoanatomical outcomes post-RC into three groups: complete responders (CR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). Selected covariates with possible impact on SN-yield were tested in uni -and multivariate analyses for NAC-treated patients only. Results In NAC treated patients, the mean number of SNs was significantly higher in CR patients (3.3) and SD patients (3.6) compared with PD patients (1.4) (p = 0.034). In a linear multivariate regression model, the number of harvested nodes was the only independent variable that affected the number of SNs (p = 0.0004). Conclusions The number of tumor-draining SNs in NAC-treated patients was significantly lower in patients with progressive disease.

TI  - Evaluation of gap-filling methods for Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off image for LULC classification in a heterogeneous landscape of West Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat mission which has existed over five decades has remained at the forefront of providing consistent moderate spatial and temporal resolution optical images of the earth. The failure of the scan line corrector (SLC) on board the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) in May 2003 has permanently resulted in data gaps on each Landsat 7 scene. Due to the obvious negative impacts on the image usability, a number of methods have been developed to fill the no-data areas in the image. This study assessed the performance of four Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off gap-filling methods in a highly heterogeneous landscape of West Africa for two different seasons (dry and rainy). The methods considered are: (1) Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) integrated with Laplacian Prior Regularization Method (LPRM), (2) Localised Linear Histogram Matching (LLHM), (3) Neighbourhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI) and (4) Geostatistical Neighbourhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (GNSPI). All the images used were Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images, temporally close and from the same season for each set of time step. Visual comparison, mean, and standard deviations of the histograms of all bands of only the filled areas were used to assess the results. Additionally, overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (kappa), and balanced accuracy (BA) per class were used to evaluate a land use/cover (LULC) classification based on the gap-filled images. Visually, all the four methods were able to completely fill the gaps in the Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off image. They all look similar and spatially continuous with no anomalies or artefacts on them. The histograms from each band for only the filled areas for all the four methods also gave similar means and standard deviations in most cases. All the four gap-filling methods provided satisfactory results (OA >96% and kappa> 0.937 in all methods for images in the dry season and OA >93% and kappa> 0.877 for the image in the rainy season) in the land cover classification considering the complexity of the study area. But the GNSPI was superiority in all cases with the highest OA of 97.1% and kappa of 0.947 in the dry season and OA of 94.6% and kappa of 0.899 in the rainy season. This implies that the GNSPI is more robust in gap filling of Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images than the other three methods in a heterogeneous landscape of West Africa regardless of the season. This study suggests that gap filling of Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images will help to increase the number of Landsat images needed to build time-series data for a data-scarce region such as West Africa.

TI  - Biomass of the Cyanobacterium <i>Lyngbya wollei</i> Alters Copper Algaecide Exposure and Risks to a Non-target Organism
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nuisance algal infestations are increasing globally in distribution and frequency. Copper-based algaecides are routinely applied to control these infestations, though there is an ever-present concern of risks to non-target species. This research evaluated risks associated with a commonly applied chelated copper algaecide (Captain (R) XTR; SePRO Corporation) to a sentinel non-target species (Daphnia magna) and further assessed alteration of the exposure and toxicity when a nuisance mat-forming cyanobacterium, Lyngbya wollei, was present in exposures. Aqueous copper concentrations in treatments with algae significantly decreased within 1 h after treatment and averaged 57.5% of nominal amended Cu through the experiment duration. The 48 h LC50 values were 371 mu g Cu/L with no algae present in exposures and increased significantly to 531 mu g Cu/L when L. wollei was simultaneously exposed. This research provides information on the short-term fate of copper and hazard assessment by incorporating targeted binding ligands, as present in operational treatments.

TI  - 'Timing it Right': needs of African American adults with stroke and their caregivers across the care continuum
T2  - ETHNICITY & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: African Americans are disproportionately affected by stroke in the United States (US). The purpose of this study is to explore experiences, wants, and needs of African Americans with stroke and their family caregivers residing in the stroke belt across the care continuum using the 'Timing It Right' (TIR) framework as a conceptual guide. Design: We conducted a series of focus groups among 20 African Americans living with stroke and 19 family caregivers. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. For this secondary analysis, we coded qualitative data using the TIR framework. Results: Participants in this sample identified pre-stroke needs in addition to the TIR phases that span across the care continuum and into community living. We identified four important contextual factors and real-world conditions that operate in the background and influence the post-stroke needs of this specific population across the TIR framework: (1) religion, faith, and church, (2) healthcare delivery, (3) community, and (4) sentinel events. Conclusions: We propose a TIR model that expands upon the original TIR framework which includes factors important for consideration when developing and delivering community-based interventions among African Americans with stroke and family caregivers in the southeastern US.

TI  - The quantitative relation between ambient soundscapes and landscape development intensity in North Central Florida
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context It is widely accepted that wildlife is subjected to detrimental human noise within urban landscapes but little is known about how the intensity of land use changes soundscapes. Objectives The objective of this research was to produce quantitative associations between characteristics of ambient soundscapes and land use intensity. These relations were used to examine the 2 kHz demarcation between anthrophony and biophony and compare the impact of different sized contributing areas on ambient soundscape characteristics. Methods This study related the surrounding land use intensity of 67 sites in north central Florida (USA) to several metrics describing their recorded soundscapes. Land use intensity was measured remotely at three scales using the landscape development intensity index (LDI). Results The analysis revealed that the LDI index had a statistically significant effect on soundscape characteristics after controlling for important factors such as climate, season, and attenuation due to hard ground. The trends between LDI and soundscape confirmed that human generated sounds are loud, continuous, and occupy low frequencies. The evenness of the sound distribution decreased with landscape intensity and LDI correlated significantly with sound below 3 kHz. Land use intensity within a 100 and 500-m radius contributing area were most closely related to soundscape metrics. Conclusions LDI is a tool with the potential to predict the extent and intensity of anthropogenic noise disturbance on wildlife from remote sensing data. The utility of this tool allows for widespread application to identify and mitigate conflicts in the acoustic realm between human noise and wildlife.

TI  - Agricultural cropland extent and areas of South Asia derived using Landsat satellite 30-m time-series big-data using random forest machine learning algorithms on the Google Earth Engine cloud
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan) has a staggering 900 million people (similar to 43% of the population) who face food insecurity or severe food insecurity as per United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). The existing coarse-resolution (>= 250-m) cropland maps lack precision in geo-location of individual farms and have low map accuracies. This also results in uncertainties in cropland areas calculated from such products. Thereby, the overarching goal of this study was to develop a high spatial resolution (30-m or better) baseline cropland extent product of South Asia for the year 2015 using Landsat satellite time-series big-data and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. To eliminate the impact of clouds, 10 time-composited Landsat bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, Thermal, EVI, NDVI, NDWI) were derived for each of the three time-periods over 12 months (monsoon: Days of the Year (DOY) 151-300; winter: DOY 301-365 plus 1-60; and summer: DOY 61-150), taking the every 8-day data from Landsat-8 and 7 for the years 2013-2015, for a total of 30-bands plus global digital elevation model (GDEM) derived slope band. This 31-band mega-file big data-cube was composed for each of the five agro-ecological zones (AEZ's) of South Asia and formed a baseline data for image classification and analysis. Knowledge-base for the Random Forest (RF) MLAs were developed using spatially well spread-out reference training data (N = 2179) in five AEZs. The classification was performed on GEE for each of the five AEZs using well-established knowledge-base and RF MLAs on the cloud. Map accuracies were measured using independent validation data (N = 1185). The survey showed that the South Asia cropland product had a producer's accuracy of 89.9% (errors of omissions of 10.1%), user's accuracy of 95.3% (errors of commission of 4.7%) and an overall accuracy of 88.7%. The National and sub-national (districts) areas computed from this cropland extent product explained 80-96% variability when compared with the National statistics of the South Asian Countries. The full-resolution imagery can be viewed at full-resolution, by zooming-in to any location in South Asia or the world, at and the cropland products of South Asia downloaded from The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS): .

TI  - Land cover dynamic change in the Napahai Basin using the optimized random forest model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the optimized random forest (ORF) model proposed in our research, data of the Landsat-OLI, Landsat-TM images, and digital elevation model were used by us to obtain the land cover maps during several periods in the Napahai Basin. Model performance testing results show that producer accuracy and kappa coefficient of the ORF approach are 0.916 and 0.903, which are higher than the traditional maximum likelihood method. Furthermore, we analyzed the characteristic of land cover dynamic change and seasonal variation of wetlands landscape in 2002 and 2017, and revealed their driving mechanisms and ecological response process. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Lake area expanded in the past 15 years because of increased glacial runoff generated from global warming. Construction land and farmland replaced wetland areas in the middle and downstream regions. Moreover, due to the limitation of hydrothermal conditions in the canyon, few forests in the northeastern basin transferred to shrubs. (2) Dam, which was constructed in northern Napahai lake, controls water storage and made the lake area stable after 2013, so, area change percentage in 2017 from wet to dry season is lower than 2002. The wetland region in the central and downstream basin was synthetically affected by climate change and drainage projects, so its environment condition becomes dryer, and vegetation communities' succession shows a reversed process. (3) Ecological problems in the Napahai Basin were mainly reflected at aspects of agricultural nonpoint source pollution, overgrazing, and urbanization. These factors affected lake, soil, and groundwater in the Napahai Basin and destroyed the ecological health of wetland landscapes. Therefore, in order to realize sustainable development environmental resources, local government should propose the effective policies to restore the degraded ecosystem and protect natural wetland.

TI  - A practical method to account for variation in detection range in acoustic telemetry arrays to accurately quantify the spatial ecology of aquatic animals
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Acoustic telemetry is a popular tool for long-term tracking of aquatic animals to describe and quantify patterns of movement, space use, and diverse ecological interactions. Acoustic receivers are imperfect sampling instruments, and their detection range (DR; the area surrounding the receiver in which tag transmissions can be detected) often varies dramatically over space and time due to dynamic environmental conditions. Therefore, it is prudent to quantify and account for variation in DR to prevent telemetry system performance from confounding the understanding of real patterns in animal space use. However, acoustic receiver DR consists of a complex, dynamic, three-dimensional area that is challenging to quantify. Although quantifying the absolute DR of all receivers is infeasible in the context of most acoustic telemetry studies, we outline a practical approach to quantify relative variation among receiver DR over space and time. This approach involves selecting a set of sentinel receivers to monitor drivers of variation in detection range. Each sentinel receiver is subject to a range testing procedure to estimate detection efficiency (DE; the proportion of total transmissions detected by the receiver), at a range of distances from the receiver, to derive the maximum range (MR; distance from the receiver where DE is 5%) and Midpoint (distance from the receiver where DE is 50%). A reference transmitter is then placed at the Midpoint, providing a standardized measure of long-term variation in DE, with each station having similar freedom of variance. Variation in reference tag DE is then combined with MR to calculate a DR correction factor (DRc). A modelling approach is then used to estimate DRc for all receivers in the array at spatial and temporal scales of ecological interest, which can be used to correct animal detection data in various ways. We demonstrate this method with a hypothetical dataset, as well as empirical data from an acoustic telemetry array to delineate spatio-temporal patterns of fish habitat use. This is a flexible and practical approach to account for variation in acoustic receiver performance, allowing more accurate spatial and temporal patterns in aquatic animal spatial ecology to be revealed.

TI  - Development of aboveground mangrove forests' biomass dataset for Southeast Asia based on ALOS-PALSAR 25-m mosaic
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA) has the largest mangrove forest area in the world, which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and is helping to mitigate climate change. In order to manage the mangrove forests in SEA, their total biomass needs to be determined. However, development of a biomass dataset based on field survey is time consuming. An aboveground biomass (AGB) dataset of mangrove forests was developed for SEA based on ALOS PALSAR 25-m mosaic. Specifically, ALOS-PALSAR 25-m images were first retrieved for SEA from the Kyoto and Carbon Initiative projects and then converted from a digital number to a normalized radar cross-section format in decibels. Samples of mangrove forests in SEA were collected as regions of interest from ALOS PALSAR data based on visual interpretation using Landsat data and Google Earth imagery. A rule-based classification method based on mangrove backscattering characteristics was then used to classify mangroves and nonmangroves in the region. Subsequently, an empirical model was adopted to estimate the AGB of the mangrove forests and an AGB dataset was developed. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of mangrove forests over SEA is 5 1 million hectares, and the estimated average AGB is 140.5 +/- 136.1 Mg/ha. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Linear Transects of Imagery Increase Crop Monitoring Efficiency Using Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aircraft Systems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop monitoring with unmanned aircraft must be timely to prevent yield losses and have low cost to be profitable. However, the expenses of acquiring large numbers of images with large overlap and creation of ortho-rectified mosaics may make unmanned aircraft system (UAS) monitoring slow and cost prohibitive. A fixed-wing UAS was flown over six center-pivot irrigated fields and untilled sagebrush steppe over the 2014 growing season. A 90-m by 90-m area centered at the image nadir point was analyzed as a single point along a linear transect. When aggregated by field, UAS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) agreed with NDVI from a corresponding Landsat image, with an R-2 of 0.958 and an RMSE of 0.058. Since each image retained its high spatial resolution, the proposed transect method could be used along with computer vision and artificial intelligence to detect plant stress, weeds, pests, and diseases.

TI  - People and Pixels 20 years later: the current data landscape and research trends blending population and environmental data
T2  - POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1998, the National Research Council published People and Pixels: Linking Remote Sensing and Social Science. The volume focused on emerging research linking changes in human populations and land use/land cover to shed light on issues of sustainability, human livelihoods, and conservation, and led to practical innovations in agricultural planning, hazard impact analysis, and drought monitoring. Since then, new research opportunities have emerged thanks to the growing variety of remotely sensed data sources, an increasing array of georeferenced social science data, including data from mobile devices, and access to powerful computation cyberinfrastructure. In this article, we outline the key extensions of the People and Pixels foundation since 1998 and highlight several breakthroughs in research on human-environment interactions. We also identify pressing research problems-disaster, famine, drought, war, poverty, climate change-and explore how interdisciplinary approaches integrating people and pixels are being used to address them.

TI  - Can We Identify or Exclude Extensive Axillary Nodal Involvement in Breast Cancer Patients Preoperatively?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. Breast cancer treatment has rapidly changed in the last few years. Particularly, treatment of patients with axillary nodal involvement has evolved after publication of several randomized clinical trials. Omitting axillary lymph node dissection in selected early breast cancer patients with one or two positive sentinel nodes did not compromise overall survival nor regional disease control in these trials. Hence, either excluding or identifying extensive axillary nodal involvement becomes increasingly important. Purpose. To evaluate whether the current diagnostic modalities can accurately identify or exclude extensive axillary nodal involvement. Evaluated modalities were axillary ultrasound, ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, MRI, and PET/CT. Methods. A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed databases up to June 2019. The search strategy included terms for breast cancer, lymph nodes, and the different imaging modalities. Only articles that reported pathological N-stage or the total number of positive axillary lymph nodes were considered for inclusion. Studies with patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy were excluded. Conclusion. There is no evidence that any of the current preoperative axillary imaging modalities can accurately exclude or identify breast cancer patients with extensive nodal involvement. Both negative PET/CT and negative MRI scans (with gadolinium-based contrast agents) are promising in excluding extensive nodal involvement. Larger studies should be performed to strengthen this conclusion. False-negative rates of axillary ultrasound and ultrasound-guided needle biopsy are too high to rely on negative results of these modalities in excluding extensive nodal involvement.

TI  - Lagrangian Evolution of Two Madagascar Cyclonic Eddies: Geometric Properties, Vertical Structure, and Fluxes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the 3-D Lagrangian evolution of two Madagascar cyclonic eddies based on ad hoc Argo experiments undertaken in April and July 2013. Eight Argo floats were configured to measure temperature and salinity at high temporal resolutions (daily and five-daily experiments) and varying park depths (300, 500, 650, and 1,000 m) to test their performance with regard to retention within the eddies described. Near-surface eddy properties are derived from an eddy detection and tracking algorithm applied to satellite altimetry data and a quasi eddy-resolving (1/4 degrees) ocean general circulation model (GLORYS2v4). Both eddies propagated southwestward from southwest Madagascar (26 degrees S, 40 degrees E), where the South East Madagascar Current separates from the continental shelf. During a travel of about 130 days at an average speed of 11 km day(-1), the eddies experienced well-defined growth, mature, and decay phases, interacting with the Agulhas Current at the KwaZulu-Natal Bight (28 degrees S, 34 degrees E). Model-based estimates indicate the April (July) eddy showed mean trapping water depths of 595 +/- 294 m (914 m +/- 107 m), volume transport about 13.4 +/- 5.2 Sv (21.2 +/- 9.1 Sv), heat flux of -0.07 +/- 0.06 PW (-0.2 +/- 0.09 PW), and freshwater flux of 0.04 +/- 0.04 Sv (0.09 +/- 0.05 Sv). Peak estimates were found for both eddies during the mature eddy phase. These results highlight the role of Madagascar cyclonic eddies as transporters of cooled and freshened source waters into the Agulhas Current and illustrate the benefits of ad hoc Argo configurations for the study of 3-D Lagrangian eddy dynamics in combination with a "state-of-the-art" ocean model and remotely sensed data.

TI  - Exposed soil and mineral map of the Australian continent revealing the land at its barest
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-spectral remote sensing has already played an important role in mapping surface mineralogy. However, vegetation - even when relatively sparse - either covers the underlying substrate or modifies its spectral response, making it difficult to resolve diagnostic mineral spectral features. Here we take advantage of the petabyte-scale Landsat datasets covering the same areas for periods exceeding 30 years combined with a novel high-dimensional statistical technique to extract a noise-reduced, cloud-free, and robust estimate of the spectral response of the barest state (i.e. least vegetated) across the whole continent of Australia at 25m(2) resolution. Importantly, our method preserves the spectral relationships between different wavelengths of the spectra. This means that our freely available continental-scale product can be combined with machine learning for enhanced geological mapping, mineral exploration, digital soil mapping, and establishing environmental baselines for understanding and responding to food security, climate change, environmental degradation, water scarcity, and threatened biodiversity.

TI  - Three-dimensional deformation time series of glacier motion from multiple-aperture DInSAR observation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The previously presented Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS-2D) technique computes two-dimensional (2D), east and vertical, ground deformation time series from two or more ascending and descending Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) data sets by assuming that the contribution of the north deformation component is negligible. DInSAR data sets can be acquired with different temporal and spatial resolutions, viewing geometries and wavelengths. The MSBAS-2D technique has previously been used for mapping deformation due to mining, urban development, carbon sequestration, permafrost aggradation and pingo growth, and volcanic activities. In the case of glacier ice flow, the north deformation component is often too large to be negligible. Historically, the surface-parallel flow (SPF) constraint was used to compute the static three-dimensional (3D) velocity field at various glaciers. A novel MSBAS-3D technique has been developed for computing 3D deformation time series where the SPF constraint is utilized. This technique is used for mapping 3D deformation at the Barnes Ice Cap, Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada, during January-March 2015, and the MSBAS-2D and MSBAS-3D solutions are compared. The MSBAS-3D technique can be used for studying glacier ice flow at other glaciers and other surface deformation processes with large north deformation component, such as landslides. The software implementation of MSBAS-3D technique can be downloaded from http://insar.ca/.

TI  - Delineation of management zones with spatial data fusion and belief theory
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture, as part of modern agriculture, thrives on an enormously growing amount of information and data for processing and application. The spatial data used for yield forecasting or the delimitation of management zones are very diverse, often of different quality and in different units to each other. For various reasons, approaches to combining geodata are complex, but necessary if all relevant information is to be taken into account. Data fusion with belief structures offers the possibility to link geodata with expert knowledge, to include experiences and beliefs in the process and to maintain the comprehensibility of the framework in contrast to other "black box" models. This study shows the possibility of dividing agricultural land into management zones by combining soil information, relief structures and multi-temporal satellite data using the transferable belief model. It is able to bring in the knowledge and experience of farmers with their fields and can thus offer practical assistance in management measures without taking decisions out of hand. At the same time, the method provides a solution to combine all the valuable spatial data that correlate with crop vitality and yield. For the development of the method, eleven data sets in each possible combination and different model parameters were fused. The most relevant results for the practice and the comprehensibility of the model are presented in this study. The aim of the method is a zoned field map with three classes: "low yield", "medium yield" and "high yield". It is shown that not all data are equally relevant for the modelling of yield classes and that the phenology of the plant is of particular importance for the selection of satellite images. The results were validated with yield data and show promising potential for use in precision agriculture.

TI  - Precipitable water vapor fusion: an approach based on spherical cap harmonic analysis and Helmert variance component estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is an important parameter in Earth's atmosphere, and its spatiotemporal variations influence Earth's energy transfer and weather changes. PWV can be monitored and retrieved by plenty of techniques with varying spatiotemporal resolutions, accuracies, and systematic biases. In this study, we fused PWVs from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-5 reanalysis to generate PWV maps with combined resolution and accuracy. Before fusing the data, we apply a bias correction to remove the systematic biases among the three datasets. Then, the fusion is performed by an approach based on the spherical cap harmonic (SCH) analysis and the Helmert variance component estimation (HVCE). The core idea is that the SCH model represents the combined PWV field on the sphere, and the HVCE determines the weights of different datasets. We generate more than 300 combined PWV maps in North America in 2018, which are then validated by a different set of GNSS PWV. Results show that the combined PWVs have mean bias of 0.2 mm, standard deviation of 1.9 mm, and root mean square error of 2.0 mm. The fused PWVs present better accuracy than the MODIS and ERA-5 PWVs. In addition, our proposed approach effectively suppressed regional biases among different datasets. The fused PWV exhibits a better and unified accuracy compared with the MODIS and ERA-5 PWVs.

TI  - Detection of urban flood inundation using RISAT-1 SAR images: a case study of Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir (North India) floods of September 2014
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave data from SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors are used extensively in providing operational support for riverine floods, unlike for urban flood disaster. Current approaches for flood mapping using SAR basically aim at detecting for regions of low backscatter due to specular reflection from water surface. However, flooding in urban areas may appear bright in SAR images, because of the enhancement of the double-bounce effect. The present communication presents a case study of the use of moderate-resolution C-band SAR images from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite RISAT-1 to assess the changes in backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) values (flood sigma(0 )- non-flood sigma(0)) for catastrophic floods of September 2014. SAR images considered for evaluation are with similar acquisition parameters (orbit, look direction, incidence angle, polarization, imaging mode, resolution, and acquisition time) to have a consistency in comparison of backscatter values. From the backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) comparison analysis and visual inspection between pre-flood and flood duration images, it is observed that there is a significant increase in the sigma(0) values of about 8.0 dB and corresponding increase in the tonal brightness of flooded locations. The areas identified with high backscatter response are also validated for flooding through high-resolution Pleiades (spatial resolution 0.5 m) optical satellite data and ground information from open sources. The observations made from this study highlight the fact that moderate-resolution SAR images could be an important source in indicating urban flooded areas during rapid response.

TI  - The potential of pregnant women as a sentinel population for malaria surveillance
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background With increasing spatial heterogeneity of malaria transmission and a shift of the disease burden towards older children and adults, pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) have been proposed as a pragmatic sentinel population for malaria surveillance. However, the representativeness of routine ANC malaria test-positivity and its relationship with prevalence in other population subgroups are yet to be investigated. Methods Monthly ANC malaria test-positivity data from all Tanzanian health facilities for January 2014 to May 2016 was compared to prevalence data from the School Malaria Parasitaemia Survey 2015, the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) 2015/16, the Malaria Atlas Project 2015, and a Bayesian model fitted to MIS data. Linear regression was used to describe the difference between malaria test-positivity in pregnant women and respective comparison groups as a function of ANC test-positivity and potential covariates. Results The relationship between ANC test-positivity and survey prevalence in children follows spatially and biologically meaningful patterns. However, the uncertainty of the relationship was substantial, particularly in areas with high or perennial transmission. In comparison, modelled data estimated higher prevalence in children at low transmission intensities and lower prevalence at higher transmission intensities. Conclusions Pregnant women attending ANC are a pragmatic sentinel population to assess heterogeneity and trends in malaria prevalence in Tanzania. Yet, since ANC malaria test-positivity cannot be used to directly predict the prevalence in other population subgroups, complementary community-level measurements remain highly relevant.

TI  - Understanding land surface temperature on rift areas to examine the spatial variation of urban heat island: the case of Hawassa, southern Ethiopia
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the spatial variation of surface temperature is an important criterion to create livable urban environment. To examine the cause of heat island variation in the study area located within the rift zones, an algorithm that was prepared for Landsat 8 band 10 were used by taking the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index threshold method for the estimation of ground emissivity by integrating with the result obtained from MODIS night time data. The LU/LC (land use land cover) maps of the area were prepared with better accuracy using on screen classification technique. The derived LST showed that the surface temperature of the city ranges from 20.6 to 41.30 degrees C and the minimum temperature of the area was observed within the lake and the surrounding areas such as wetland. The maximum temperature was registered on the scattered hills and excavation areas and some parts of bare lands including industrial park of the city. The spatial variation of LST (Land Surface Temperature) in the city is the result of three major factors namely: (1) volcanic products of the geological setting, (2) the nature of the rock (high reflectance) and (3) the LU/LC type. Increasing of evergreen tree cover and rehabilitation of existing mining areas are among the recommended strategy to mitigate the UHI (urban heat island) effects in the city. For future studies in areas that are susceptible to natural heat sources, the satellite data should have high spatial resolution and derived from multiple sensors and satellites that can provide better tools to understand the UHI effect considering the geological setting of the area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to investigate the urban change in the West Bank between the years 1997 to 2016, under complicated geopolitical conditions. High-resolution aerial photographs (1.25 m and 0.1 m) and moderate-resolution satellite imagery (30 m resolution Landsat data) were used in this study. The results of the study showed that the Palestinians suffer from serious limitations imposed by the Israeli occupation due to the urban expansion, especially in the so-called area C, which represents 61% of the West Bank. The Israeli occupation controls this area. On the other hand, the Israeli occupation provides an opportunity to the Israeli settlers to build more houses and buildings for various purposes. The study also shows that most of the Palestinian urban expansion comes at the expense of agricultural lands. The study recommends that the international community has to place more pressure on Israel to give the Palestinians their freedom to plan for their future, and use their lands freely.

TI  - Photogrammetric Bathymetry for the Canadian Arctic
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is becoming common in the estimation of bathymetry for navigational charting through a process known as Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB). Most SDB techniques currently used by hydrographic offices employ an empirical approach, requiring the use of in-situ data to calibrate a relationship between spectral information and coincident depths. This article reports on a multi-site test of an alternative SDB method which uses photogrammetry to extract depths from stereo WorldView-2 imagery. In areas with heterogeneous seafloors, the empirical approach faces difficulties in establishing the relationship between colour and depth, while the photogrammetric approach uses the contrasting seafloor features for triangulation. Additionally, the photogrammetric method may be applied in areas lacking previous survey data. Five study areas in Nunavut, Canada were selected to test the robustness of the method in different environments and under different imaging conditions. Study areas were (with resulting RMSE/Bias given in metres) Coral Harbour (0.84/-0.47), Cambridge Bay (1.16/-0.15), Queen Maud Gulf (0.97/0.06), Arviat (0.99/-0.009), and Frobisher Bay, where extraction largely failed due to environmental conditions. Accuracies demonstrated here are similar to those seen using the empirical approach, suggesting that these two methods may be used in conjunction, each applied to regions where they are better suited.

TI  - Mapping burnt areas in the semi-arid savannahs: an exploration of SVM classification and field surveys
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and precise mapping of burnt areas in the fire-prone semi-arid savannah zones is relevant for making decisions on the management of environmental resources. In this study, we apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to freely available Sentinel-2A&B data to delineate and map burnt areas and compare our findings with conventional field surveys to enable resource managers decide on the most appropriate method to use when seeking to rapidly conduct post-fire assessment. We surveyed three burnt patches of varying sizes and compared with estimates from the SVM classification algorithm. Accuracy assessment was based on reference data collected from field surveys. We obtained an average overall accuracy of 94.8%+/- 5.2% for all kernel functions in the SVM. The classification estimated the average total of the three patches at 42.99 km(2) but with variations among the different kernels, while the field measurements produced 42.29 km(2). A follow-up field survey showed that the earlier survey either over- or under-estimated the burnt patches. Our micro-level analysis demonstrates that any kernel function in the SVM algorithm can be used with freely available remote sensing data to accurately and cost-effectively map wildfire hazards, especially in resource-poor settings, for efficient decision making when managing environmental resource.

TI  - A novel spatial-spectral extraction method for subpixel surface water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral index provides a feasible and efficient method for extracting land surface water from satellite images. However, existing methods at the pixel scale consider only water bodies but disregard complicated mixtures. Emerging subpixel-scale methods improve water mapping a detailed description, but they still fail to achieve precise identification of various types of mixed pixels. This deficiency restricts the further development and application of the spectral index method. In this study, we proposed a novel spatial-spectral extraction method that utilizes double thresholds in describing pixels at the subpixel scale. This method combines spatial and spectral attributes to refine and decompose mixed water-land pixels. In this manner, a stepwise approach is adopted to achieve the optimal result instead of the common single-judging method. The experiments use moderate spatial-resolution images, such as those taken by Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, GF-1's wide field view multispectral camera and the Sentinel-2A satellite. Results confirm that the proposed method can be applied to common moderate spatial-resolution satellite images. This method achieves better accuracy than existing methods. The insensitivity of threshold selection ensures that the proposed method maintains high precision in actual applications.

T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose To report dosimetry and early adverse effects, aesthetic, and patient-reported outcomes of a prospective study of 3-fraction pencil-beam scanning (PBS) proton accelerated partial irradiation (APBI). Materials and methods Eligibility included women age >= 50 years with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), sentinel lymph node negative invasive or in-situ breast cancer measuring <= 2.5 cm. The prescription was 21.9 Gy (RBE 1.1) in 3 daily fractions to the post-operative tumor bed with a 1 cm expansion. Toxicities were collected using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, 10-point Linear Analog Scale Assessment, Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the CTCAE, and the Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale. Results Seventy-six women were treated between 2015 and 2017. The median breast volume receiving 50% of prescription or more was 28%. Median mean heart, mean ipsilateral lung, and maximum skin dose were 0 Gy, 0.1 Gy, and 20.6 Gy, respectively. With a median follow-up of 12 months, no treatment-related toxicity grade >= 2 has been observed. Most common grade 1 adverse events were dermatitis (68%) and skin hyperpigmentation (18%). At 12 months, the only persistent toxicities were one patient with grade 1 breast edema and one patient with a grade 1 seroma. 90% of patients reported quality of life as >= 7 out of 10 (0 indicating "as bad as it can be" and 10 indicating "as good as it can be") and 98% of patients reported excellent or good cosmesis. Conclusion 3-fraction PBS proton APBI is well tolerated with low rates of physician and patient reported early adverse effects. Follow-up is ongoing to assess late toxicities and disease control outcomes. Further investigation of this novel adjuvant treatment strategy is warranted.

TI  - Clinical and virological findings in patients with Usutu virus infection, northern Italy, 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which shares its transmission cycle with the phylogenetically related West Nile virus (WNV). USUV circulates in several European countries and its activity has increased over the last 5 years. Aim: To describe human cases of USUV infection identified by surveillance for WNV and USUV infection in the Veneto Region of northern Italy in 2018.Methods: From 1 June to 30 November 2018, all cases of suspected autochthonous arbovirus infection and blood donors who had a reactive WNV nucleic acid test were investigated for both WNV and USUV infection by in-house molecular methods. Anti-WNV and anti-USUV lgM and IgG antibodies were detected by ELISA and in-house immunofluorescence assay, respectively; positive serum samples were further tested by WNV and USUV neutralisation assays run in parallel. Results: Eight cases of USUV infection (one with neuroinvasive disease, six with fever and one viraemic blood donor who developed arthralgia and myalgia) and 427 cases of WNV infection were identified. A remarkable finding of this study was the persistence of USUV RNA in the blood and urine of three patients during follow-up. USUV genome sequences from two patients shared over 99% nt identity with USUV sequences detected in mosquito pools from the same area and clustered within lineage Europe 2. Conclusions: Clinical presentation and laboratory findings in patients with USUV infection were similar to those found in patients with WNV infection. Cross-reactivity of serology and molecular tests challenged the differential diagnosis.

TI  - Longer term effects of biological control on tamarisk evapotranspiration and carbon dioxide exchange
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological control of Tamarix spp. (tamarisk) with Diorhabda spp. (tamarisk beetle) was initiated in several states in the Western United States in 2001. We analysed 12 years of evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem production (NEP), and beetle abundance data from a tamarisk-invaded site in Western Nevada along the Truckee River. Diorhabda carinulata (northern tamarisk beetle) appeared at the site in 2007. Large beetle outbreaks and associated defoliation of the tamarisk occurred in 2008 and 2009, then the beetle population was highly variable from year to year. Since 2016, the beetle population declined. Growing season ET noticeably declined from direct beetle herbivory in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but the decline in ET was seasonally transient as trees regrew leaves. In 2012 and 2013, total growing season ET was low, likely due to the combined effects of drought and beetle herbivory pressure. Total seasonal ET losses and NEP were primarily driven by annual precipitation with higher values in wetter years and reduced values when precipitation fell below 100 mm. In the last 2 years of the study, 2017-2018, there were few to no beetles observed at the site, and we measured increased tamarisk leaf area index, ET, and NEP. Since 2010 at the study site, no further releases of the beetles have occurred due to wildlife concerns, and subsequent declines in beetle populations where such that the "outbreak" conditions apparently required to impair tamarisk physiological function and significantly reduce ET have not occurred. ET and photosynthesis were highly correlated (r(2) >= .91) to the Landsat-satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Using a relationship between growing season ET and NDVI, we estimated ET for five additional tamarisk sites along several southwestern U.S. rivers. In the 2005 to 2018 analysis period, NDVI-estimated ET declined at all sites after beetle arrival with three sites showing a recovery in pre-beetle ET rates in subsequent years. At the other three sites, ET rates have not recovered to pre-beetle levels.

TI  - Mapping and assessing spatial extent of floods from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images: a case study on Brahmaputra River in Assam State, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Brahmaputra is one of the perennial rivers in India which causes floods every year in the north-east state of Assam causing hindrance to normal life and damage to crops. The availability of temporal Remote Sensing (RS) data helps to study the periodical changes caused by flood event and its eventual effect on natural environment. Integrating RS and GIS methods paved a way for effective flood mapping over a large spatial extent which helps to assess the damage accurately for mitigation. In the present study, multitemporal Sentinel-1A data is exploited to assess the 2017 flood situation of Brahmaputra River in Assam state. Five data sets that are taken during flood season and one reference data taken during the non-monsoon season are used to estimate the area inundated under floods for the quantification of damage assessment. A visual interpretation map is produced using colour segmentation method by estimating the thresholds from histogram analysis. A new method is developed to identify the optimum value for threshold from statistical distribution of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that separates flooded water and non-flooded water. From this method, the range of backscatter values for normal water are identified as - 18 to - 30 dB and the range is identified as - 19 to - 24 dB for flooded water. The results showed that the method is able to separate the flooded and non-flooded region on the microwave data set, and the derived flood extent using this method shows the inundated area of 3873.14 Km(2) on peak flood date for the chosen study area.

TI  - Performance of Indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node mapping and lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer: a diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Indocyanine green has been widely employed as a secure and easy technique for sentinel lymph node mapping in different types of cancer. Nonetheless, the usage of Indocyanine green has not been fully implemented due to the heterogeneous results found in published studies. Thus, the objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the overall performance of Indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node mapping and node metastasis in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Methods An extensive systematic search was performed to identify relevant studies in English and Spanish with no time limit restrictions. For the meta-analysis, a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve (HSROCs) was constructed, and quantitative data synthesis was performed using random effects models. Specificity, sensitivity, positive, and negative likelihood ratios were obtained from the corresponding HSROC. Between-study heterogeneity was visually evaluated using Galbraith plot, and publication bias was quantified using Deeks' method. Results A total of 11 studies were included for analysis. The pooled detection rate for sentinel lymph node mapping was 91% (80-98%). Covariates significantly influencing the pooled detection rate were having colon cancer (estimate: 1.3001; 1.114 to 1.486; p < 0.001) and the usage of a laparoscopic approach (estimate: 1.3495; 1.1029 to 1.5961; p < 0.001). The performance of Indocyanine green for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes yielded an area under the roc curve of 66.5%, sensitivity of 64.3% (51-76%), and specificity of 65% (36-85%). Conclusions Indocyanine green for the detection of sentinel lymph node mapping demonstrates better accuracy when used in colonic cancer and by a laparoscopic approach. Nevertheless, its overall performance for the detection of lymph node metastasis is poor.

TI  - From the threat to the large outbreak: dengue on Reunion Island, 2015 to 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With more than 300 million infections estimated annually worldwide, dengue is the most prevalent arboviral infection. On Reunion Island, after a large outbreak in 1977-78, only limited episodes of viral circulation or sporadic cases were reported till 2015. Aim: Our objective was to document and report on the circulation of dengue virus after the occurrence of a small outbreak during austral summer 2015/16 and until the large outbreak of 2018. Methods: Beside the mandatory notification of biologically confirmed dengue cases, additional systems of surveillance were set up: estimation of dengue-like syndrome in people seeking care by their family doctor, surveillance of emergency department visits related to dengue, surveillance of hospitalised dengue patients and deaths classifications.Results: After a moderate outbreak during summer 2015/16 with 231 cases, 2017 was characterised by limited viral circulation (97 cases) which, however, persisted during the austral winter. By February 2018, the number of cases had increased and led to a peak at the beginning of May 2018. More than 6,000 cases were reported this year (dengue virus type 2 only). In addition, six deaths of dengue patients were notified. Conclusion: In 2017, the persistence of transmission during winter created favourable conditions for the emergence of an epidemic during summer 2018. After this moderate epidemic wave, the viral circulation persisted during winter 2018 for the second year, opening the door for the second wave in 2019 and for potential endemisation of the disease on Reunion Island in the near future.

TI  - Interannual variability of South China Sea winter circulation: response to Luzon Strait transport and El Nino wind
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The El Nino wind and Luzon Strait transport are important factors modulating the interannual variability of the southern and northern South China Sea (SCS) winter circulation, respectively. The joint effect of El Nino wind and westward Luzon Strait transport drives a dipolar gyre with an anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly in the southern (northern) SCS, which enhances the cross-basin current that connects the SCS western boundary current with the eastern boundary of the SCS around the Mindoro Strait, and then effectively modulates the interannual variability of Mindoro Strait transport. An extreme El Nino and large Luzon Strait intrusion occurred in winter 2015/16, and mooring observations and remote sensing data confirmed the presence of an intense dipolar gyre. This resulted in an extreme eastward cross-basin current and outward SCS Mindoro Strait transport anomaly in 2015/16.

TI  - The role of cyclone activity in snow accumulation on Arctic sea ice
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the mechanisms controlling the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation on sea ice is crucial for understanding snow's net effect on the surface energy budget and sea-ice mass balance. Here, we analyze the role of cyclone activity on the seasonal buildup of snow on Arctic sea ice using model, satellite, and in situ data over 1979-2016. On average, 44% of the variability in monthly snow accumulation was controlled by cyclone snowfall and 29% by sea-ice freeze-up. However, there were strong spatio-temporal differences. Cyclone snowfall comprised similar to 50% of total snowfall in the Pacific compared to 83% in the Atlantic. While cyclones are stronger in the Atlantic, Pacific snow accumulation is more sensitive to cyclone strength. These findings highlight the heterogeneity in atmosphere-snow-ice interactions across the Arctic, and emphasize the need to scrutinize mechanisms governing cyclone activity to better understand their effects on the Arctic snow-ice system with anthropogenic warming.

TI  - Evaluation of honey-baited FTA cards in combination with different mosquito traps in an area of low arbovirus prevalence
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The threat of mosquito-borne diseases is increasing in continental Europe as demonstrated by several autochthonous chikungunya, dengue and West Nile virus outbreaks. In Switzerland, despite the presence of competent vectors, routine surveillance of arboviruses in mosquitoes is not being carried out, mainly due to the high costs associated with the need of a constant cold chain and laborious processing of thousands of mosquitoes. An alternative approach is using honey-baited nucleic acid preserving cards (FTA cards) to collect mosquito saliva that may be analysed for arboviruses. Here, we evaluate whether FTA cards could be used to detect potentially emerging viruses in an area of low virus prevalence in combination with an effective mosquito trap. Methods In a field trial in southern Switzerland we measured side-by-side the efficacy of the BG-Sentinel 2, the BG-GAT and the Box gravid trap to catch Aedes and Culex mosquitoes in combination with honey-baited FTA cards during 80 trapping sessions of 48 hours. We then screened both the mosquitoes and the FTA cards for the presence of arboviruses using reverse-transcription PCR. The efficacy of the compared trap types was evaluated using generalized linear mixed models. Results The Box gravid trap collected over 11 times more mosquitoes than the BG-GAT and BG-Sentinel 2 trap. On average 75.9% of the specimens fed on the honey-bait with no significant difference in feeding rates between the three trap types. From the total of 1401 collected mosquitoes, we screened 507 Aedes and 500 Culex females for the presence of arboviruses. A pool of six Cx. pipiens/Cx. torrentium mosquitoes and also the FTA card from the same Box gravid trap were positive for Usutu virus. Remarkably, only two of the six Culex mosquitoes fed on the honey-bait, emphasising the high sensitivity of the method. In addition, two Ae. albopictus collections but no FTA cards were positive for mosquito-only flaviviruses. Conclusions Based on our results we conclude that honey-baited FTA cards, in combination with the Box gravid trap, are an effective method for arbovirus surveillance in areas of low prevalence, particularly where resources are limited for preservation and screening of individual mosquitoes.

TI  - Tibetan Plateau's Lake Level and Volume Changes From NASA's ICESat/ICESat-2 and Landsat Missions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake level change is an effective indicator of climate change, because it reflects the dynamic balance of water input and loss. Here we provide a first look of Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) on the lakes of the Tibetan Plateau. ICESat-2 doubles the number of lakes observed using predecessor ICESat data. The ICESat/ICESat-2 altimetry data between 2003 and 2018 are in excellent agreement with in situ measurements from Qinghai Lake (R-2 = 0.95, root-mean-square error = 0.10 m) and with gauge observations made on 3 December 2018 (< 2 cm). The 62 lakes examined show a mean rate of water level change of 0.28 +/- 0.03 m/year in 2003-2018, with 58 lakes increasing (mean rate 0.30 +/- 0.03 m/year), and 4 lakes decreasing (mean rate -0.12 +/- 0.06 m/year). A total change of lake water storage of similar to 14 Gt/year is estimated. The results suggest that ICESat-2 data will be an important tool for future lake level change studies.Plain Language Summary The Tibetan Plateau contains many lakes that are changing in depth and size due to the climate warming that has been particularly rapid in this region. Because of the lack of water level gauges in this remote area, satellites provide the only practical tool of monitoring these lakes' changes. A new altimetry satellite, Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), which has several improvements for monitoring lakes, was launched in 2018; we are reporting the first outlook of the new data to assess its potential for lake level changes on the Tibetan Plateau. We found that the new data allowed us to study more lakes than was previously possible, and the data compared well with traditional water level measurements. By carefully combining the new data with older ICESat and Landsat images, we are able to assess how the lake levels and water storage had changed over the period 2003 to 2018. Out of the 62 lakes studied, 58 had an increase in water level over this period, with only 4 lakes showing a decrease. The ability of the ICESat-2 data to provide this information, suggests that, when the data become routinely available in the future, real-time monitoring of these lakes may be possible.

TI  - Influenza in patients with cancer after 2009 pandemic AH1N1: An 8-year follow-up study in Mexico
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Immunosupressed patients are at high risk of influenza-related complications. Influenza AH1N1 has been hypothesized to induce worse outcomes in patients with malignancies, but after the A(H1N1)pdm09 few publications have analyzed the presentation and complications related to influenza afterward. Objectives We aimed to describe the characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of influenza in an oncologic center after the 2009 pandemic and to compare our case distribution to the National community acquired influenza databases in Mexico and the United States. Methods We reviewed the cases of confirmed influenza in patients with cancer from an oncological center in Mexico from April 2009 to April 2017. Data on severity and influenza type, malignancy, comorbidities, and outcomes were recorded. We correlated data between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and SISVEFLU (Influenza Surveillance Program) in Mexico. Results One hundred eighty-eight patients were included; 75 (39.9%) had a solid neoplasm and 113 (60.1%) had hematologic malignancies. AH1N1 was the most frequent influenza type (54.2%). Patients with hematologic malignancies had more pneumonia (55% vs 25%, P < .001), needed more hospitalizations (75% vs 39% P < .001), had higher all-cause mortality at 30 days (20% vs 9% P = .048) and influenza-associated mortality (17% vs 7% P = .041). Thirty (16%) patients died within 30 days, and 24 (12.7%) were related to influenza. Influenza type was not associated with worse outcomes. Yearly occurrence of influenza reported by the CDC and SISVEFLU showed a significant correlation (rho = 0.823, P = .006). Conclusions AH1N1 was the dominant serotype. Patients with hematologic malignancies had more severe influenza and presented worse outcomes. Annual SISVEFLU and CDC surveillance information showed a similar distribution of cases along time but influenza serotypes did not match for all seasons.

TI  - Photo-ID and telemetry highlight a global whale shark hotspot in Palawan, Philippines
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Philippines is home to the second largest known population of whale sharks in the world. The species is listed as endangered due to continued population declines in the Indo-Pacific. Knowledge about the connectivity within Southeast Asia remains poor, and thus international management is difficult. Here, we employed pop-up archival tags, data mining and dedicated effort to understand an aggregation of whale sharks at Honda Bay, Palawan, Philippines, and its role in the species' conservation. Between Apr and Oct 2018, we conducted 159 surveys identifying 117 individual whale sharks through their unique spot patterns (96.5% male, mean 4.5 m). A further 66 individual whale sharks were identified from local operators, and data mined on social media platforms. The satellite telemetry data showed that the whale sharks moved broadly, with one individual moving to Sabah, Malaysia, before returning to the site <1 year later. Similarly, another tagged whale shark returned to the site at a similar periodicity after reaching the Malay-Filipino border. One individual whale shark first identified in East Kalimantan, Indonesia by a citizen scientist was resighted in Honda Bay similar to 3.5 years later. Honda Bay is a globally important site for the endangered whale shark with connectivity to two neighbouring countries, highlighting the need for international cooperation to manage the species.

TI  - Historical and contemporary indigenous marine conservation strategies in the North Pacific
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Strategies to reduce, halt, and reverse global declines in marine biodiversity are needed urgently. We reviewed, coded, and synthesized historical and contemporary marine conservation strategies of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation in British Columbia, Canada to show how their approaches work. We assessed whether the conservation actions classification system by the Conservation Measures Partnership was able to encompass this nation's conservation approaches. All first-order conservation actions aligned with the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation's historical and contemporary marine conservation actions; hereditary chief management responsibility played a key role. A conservation ethic permeates Kitasoo/Xai'xais culture, and indigenous resource management and conservation existed historically and remains strong despite extreme efforts by colonizers to suppress all indigenous practices. The Kitasoo/Xai'xais's embodiment of conservation actions as part of their worldview, rather than as requiring actions separate from everyday life (the norm in nonindigenous cultures), was missing from the conservation action classification system. The Kitasoo/Xai'xais are one of many indigenous peoples working to revitalize their governance and management authorities. With the Canadian government's declared willingness to work toward reconciliation, there is an opportunity to enable First Nations to lead on marine and other conservation efforts. Global conservation efforts would also benefit from enhanced support for indigenous conservation approaches, including expanding the conservation actions classification to encompass a new category of conservation or sacredness ethic.

TI  - Diversion of the paleo-Yellow River channel in the Qingtongxia area of Ningxia, China: Evidence from terraces and fluvial landforms
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qingtongxia Grand Canyon (QGC) of the Yellow River is a region of intense tectonic deformation that is located in the southern Yinchuan Basin, at the junction of the western margin of the Ordos Plateau and the northeast arcuate structural belt of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The Yellow River makes a 90 degrees turn as it traverses the Qingtongxia area, incising the hard Ordovician sandstones of Niushou Mountain, while leaving the relatively soft Quaternary sediments on the northern side of the channel undisturbed. Despite this apparent inconsistency with the expected pattern of river erosion, there has been no significant research to date on the formation of the QGC. Here, we utilize remote sensing, surficial geomorphology, and shallow coring to confirm the evolution of the Yellow River channel and formation of the QGC. Using Landsat Thermic Mapper and ASTER imagery, we identified a N-S-oriented zone of high water-content in the northern part of the QGC that is characterized at the surface by marsh and wetlands. Shallow cores reveal the zone is underlain by Yellow River gravel, while seismic profiling confirms anomalous seismic structures relative to the surrounding strata. Together, these data document a paleo-Yellow River channel in the northern Qingtongxia area. We selected four representative profiles of the Yellow River terraces in the Qingtongxia and adjacent areas to acquire measurements on above water level and age. The uppermost terraces preserved at the entrance, central section, and exit of the QGC are labelled T6, T9, and T3, respectively. Our data indicate that the flow direction during the construction of T9 was different to that of the modern Yellow River and that canyon incision occurred during the development of T3, which we constrain to 65-85 ka. Ultimately, we (a) document a paleo-Yellow River channel north of the QGC, which may have been affected by tectonic activity since the late Pleistocene and (b) show that the Yellow River has since been diverted towards the Yinchuan Basin via the QGC.

TI  - Response of vegetation carbon uptake to snow-induced phenological and physiological changes across temperate China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover, which is undergoing significant change along with global climate change, has considerable impacts on the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, how snow cover change affects the vegetation gross primary production (GPP) in temperate regions still requires in-depth exploration. In this study, we investigated how changes in the winter snow depth (WSD) and snowmelt date (SMD) affect spring GPP and summer GPP through their influences on the start date of the growing season (SGS) and the maximum daily GPP (GPP(max)), respectively. across temperate China from 2001 to 2015, based on both in situ measurements and satellite products (i.e., GLASS GPP, WestDC snow depth and GLEAM soil moisture). Soil moisture is identified as an important factor in the snow-GPP relationship in temperate China. Since most of temperate China is water-limited, thicker snow cover along with later snowmelt generally resulted in earlier SGS via a significant increase in soil moisture (47% of the area), which lengthened the growth period and enhanced spring carbon uptake in these areas. However, in wetter regions (7% of the area), thicker snow cover with later snowmelt would be more likely to delay the SGS, thus reducing spring GPP. Moreover, although the direct impact mechanisms of snow cover dynamics on summer GPP have not been identified, the snow-induced SGS change was found to have delayed effects on summer photosynthesis capacity, as earlier SGS increased the GPP(max) and thus summer GPP. However, the photosynthesis enhanced by earlier SGS meanwhile increased the plant water consumption, which would bring water stress and reduce summer GPP if the subsequent precipitation is unable to compensate for the water consumption. Our findings on the effects of snow cover change on carbon uptake would provide the basic mechanisms for assessing how future climate change will affect ecosystem productivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Automated volcanic hot-spot detection based on FY-4A/AGRI infrared data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm (FYVOLC) for the automated detection of volcanic hot spots using data obtained from China's new-generation satellite FY-4A is developed and tested. FYVOLC improves the detection ability of the Volcanic Anomaly SofTware (VAST) algorithm by incorporating a Normalized Brightness Temperature Difference Index (NBTDI) to reduce the influence of 'cold' cloud. In addition, FYVOLC introduces a mid-infrared brightness temperature criterion to identify volcanic hot spots by making calculations based on the image itself without artificially determining any parameters. To test the volcanic hot-spot detection performance of FYVOLC, FY-4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager data were used for eruptions from four volcanoes: Mayon Volcano in the Philippines (25-26 January 2018), and Bromo (1-2 September 2018), Lawu (3-4 September 2018), and Soputan volcanoes (3-4 October 2018) in Indonesia. A total of 147 images of the above four volcanoes were used, and the results obtained using the FYVOLC algorithm were compared with those from three existing volcanic hot-spot detection algorithms: the simplified contextual, VAST, and HOTSAT algorithms. It is shown that the simplified contextual and VAST algorithms are prone to generating false alerts (with a maximum false alert rate of up to 41% and 48%, respectively), whereas the simplified contextual and HOTSAT algorithms are prone to missing hot-spot pixels (with a maximum miss rate of up to 71% and 54%, respectively). The FYVOLC algorithm has the best detection accuracy owing to the adopted NBTDI and image-based mid-infrared brightness temperature criterion. The maximum false alert rate of FYVOLC is 12%, and the maximum miss rate is 11%. By analysing the thermal anomaly time-series of the 147 images, it was found that the detection results of FYVOLC are basically consistent with the actual hot spots, except for some images that were strongly affected by cloud cover. This study is the first to realize the automated detection of volcanic hot spots and monitor temporally dynamic thermal phenomena based on FY-4A satellite data. The results have significance for the continuing development of global volcanic early-warning systems and for the dynamic monitoring of volcanoes after eruptions.

TI  - Seasonal influence of parasitism on contamination patterns of the mud shrimp Upogebia cf. pusilla in an area of low pollution
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Very few studies have characterized the concentrations of pollutants in bioturbating species. These species are considered as ecosystem engineers and characterizing stressors. such as contaminants, that impact them could lead to a better understanding of the functioning of ecosystems. In addition to contaminants, bioturbators are affected by a wide range of stressors, which can influence their physiological status and their ability to accumulate pollutants. Among these stressors, parasitism is of particular concern due to the ubiquity of parasites in natural environments and their influence on the fitness of their host. This study aims to assess the relationship between parasitism and metal accumulation in the bioturbating mud shrimp Upogebia cf. pusilla. A one-year seasonal survey was conducted in Arcachon Bay, France, with the aims of (1) characterizing the levels of metals in the mud shrimp and (2) evaluating the influence of two macroparasites (a bopyrid isopod and a trematode) on the variation of the metal content in mud shrimp. The bopyrid parasite castrates its female host and a particular attention has therefore been paid to the reproductive cycle of female mud shrimp by quantifying the expression of the vitellogenin gene that encodes the major yolk protein in female crustaceans. The levels of contaminants in mud shrimp appeared low compared to those reported in other crustaceans in areas of higher pollution. Even at these low contamination levels, we observed a significant impact by the bopyrid parasite that depends on season: bopyrid-infested organisms are generally more contaminated than their uninfested conspecifics except in summer when the opposite trend was observed. We suggest that the bopyrid indirectly interferes with the metal accumulation process by altering the reproductive capabilities of the mud shrimp. On the opposite, very low influence of the trematode parasite on the metal content of the host was found. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Synergistic Use of RADARSAT-2 Ascending and Descending Images to Improve Surface Water Detection Accuracy in Alberta, Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large, e.g., provincial or national, scale near-real-time surface water monitoring is an ambitious task, which can be accomplished by using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. SAR has demonstrated the ability to distinguish water and land, but there are many common errors of commission and omission that arise due to the side-looking nature of SAR and due to some landcover types with similar backscatter like roads and pasture. A method is proposed to fix/mitigate these errors through the use of combined ascending/descending RADARSAT-2 image pairs and ancillary data. The results of a corrected water/land binary image were, on average, 99.4% accurate for the Boreal Forest Region (Utikuma) of Alberta, Canada, while for the Rocky Mountain Region (Westcastle) also in Alberta, the results proved to be 99.9% accurate when distinguishing water from land. These accuracies were achieved through the reduction of the water false positive rate and a slight reduction in the water true positive rate. These high accuracy values can be partially attributed to the relative low ratios of water to land in the study regions. We hope that these methods can be used and improved in order to move towards large scale dynamic surface water and wetland mapping.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in cropland abandonment in the Guizhou-Guangxi karst mountain area, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2000, vast areas of cropland in the rural mountain areas of China have been abandoned for reasons including labor loss and rapid urbanization, although the spatiotemporal patterns and causes of abandoned cropland (ACL) are not fully understood. We investigated changes in cropland abandonment in the Guizhou-Guangxi karst mountain area (GGKMA). We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index in conjunction with phenology metrics to obtain the land-use trajectory from 2001 to 2015, and then mapped the extent of cropland abandonment based on this land-use trajectory and local crop rotation cycle. We found that 10.45% (2.24 x 10(4) km(2)) of cropland in the GGKMA has been abandoned since 2001. In three sub-periods (2001-2005, 2005-2010, and 2011-2015), the overall trend showed an initial increase and then a slight decrease in the cropland abandonment rate (CAR) of 11.55%, 19.29%, and 17.17%, respectively. We explored the effects of environmental and socioeconomic factors on differences in the CAR by applying a multi-level model approach. About 26% and 16% of the variances in CAR were explained at the county and small watershed levels. At the small watershed level, spatiotemporal changes in CAR were primarily influenced by farming and soil conditions, while the severity of soil hydraulic erosion was a key factor in determining the distribution of CAR. Rural depopulation, the decline of agricultural activity, and low levels of education had significant positive effects on the increasing CAR, while the "feminization" of agriculture had the opposite effect on CAR at the county level. The results of this study implied that the spatial variation of abandonment may be influenced by environmental constraints, while socio-economic changes were the direct cause of the temporal trend of abandonment. Government should encourage farmers to increase the vegetation cover rather than continually undertake unsustainable agricultural activities in the areas with steep slopes and eroded soil, as well as strive to reduce the production costs associated with scattered plots, poor agricultural infrastructure, and the rising opportunity cost of labor. This could include conducting land consolidation and transfer, and providing agricultural subsidies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Internal solitary wave observations in the Flores Sea using the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japanese Meteorological Agency's geostationary satellite Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) images, acquired over the Flores Sea in Indonesia, observed that long internal solitary waves (ISWs) seem to be generated from the Sape Strait, which then propagates through the Java Sea, the Sumba Strait, and the Savu Sea. Shallow water wave refraction behaviour is present during the observations. These important parameters related to the ISW propagation (wavelength, soliton number, first crest length, propagation direction, and phase speed) could also be estimated using Himawari-8 images. These observational results were also compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The geostationary satellite Himawari-8 showed great potential and was very helpful in observing the ISW propagation parameters, spatially and temporally, in the Flores Sea in detail.

TI  - Hydro-meteorological reconstruction and geomorphological impact assessment of the October 2018 catastrophic flash flood at Sant Llorenc, Mallorca (Spain)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An extraordinary convective rainfall event, unforeseen by most numerical weather prediction models, generated a devastating flash flood (305 m(3) s(-1)) in the town of Sant Llorenc des Cardassar, Mallorca, on 9 October 2018. Four people died inside this village, while casualties were up to 13 over the entire affected area. This extreme event has been reconstructed by implementing an integrated flash flood modelling approach in the Ses Planes catchment up to Sant Llorenc (23.4 km(2)), based on three components: (i) generation of radar-derived precipitation estimates, (ii) modelling of accurate discharge hydrographs yielded by the catchment (using FEST and KLEM models), and (iii) hydraulic simulation of the event and mapping of affected areas (using HEC-RAS). Radar-derived rainfall estimates show very high agreement with rain gauge data (R-2 = 0.98). Modelled flooding extent is in close agreement with the observed extension by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, based on Sentinel-1 imagery, and both far exceed the extension for a 500-year return period flood. Hydraulic simulation revealed that water reached a depth of 3 m at some points, and modelled water depths highly correlate (R-2 = 0.91) with in situ after-event measurements. The 9 October flash flood eroded and transported woody and abundant sediment debris, changing channel geomorphology. Water velocity greatly increased at bridge locations crossing the river channel, especially at those closer to the Sant Llorenc town centre. This study highlights how the very low predictability of this type of extreme convective rainfall events and the very short hydrological response times typical of small Mediterranean catchments continue to challenge the implementation of early warning systems, which effectively reduce people's exposure to flash flood risk in the region.

AB  - We retrieve aerosol optical thickness (AOT) independently for brown carbon, dust and sulfate from hyperspectral image data. The model, a neural network, is trained on atmospheric radiative transfer calculations from MOD-TRAN 6.0 with varying aerosol concentration and type, surface albedo, water vapor, and viewing geometries. From a set of test radiative transfer calculations, we are able to retrieve AOT with a standard error of better than +/- 0:05. No a priori information on the surface albedo or atmospheric state is necessary for our model. We apply the model to AVIRIS-NG imagery from a recent campaign over India and demonstrate its performance under high and low aerosol loadings and different aerosol types.

TI  - Multi-hazard probability assessment and mapping in Iran
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several areas of Iran are prone to numerous natural hazards. An effective multi-hazard risk reduction requires analysis of the individual hazards and their interplay. This research develops a multi-hazard probability map for three hazards (i.e. landslides, floods, and earthquakes) for the management of hazard-prone areas in Lorestan Province, Iran, using anew ensemble model named SWARA-ANFIS-GWO. First, based on flood and landslide occurrence maps, hazard-prone areas were identified and sub-divided into two subsets.70% of these locations were randomly chosen to be used for the construction of susceptibility maps, while the remaining 30% of the instances were used to assess the accuracy of the models. Then, eleven factors relating to terrain and land use were selected for the preparation of landslide and flood susceptibility maps. An earthquake map was prepared based on a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). The SWARA method was implemented for weighting contributing factors and evaluating spatial relationships between the three hazards and predisposing factors. Subsequently, the ANFIS approach was used to acquire weights for each value while using a gray Wolf metaheuristic algorithm. Finally, all weight values were further assessed using the MATLAB software. The predicated results from the models were validated with ROC (rate of change) curves. The resulting AUCs (area under the curve) of the validation data indicated accuracies of 84% and 80% for floods and landslides, respectively, and 87% and 82.6%for flood and landslides based on the training data, respectively. Finally, the flood, landslide, and earthquake maps were combined to create a multi-hazard probability map of the Lorestan Province. This multi-hazard map serves as a valuable tool for land use planning and sustainable infrastructure development for the Lorestan Province. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A new 30 meter resolution global shoreline vector and associated global islands database for the development of standardized ecological coastal units
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new 30-m spatial resolution global shoreline vector (GSV) was developed from annual composites of 2014 Landsat satellite imagery. The semi-automated classification of the imagery was accomplished by manual selection of training points representing water and non-water classes along the entire global coastline. Polygon topology was applied to the GSV, resulting in a new characterisation of the number and size of global islands. Three size classes of islands were mapped: continental mainlands (5), islands greater than 1?km(2) (21,818), and islands smaller than 1?km(2) (318,868). The GSV represents the shore zone land and water interface boundary, and is a spatially explicit ecological domain separator between terrestrial and marine environments. The development and characteristics of the GSV are presented herein. An approach is also proposed for delineating standardised, high spatial resolution global ecological coastal units (ECUs). For this coastal ecosystem mapping effort, the GSV will be used to separate the nearshore coastal waters from the onshore coastal lands. The work to produce the GSV and the ECUs is commissioned by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), and is associated with several GEO initiatives including GEO Ecosystems, GEO Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and GEO Blue Planet.

TI  - Hydrologic Resilience from Summertime Fog and Recharge: A Case Study for Coho Salmon Recovery Planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) and late summer recharge increase stream baseflow and decrease stream temperature during arid Mediterranean climate summers, which benefits salmon especially under climate warming conditions. The potential to discharge cool water to streams during the late summer (hydrologic capacity; HC) furnished by FLCC and recharge were mapped for the 299 subwatersheds ranked Core, Phase 1, or Phase 2 under the National Marine Fisheries Service Recovery Plan that prioritized restoration and threat abatement action for endangered Central California Coast Coho Salmon evolutionarily significant unit. Two spatially continuous gridded datasets were merged to compare HC: average hrs/day FLCC, a new dataset derived from a decade of hourly National Weather Satellite data, and annual average mm recharge from the USGS Basin Characterization Model. Two use-case scenarios provide examples of incorporating FLCC-driven HC indices into long-term recovery planning. The first, a thermal analysis under future climate, projected 65% of the watershed area for 8-19 coho population units as thermally inhospitable under two global climate models and identified several units with high resilience (high HC under the range of projected warming conditions). The second use case investigated HC by subwatershed rank and coho population, and identified three population units with high HC in areas ranked Phase 1 and 2 and low HC in Core. Recovery planning for cold-water fish species would benefit by including FLCC in vulnerability analyses.

TI  - The impact of the decline in area of the storage areas on water level at downstream of the Sai Gon - Dong Nai river system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of climate change, area decline of storage areas due to land levelling and dyke building activities on the water level at downstream of the Sai Gon - Dong Nai river system. The research methods were used include trend analysis and relation analysis between water levels and area of storage areas. The annual statistical data of typical water levels were collected at five monitoring stations from 1980-2018. The area was determined by satellite image classification. Thirty-two images of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 in 1980-2018 period were used. The results indicated, due to the impact of climate change, the highest and lowest water level of station on the sea (Vung Tau) rose about 0.35 and 0.31 cm/year, respectively. At stations on the river, due to the simultaneous impact of sea-level rise and storage area decline, the water levels changed quite differently from Vung Tau. At stations near the storage areas such as Nha Be and Phu An, the highest water level rose about 1.1-1.2 cm/year, meanwhile, the lowest water level fell or rose insignificantly. There was a tight correlation between typical water levels and the area of storage areas over time, especially at stations near the storage areas. The study results have contributed to clarifying the cause of the extraordinary increase in the highest water level at downstream of the research area.

TI  - Forecasting corn yield at the farm level in Brazil based on the FAO-66 approach and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield forecasting at the field level is essential for decision-making and the prediction of agricultural economic returns for farmers. Thus, this study evaluated the performance of a methodology for corn yield prediction in irrigated fields in the western region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. This methodology integrates a time series of the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) estimated from the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) into a simple model based on the water productivity as presented in the FAO-66 manual. In this context, an extensive field-level dataset of 52 center pivot fields of cultivated with corn was used for four consecutive growing seasons (2013 to 2016). Surface reflectance images from the Landsat series were used to calculate the SAVI. The methodology performance was assessed through RMSE, RRMSE, MBE, MAE, and r(2). The results revealed that the difference between the predicted and actual yield values ranged between -12.2% and 18.8% but that the majority of the estimates remained between -10% and 10%, considering that a single harvest index (HI) was used for the hybrids cultivated in the growing seasons of 2014, 2015 and 2016. After a new reanalysis (by grouping the similar hybrids and using specific HIs), the performance of the predictions increased, especially for the Pioneer hybrids; the majority of the differences between the predicted yield values and the measured yield values remained between -5% and 5%. The results of this research showed that it is essential to work with different HIs when considering different hybrids and years under different weather conditions.

TI  - Evaluation and uncertainty estimate of next-generation geostationary meteorological Himawari-8/AHI aerosol products
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The next-generation geostationary meteorological Himawari-8 satellite carrying the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) allows frequent observations of the atmosphere, the surface, and oceans every 10 min. With its retrieval algorithms recently updated, Himawari-8/AHI Version 2 Level 2 aerosol products are now available. However, these retrievals have not yet undergone a quality assessment. This study aims to comprehensively validate the official aerosol optical properties derived from Himawari-8/AHI over land and ocean. Aerosol Robotic Network and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network ground-based measurements at 98 stations in the Himawari-domain region are used to validate aerosol optical depth (AOD, or tau) retrievals at 500 nm and Angstrom exponent (AE) retrievals at 440-675 nm from the year 2016. The AOD retrievals agree well with surface observations (i.e., from linear regression, slope = 0.876, intercept = 0.076, and correlation coefficient = 0.756) with a mean absolute error and a root-mean-square error of 0.168 and 0.293, respectively. On site and regional scales, large uncertainties are seen, especially in Australia (significant overestimation) and South Asia (significant underestimation). The AOD retrievals can correctly capture daily variations and show the best (worst) performance in summer (spring). The AE performance is poorer on all scales, showing overall underestimations, especially in Australia, Southeast Asia, and China. The data quality of AOD retrievals improves as the vegetation coverage and the AE increases. This suggests that the official aerosol retrieval algorithm still faces great challenges over bright surfaces and under coarse-particle-dominated conditions. In general, approximately 61% and 64% of the AOD matchups meet the newly defined expected errors of [0.330 x tau + 0.024; -0.132 x tau - 0.125] and [0.519 x tau + 0.005; -0.007 x tau - 0.194] determined by ground measurements and aerosol retrievals, respectively. The highly variable accuracy of aerosol retrievals raises a concern about the reliability of the current product under different environmental conditions and underlying surfaces. It also sheds light on what future improvements need implementing to the aerosol retrieval algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna, southwest China based on the re-normalization of two Landsat-based vegetation-moisture indices and meteorological data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on where rubber plantations are located and when they were established is essential for understanding changes in the regional carbon cycle, biodiversity, hydrology and ecosystem services. Here, we proposed a simple and modified phenology-based method to map rubber plantations and evaluate the effectiveness of this method in Xishuangbanna in southwest China, the second largest area of natural rubber cultivation. Our phenological algorithm is supported by local meteorological data and involves the re-normalization of two Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager-derived vegetation moisture indices (i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)). We then applied air temperature data (daily records from 1981 to 2015) and periodic in situ observations of rubber plantations (weekly records from 2017 to 2018) to determine the phenological stages of rubber tree growth with the goal of selecting the most effective Landsat images. The re-normalization algorithm was able to highlight the temporal differences in the vegetation canopy and moisture content of rubber plantations, because rubber trees in Xishuangbanna display unique defoliation-foliation signals during the dry season. The resultant map of rubber plantations showed a high overall accuracy of 92.3% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.846. The developed phenological re-normalization method with meteorological data greatly enriches remote sensing-based approaches for mapping rubber plantations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in ecologically functional land in China: A quantity-quality coupled perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding ways to identify the coupled relationship between changes in the quantity and quality of ecologically functional land (EFL) is essential for sustainable ecosystem management. However, this coupled relationship has been ignored in the literature. This paper proposes a quality-based quantity (QBQ) method to evaluate the spatiotemporal change in EFL in China. Three Landsat images spanning 20 years were used to investigate the gains and losses of EFL. We compared the differences and linkages between the net change and QBQ change of EFL at the county scale. Continuous EFL loss and growing fragmentation were observed in China. From 1995 to 2015, the main cause of EFL loss was desertification, followed by farmland occupation and construction land consolidation. It should be noted that the EFL loss from 2005 to 2015 was much higher than that from 1995 to 2005. The main gain in EFL was from desert land exploitation, followed by farmland return and construction land consolidation. In particular, grassland degradation was the most severe ecological problem in western China. The QBQ change in EFL showed a more severe situation than did the quantity change. The dynamic processes associated with quantity change and their effects on landscape were well reflected in the QBQ change. These results indicated that the EFL degraded in both quantity and quality in China between 1995 and 2015. EFL conservation policies should focus not only on the dynamic losses and gains in quantity but also on the changes in quality linked to landscape patterns. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Observational Evidence of Irrigation Influence on Vegetation Health and Land Surface Temperature in India
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated area in India has significantly increased after the green revolution. However, quantification of irrigation influence on vegetation health and land surface temperature (LST) remains limited. Here, we develop a high-resolution (250 m) remotely sensed data of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and LST from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer for 2000-2017 at the 8-day temporal resolution for India to quantify the role of irrigation in the modulation of EVI, LST, and vegetation health. We show that irrigation-dominated regions have significantly (p value < 0.05) higher EVI and cooler (1-2 K) LST during the crop-growing season in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vegetation health in highly irrigated areas is poorly correlated with meteorological drought primarily due to irrigation. Moreover, vegetation health is negatively correlated with groundwater storage anomalies in the highly irrigated Indo-Gangetic Plain. Irrigation in Indo-Gangetic Plain modulated EVI, LST, and vegetation health and resulted in groundwater depletion during 2002-2016.

TI  - A regularity structure for rough volatility
T2  - MATHEMATICAL FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new paradigm has emerged recently in financial modeling: rough (stochastic) volatility. First observed by Gatheral et al. in high-frequency data, subsequently derived within market microstructure models, rough volatility captures parsimoniously key-stylized facts of the entire implied volatility surface, including extreme skews (as observed earlier by Alos et al.) that were thought to be outside the scope of stochastic volatility models. On the mathematical side, Markovianity and, partially, semimartingality are lost. In this paper, we show that Hairer's regularity structures, a major extension of rough path theory, which caused a revolution in the field of stochastic partial differential equations, also provide a new and powerful tool to analyze rough volatility models.

TI  - A Century of Forest Regrowth and Snow Loss Alters the Cooling Effect of Historical Land Use in the Upper Midwest
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land use affects climate by altering the energy balance of the Earth's surface. In temperate regions, cooling from increased albedo is a common result of historical land-use change. However, this albedo cooling effect is dependent mainly on the exposure of snow cover following forest canopy removal and may change over time due to simultaneous changes in both land cover and snow cover. In this paper, we combine modern remote sensing data and historical records, incorporating over 100 years of realized land use and climatic change into an empirical assessment of centennial-scale surface forcings in the Upper Midwestern USA. We show that, although increases in surface albedo cooled through strong negative shortwave forcings, those forcings were reduced over time by a combination of forest regrowth and snow-cover loss. Deforestation cooled strongly (- 5.3 Wm(-2)) and mainly in winter, while composition shift cooled less strongly (- 3.03 Wm(-2)) and mainly in summer. Combined, changes in albedo due to deforestation, shifts in species composition, and the return of historical forest cover resulted in - 2.81 Wm(-2) of regional radiative cooling, 55% less than full deforestation. Forcings due to changing vegetation were further reduced by 0.32 Wm(-2) of warming from a shortened snow-covered season and a thinning of seasonal snowpack. Our findings suggest that accounting for long-term changes in land cover and snow cover reduces the estimated cooling impact of deforestation, with implications for long-term land-use planning.

TI  - Mitigating and comparing the striping noise in FengYun-3B/C/D microwave radiation imager brightness temperature observations
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on board the FengYun-3 (FY-3) series of satellites can provide global observations four times daily, which significantly improves the ability to monitor large-scale natural disasters. There is noticeable striping noise in brightness temperature observations from the MWRIs on board the FY-3B, FY-3C and FY-3D satellites. The central frequencies of all MWRI channels are in the atmospheric window region. In this article, a modified principal component analysis/ensemble empirical mode decomposition method proposed by Zou et al. in 2017 was applied to deal with the striping noise in MWRI measurements. Results reveal that the magnitude of the striping noise in the brightness temperature observations of MWRI channels 10 are about +/- 1.2 K for FY-3B, +/- 1.1 K for FY-3C and +/- 0.8 K for FY3D. The striping noise in FY-3D MWRI measurements is significantly reduced, compared with the striping noise in FY-3B and FY-3C MWRI measurements. Striping features will appear in the liquid water path (LWP) distribution if LWP is retrieved from brightness temperatures without removing the striping noise. The differences between LWP retrieved from the MWRI observations with and without striping noise mitigation could be as large as 0.07 kg center dot m(-2). It is thus necessary to remove striping noise before any MWRI data applications.

T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variability in high-relief landscapes is immense, and grid-based models cannot be run at spatial resolutions to explicitly represent important physical processes. This hampers the assessment of the current and future evolution of important issues such as water availability or mass movement hazards. Here, we present a new processing chain that couples an efficient sub-grid method with a downscaling tool and a data assimilation method with the purpose of improving numerical simulation of surface processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales in ungauged basins. The novelty of the approach is that while we add 1-2 orders of magnitude of computational cost due to ensemble simulations, we save 4-5 orders of magnitude over explicitly simulating a high-resolution grid. This approach makes data assimilation at large spatio-temporal scales feasible. In addition, this approach utilizes only freely available global datasets and is therefore able to run globally. We demonstrate marked improvements in estimating snow height and snow water equivalent at various scales using this approach that assimilates retrievals from a MODIS snow cover product. We propose that this as a suitable method for a wide variety of operational and research applications where surface models need to be run at large scales with sparse to non-existent ground observations and with the flexibility to assimilate diverse variables retrieved by Earth observation missions.

TI  - A Critical Evaluation of Deep Blue Algorithm Derived AVHRR Aerosol Product Over China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deep Blue (DB) aerosol retrieval algorithm has recently been applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data to produce a first version (V001) of a global aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data set. In this paper, we critically evaluate these AVHRR AOT data over China by comparison with ground-based reference data from China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network for the period 2006-2011. The evaluation considers the impact of the surface (type and reflectance) and the aerosol properties (aerosol loading, aerosol absorption) on the quality of the retrieved AOT. We also compare the AVHRR-retrieved AOT with that from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer over major aerosol source regions in China. We further consider seasonal variations and find, in general, a good agreement between AVHRR AOT and the reference data sets. The AVHRR retrieval algorithm performs well over dark vegetated surfaces, but over bright surfaces (e.g., desert regions) the results are less good. The AVHRR algorithm underestimates the AOT, with 32.1% of the values lower than the estimated error envelope of +/- 0.05 +/- 0.25 tau. In particular over the desert, the AVHRR-retrieved AOT is frequently underestimated and for AOT <= 0.6 the values are on average 0.05 too low due to the pixel filtering, and dust storms are missed. The comparison of the AVHRR AOT with MODIS collection 6 and CARSNET data indicates that improvements are needed for, for example, AVHRR calibration and cloud/aerosol flagging. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to a better understanding of the AVHRR AOT product over China.

TI  - Climate change decreases the cooling effect from postfire albedo in boreal North America
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a primary disturbance in boreal forests and generates both positive and negative climate forcings. The influence of fire on surface albedo is a predominantly negative forcing in boreal forests, and one of the strongest overall, due to increased snow exposure in the winter and spring months. Albedo forcings are spatially and temporally heterogeneous and depend on a variety of factors related to soils, topography, climate, land cover/vegetation type, successional dynamics, time since fire, season, and fire severity. However, how these variables interact to influence albedo is not well understood, and quantifying these relationships and predicting postfire albedo becomes increasingly important as the climate changes and management frameworks evolve to consider climate impacts. Here we developed a MODIS-derived 'blue sky' albedo product and a novel machine learning modeling framework to predict fire-driven changes in albedo under historical and future climate scenarios across boreal North America. Converted to radiative forcing (RF), we estimated that fires generate an annual mean cooling of -1.77 +/- 1.35 W/m(2) from albedo under historical climate conditions (1971-2000) integrated over 70 years postfire. Increasing postfire albedo along a south-north climatic gradient was offset by a nearly opposite gradient in solar insolation, such that large-scale spatial patterns in RF were minimal. Our models suggest that climate change will lead to decreases in mean annual postfire albedo, and hence a decreasing strength of the negative RF, a trend dominated by decreased snow cover in spring months. Considering the range of future climate scenarios and model uncertainties, we estimate that for fires burning in the current era (2016) the cooling effect from long-term postfire albedo will be reduced by 15%-28% due to climate change.

TI  - Multi-sensor approach integrating optical and multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar for carbon stock estimation over a tropical deciduous forest in India
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An optimal model was developed for accounting forest carbon stock from synergistic use of optical data from Landsat TM and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from COSMO-Skymed (X-band), Radarsat-2 (C-band) and ALOS PALSAR (L-band) sensors over a tropical deciduous heterogeneous forest of India. The best-fit integrated multiple linear regression model had a model accuracy of 83%, r(2) = 0.96, root mean square error = 10.02 Mg/ha and Willmott's index of agreement of 0.98. The model further validated using chi-squared and t-test. Results of models for calculating the aboveground biomass (AGB) were converted to C and CO2 using conversion factors. Average AGB, C and CO2 were 70.5, 35.26 and 130.89 Mg/ha, respectively. The synergistic use of optical and multi-frequency SAR data enhanced the AGB saturation threshold to about 150 Mg/ha for tropical deciduous mixed forests. Hence, the synergistic use of this data is suggested for large-scale AGB and C estimations for tropical forests. Optical remote sensing sensors are extensively used due to greater data availability despite their poor sensitivity toward forest parameters. In contrast, SAR signals are highly sensitive toward forest biophysical and structural parameters, providing a better alternative. This unique integrated approach provides valuable information regarding the spatial distribution and quantification of forest biomass and carbon.

TI  - Satellite Data Reveal Cropland Losses in South-Eastern Ukraine Under Military Conflict
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While people are aware that there is a continuing conflict in Ukraine, there is little understanding of its impact. The military conflict in South-Eastern Ukraine has been on-going since 2014, with a major socio-economic impact on the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In this study, we quantify land cover land use changes in those regions related to cropland changes. Cropland areas account for almost 50% of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and with the declining industry between 2014 and 2017, the role of agriculture to the regional economy has increased. We use freely available satellite data and machine learning methods to map cropland extent in 2013 and 2018 and derive corresponding changes in cropland areas. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify multi-temporal Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 images into cropland and non-cropland areas, and a sampling-based approach to estimate the areas of cropland change. We found that net cropland losses were not uniform across the regions, and were more substantial in the areas not under control of the Ukrainian Government (22% of net cropland area loss compared to cropland areas in 2013) and within a buffer zone along the conflict border line (46%), where combat activities occur. These results highlight the impact of the conflict on agriculture and the utility of spatially explicit information acquired from Earth observation satellites, especially for areas, where collecting ground-based data is impractical.

TI  - Phytoplankton Blooms off a High Turbidity Estuary: A Case Study in the Changjiang River Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of phytoplankton blooms in estuarine and coastal waters is codetermined by the export of fluvial nutrients and other water properties such as turbidity. In this study, the Changjiang River Estuary was used as an example to investigate the intrinsic link between river plume dynamics, riverine nutrient loading, suspended sediment concentration, and phytoplankton blooms with a coupled hydrodynamic-sediment-ecosystem numerical model. Suspended sediment concentration from the sediment module was used to parameterize light attenuation in waters, which, in association with river plume dynamics, was found to impact phytoplankton distribution. Data that was collected in situ, in addition to satellite data for chlorophyll, nutrients, and suspended sediments, were used to validate the model, which performed well. The surface high chlorophyll centers exhibited a patch-like pattern from the northeast to the south off the Changjiang River mouth. The high chlorophyll concentration within the river plume was mainly determined by riverine nutrient exports, and potential phosphate limitation occurred away from the river mouth. The chlorophyll concentration decreased dramatically shoreward of the sediment front, which was controlled by the bottom river plume front. The bottom plume front was an intrinsic feature of the Changjiang River plume and similar river plume systems, which set a boundary separating the well-mixed (turbid) nearshore waters and stratified (clear) offshore waters. Without considering the sediment shading effect, the model yielded an unrealistic chlorophyll distribution with artificially high values in the turbid area. This indicated that light attenuation was a key factor limiting phytoplankton blooms in turbid river estuaries.

TI  - Deep Learning Prediction of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the High Arctic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the lack of understanding of the complex physiochemical and environmental processes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Arctic and around the globe, atmospheric models often yield large errors in the predicted atmospheric concentrations of POPs. Here, we developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) method based on non-parametric deep learning algorithms. The RNN model was implemented to predict monthly air concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at the high Arctic monitoring station Alert. To train the RNN system, we used MODIS satellite remotely sensed forest fire data, air emissions, meteorological data, sea ice cover area, and sampled PAH concentration data from 1996 to 2012. The system was applied to forecast monthly PAH concentrations from 2012 to 2014 at the Alert station. The results were compared with monitored PAHs and an atmospheric transport model (CanMETOP) for POPs. We show that the RNN significantly improved PHE and BaP predictions from 2012 to 2014 by 62.5 and 91.1%, respectively, compared to CanMETOP predictions. The sensitivity analysis using the Shapley value reveals that air emissions determined the magnitude of PAH levels in the high Arctic, whereas forest fires played a significant role in the changes in PAH concentrations in the high Arctic, followed by air temperature and meridional wind fields.

TI  - Influenza epidemiology in patients admitted to sentinel Australian hospitals in 2018: the Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN)
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is a sentinel hospital-based surveillance program that operates at sites in all jurisdictions in Australia. This report summarises the epidemiology of hospitalisations with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2018 influenza season.In this observational surveillance system, cases were defined as patients admitted to any of the 17 sentinel hospitals with influenza confirmed by nucleic acid detection. Data were also collected on a frequency-matched control group of influenza-negative patients admitted with acute respiratory infection.During the period 3 April to 31 October 2018 (the 2018 influenza season), 769 patients were admitted with confirmed influenza to one of 17 FluCAN sentinel hospitals. Of these, 30% were elderly (>= 65 years), 28% were children (<16 years), 6.4% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 2.2% were pregnant and 66% had chronic comorbidities. A small proportion of FluCAN admissions were due to influenza B (13%). Estimated vaccine coverage was 77% in the elderly (>= 65 years), 45% in non-elderly adults with medical comorbidities and 26% in children (<16 years) with medical comorbidities. The estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the target population was 52% (95% CI: 37%, 63%).There were a smaller number of hospital admissions detected with confirmed influenza in this national observational surveillance system in 2018 than in 2017, with the demographic profile reflecting the change in circulating subtype from A/H3N2 to A/H1N1.

TI  - Dry-Season Snow Cover Losses in the Andes (18°-40°S) driven by Changes in Large-Scale Climate Modes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andean snowpack is the primary source of water for many communities in South America. We have used Landsat imagery over the period 1986-2018 in order to assess the changes in the snow cover extent across a north-south transect of approximately 2,500 km (18 degrees-40 degrees S). Despite the significant interannual variability, here we show that the dry-season snow cover extent declined across the entire study area at an average rate of about -12% per decade. We also show that this decreasing trend is mainly driven by changes in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), especially at latitudes lower than 34 degrees S. At higher latitudes (34 degrees-40 degrees S), where the El Nino signal is weaker, snow cover losses appear to be also influenced by the poleward migration of the westerly winds associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).

TI  - Stand age and species composition effects on surface albedo in a mixedwood boreal forest
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is one of the most important processes governing climate forcing in the boreal forest and is directly affected by management activities such as harvesting and natural disturbances such as forest fires. Empirical data on the effects of these disturbances on boreal forest albedo are sparse. We conducted ground-based measurements of surface albedo from a series of instrument towers over 4 years in a replicated chronosequence of mixed-wood boreal forest sites differing in stand age (to 19 years since disturbance) in both post-harvest and post-fire stands. We investigated the effects of stand age, canopy height, tree species composition, and ground vegetation cover on surface albedo through stand development. Our results indicate that winter and spring albedo values were 63% and 24% higher, respectively, in post-harvest stands than in post-fire stands. Summer and fall albedo values were similar between disturbance types, with summer albedo showing a transient peak at similar to 10 years stand age. The proportion of deciduous broadleaf species showed a strong positive relationship with seasonal averages of albedo in both post-harvest and post-fire stands. Given that stand composition in mixedwood boreal forests generally shows a gradual replacement of deciduous trees by conifers, our results suggest that successional changes in species composition are likely a key driver of age-related patterns in albedo. Our findings also suggest the efficacy of increasing the proportion of deciduous broadleaf species as a silvicultural option for climate-friendly management of the boreal forest.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and surface urban heat island intensity: source-sink landscape-based study in Delhi, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization-induced rapid land use/land cover change (LULCC) modifies the thermal characteristics of a region at local scale and often creates urban heat island (UHI) effects. Delhi also experiences such enhancing UHI scenario. In present study, LULCC was linked with the land surface temperature (LST), and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) was measured at the sub-district level. Landsat imageries and MODIS LST product for 2001, 2009 and 2017 were main data sources. LULC classification and LST were derived using maximum likelihood classification and single-channel algorithm techniques, respectively. Proposed LULC classification scheme was built-up, current fallows land, bare land (or source landscape); and crop land, vegetation and water bodies (or sink landscape). SUHII was calculated using the contribution index of both source and sink landscapes and landscape index (LI). Results from LI also supported with temperature vegetation feature space index, transformed difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, diurnal temperature range, population density and transect analysis. The result showed that sub-districts of North, North-East, East and West Delhi were more prone to SUHII due to the highly dense built-up area and industrial area. SUHII was comparatively low in the sub-districts of South and South-West Delhi because of less built-up area as well the presence of greenery. Not only built-up but also fallow land and barren land contributed significantly in some places, i.e. South and South-West Delhi. Besides, urban green space and green crop field reduced the LST sufficiently in some areas, i.e. Najafgarh and New Delhi. Again, this study could help to understand UHI in Delhi at sub-district level.

TI  - Decomposition of mixed pixels in MODIS data using Bernstein basis functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The decomposition of mixed pixels in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images is essential for the application of MODIS data in many fields. Many existing methods for unmixing mixed pixels use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the image data and require the extraction of endmember spectra. We propose the pixel spectral unmixing index (PSUI) method for unmixing mixed pixels in MODIS images. In this method, a set of third-order Bernstein basis functions is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the image data and characterize the spectral curves of the mixed pixels in a MODIS image, and then the derived PSUIs (i.e., the coefficients of the basis functions) are calibrated by means of the abundance values of the ground features from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) classification images corresponding to the date and region of the MODIS image. The proposed method was tested on MODIS and ETM+/OLI images, and it obtained satisfying unmixing results. We compared the PSUI method with conventional methods, including the pixel purity index, the N-finder algorithm, the sequential maximum angle convex cone, and vertex component analysis and found that the PSUI method outperformed the other four methods.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of land use changes using remote sensing in Horqin sandy land, China
T2  - SENSOR REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the characteristics of spatio-temporal dynamics and the evolution of land use change is essential for understanding and assessing the status and transition of ecosystems. Such analysis, when applied to Horqin sandy land, can also provide basic information for appropriate decision-making. Design/methodology/approach By integrating long time series Landsat imageries and geographic information system (GIS) technology, this paper explored the spatio-temporal dynamics and evolution-induced land use change of the largest sandy land in China from 1983 to 2016. Accurate and consistent land use information and land use change information was first extracted by using the maximum likelihood classifier and the post-classification change detection method, respectively. The spatio-temporal dynamics and evolution were then analyzed using three kinds of index models: the dynamic degree model to analyze the change of regional land resources, the dynamic change transfer matrix and flow direction rate to analyze the change direction, and the barycenter transfer model to analyze the spatial pattern of land use change. Findings The results indicated that land use in Horqin sandy land during the study period changed dramatically. Vegetation and sandy land showed fluctuating changes, cropland and construction land steadily increased, water body decreased continuously, and the spatial distribution patterns of land use were generally unbalanced. Vegetation, sandy land and cropland were transferred frequently. The amount of vegetation loss was the largest. Water body loss was 473.6 km(2), which accounted for 41.7 per cent of the total water body. The loss amount of construction land was only 1.0 km(2). Considerable differences were noted in the rate of gravity center migration among the land use types in different periods, and the overall rate of construction land migration was the smallest. Moreover, the gravity center migration rates of the water body and sandy land were relatively high and were related to the fragile ecological environment of Horqin sandy land. Originality/value The results not only confirmed the applicability and effectiveness of the combined method of remote sensing and GIS technology but also revealed notable spatio-temporal dynamics and evolution-induced land use change throughout the different time periods (1983-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2014, 2014-2016 and 1983-2016).

TI  - TCCON and NDACC X<sub>CO</sub> measurements: difference, discussion and application
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO (X-CO) measurements are obtained from two ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer networks: the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). In this study, the differences between the TCCON and NDACC X-CO measurements are investigated and discussed based on six NDACC-TCCON sites using data over the period 2007-2017. A direct comparison shows that the NDACC X-CO measurements are about 5.5 % larger than the TCCON data at Ny-Alesund, Bremen, and Izana (Northern Hemisphere), and the absolute bias between the NDACC and TCCON data is within 2 % at Saint-Denis, Wollongong and Lauder (Southern Hemisphere). The hemispheric dependence of the bias is mainly attributed to their smoothing errors. The systematic smoothing error of the TCCON X-CO data varies in the range between 0.2 % (Bremen) and 7.9 % (Lauder), and the random smoothing error varies in the range between 2.0 % and 3.6 %. The systematic smoothing error of NDACC data is between 0.1 % and 0.8 %, and the random smoothing error of NDACC data is about 0.3 %. For TCCON data, the smoothing error is significant because it is higher than the reported uncertainty, particularly at Southern Hemisphere sites. To reduce the influence from the a priori profiles and different vertical sensitivities, the scaled NDACC a priori profiles are used as the common a priori profiles for comparing TCCON and NDACC retrievals. As a result, the biases between TCCON and NDACC X-CO measurements become more consistent (5.6 %-8.5 %) with a mean value of 6.8 % at these sites. To determine the sources of the remaining bias, regular AirCore measurements at Orleans and Sodankyla are compared to co-located TCCON measurements. It is found that TCCON XCO measurements are 6.1 +/- 1.6 % and 8.0 +/- 3.2 % smaller than the AirCore measurements at Orleans and Sodankyla, respectively, indicating that the scaling factor of TCCON X-CO data should be around 1.0000 instead of 1.0672. Further investigations should be carried out in the TCCON community to determine the correct scaling factor to be applied to the TCCON X-CO data. This paper also demonstrates that the smoothing error must be taken into account when comparing FTIR X-CO data, and especially TCCON X-CO data, with model or satellite data.

M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of geospatial, geophysical and statistical models using satellite data, the weighted index overlay (WIO) method and two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (2D-ERT) is applied to generate the highest potential groundwater area and to further explore the groundwater in Dehradun, India. The results show that of 19.7 km(2) total basin area, 0.26% falls under the "poor" category as a prospect zone for groundwater, 4.3% is "moderate", 10.10% "moderately good", 4.9% "good" and 0.17% "very good". In addition, the demonstration of the geophysical survey is presented, in which Purkal Youth Society Division (PYSD) site is categorized as a shallow aquifer zone and the Guru Nanak Fifth Centenary School (GNFCS) site is a deeper aquifer zone. Our study emphasizes remote sensing and geographic information system integrated with a geophysical survey to support prospecting the most probable area and confirm the existence of groundwater.

TI  - Permanent disappearance and seasonal fluctuation of urban lake area in Wuhan, China monitored with long time series remotely sensed images from 1987 to 2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are important to the healthy functioning of the urban ecosystem. The urban lakes in Wuhan, China, which is known as 'city of hundreds of lakes', are facing substantial threats mainly due to rapid urbanization. This paper focused on detecting the spatial and temporal change of urban lakes in Wuhan, using a long time series of Landsat and HJ-1A remotely sensed data from 1987 to 2016. The permanent disappearance and seasonal fluctuation of 28 main urban lakes were analysed, and their relationships with climatic change and human activities were discussed. The results show that most lakes in Wuhan had shrunk over the past 30 years resulting in a permanent change from water to land. The shrinkage was also most apparent in the central region of the city. Seasonal fluctuations of lake area were evident for most lakes but the relative important driving variable of lake area change varied between sub-periods of time for different lakes. The explanatory power of impervious surface to five-year permanent water change is 91.75%, suggesting that urbanization - as increasing impervious surface - had led to the shrinkage of urban lakes in Wuhan. In all, 128.28 km(2) five-year permanent water disappeared from 1987 to 2016.

TI  - Synergy of satellite-based aerosol optical thickness analysis and trajectory statistics for determination of aerosol source regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 10 years of satellite-based remote sensing data with trajectory statistics are used to determine sources of air mass related to different aerosol types. Aerosol typing is based on analysis of sun-photometer data and then extended in time with the use of satellite data. Supplemental analysis of Gaussian distributions of aerosol optical thickness changes during transport, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, is performed. It allows for differentiating between primary and secondary aerosol sources as well as to prove air mass source as a source of aerosol. It appears that source regions of air mass and aerosols' sources are collocated in most cases. For western advection from Germany, the most probable aerosol sources are located between air mass source regions and the receptors. These are mostly associated with the industrial/urbanized aerosol type. Additionally, aerosols from intermittent and strong episodes of biomass burning to the east of the Polish border are found to originate from sources located closer to the receptors than backward trajectory analysis alone suggested.

TI  - Ice Cloud Optical Thickness, Effective Radius, And Ice Water Path Inferred From Fused MISR and MODIS Measurements Based on a Pixel-Level Optimal Ice Particle Roughness Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) provides measurements over a wider scattering-angle range for a given location than a cross-track scanning sensor such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based on a full year (2013) of fused MISR-MODIS datasets, we develop a variable surface roughness model for ice particles with the goal of identifying the optimal degree of roughness in the ice model for a given pixel containing single-layer ice clouds. For the MISR-MODIS observations over oceans, severe roughness values are often selected for a pixel when optical thickness (tau) and particle effective radius (R-eff) are large in conjunction with larger cloud heterogeneity index (H-sigma) or a warmer cloud top temperature. Furthermore, tau, R-eff, and ice water path are retrieved with the optimal model and compared to operational MODIS Collection 6 (MC6) products that assume a constant roughness. In general, the retrievals based on the present optimal model lead to greater consistency with MISR measurements, and result in larger median tau by 10.1% and smaller median R-eff by 6.5% but almost identical ice water path in comparison with the MC6 counterparts. The higher average tau value is caused by a slightly larger number of large tau cases, but the smaller average R-eff value is due to the shifting of the retrieved R-eff value toward smaller values by approximately 2-4 mu m in comparison to the MC6 distribution over all seasons. Both tau retrievals have similar regional and monthly variations, but a larger annual cycle of R-eff is associated with the optimal model.

TI  - Estimating vulnerability of water body using Sentinel-2 images and environmental modelling: the study case of Bracciano Lake (Italy)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the concomitance of several factors related to progressive climate changes and to increased water management for anthropogenic usage, drastic fall in level of Bracciano Lake, a volcanic lake, 30 km northwest of Rome, was reported. In November 2017 the water level decreased 1.98 m below the hydrometric zero. Vulnerability to eutrophication was investigated by determination of the lake water volume and the related phosphorus concentration. At this purpose, the bathymetry layer of the water body and the application of supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images allowed to quantify the water body and to define the coastline shape. Once calculated the hydrometric reduction in water body after the hydrometric crisis, occurred in 2017, Vollenweider model allowed to estimate nutrient concentration (around 100.93 mu g/l) and the relative increase of the eutrophication status (+2.3% per liter). According to the lake water quality classification proposed by the OECD, we classified the lake as a very eutrophic lake with a hypertrophic level in the period of water crisis. The proposed methodology represents an efficient monitoring tool for assessing the vulnerability of water bodies influenced by eutrophication.

TI  - Creating forest management units with Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) over a forest affected by mixed-severity fires
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rehabilitation of degraded subtropical natural forests is a global concern. A detailed assessment of their structure is a challenging and costly prerequisite because diverse structures exist depending on the cause and degree of degradation. Recent remote sensing concepts and technologies provide a detailed picture of actual forest structure, even in difficult terrain. When it comes to planning and implementing rehabilitation measures on the ground, however, meaningful forest management units (FMUs) must be created that are large enough to allow technical implementation, but which are also homogenous in structure. To date, the delineation of FMUs has, in most cases, been achieved qualitatively based on expert knowledge. The aim of this contribution is to develop and demonstrate a method for creating and delineating meaningful FMUs based on quantitative information acquired from remote sensing and spatial statistics. Therefore, a case study was conducted in a 3940-ha fire-degraded forest area in the Argentinean cloud forest of Yungas Pedemontana. A plot-based field inventory and an aerial survey with an unmanned aerial vehicle were conducted. The Adjusted Canopy Coverage Index (ACCI), as a metric for stand structure, was formulated to predict basal area from canopy height models. A SPOT6 image of the area was object-based segmented and classified into four fire-severity strata by training it with the ACCI values. The resulting classification presented a mosaic pattern in which the stands are homogenous but far too small (average 3129 m(2)) for planning adaptive management. Therefore, features in close proximity with similar structure (i.e. ACCI values) were aggregated using the Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) tool from the Arc geographic information system environment to create FMUs. Clusters were calculated at four scales: 10, 20, 30 and 40 ha (resulting in threshold radii of 178, 252, 309 and 357 m, respectively), using ACCI values as the variable of aggregation. As a result, average cluster areas were obtained of 33.9 ha for the shortest threshold distance of analysis and 138.5 ha for the greatest threshold distance. The tool significantly aggregated between 30.7% and 60.8% of the area into either coldspots or hotspots of ACCI, facilitating the delineation of FMUs for the planning of adaptive rehabilitation measures. There is a trade-off, however, between the gain in area of the FMUs and the loss of homogeneity: for a 357 m distance threshold, 12% more of the area was misclassified, compared with a 178 m threshold.

TI  - Landcover classification of satellite images based on an adaptive interval fuzzy c-means algorithm coupled with spatial information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landcover classifications have large uncertainty related to the heterogeneity of similar objects and complex spatial correlations in satellite images, making it difficult to obtain ideal classification results using traditional classification methods. Therefore, to address the uncertainty in landcover classifications based on remotely sensed information, we propose a novel fuzzy c-means algorithm, which integrates adaptive interval-valued modelling and spatial information. It dynamically adjusts the interval width according to the fuzzy degree of the target membership without pre-setting any parameters, controls the fuzziness of the target, and mines the inherent distribution of the data. Furthermore, reliability-based spatial correlation modelling is used to describe the spatial relationship of the target and to improve both robustness and accuracy of the algorithm. Experimental data consisting of SPOT5 (10-m spatial resolution) or Thematic Mapper (30-m spatial resolution) satellite data for three case study areas in China are used to test this algorithm. Compared with other state-of-the-art fuzzy classification methods, our algorithm markedly improved the ground-object separability. Moreover, it balanced improvement of pixel separability and suppression of heterogeneity of intra-class objects, producing more compact landcover areas and clearer boundaries between classes.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Change Monitoring of Drought Grade Based on ERA5 Analysis Data and BFAST Method in the Belt and Road Area during 1989-2017
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a worldwide natural disaster with a wide range of influences and a long duration, which has a huge impact on the agricultural production activities and social economy of local residents. The Belt and Road Initiative has always received much attention due to its special geographical location and great potential for economic development. At the same time, the Belt and Road region is also deeply affected by drought, especially in some countries and regions, where the agricultural infrastructure is weak and the ecological environment is fragile. How to effectively monitor and evaluate drought has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data were used, and the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index was combined with Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the 1989-2017 monthly scale of drought in different climate regions of the Belt and Road region. The results show that the overall change trend of arid area shows a change of "up-down-up-down." The winter drought area is larger than the summer drought area, and the drought center gradually moves from the Southeast Asia region in winter to the West-Central Asia region in summer. In the past five years, the drought area decreased gradually at the rate of approximately 0.38 million km(2) per year.

TI  - Eliminating vascular interference from the Spot Sign contributes to predicting hematoma expansion in individuals with spontaneous cerebral hemorrhages
T2  - ACTA NEUROLOGICA BELGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The computed tomography angiography (CTA) Spot Sign is an effective means of predicting hematoma expansion (HE) in the context of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We investigated whether continuous CTA source images could differentiate the Spot Sign and blood vessels in the hematoma, and whether it would improve Spot Sign accuracy as an HE predictor. We screened for the presence of CTA Spot Sign in individuals affected by spontaneous ICH within 24 h of symptom development. Based on our findings, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values of this sign as a predictor of HE both on its own and following the exclusion of blood vessels. In addition, a receiver-operating characteristic approach was used to assess the accuracy of Spot Sign with and without elimination of vascular interference. A total of 265 patients were included in this study. The Spot Sign was observed in 100 patients, including in 29 patients wherein it was confirmed to be blood vessels as determined based upon continuous CTA source images. With respect to predicting HE, Spot Sign sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were 57%, 71%, 48% and 78%, respectively. Following the exclusion of blood vessels, these values were 57%, 87%, 68% and 81%, respectively. Spot Sign area under the curve after excluding blood vessels was 0.718, which was higher than that of the Spot Sign (0.638). After continuous CTA, source images are used to exclude blood vessels in the hematoma, the Spot Sign is thus more accurate in predicting HE.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in land surface phenology arising from large-scale and regional climatic oscillations are important determinants for environmental and ecological conditions. Spearman's correlation coefficient was employed to delineate, within the geographical territory of Iran, the relationship between phenological metrics [cumulative NDVI (cumNDVI), start of growing season (SOS), and end of growing season (EOS)], which were obtained using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the AVHRR Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), and six large-scale climate oscillations [the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the Dipole Mode Index (DMI), the Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the North Sea-Caspian Pattern (NCP), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)]. Results showed that the NCP and NAO had the greatest association, while the AO and MEI had the least association, with the studied phenological metrics for the different types of vegetation in Iran. The NCP was significantly correlated with 25-41% of the pixels for the different vegetation types. The climate oscillations that dominated the relation to phenological metrics differed depending on whether relations with current or previous year climatic oscillation indices were used. The results have implications for environmental and ecological forecasting and analysis, especially for vegetation trends in Iran's arid to semi-arid climate.

TI  - Characterizing beach changes using high-frequency Sentinel-2 derived shorelines on the Valencian coast (Spanish Mediterranean)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline position can be efficiently extracted with subpixel accuracy frommid-resolution satellite imagery using tools as SHOREX. However, it is necessary to develop procedures for deriving descriptors of the beach morphology and its changes in order to become truly useful data for characterizing the coastal dynamism.A new approach is proposed based on a spatiotemporal model of the beach widths. Divided into 80 m analysis segments, it offers a robust and detailed characterization of the beach state along large micro-tidal regions, with continuous information through time and space. Geographical and temporal differences can be recognized andmeasured, making it possible to study the beach response both to general factors (as wave conditions) and to punctual anthropic actions (as small sand nourishments).Widths were defined throughout two and a half years from 60 shorelines (3.04 m RMSE) covering 50 km of the Gulf of Valencia. Important width contrasts appeared along the study site associated with sediment imbalances motivated by sediment traps and other anthropic actions. Segments too narrow for maintaining the recreational function were located and mapped (16% narrower than 30 m). Short-term width changes appeared linked to storm events, with fast retreatments and slow recoveries. Punctually, even small-magnitude nourishments created perceptible changes in width (12,830 m(3) were associated with a 4 m increase).This novel description of the beach state and its changes from Satellite-Derived Shorelines is useful for coastal management, especially considering the global coverage of these free satellite images. It may improve the comprehension of coastal processes as well as monitor human interventions on the coast, helping in the decision making. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Air Quality and Cause Analysis of Heavy Pollution in Northeast China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeastern China experiences severe atmospheric pollution, with an increasing occurrence of heavy haze episodes. Based on ground monitoring data, satellite products and meteorological products of atmospheric pollutants in northeast China from 2013 to 2017, the characteristics of spatial and temporal distribution of air quality and the causes of heavy haze events in northeast China were discussed. It was found that the "Shenyang-Changchun-Harbin" city belt was the most polluted area in the region on an annual scale. The spatial distribution of air quality index (AQI) values had a clear seasonality, with the worst pollution occurring in winter, an approximately oval-shaped polluted area around western Jilin Province in spring, and the best air quality occurring in summer and most of autumn. The three periods that typically experienced intense haze events were Period I from late-October to early-November (i. e., late autumn and early winter) , Period II from late-December to January (i. e., the coldest time in winter) , and Period III from April to mid-May (i. e., spring). During Period I, strong PM2.5 emissions from seasonal crop residue burning and coal burning for winter heating were the dominant reasons for the occurrence of extreme haze events (AQI >300). Period II had frequent heavy haze events (200 < AQI <300) in the coldest months of January and February(200 < AQI <300) , which were due to high PM2.5 emissions from coal burning and vehicle fuel consumption, a lower atmospheric boundary layer, and stagnant atmospheric conditions. Haze events in Period III, with high PM10 concentrations, were primarily caused by the regional transportation of windblown dust from degraded grassland in central Inner Mongolia and bare soil in western Jilin Province. Local agricultural tilling could also release PM10 and enhance the levels of windblown dust from tilled soil.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Driving Mechanism of Aerosol Optical Depth in the Ebinur Lake Basin
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the attenuation of light by aerosols and reflects the degree of regional air pollution to some extent. This study was based on the data from the long-term sequence MOD09A1 from 2000 to 2015 and the generation of a lookup table using the deep blue algorithm (DB) to perform AOD remote sensing estimation on the Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data from the Ebinur Lake Basin to analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of AOD in the Ebinur Lake Basin and to perform an AOD prediction and factor contribution ranking using the random forest model (RF) combined with environmental variables. The results showed that: (1) AOD of Ebinur Lake Basin has significant seasonal variation characteristics, and the AOD values were spring (0.414) > summer (0.390) > autumn (0.287), with the largest variation in spring. (2) The AOD average of the Ebinur Lake Basin was 0.374, and the interannual variation as a whole showed an upward trend. However, the AOD increased rapidly during 2010-2015, with an interannual increase of 32.32%, which indicated increasing air pollution in the basin over the past 15 years, especially the past five years. (3) The spatial distribution of AOD in the Ebinur Lake Basin was stepped up from the north to the south of Lake Ebinur. In this area, the pollution in Jinghe County was the most prominent, and the AOD value reached 0.483. (4) The RF model had a good predictive effect on AOD, R-2=0.866, RMSE=0.042, and evapotranspiration had the most significant effect on AOD in the Ebinur Lake basin.

TI  - Comparing <i>in</i>-<i>situ</i> leaf observations in early spring with flux tower CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, MODIS EVI and modeled LAI in a northern mixed forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the timing and duration of spring leaf development have implications for the start of the carbon uptake period and are therefore fundamental to the accurate calculation of carbon budgets, and in determining the potential for forests to sequester CO2. Here, we examined trends in CO2 exchange (Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER)) (1997-2016) and satellite derived measures (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and modeled Leaf Area Index (LAI)) of the start of spring from the MODIS product MOD13Q1 (2001-2016) for a mixed forest landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. We then explored the relationship between these indirect determinants of spring phenology and the timing and duration of spring phenophases (bud-burst, leaf-out, full-leaf unfolded) of trees over a 5-year period (2006-2010). Contrary to earlier studies focus', our analysis did not find a consistent link between the early transition, of the forest stand from C source to sink with increased annual productivity. Interestingly, while annual regional NEE trended from a source to a sink over the study period, there were no significant concomitant trends in the timing of the start of the season, peak season or the duration of the season derived from (i) satellite data (2001-2016), (ii) flux data (1997-2016) nor from in situ observations (2006-2010). The range of time periods used and difference in phenological determinants examined likely contributed to a lack of expected relationships. The results highlight the need for in situ observations of different forest layers, in particular shrubs, which could help explain current discrepancies between direct and indirect determinants of spring phenology. Furthermore, characterization of abiotic influences on C flux measurements may further explain some of the observed discrepancies.

TI  - Multivariate syndromic surveillance for cattle diseases: Epidemic simulation and algorithm performance evaluation
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multivariate Syndromic Surveillance (SyS) systems that simultaneously assess and combine information from different data sources are especially useful for strengthening surveillance systems for early detection of infectious disease epidemics. Despite the strong motivation for implementing multivariate SyS and there being numerous methods reported, the number of operational multivariate SyS systems in veterinary medicine is still very small. One possible reason is that assessing the performance of such surveillance systems remains challenging because field epidemic data are often unavailable. The objective of this study is to demonstrate a practical multivariate event detection method (directionally sensitive multivariate control charts) that can be easily applied in livestock disease SyS, using syndrome time series data from the Swiss cattle population as an example. We present a standardized method for simulating multivariate epidemics of different diseases using four diseases as examples: Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SV). Two directional multivariate control chart algorithms, Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) and Multivariate Cumulative Sum (MCUSUM) were compared. The two algorithms were evaluated using 12 syndrome time series extracted from two Swiss national databases. The two algorithms were able to detect all simulated epidemics around 4.5 months after the start of the epidemic, with a specificity of 95%. However, the results varied depending on the algorithm and the disease. The MEWMA algorithm always detected epidemics earlier than the MCUSUM, and epidemics of IBR and SV were detected earlier than epidemics of BVD and BTV. Our results show that the two directional multivariate control charts are promising methods for combining information from multiple time series for early detection of subtle changes in time series from a population without producing an unreasonable amount of false alarms. The approach that we used for simulating multivariate epidemics is relatively easy to implement and could be used in other situations where real epidemic data are unavailable. We believe that our study results can support the implementation and assessment of multivariate SyS systems in animal health.

TI  - On the strongly imbalanced state of glaciers in the Sikkim, eastern Himalaya, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates multiple glacier parameters (length, area, debris cover, snowline altitude (SLA), glacial lakes, velocity, and surface elevation change) to comprehend the response of poorly understood glaciers of the Sikkim Himalaya to climate change. For the proposed task, 23 representative glaciers were selected from the region, and remotely acquired data from Landsat-TM/ETM/OLI (1991-2017), and Terra-ASTER (2007-2017) along with the SRTM DEMs were used for extraction of the various parameters. Results show that during 1991-2015 the studied glaciers have significantly retreated (17.78 +/- 2.06 m a(-1)), deglaciated (5.44 +/- 0.87%), and experienced a considerable increase in SLA (similar to 7 m a(-)1) and debris cover (16.49 +/- 2.96%). Glaciers slowed-down (by 24.90%) with sizable growth in number (23.81%) and area (48.78 +/- 2.23%) of glacial lakes. They also exhibit a notable downwasting (-0.77 +/- 0.08 m a(-1)) during 2000-2007/17. The behavior of glaciers in the region is heterogeneous and found to be primarily determined by glacier size, debris cover and glacial lakes. Though a generalized mass loss is observed for both small- (<3 km(2)) and large-sized glaciers (>10 km(2)), they seem to adopt different mechanisms to cope with the ongoing climatic changes. While the first adjust mostly by retreat/deglaciation, the latter lose mass through downwasting. Comparing with other Himalayan regions, the magnitude of dimensional changes and debris growth are higher in the Sikkim. The SLA trends are comparable with the central and western Himalaya up to 2000, but a reverse trend is seen afterwards. Also, contrary to the western and central Himalaya, where glaciers are reported to have slowed-down in recent decade, the Sikkim glaciers have shown negligible deceleration after 2000. Climate analysis confirm almost double increase in summer temperature (24.47%) than winters (12.77%) during 1990-2016, which, given the 'summer-accumulation-type' nature of the Sikkim glaciers, seems to be the prime driver of the observed changes.

TI  - Concentrations of organohalogens (PCBs, DDTs, PBDEs) in hunted and stranded Northern sea otters (<i>Enhydra lutris kenyoni</i>) in Alaska from 1992 to 2010: Links to pathology and feeding ecology
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many organohalogen compounds (OHCs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in appreciable concentrations in marine predators. While production of some POPs has declined or ceased in recent decades, their capacity for global transport and bioaccumulation results in observations of unchanging or increasing concentrations in marine systems. Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have been advocated as an environmental sentinel for contaminants due to their longevity, site fidelity and prey species that often overlap with human consumption. Using archived (1992-2010) samples of livers from Northern sea otters (n= 50) from Alaska we examine concentrations of chlordanes (CHLs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and associated metabolites. We found some evidence for declining Sigma PCBs over the two decades, however for most animals concentrations were low compared to toxicological thresholds. Six animals had relatively high concentrations of Sigma PCBs (mean = 262,000 ng/g lipid weight), Sigma DDTs (mean = 8,800 ng/g/lw), and Sigma PBDEs (mean = 4,600 ng/g lw), with four of these six animals experiencing hepatic parasitism or hepatitis. In order to assess whether differences in POP concentrations are associated with feeding ecology, we examined stable isotopes of C and N in archived muscle and whisker samples. In general, there were no significant relationships between Sigma POP concentrations and stable isotope ratios. There were small differences in stable isotope profiles in animals with high POP concentrations, although it was unclear if these differences were due to feeding ecology or disease processes. This study highlights the importance of considering feeding ecology and necropsy (health and disease status) datawhile conducting contaminant surveys, and confirms some previous reports of trends in OHCs in Alaska marine mammals.

TI  - A novel compact planar antenna for ultra-wideband application
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel compact antenna for ultra-wideband application is investigated and presented. The proposed structure consists of a modified patch with rectangular parasitic elements at the top, whereas a defective ground plane is etched on the flame retardant FR-4 substrate at the bottom with a 50 omega feed line. The magnitude of S-11 < -10 dB of the structure is 2.7-11 GHz which accounts for the fractional bandwidth of 121.1%. The overall volume of the structure has a compact dimension of 20 x 20 x 1.6 mm(3). The gain and antenna efficiency of the structure are 3.34 dB and 79.8%, respectively. The structure exhibits stable radiations across the band of operation. Measured and simulated results of co and cross(X)-polarization are in relatively good agreement. All these properties suggest that the proposed structure finds its applications in WiMAX-band 3.5 and 5.5 GHz, WLAN-band 5.2 and 5.8 GHz, data links to satellites along with various other applications in the wireless communication field.

TI  - Effects of multiple climate change factors on the spring phenology of herbaceous plants in Inner Mongolia, China: Evidence from ground observation and controlled experiments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a natural ecosystem or as climatic climax community, grassland is relatively dry with a strongly seasonal climate, and sensitive to climatic changes. Most of the previous studies used remote sensing data to investigate the phenological response of grassland to climate change, while ground-based studies covering a large geographic area were limited. In this study, using the long-term phenological data (1981-2012) of 16 herbaceous species observed at 20 stations in Inner Mongolia, China, we first investigated the trends in three spring phenophases, including the dates of bud-burst, first leaf unfolding, and 50% of leaf unfolding. Subsequently, multiple linear regressions between phenophases and four climatic factors (spring temperature, soil moisture, chilling temperature, and insolation) were performed to determine the relative importance of each factor on the spring phenology. To validate the resulted regression coefficients, we developed a controlled environment to investigate the factors regulating the leaf unfolding time of one dominant species (Leymus chinensis). The results showed that the study area became warmer and drier from 1981 to 2012. However, the overall changes in spring phenophases were not apparent, as there was a similar proportion of significant earlier or later trends. Such phenological changes were driven by multiple climatic factors. The warmer temperature would advance the spring phenophases, while lower soil moisture would delay them. The impact of soil moisture was significant in the experimental data, but not significant in the observation data. In addition, leaf unfolding became faster when L. chinensis experienced more chilling days, but this effect was difficult to be detected in observation data due to the weak sensitivity of the leaf unfolding time to chilling days. These findings can help us to understand how the spring phenology of typical herbaceous species responds to multiple climatic factors under the background of climate change.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land-use and Land-cover Dynamics of Adama District, Ethiopia and its Implication to Greenhouse Gas Emissions
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled change in land use and land cover (LULC) enhances the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This study, therefore, is aimed at the spatiotemporal analysis of LULC dynamics and their implications for the greenhouse gas emissions of the Adama district of Ethiopia. The dry season Landsat image Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1986, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) of 2000, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) of 2014 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey Global Visualization Viewer Website and employed. The hybrid classification approach was performed after the preprocessing of the image. Moreover, observations, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were used. The analysis was carried out using the image data and survey data. The result indicates that agricultural land and shrub and bush lands covered 80.98%, 76.75%, and 74.42% of the study area during 1986, 2000, and 2014, respectively. Although there were differences in the magnitudes and rates of change during the considered years, the LULC classification results of this study indicated that most natural environments are converted to human-dominated environments, which can be attributed to human-induced activities. Due to this conversion, environmental degradation is aggravated, which again paves the way for the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The study concludes that, largely as a result of interventions from the communities living in the area, the study area is being transformed from the natural ecosystem to a managed environment. Hence, the practices of smallholder farmers with respect to protected areas, afforestation, and reforestation must be strengthened and supported by an integrated policy framework.

TI  - Characterizing fire effects on conifers at tree level from airborne laser scanning and high-resolution, multispectral satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-fire assessment is made after a wildfire incident to provide details about damage level and its distribution over burned areas. Such assessments inform restoration plans and future monitoring of ecosystem recovery. Due to the high cost and time to conduct fieldwork, remote sensing is an appealing alternative to assess post-fire condition over larger areas than can be surveyed practically in the field. The aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post-fire severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the Cascade and East Zone megafires of 2007 in central Idaho, USA. We used remote sensing metrics derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data (2008) and high-resolution QuickBird (QB) multispectral satellite imagery (2007-2009) for calibrating and validating predictive models with field data (2008). We compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent, untreated sites. We observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire severity sites, mostly untreated, whereas we observed more trees with live crowns in low fire severity sites, independent of the treatment. Individual trees were more accurately detected from ALS data in treated sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies. For detected trees, the response variables predicted from ALS and QB metrics were total height (Ht), crown base height (CBH), total basal area (BA(T)), live basal area (BA(L)), scorched basal area (BA(S)), charred basal area (BA(C)) and crown severity (CS). None of the selected QB metrics were strongly correlated with the selected ALS metrics, which justified combining both data types into the predictive models. Random Forest regression models combining ALS + QB metrics or using ALS metrics alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only QB metrics. This study shows the superiority of ALS data to high resolution, multispectral QB imagery for mapping fire severity at tree level. Managers with limited resources to plan for restoration of fire affected forests are advised to prioritize spending for data collection on ALS data and a modest number of field inventory plots, rather than QB or other broadband satellite imagery.

TI  - Estimating the soil salinity over partially vegetated surfaces from multispectral remote sensing image using non-negative matrix factorization
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing technique has been extensively applied in recent years for the detection of soil salinity on bare soil; however, multispectral remote sensing is restricted in areas covered with vegetation, largely due to the mixed pixel problem. In the present study, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was implemented to separate soil spectral signal from mixed pixels of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) to further estimate the soil salinity in a partially vegetated area. Four methods, namely, partial least squares regression (PLSR), least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF), were applied and compared. The results showed that the NMF-separated soil spectra could greatly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the mixed spectra, and among the four modeling methods, RF performed better than the rest of the methods, with the averaged results of determination of the prediction R-p(2) = 0,67, a root mean square error of the prediction RMSEp = 0.73 ms cm(-1), and the ratio of the standard deviation to RMSEp RPD = 1.61 after 100 times of random sampling and modeling. This approach could propose a new method for accurate and timely monitoring of soil salinity in a partially vegetation-covered area.

TI  - Remote photonic sensing of cerebral hemodynamic changes via temporal spatial analysis of acoustic vibrations
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel photonic method for remote monitoring of task-related hemodynamic changes in human brain activation is presented. Physiological processes associated with neural activity, such as nano-vibrations due to blood flow and tissue oxygenation in the brain, are detected by remote sensing of nano-acoustic vibrations using temporal spatial analysis of defocused self-interference random patterns. Temporal nanometric changes of the speckle pattern due to visual task-induced hemodynamic responses were tracked by this method. Reversing visual checkerboard stimulation alternated with rest epochs, and responsive signals were identified in occipital lobe using near-infrared spectroscopy. Temporal vibrations associated with these hemodynamic response functions were observed using three different approaches: (a) single spot illumination at active and control areas simultaneously, (b) subspots cross-correlation-based analysis, and (c) multiwavelength measurement using a magnitude-squared wavelet coherence function. Findings show remote sensing of task-specific neural activity in the human brain.

TI  - Profiling microplastics in the Indian edible oyster, <i>Magallana bilineata</i> collected from the Tuticorin coast, Gulf of Mannar, Southeastern India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to quantify the extent of microplastic (MP) contamination in the Indian edible oyster (Magallana bilineata) and to understand how this relates to the MP contamination in its surrounding marine environment. Samples of water, sediment and oysters of different sizes were collected from three sites along Tuticorin coast in Gulf of Mannar in Southeast India. The mean abundance of MP in oysters was found to be 6.9 +/- 3.84 items/individual and the mean concentration to be 0.81 +/- 0.45 items/g of tissue. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) fibers were the dominant MP types in oysters (92% and 4%, respectively) and in seawater (75% and 25%, respectively), with PE fibers, ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 mm, being the most common. Both PE and PP are low-density polymers which are slow to sediment to the seafloor. This increases the potential of their availability in the environment and ingestion by the oysters. The largest oysters (14-16 cm) contained the highest abundance and concentrations of MP, suggesting a greater proportion of MP in the water column is ingested with increasing size. The calculated microplastic index (0.02 to 0.99) also indicates that MP bioavailability increases with increasing size of oysters. The distribution patterns of MP abundance, shape and size in oysters more closely resemble those in water than in sediment. The surface morphology of the MPs reveals the characteristic pits and cracks which result from partial degradation through the weathering processes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis shows the presence of Ni and Fe in association with MP, and this probably indicates the fly-ash pollution and the petroleum-related activities in the surrounding area. Being sessile animals the oysters are good candidates for use as sentinel organisms for monitoring MP in specificmarine environments. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Managing in-transit melanoma metastases in the new era of effective systemic therapies for melanoma
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Melanoma in-transit metastases (ITMs) occur between the primary tumor site and the regional node field. Most patients with ITMs have a poor prognosis. The treatment of ITMs can be simple if surgical excision is possible, but challenging when ITMs are advanced, multiple or recurrent and impacting quality of life. Areas covered: The management of ITM is still evolving. Patients who are disease-free after surgical excision of ITMs are today candidates for adjuvant systemic treatment to reduce recurrence risk. Some who have multiple or advanced ITMs may achieve long-term survival or disease control with systemic therapies alone. Those who do not remain candidates for the numerous locoregional therapies used to treat ITMs, including electrocautery, intralesional injection, topical therapy, electrochemotherapy, isolated limb infusion, isolated limb perfusion, radiation therapy and, rarely, amputation. Relevant publications identified in Pubmed and MEDLINE databases are reviewed. Expert opinion: Patients with multiple ITMs can benefit from use of systemic therapies as primary treatment, in the adjuvant setting and in neoadjuvant trials. Multiple alternative treatment modalities exist for patients unsuitable for systemic therapies or in whom systemic therapies have failed. Trials assessing combined systemic and locoregional therapies for ITMs are in progress.

TI  - A novel remote sensing-based method of ozone damage assessment effect on Net Primary Productivity of various vegetation types
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric ozone causes considerable damage to both agricultural crops and forest trees, leading to Net Primary Productivity (NPP) reduction. Ozone damage is conventionally investigated using experiments limited in scope and study area. This study attempted to develop a novel remote sensing-based method to assess the effect of regional ozone damage on the NPP of various vegetation types, combining AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone exposure over a Threshold of 40 ppb) and MODIS NPP products. Annual averages of multi-year (five periods during 2009-2013) cumulative AOT40 values and NPP data for each MODIS image pixel were compared to investigate the relationships between NPP and AOT40, and construct linear AOT40-based NPP response models for each of five vegetation types. Our results showed negative significant relationships between NPP and AOT40 for all vegetation types, using at least 4-year average AOT40 values. Estimated maps of ozone impacts on NPP showed a 4-48% reduction for the Kanto area of Japan in response to AOT40 for the year 2013, and a higher ozone sensitivity of crop species (with NPP decrease of 12-48%) than forest species (with NPP decrease of 4-39%). The largest decreases (over 40% in some locations) occurred in the agricultural lands in the central part of the study area. This remote sensing-based method was considered as suitable for regional ozone damage assessment with considerable precision based on comparison with the results of previous experiment-based studies.

TI  - Multicountry Distribution and Characterization of Extended-spectrum β-Lactamase-associated Gram-negative Bacteria From Bloodstream Infections in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern, yet, there are noticeable gaps in AMR surveillance data in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to measure the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria in bloodstream infections from 12 sentinel sites in sub-Saharan Africa.Methods. Data were generated during the Typhoid Fever Surveillance in Africa Program (TSAP), in which standardized blood cultures were performed on febrile patients attending 12 health facilities in 9 sub-Saharan African countries between 2010 and 2014. Pathogenic bloodstream isolates were identified at the sites and then subsequently confirmed at a central reference laboratory. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of ESBL production, and conventional multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for genes encoding for beta-lactamase were performed on all pathogens.Results. Five hundred and five pathogenic Gram-negative bloodstream isolates were isolated during the study period and available for further characterization. This included 423 Enterobacteriaceae. Phenotypically, 61 (12.1%) isolates exhibited ESBL activity, and genotypically, 47 (9.3%) yielded a PCR amplicon for at least one of the screened ESBL genes. Among specific Gram-negative isolates, 40 (45.5%) of 88 Klebsiella spp., 7 (5.7%) of 122 Escherichia coli, 6 (16.2%) of 37 Acinetobacter spp., and 2 (1.3%) of 159 of nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) showed phenotypic ESBL activity.Conclusions. Our findings confirm the presence of ESBL production among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in sub-Saharan Africa. With few alternatives for managing ESBL-producing pathogens in the African setting, measures to control the development and proliferation of AMR organisms are urgently needed.

TI  - Evolution of ice shelf rifts: Implications for formation mechanics and morphological controls
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice shelf rifts are predecessors to iceberg calving events. Observations of their morphology over time and interaction with their surroundings are presented. Newly-available Landsat-derived annual velocity data and laser altimetry from NASA's ICESat, ICESat-2 and Operation IceBridge missions were used to characterize several ice shelf rift systems. Actively propagating ice shelf rifts exhibit uplift on both sides, with an offset in height between the two rift walls, suggesting an asymmetric buoyancy force resulting from the rifting process itself. It is observed that the direction of the asymmetry is the same for rifts within a single ice shelf, but not between ice shelves. This finding suggests a rheological or basal properties influence on rift formation and buoyancy asymmetry. It is shown that this asymmetry can be accounted for by modeling ice shelf rifts as subvertical faults. With time and inactivity, rift walls eventually relax and become rounded off. Measurements of widening suggest that rift infilling is active on many active rifts. Active rifts experience higher spreading rates than do dormant rifts. Lastly, two candidate processes are identified for rift nucleation (subvertical basal crevassing and localized melt). It is found that more than any other ice shelf in this study, rifting in Pine Island Glacier is driven by ocean heat variations and is showing signs of increasing destabilization.

TI  - Long-term temporal and spatial patterns of <i>Ostreid herpesvirus 1</i> (OsHV-1) infection and mortality in sentinel Pacific oyster spat (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) inform farm management
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disease due to Ostreid herpes virus - 1 (OsHV-1) is a major constraint to farming the Pacific oyster Crassotrea gigas in Europe and Australasia, requiring new management strategies. The objectives of this study were to determine the seasonal limits of transmission of OsHV-1, the spatial distribution of the virus, the seasonal water temperatures associated with OsHV-1 transmission and disease and the suitability of active surveillance for OsHV-1 using sentinel oysters. Spat were deployed and sampled regularly between 2012 and 2017 at 15 sites in two large estuaries and the times of OsHV-1 exposure and mortality were identified at weekly to monthly intervals. Mortality due to OsHV-1 was observed each summer season but was significantly more likely in the Georges than the Hawkesbury River estuary. Mortality was most widespread and frequent between December and April and was not observed prior to late October or after May. However, subclinical infections with OsHV-1 that did not progress to mortality were detected from early October until late June. There was a significant reduction in mortality due to OsHV-1 as well as subclinical infection with OsHV-1 between 2012-13 and 2016-17, and viral loads in infected oysters also appeared to decline after 2012-13. Mortality due to OsHV-1 was observed in sentinel spat at 14 of 15 sites but not at every site in every season. Different outcomes were sometimes seen between spat in paired baskets that were 1 to 100 m apart at the same site, attributable to differential exposure to OsHV-1 (clustering). Fifteen different batches of spat were used and mortality due to OsHV-1 occurred in all but three; both triploid and diploid spat were affected. In 2016-17, there was a trend of better survival in selected spat with potential genetic resistance to OsHV-1 compared to unselected spat. There were no biologically significant differences in the growth of spat that subsequently died due to OsHV-1 infection and those that survived. Mortality due to OsHV-1 commenced when the mean water temperature rose above approximately 20 degrees C in spring, which is 4-5 degrees C warmer than the initiation threshold in Europe. These consistent epidemiological patterns of infection and mortality will enable strategic placement of susceptible oysters in these estuaries at certain locations and within specific time windows with predicted low risk of mortality due to OsHV1; water temperature monitoring may be used to predict this risk. Use of sentinel oysters for surveillance for OsHV-1 can be effective, but the clustering of exposure at all scales renders this more reliable at estuary level rather than at bay or site level and it requires an intensive sampling program. Non-specific mortality of spat was relatively common, therefore tests for OsHV-1 should be applied in field trials to distinguish mortality due to OsHV-1 from other causes of mortality.

TI  - Assessment of changes in oasis scale and water management in the arid Manas River Basin, north western China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern water-saving irrigation technology has expanded the scale of agricultural oases in arid and semi-arid regions of China. In this study, we used Landsat MSS and Landsat TM/ETM remote sensing data to assess changes in oasis scale and water availability with reference to differing water management practices in the Manas River Basin of north-western China from 1975 to 2015. We used the water-heat balance index H-0 to determine oasis stability over time and constructed a suitable-scale calculation model for arid and semi-arid regions to assess the suitable development scale and cultivated land area in the study area. The implementation of water-saving technology in 2000 effectively improved the utilization efficiency of water resources and accelerated the formation of artificial oases; these expanded by 3873.3 km(2) while natural oasis area was reduced by 3485.0 km(2). The oasis stability index H-0 was less than the critical stability index of 0.5 throughout the study period, implying that these areas were in a metastable state and unsuitable for further development. Therefore, in order to improve oasis stability, both scale and agricultural area should be further controlled. At present, actual oasis scale exceeds appropriate scale by 1.1 times and agricultural area exceeds suitable area by 2.5 times. To ensure the stability of the oasis, its area should be maintained at 3942.28-4481.06 km(2) and the cultivated land should be maintained at 1576.91-1792.42 km(2). (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - How Do Cultural Worldviews Shape Food Technology Perceptions? Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural biotechnology (genetic modification) has encountered resistance from many consumers, resulting in disparate regulatory approaches across different jurisdictions. The recent advent of CRISPR-Cas9, or gene editing, offers the potential for significant improvements in plant breeding. However, little is known currently about consumer responses to the technology. A factor often omitted from previous economic analyses of consumer acceptance of new food technologies is underlying human values or worldviews. Drawing upon cultural cognition theory and using data from a survey of Canadian consumers, we examine the influence of cultural values on food choice behaviours. Respondents' pre-existing cultural values are measured on two dimensions: hierarchy-egalitarianism and individualism-communitarianism. Choice behaviours are captured using a discrete choice experiment featuring a sliced apple product with two consumer-oriented attributes (non-browning and antioxidant-enhanced) and three novel food technologies (gene editing, genetic modification, edible coating). Using a random parameters logit model with error components we find pre-existing cultural values to be significant determinants of choice behaviours. Individuals pre-disposed towards a hierarchical worldview are more accepting of novel food technologies, as are individuals with a communitarian worldview. While the use of gene editing results in negative marginal utilities in a food choice situation, the effect is not as large as with genetic modification, suggesting there is scope to ameliorate potentially negative reactions to the technology with value-compatible messages.

TI  - Empirical evidence of a positive climate forcing of aerosols at elevated albedo
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observation data to empirically determine how natural and anthropogenic aerosol categories (i.e. mineral dust, biomass burning, and urban-industrial aerosols) affect light extinction, showing that their radiative forcing varies strongly with the surface albedo. Generally, the radiative forcing depends on the aerosol loading, but the efficiency varies with the aerosol type and aerosol-radiation-surface interactions. Desert dust, biomass burning and urban-industrial aerosols can exhibit dramatic shifts in radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, from cooling to warming, at surface albedos from below 0.5 to above 0.75. Based on the linear relationship between the radiative forcing efficiency and surface albedo for aeolian aerosols, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOT (Aerosol Optical Thickness) and surface albedo data, we characterized a large Asian dust event during the spring of 2001, and demonstrate its immense spatially varying radiative forcing, ranging from about -84.0 to +69.3 W/m(2). For extensive Russian wildfires during the summer of 2010, strong radiative cooling forcing variability of biomass combustion aerosols is found, ranging from about -86.3 to +3.1 W/m(2). For a thick urban-industrial aerosol haze over northern India during the winter of 2017, a large range of about -85.0 to -0.3 W/m(2) is found. These wide ranges underscore the need to accurately define aerosol-radiation-surface interactions.

TI  - Evapotranspiration and biomass modelling in the Pontal Sul Irrigation Scheme
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to make feasible the use of irrigated areas of the Pontal Sul Irrigation Scheme in Petrolina, State of Pernambuco, Brazil, modelling of real evapotranspiration (ET) and plant biomass production (BIO) at a large scale was performed with associated agro-meteorological data and the algorithm SAFER (Simple Algorithm For Evapotranspiration Retrieving) using MODIS images for the years 2010-2017. The year 2012 presented the highest ET average with 3.15 mm day(-1) in the rainy season, reaching a maximum of 6 mm day(-1). The lowest mean ET was recorded in the year 2013, with 0.08 mm day(-1) in the dry season, and the maximum recorded for the period was 3.40 mm day(-1) in the irrigated agricultural area. For BIO, the highest average was 104.82 kg ha(-1) day(-1), during the rainy season of 2012, reaching a maximum value of 252 kg ha(-1) day(-1). The lowest average was for the dry period of 2013, with a value of 0.93 kg ha(-1) day(-1), and a maximum of 112.51 kg ha(-1) day(-1) in the irrigated agricultural area. The higher ET results represent moisture in the root zone, provided by rainfall and/or irrigation, showing maximum values in the rainy season. The results obtained for BIO suffer greatly from perimeter water availability. The present study becomes very important to the management of water resources, as it provides an increase in water productivity for food production.

TI  - Spread and potential host range of the invasive oak lace bug [<i>Corythucha arcuata</i> (Say, 1832) - Heteroptera: Tingidae] in Eurasia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The North American oak lace bug feeds on leaves of 'white oaks" in its native range. In Europe, it was first discovered in northern Italy in 2000. In recent years, it has subsequently spread rapidly and population outbreaks have been observed in several European countries. In the present study, we summarize the steps of its expansion. To predict its potential host range, we checked 48 oak species in 20 sentinel gardens in seven countries between 2013 and 2018. In total, 27 oak species were recorded as suitable hosts; 13 of them are globally new ones, 23 out of the 29 in section Quercus (similar to white oaks, an intrageneric taxonomic unit within genus Quercus), including Asian oaks, native to Japan, Korea and China, and four out of five in section Cerris (another intrageneric unit of the same genus), were accepted as hosts. None of the species in section Lobatae (red oaks) or in the Ilex group was accepted. Host records were also collected in forest stands of 10 countries. We found 11 oak species that were infested. Outbreak populations were most commonly found on Quercus robur, Quercus frainetto, Quercus petraea and Quercus cerris, comprising widespread and outstandingly important oaks species in Europe. Based on our findings, we conclude that suitable hosts for oak lace bug are present in most of Europe and Asia. This means that a lack of hosts will likely not restrict further range expansion.

TI  - A new era in forest restoration monitoring
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ecological restoration has been historically dependent on traditional inventory methods based on detailed information obtained from field plots. New paradigms are now needed to successfully achieve restoration as a large-scale, long-lasting transformative process. Fortunately, advances in technology now allow for unprecedented shifts in the way restoration has been planned, implemented, and monitored. Here, we describe our vision on how the use of new technologies by a new generation of restoration ecologists may revolutionize restoration monitoring in the coming years. The success of the many ambitious restoration programs planned for the coming decade will rely on effective monitoring, which is an essential component of adaptive management and accountability. The development of new remote sensing approaches and their application to a restoration context open new avenues for expanding our capacity to assess restoration performance over unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. A new generation of scientists, which have a background in remote sensing but are getting more and more involved with restoration, will certainly play a key role for making large-scale restoration monitoring a viable human endeavor in the coming decade-the United Nations' decade on ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Topographic effects on the determination of hyperspectral vegetation indices: a case study in southeastern Brazil
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the sensitivity of 16 hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) to topographic effects in southeastern Brazil. Using Hyperion data acquired over ombrophilous forest and the topographic C-correction, we calculated the relative changes and statistical differences (Wilcoxon test) between corrected and non-corrected data, and the magnitude of the effect size of topographic correction. The analysis considered 12 terrain illumination classes obtained from cross-comparison between aspect and slope images. The results showed that the most anisotropic indices were the Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). During the comparison between C-corrected and non-corrected data, these VIs presented the largest relative changes, the lowest p-values and the largest metric of effect size. The sensitivity was stronger with increasing slope over south- and west-facing shaded surfaces. The least sensitive VIs were the Visible Index Green (VIG), Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) and Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI).

TI  - Mapping of sentinel lymph node drainage using SPECT/CT to tailor elective nodal irradiation in head and neck cancer patients (SUSPECT-2): a single-center prospective trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The majority of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) receive bilateral elective nodal irradiation (ENI), in order to reduce the risk of regional failure. Bilateral ENI, as compared to unilateral ENI, is associated with higher incidence of acute and late radiation-induced toxicity with subsequent deterioration of quality of life. Increasing evidence that the incidence of contralateral regional failure (cRF) in lateralized HNSCC is very low (< 10%) suggests that it can be justified to treat selected patients unilaterally. This trial aims to minimize the proportion of patients that undergo bilateral ENI, by using lymph drainage mapping by SPECT/CT to select patients with a minimal risk of contralateral nodal failure for unilateral elective nodal irradiation. Methods In this one-armed, single-center prospective trial, patients with primary T1-4 N0-2b HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx (except T1 glottic) or hypopharynx, not extending beyond the midline and planned for primary (chemo) radiotherapy, are eligible. After Tc-99m-nanocolloid tracer injection in and around the tumor, lymphatic drainage is visualized using SPECT/CT. In case of contralateral lymph drainage, a contralateral sentinel node procedure is performed on the same day. Patients without contralateral lymph drainage, and patients with contralateral drainage but without pathologic involvement of any removed contralateral sentinel nodes, receive unilateral ENI. Only when tumor cells are found in a contralateral sentinel node the patient will be treated with bilateral ENI. The primary endpoint is cumulative incidence of cRF at 1 and 2 years after treatment. Secondary endpoints are radiation-related toxicity and quality of life. The removed lymph nodes will be studied to determine the prevalence of occult metastatic disease in contralateral sentinel nodes. Discussion This single-center prospective trial aims to reduce the incidence and duration of radiation-related toxicities and improve quality of life of HNSCC patients, by using lymph drainage mapping by SPECT/CT to select patients with a minimal risk of contralateral nodal failure for unilateral elective nodal irradiation.

TI  - Acute Upper Airway Obstruction
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Upper airway obstruction is defined as blockage of any portion of the airway above the thoracic inlet. Stridor, suprasternal retractions, and change of voice are the sentinel signs of upper airway obstruction. Most of the common causes among children presenting to emergency department are of acute infectious etiology. Among these, croup is the commonest while diphteria remains the most serious life-threatening cause. Recent reports indicate that bacterial tracheitis has become increasingly common. In ER evaluation the key clinical data in determining the cause and the site of obstruction are the onset, presence of fever, character of the stridor, retractions, the voice and the ability to handle secretions. After assessment of the severity of respiratory distress and resuscitative or supportive therapy including oxygen and emergent airway, specific treatment is directed at underlying etiology. All patients with audible stridor require early endotracheal intubation/tracheostomy. In croup the mainstay of treatment are cold humidified oxygen, budesonide nebulization ( in mild cases), Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg iv or im (in moderate and severe cases), and Adrenaline 5 ml 1:1000 (5 mg) solution as nebulization ( in severe cases). In diphtheria, early tracheostomy, anti-diphtheric serum and injectable penicillin are critical. Bacterial Tracheitis and Retropharyngeal abscess need early administration of injectable Cloxacillin, Amikacin and Clindamycin. ENT consultation should be obtained for early surgical drainage of retropharyngeal abscess. Angioneurotic edema is treated with subcutaneous adrenaline (1:1000, 0.01 ml/kg); hydrocortisone 10 mg/kg IV and antihistamines. Patients with severe obstruction and those with endotracheal tube/ trachesotomy should be transferred to PICU.

TI  - Culture of safety and clinical risk management
T2  - UNFALLCHIRURG
M3  - Article
AB  - An error-resistant safety culture can only be achieved through proactive clinical risk management. In April 2019 the Federal Joint Committee once again increased the pressure on hospitals by means of the Quality Promotion and Enforcement Directive (QFD Directive) to take measures within the framework of clinical risk management in order to reduce the error and harm rate and therefore to significantly improve patient safety. In the long term this can only be achieved by positively influencing the safety culture and thus the attitudes and motives of all employees. Clinical risk management should focus on the prevention of so-called sentinel events on the one hand and on the reduction of frequent and avoidable complications on the other hand. This not only improves patient safety but also protects employees from negative consequences. Effective clinical risk management always follows a systemic approach, the 10 fields of action of which are discussed in this article. Large meta-analyses have also confirmed the substantial economic benefit of a clinical risk management.

TI  - Double-stage linear spectral unmixing analysis for improving accuracy of sediment concentration estimation from MODIS data: the case of Tekeze River, Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic spectral properties of sediment types together with less wide river dimension compared to spatial resolution of public imageries are the challenges for modeling suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using the conventional regression remote sensing analysis. In this study, a new subpixel analysis approach called double-stage linear spectral unmixing analysis (DLSUA) was proposed for modeling the variability of SSC from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In the first stage, the linear spectral unmixing analysis was used to unmix the ground cover components (rock, bare land and turbid water) which contributed to the reflectance of the mixed pixels. In the next stage, the spectral mixing coefficients (SMCs) of the constituents in the turbid water were determined. Finally, nonlinear regression models correlating the SSC and its SMC were generated. Furthermore, the field and laboratory-based observed SSC and reflectance data were used for verifying the model. The coefficients of determination (R-2) and relative mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the model. The DLSUA approach improved the simulations of SSCs (R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE +/- 9.96) compared to the simulations using the empirical regression remote sensing model (R-2 = 0.74 and RMSE +/- 16.2). Overall, the study showed that understanding the variability of spectral properties of primary components is important to use remote sensing for modeling and monitoring the SSCs using coarser remote sensing data (MODIS).

TI  - A CYGNSS-Based Algorithm for the Detection of Inland Waterbodies
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is a new constellation of eight low Earth orbiting spacecrafts that receive both direct and reflected signals from GPS satellites. Coherent reflection of the GPS signal from standing water over land results in a high surface reflectivity signal in the CYGNSS data. An image processing algorithm is presented, which leverages the surface reflectivity signal to produce a watermask of inland waterbodies at 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees spatial resolution. The watermask is compared to hand-drawn maps of inland waterbodies, as well as to the MODIS watermask product. We find that the CYGNSS watermask provides accurate, time-varying maps that are able to resolve changes in lake and river position and extent. With CYGNSS' short return time, watermasks can be generated using as little as half a month of data to produce near-real-time maps of flooding events.

TI  - Monitoring the Real-Time Circulatory System-Related Physiological and Pathological Processes In Vivo Using a Multifunctional NIR-II Probe
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dysfunction of the circulatory system leads to various pathological processes with high morbidity. Recently, fluorescence imaging in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window (1000-1700 nm) has attracted immense attention in many biological processes. The rapid metabolism and low toxicity of some NIR-II organic small molecules indicate their feasibility for use in visualizing the circulatory system. However, most of the reported NIR-II organic small molecules presently encounter such dilemmas as complicated synthetic procedures and low quantum yields (QY). To address this challenge, a series of facilely prepared NIR-II organic small molecule CQ-T (CQ-1-4T) are designed and these compounds are loaded with biocompatible human serum albumin (HSA) to improve QY. Among them, CQL (CQ-4T/HSA) demonstrates superior optical properties and a 6.65-fold increase in fluorescence compared to the small molecule alone. Further work validates the efficacy and accuracy of CQL in monitoring the real-time circulatory system-related physiological and pathological processes in vivo, including thrombosis, peripheral arterial disease, tumor angiogenesis, and lymphatic drainage. Moreover, the excellent optical properties of CQL enable precise tumor resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy under NIR-II navigation. In conclusion, CQL is a novel and promising NIR-II organic probe with multifunctional imaging capability. It is highly desirable to accelerate its future translations into the clinic.

TI  - Simultaneous Identification of Clinically Common <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> Serotypes Using Probe Melting Curve Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic nature of Vibrio parahaemolyticus epidemiology has presented a unique challenge for disease intervention strategies. Despite the continued rise of disease incidence and outbreaks of vibriosis, as well as the global emergence of pandemic clones and serovariants with enhanced virulence, there is a paucity of molecular methods for the serotyping of V. parahaemolyticus strains to improve disease surveillance and outbreak investigations. We describe the development of a multiplex ligation reaction based on probe melting curve analysis (MLMA) for the simultaneous identification of 11 clinically most common V. parahaemolyticus serotypes spanning a 10-year period. Through extensive sequence analyses using 418 genomes, specific primers and probes were designed for a total of 22 antigen gene targets for the O- and K- serogroups. Additionally, the toxR gene was incorporated into the assay for the confirmation of V. parahaemolyticus. All gene targets were detected by the assay and gave expected Tm values, without any cross reactions between the 11 clinically common serotypes or with 38 other serotypes. The limit of identification for all gene targets ranged from 0.1 to 1 ng/mu L. The intra- and inter-assay standard deviations and the coefficients of variation were no more than 1 degrees C and <1% respectively, indicating a highly reproducible assay. A multicenter double-blind clinical study was conducted using the traditional V. parahaemolyticus identification workflow and the MLMA assay workflow in parallel. From consecutive diarrheal stool specimens (n = 6118) collected over a year at 10 sentinel hospitals, a total of 153 V. parahaemolyticus isolates (2.5%) were identified by both workflows. A total agreement (kappa = 1.0) between the serotypes identified by the MLMA assay and conventional serological method was demonstrated. This is the first molecular assay to simultaneously identify multiple clinically important V. parahaemolyticus serotypes, which satisfies the acute need for a practical, rapid and robust identification of V. parahaemolyticus serotypes to facilitate the timely detection of vibriosis outbreaks and surveillance.

TI  - Pansharpening with transform-based gradient transferring model
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most popular kinds of the component substitution (CS)-based pansharpening methods, the intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) method can produce the pan-sharpened images with high spatial quality while causing some spectral distortion, mainly owing to it cannot estimate an accurate intensity image in the IHS space. To solve this issue in the IHS method, in this study, the authors propose a new pansharpening method with gradient transferring in the generalised IHS transform space, which aims at estimating a more accurate intensity image. More specifically, the novelty of the proposed method consists of building a novel variational gradient transferring model to transfer the spatial gradient information of the panchromatic image into the new intensity image as well as preserve the local spectral information from the low resolution multispectral image. Finally, they compare the proposed method with some CS methods using the Pleiades, QuickBird, and GeoEye-1 satellite datasets from both the subjective and objective aspects. Specifically, the experimental results show that the proposed method yields better pansharpening results than the other methods in terms of higher spatial and spectral qualities.

TI  - Analysis of multi-frequency and multi-polarization SAR data for wetland mapping in Hamoun-e-Hirmand wetland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex, dynamic and narrow boundaries between vegetation types make wetland mapping challenging. Hereafter the case study of the Hamoun-e-Hirmand wetland is considered by analysing eight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images acquired in dry and wet periods with three wavelengths (X-band similar to 3 cm, C-band similar to 6 cm, and L-band similar to 25 cm), three polarizations (HH, VV and VH), and four incidence angles (22 degrees, 30 degrees, 34 degrees and 53 degrees). Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method was applied to classify TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-PALSAR images. The final wetland land cover map was created by combining the classification results obtained from each sensor. In the case in question, results show that TerraSAR-X (X-band, HH-53 degrees) and Sentinel-1 data (C-band, W-34 degrees) were useful for determining the flooded vegetation area in the wet period. This is crucial for the conservation of water bird habitats since flooded vegetation is an ideal environment for the nesting and feeding of water birds. PALSAR data (L-band in both HH and VH polarizations, 30 degrees) were capable of separating the classes of vegetation density in the wetland. In the dry period, Sentinel-1 (VV and VH, 34 degrees) and TerraSAR-X (HH, 22 degrees and 53 degrees) had higher potential in land cover mapping than PALSAR (HH and VH, 30 degrees). Based on these results, Sentinel-1 in VV and VH provides the highest ability to discriminate between dry and green plants. TerraSAR-X is better for separating meadow and bare land. The results obtained in this paper can reduce the ambiguity in selecting satellite data for wetland studies. The results can also be used to produce more accurate data from satellite images and to facilitate wetland investigation, conservation and restoration.

TI  - Analysis of Spatiotemporal Variation of Site-Specific Management Zones in a Topographic Relief Area over a Period of Six Years Using Image Segmentation and Satellite Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over fertilization has resulted in serious soil compaction and acidification, as well as nonpoint pollution. A strategy for variable fertilization according to Site-Specific Management Zones (SSMZ) is urgently needed. We developed an object-oriented method using image segmentation for SSMZ delineation for a farming cooperative founded in 2013 in northeastern China. The method is based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the crop growth period from 2011 to 2016. We analyzed and validated SSMZ results with plant sampling data, NDVI, soil temperature and moisture. The results indicated that (i) SSMZs derived from NDVI and image segmentation enhanced the difference between SSMZs and the homogeneity within SSMZs; (ii) crop dry biomass was consistent with NDVI, and NDVI showed a clear change in the regular SSMZ pattern with terrain variation after 2013; and (iii) SSMZ patterns were mainly affected by different farming practices or by topographic factors before and after the cooperative was founded. This new approach for SSMZ delineation will accelerate the application of precision agriculture in relief areas. If the study results are applied to other areas, the main factors of SSMZ need to be determined because of climate differences as well as specific soil and terrain conditions.

TI  - The Influence of Race-Related Stress on Eating Pathology: The Mediating Role of Depression and Moderating Role of Cultural Worldview Among Black American Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to advance the eating pathology literature through investigating the association between a salient stressor for Black American women (race-related stress) and eating pathology, while also examining the potential mediating role of depressive symptoms on this association. In addition, the study aimed to examine the potential protective role of cultural worldview in this model. A community sample of 119 Black women between the ages of 18 and 60 years (M = 36.34, SD = 12.51) were recruited for the study. Results supported a significant indirect effect of race-related stress on eating pathology through depressive symptoms. Moderated mediation analyses revealed a conditional effect of depression at various levels of worldview. Contrary to our hypotheses, participants with a more collectivistic and spiritual worldview often engaged in more eating pathology as a result of self-reported depressive symptoms stemming from experiences of race-related stress. Implications and future directions are discussed.

TI  - Paradoxical clade- and age-specific vaccine effectiveness during the 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) epidemic in Canada: potential imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV)
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network reports vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) epidemic. Aim: To explain a paradoxical signal of increased clade 3C.3a risk among 35-54-year-old vaccinees, we hypothesise childhood immunological imprinting and a cohort effect following the 1968 influenza A(H3N2) pandemic. Methods: We assessed VE by test-negative design for influenza A(H3N2) overall and for co-circulating clades 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a. VE variation by age in 2018/19 was compared with amino acid variation in the haemagglutinin glycoprotein by year since 1968. Results: Influenza A(H3N2) VE was 17% (95% CI: -13 to 39) overall: 27% (95% CI: -7 to 50) for 3C.2a1b and -32% (95% CI: -119 to 21) for 3C.3a. Among 20-64-year-olds, VE was -7% (95% CI: -56 to 26): 6% (95% CI: -49 to 41) for 3C.2a1b and -96% (95% CI: -277 to -2) for 3C.3a. Clade 3C.3a VE showed a pronounced negative dip among 35-54-year-olds in whom the odds of medically attended illness were > 4-fold increased for vaccinated vs unvaccinated participants (p < 0.005). This age group was primed in childhood to influenza A(H3N2) viruses that for two decades following the 1968 pandemic bore a serine at haemagglutinin position 159, in common with contemporary 3C.3a viruses but mismatched to 3C.2a vaccine strains instead bearing tyrosine.Discussion: Imprinting by the first childhood influenza infection is known to confer long-lasting immunity focused toward priming epitopes. Our findings suggest vaccine mismatch may negatively interact with imprinted immunity. The immunological mechanisms for imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV) warrant investigation.

TI  - Surface deformation of Asama volcano, Japan, detected by time series InSAR combining persistent and distributed scatterers, 2014-2018
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Asama volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in Japan. Spatially dense surface deformation at Asama volcano has rarely been documented because of its high topography and snow cover around the summit. This study presents the first interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observation of ground deformation at Asama volcano with 120 Sentinel-1 SAR images from both ascending and descending tracks and 20 descending ALOS-2 images acquired between 2014 and 2018. We exploited both persistent and distributed scatterers to overcome decorrelation of SAR signals and applied a three-dimensional unwrapping method to retrieve the displacement time series efficiently. Our observations reveal an asymmetric deformation around the volcano with two main deformation regions on the northeast and southeast flanks, respectively. The northeast flank (NEF) exhibits line-of-sight (LOS) extensions in all the three SAR datasets with maximum velocities of - 14, - 10, and - 12 mm/year for the descending ALOS-2, ascending, and descending Sentinel-1 measurements, respectively. The southeast flank (SEF) shows LOS extensions in the ascending observations and LOS shortening in the descending observations with velocities between - 12 and 9 mm/year. Decomposition of the LOS displacements reveals nearly pure subsidence at the NEF, while the SEF exhibits a substantial eastward component as well as subsidence. Comparisons of the vertical subsidence at two continuous GNSS stations near the summit crater with our InSAR observations indicate small discrepancies smaller than 4 mm/year. We interpreted that the subsidence at the NEF of Asama is primarily due to the hydrothermal activity, while the deformation at SEF is plausibly due to flank instability. We highlight that efforts should be taken to monitor the slope instability at Asama volcano in the future.

TI  - Linkage mapping of quantitative trait loci for fiber yield and its related traits in the population derived from cultivated ramie and wild <i>B</i>. <i>nivea</i> var. <i>tenacissima</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ramie is an important natural fiber crop, and the fiber yield and its related traits are the most valuable traits in ramie production. However, the genetic basis for these traits is still poorly understood, which has dramatically hindered the breeding of high yield in this fiber crop. Herein, a high-density genetic map with 6,433 markers spanning 2476.5 cM was constructed using a population derived from two parents, cultivated ramie Zhongsizhu 1 (ZSZ1) and its wild progenitor B. nivea var. tenacissima (BNT). The fiber yield (FY) and its four related traits-stem diameter (SD) and length (SL), stem bark weight (BW) and thickness (BT)-were performed for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, resulting in a total of 47 QTLs identified. Forty QTLs were mapped into 12 genomic regions, thus forming 12 QTL clusters. Among 47 QTLs, there were 14 QTLs whose wild allele from BNT was beneficial. Interestingly, all QTLs in Cluster 10 displayed overdominance, indicating that the region of this cluster was likely heterotic loci. In addition, four fiber yield-related genes underwent positive selection were found either to fall into the FY-related QTL regions or to be near to the identified QTLs. The dissection of FY and FY-related traits not only improved our understanding to the genetic basis of these traits, but also provided new insights into the domestication of FY in ramie.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze and investigate the changing trend of the endemic situation of schistosomiasis in national surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province from 2011 to 2018, so as to provide scientific evidence for formulating strategies for schistosomiasis control.METHODS: From 2011 to 2014, the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites were set in seven schistosomiasis endemic counties (cities, districts) across Jiangsu Province as according to the National Schistosomiasis Surveillance Scheme (2011 version), and from 2015 to 2018, the national surveillance sites were assigned in all 64 counties (cities, districts) endemic for schistosomiasis in Jiangsu Province according to the National Schistosomiasis Surveillance Scheme (2014 version). Schistosoma japonicum infections in local populations, mobile populations and livestock, and snail status were monitored in the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province from 2011 to 2018, and the monitoring data were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: The sero-prevalence of S. japonicum infections was 1.50% to 4.61% among local populations in the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province from 2011 to 2018, and a higher sero-prevalence was seen in men than in women, with the sero-positives predominantly detected in local populations at ages of over 50 years. The positive rate of stool examinations was 0 to 0.14% among sero-positive local populations in the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province from 2011 to 2018, and no acute case was found in local populations during the study period. The sero-prevalence of S. japonicum infections was 0.46% to 15.97% among mobile populations in the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province from 2011 to 2018, and no egg-positives were identified. A total of 1 453 livestock were tested in the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province from 2011 to 2018, and no S. japonicum infections were detected. During the period from 2011 through 2018, snail survey was conducted in an area of 216 million m2 in the national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province, and 1 291.01 hm2 snail habitats were identified, with snail densities ranging from 0.01 to 0.47 snails/0.1 m2; however, no S. japonicum infections were identified in snails.CONCLUSIONS: The overall endemic situation of schistosomiasis appears a tendency towards a decline in Jiangsu Province, and S. japonicum infection remains at a low level in both humans and livestock. No S. japonicum infection has been identified in local populations in Jiangsu Province since 2012. In the future, monitoring and management of imported sources of S. japonicum infections should be intensified in Jiangsu Province, and the capability building of passive surveillance of schistosomiasis should be improved in sentinel hospitals in national schistosomiasis surveillance sites of Jiangsu Province. In addition, the examination of schistosomiasis should be strengthened in mobile populations in Jiangsu Province, a sensitive and effective surveillance-response system for schistosomiasis is urgently needed.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and analysis of the thermal expansion of high-rise buildings in Shanghai Lujiazui using tomography-based persistent scatterer interferometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We utilize a tomography-based persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Tomo-PSInSAR) approach for monitoring the deformation performance and analysis of the thermal expansion of 33 high-rise buildings in Shanghai Lujiazui. For the purpose of this study, we use 31 stripmap acquisitions from TerraSAR-X missions spanning from December 2009 to February 2013. Considering that thermal expansion, concrete creep, and shrinkage are three long-term movements that occur in high-rise buildings with concrete structures, we use an extended 4-D SAR phase model, and three parameters (height, deformation velocity, and thermal amplitude) are estimated simultaneously. Additionally, we apply a two-tier network strategy to detect single and double PSs with no need for preliminary removal of the atmospheric phase screen in the study area. The thermal amplitude map demonstrates that the derived thermal amplitude of the buildings is highly related to the building height due to the upward accumulative effect of thermal expansion. The deformation velocity map reveals that the Shanghai World Financial Center is subject to a great deal of deformation during the newly built period due to concrete creep and shrinkage effects, which are height-dependent downward movements. In addition, the deformation rates caused by concrete creep and shrinkage are largest at the beginning and gradually decrease, finally achieving a steady state as time goes to infinity. In contrast, the deformation velocity map shows that the Jin Mao Tower is almost stable during this period. We observe a negative correlation between deformation characteristics and the time of completion of high-rise buildings, inferring that the newly built concrete buildings are more sensitive to concrete creep and shrinkage effects than the older concrete buildings. Our study emphasizes the potential of the Tomo-PSInSAR solution for monitoring the deformation performance and analysis of the thermal expansion of high-rise buildings.

TI  - Spatial distribution of decadal ice-thickness change and glacier stored water loss in the Upper Ganga basin, India during 2000-2014
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers have long been the focus of glaciologists across the world while trying to understand the contrasting patterns of elevation and mass changes. However, with limited number of ground observations, a comprehensive assessment of mass balance on a regional scale still remains elusive. Using the synoptic coverage of remote sensing data, we estimate a detailed spatial variation of glacier ice thickness change in the Central Himalaya of Uttarakhand using geodetic method, on a catchment scale. High resolution TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (12 m) and SRTM (30 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) have been utilized. The mean elevation change in the catchments is found to be -9.56 +/- 0.2 m (mean annual elevation change rate is -0.68 +/- 0.01 m a(-1)). To highlight the water potential of this region, the total ice mass loss has been estimated to be 16.0 +/- 1.2 Gigatonne (Gt) from 2000-2014 from eight identified catchments namely Yamunotri, Bhagirathi, Mandakini, Alaknanda, Dhauliganga, Pindar, Goriganga and Kali/Sarda. The estimated mass balance has been validated using reported observations on five selective glaciers and the coefficient of determination is 0.93. This spatial variation of ice thickness estimated in the eight catchments is critical, as the melt-water from these glaciers contribute to the upper Ganga basin.

TI  - Moderate influenza vaccine effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and low effectiveness against A(H3N2) subtype, 2018/19 season in Italy
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza vaccines are updated every year to match the vaccine strains with currently circulating viruses; consequently influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) has to be assessed annually. Research design and methods: A test-negative case-control study was conducted within the context of the Italian sentinel influenza surveillance network to estimate IVE by age group, virus subtype, and vaccine brand in medically attended laboratory-confirmed influenza. Results: In Italy, the 2018/19 influenza season was characterized by the co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses. The adjusted IVE estimate in preventing influenza was moderate (44.8%, 95% CI: 18.8 to 62.5) against A(H1N1)pdm09, whereas there was no evidence of effectiveness (1.8%, 95% CI: -37.8 to 30.1) in persons affected by A(H3N2). IVE against A(H1N1)pdm09 decreased with age ranging from 65.7% to 13.1% among children/adolescents and elderly, respectively; moreover results suggest that Vaxigrip Tetra (R) was more effective against A(H1N1)pdm09 compared to Fluarix Tetra (R) [62.5% (95% CI: 34.3 to 78.6) vs 24.5% (95% CI: -40.6 to 59.6)]. Low effectiveness (35.2%, 95% CI: -50.8 to 72.1) against A(H3N2) was detected only in the elderly immunized with Fluad (R). Conclusions: Findings suggest that influenza vaccines were low to moderately effective, probably due to a mismatch between circulating and vaccine strains.

TI  - Variability in lymph node irradiation in patients with breast cancer-results from a multi-center survey in German-speaking countries
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lymph node irradiation in breast cancer has gained complexity due to recently published studies and technical innovations which then led to changes in international guidelines. We sought to determine real-time variability in lymph node irradiation in clinical practice in German-speaking countries. Methods The Department of Radiation Oncology, Technical University of Munich (TUM), developed an online-based questionnaire focusing on the indication, target definition, and treatment technique of lymph node irradiation in patients with breast cancer. The invitation to participate in the survey was sent to members of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) by e-mail. The results of the survey were exported from the online platform into SPSS for a detailed analysis. Results In total, 100 physicians completed the questionnaire between 05/2019 and 06/2019. Despite the existence of several treatment and contouring guidelines, we observed large variability of lymph node irradiation: The guideline recommendation for internal mammary irradiation is not consistently implemented in clinical practice and irradiation of the axilla after positive SLNB (sentinel lymph node biopsy) or ALND (axillary lymph node dissection) is handled very differently. Furthermore, in most clinics, the ESTRO (European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology) contouring consensus is not used, and PTV (planning target volume) definitions and margins vary considerably. Conclusion Further clinical studies should be performed with a particular focus on radiotherapy for lymphatic drainage to support and amend the existing guidelines. These studies should establish a more standardized treatment of the lymph node regions in clinical practice. Quality assurance should enforce broad implementation of consensus recommendations.

TI  - Topside Ionospheric Conditions During the 7-8 September 2017 Geomagnetic Storm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The uplooking total electron contents (TECs) from the GRACE, SWARM-A, TerraSAR-X, and MetOp-A satellites and in situ electron density (Ne) from SWARM-A were utilized to investigate the topside ionospheric conditions during the 7-8 September 2017 geomagnetic storm. The rate of TEC index (ROTI) and rate of density index (RODI), which are derivative indices of TEC and Ne, respectively, were also used to characterize the topside ionospheric irregularities. The main results of this study are as follows: (1) There were significant enhancements seen in the uplooking TEC during the first main phase of the storm. (2) The uplooking TEC did not show unusual enhancement at the morning and evening local times in the Asian-Australian sector during the recovery phase of the storm. (3) Prominent TEC hemispheric asymmetry at the middle and high latitudes was observed at both day and night sectors. (4) Long-duration recovery of topside TEC with respect to the prestorm condition was also detected in this event. (5) Nighttime ROTI enhancements were presented in a wide latitudinal range from the equator to the poles during the main phases of the storm. (6) The ionospheric electric field disturbances associated with IMF-B-z fluctuations probably played a very important role in triggering ionospheric irregularities during the relatively weak geomagnetic activity on 7 September, which implies that ionospheric irregularities do not necessarily occur under the severe geomagnetic conditions only.

TI  - Medical Male Circumcision and Associations Among Sexually Transmitted Infections Service Attendees
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical male circumcision (MMC) is a proven intervention for preventing HIV acquisition among males. We describe the circumcision status, eligibility for MMC referral and associations with HIV positivity among symptomatic males attending sexually transmitted infections (STI) services. This study was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected during sentinel surveillance for STI aetiologies. In the sentinel surveillance conducted at primary care facilities located in six South African provinces, an anonymous questionnaire was administered followed by collection of appropriate genital and blood specimens for laboratory testing including HIV, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and HSV-2 serological testing. During analysis, multivariable logistic regression was used to determine association between prevalent HIV infection and male circumcision among males who were HSV-2 AND/OR RPR serology positive and among those who were negative. A total of 847 males were included the analysis, among whom the median age was 28 years (IQR 24-32 years) with 26.3% aged < 25 years. Of these, 166 (19.6%) were medically circumcised, 350 (41.4%) traditionally circumcised while 324 (39%) were not circumcised. The yield of assessment for MMC referral was 27.7%. Overall HIV positivity was 23.1%. Compared to no circumcision, MMC had a statistically insignificant 62% lower odds of being HIV positive -among males who were HSV-2 and RPR negative- adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-1.18], p = 0.094. Among those HSV-2 AND/OR RPR positive, MMC had a statistically insignificant 26% lower odds of being HIV positive- aOR 0.74 (95% CI 0.41-1.36), p = 0.334. In both groups HIV positivity increased with age but was positively associated with condom use at last sexual encounter [aOR 3.41 (95% CI 1.43-8.15)] and previous treatment for an STI syndrome [aOR 3.81 (95% CI 1.60-9.05)] among those HSV-2 and RPR negative. High HIV positivity and high yield of eligibility for VMMC referral among males attending STI services points to the need for better integration of HIV prevention and treatment with STI care.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of the Forest Ecosystems in the Western Ghats, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming with the burgeoning anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (400 parts per million from 280 ppm CO2 emissions of pre-industrial era) has altered climate, eroding the ecosystem productivity and sustenance of water, affecting the livelihood of people. The anthropogenic activities such as burning fossil fuel, power generation, agriculture, industry, polluting water bodies and urban activities are responsible for increasing GHG footprint of which 72% constitute CO2. GHG footprint needs to be in balance with sequestration of carbon to sustain ecosystem functions. Forests are the major carbon sinks (about 45%) that aid in mitigating global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the forest ecosystems and changes in climatic conditions of Western Ghats. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies toward sustainable management of forests and mitigate impacts of global warming. The land-use land-cover (LULC) dynamics are the prime driver of climate change due to the loss of carbon sequestration potential as well as emissions. The Western Ghats are one among 36 global biodiversity hotspots and forests in this region sequester atmospheric carbon, which aid in moderating the global climate and sustaining water to ensure water and food security in the peninsular India. Assessment of LULC dynamics using temporal remote sensing data shows the decline of evergreen forest by 5% with an increase in agriculture, plantations and built-up area. The interior or intact forests have declined by 10%, and they are now confined to protected areas. The simulation of likely changes indicates that the region will have only 10% evergreen cover and 17% agriculture, 40% plantations and 5% built-up. Quantification of carbon reveals that the WG forest ecosystem holds 1.23 MGg (million gigagrams or Gt) in vegetation and soils. The annual incremental carbon is about 37,507.3 Gg, (or 37.5 million tons, Mt) and the highest in the forests of Karnataka part of WG. Simulation of the likely changes in carbon content indicates the loss of 0.23 MGg (2018-2031) carbon sequestration potential under business as usual scenario. The conservation scenario depicts an increase in carbon sequestration potential of WG forests with the protection. Sequestered carbon in WG is about INR 100 billion ($1.4 billion) at carbon trading of INR 2142 ($30) per tonne. Large-scale land-cover changes leading to deforestation has contributed to an increase in mean temperature by 0.5 degrees C and decline in rainy days, which necessitates evolving prudent landscape management strategies involving all stakeholders for conservation of ecologically fragile WG. This will enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon and climate moderation, with the sustenance of ecosystem goods and services.

TI  - Predominant Sea Ice Fracture Zones Around Antarctica and Their Relation to Bathymetric Features
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is of substantial importance for the Southern Ocean, as it insulates the relatively warm ocean from the cold atmosphere. Due to mechanical stress induced by wind and ocean currents, sea ice leads occur, which are characterized by open water and thin ice causing an increase of energy and moisture fluxes between ocean and atmosphere. Furthermore, they contribute to the ice production and provide a habitat for animals. Thus, it is important to gain information about the temporal and spatial distribution of leads on a circum-Antarctic scale. So far, no operational data set exists, which provides such information. We use thermal satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer to derive the predominant lead patterns for 2003-2018, April-September. This study provides first results for the long-term average lead frequencies in the Southern Ocean and discusses possible links to ocean currents, tides, and the bathymetry.Plain Language Summary The polar regions are strongly influenced by sea ice, which covers large areas of the ocean's surface. Interacting with the atmosphere and the ocean, sea ice is a very dynamic surface with a large temporal and spatial variability. Under the forcing of winds and ocean currents, sea ice is subject to deformation processes causing cracks (leads) in the ice. The observation of these leads is the aim of this study since they are an important feature. For instance, open water can be found in these cracks, which enables the warm ocean (-1.7 degrees C) to lose energy to the cold atmosphere. Also, sea ice forms a habitat for animals. In this study, the focus is on the Southern Hemisphere where sea ice surrounds the Antarctic continent. For the winter months, we use thermal infrared satellite images where leads appear as warm, almost linear features compared to the cold ice cover. By using computer algorithms, the cracks are detected automatically. This is the first study that shows these features in the Southern Ocean. Leads not only exist close to the coastline but also tend to appear offshore with characteristic spatial patterns. Therefore, possible links to ocean currents, tides, and bathymetry are discussed.Key PointsWe present the first long-term observed daily Antarctic sea ice leads based on MODIS TIR imagery from 2003-2018 Sea-ice leads occur along the shelf break and are associated with the Southern Ocean Bathymetry Sea ice leads are predominantly found in regions of enhanced tidal divergence

TI  - Multisensor validation of tidewater glacier flow fields derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity tracking
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the general warming trend in Greenland, an increase in calving rates, retreat and ice flow has been observed at ocean-terminating outlet glaciers. These changes contribute substantially to the current mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In order to constrain models of ice dynamics as well as estimates of mass change, detailed knowledge of geometry and ice flow is needed, in particular on the rapidly changing tongues of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers. In this study, we validate velocity estimates and spatial patterns close to the calving terminus of such an outlet derived from an iterative offset-tracking method based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity data with a collection of three independent reference measurements of glacier flow. These reference datasets are comprised of measurements from differential GPS, a terrestrial radar interferometer (TRI) and repeated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. Our approach to SAR velocity processing aims at achieving a relatively fine grid spacing and a high temporal resolution in order to best resolve the steep velocity gradients in the terminus area and aims to exploit the 12 d repeat interval of the single-satellite Sentinel-1A sensor. Results from images of the medium-sized ocean-terminating outlet glacier Eqip Sermia acquired by Sentinel-1A and RADARSAT-2 exhibit a mean difference of 11.5 % when compared to the corresponding GPS measurements. An areal comparison of our SAR velocity fields with independently generated velocity maps from TRI and UAV surveys showed good agreement in magnitude and spatial patterns, with mean differences smaller than 0.7 md(-1). In comparison with existing operational velocity products, our SAR-derived velocities show an improved spatial velocity pattern near the margins and calving front. There 8 % to 30 % higher surface ice velocities are produced, which has implications on ice fluxes and on mass budget estimates of similarly sized outlet glaciers. Further, we show that offset tracking from SAR intensity data at relatively low spatio-temporal sampling intervals is a valid method to derive glacier flow fields for fast-flowing glacier termini of outlet glaciers and, given the repeat period of 12 d of the Sentinel-1A sensor (6 d with Sentinel-1B), has the potential to be applied operationally in a quasi-continuous mode.

TI  - A LiDAR-optical data fusion approach for identifying and measuring small stream impoundments and dams
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines a semi-autonomous approach for using a fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and optical remote sensing data to identify and measure small impoundments (SIs) and their dams. Quantifying such water bodies as hydrologic network features is critical for ecosystem and species conservation, emergency management, and water resource planning; however, such features are incompletely mapped at national and state levels. By merging an airborne LiDAR-derived point cloud with a normalized water index using airborne optical imagery we demonstrate an improvement upon single-source methods for identifying these water bodies; classification accuracies increased over 10% by using this multi-source fusion method. Furthermore, the method presented here illustrates a cost-effective pathway to improve the National Inventory of Dams (NID) and includes a framework for estimating dam heights, with results showing strong correlations between derived dam heights and those recorded in the NID (r=.78). With the steady increase in available LiDAR coverage, the 87,000+ dams in the NID could be updated using this technique, a method which could also be expanded for global inventories of SIs and dams.

TI  - Recent glacier and lake changes in High Mountain Asia and their relation to precipitation changes
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an updated, spatially resolved estimate of 2003-2008 glacier surface elevation changes for the entire region of High Mountain Asia (HMA) from ICESat laser altimetry data. The results reveal a diverse pattern that is caused by spatially greatly varying glacier sensitivity, in particular to precipitation availability and changes. We introduce a spatially resolved zonation where ICESat samples are grouped into units of similar glacier behaviour, glacier type and topographic settings. In several regions, our new zonation reveals local differences and anomalies that have not been described previously. Glaciers in the Eastern Pamirs, Kunlun Shan and central TP were thickening by 0.10.7 m a(-1) , and the thickening anomaly has a crisp boundary in the Eastern Pamirs that continues just north of the central Karakoram. Glaciers in the south and east of the TP were thinning, with increasing rates towards southeast. We attribute the glacier thickening signal to a stepwise increase in precipitation around similar to 1997-2000 on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The precipitation change is reflected by growth of endorheic lakes in particular in the northern and eastern TP. We estimate lake volume changes through a combination of repeat lake extents from Landsat data and shoreline elevations from ICESat and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) for over 1300 lakes. The rise in water volume contained in the lakes corresponds to 4-25 mm a(-1) , when distributed over entire catchments, for the areas where we see glacier thickening. The precipitation increase is also visible in sparse in situ measurements and MERRA-2 climate reanalysis data but less visible in ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Taking into account evaporation loss, the difference between average annual precipitation during the 1990s and 2000s suggested by these datasets is 34-100 mm a(-1) , depending on region, which can fully explain both lake growth and glacier thickening (Kunlun Shan) or glacier geometry changes such as thinning tongues while upper glacier areas were thickening or stable (eastern TP). The precipitation increase reflected in these glacier changes possibly extended to the northern slopes of the Tarim Basin, where glaciers were nearly in balance in 2003-2008. Along the entire Himalaya, glaciers on the first orographic ridge, which are exposed to abundant precipitation, were thinning less than glaciers in the dryer climate of the inner ranges. Thinning rates in the Tien Shan vary spatially but are rather stronger than in other parts of HMA.

TI  - Variation in the dielectric constant of limestone with temperature
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dielectric constant is an important characteristic of limestone. It is significant in engineering applications and in the interpretation and recognition of remote sensing data. Therefore, it is important to understand how the dielectric constant of limestone varies with temperature. In this study, the dielectric constants of limestone samples were measured during heating to 25 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 200 degrees C, 300 degrees C, and 400 degrees C in a furnace. The results show that the dielectric constant of limestone decreases with temperature increase, with the decrease becoming more rapid over 300 degrees C.

TI  - Assessment and prediction of urban growth for a mega-city using CA-Markov model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of World's mega-cities are facing high population growth. To accommodate the increased population, new built-up areas are emerging at the periphery or fringe area of cities. New urbanisation has an adverse impact on the existing Land Use Land Cover (LULC). To monitor and analyse the impact of urbanisation, LULC change analysis has become the primary concern for LULC monitoring agencies. In this study, LULC change of Chennai has been assessed during 1981-2011 using temporal Landsat data. All the dataset has been classified using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Quantitative change in LULC has been carried out using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, Transition Potential Matrix, Land Use Dynamic Degree and MLC. Further, spatio-temporal change analysis has been performed using Post-classification comparison technique. Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) Model used for LULC prediction for 2021-2051. The urban area of Chennai has increased from 40.74 to 103.52 km(2) during 1981-2011. Further, LULC prediction using the CA-Markov model shows that the urban area of Chennai district may increase from 103.52 to 140.79 km(2) during 2011-2051. During the period 1981-2051, the prediction model indicates that mostly vegetation and barren land will be converted into urban land class.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Change in Selected Municipalities and Cities of Nueva Ecija Using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing Technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an effort has been made to assess the changes in land cover in some municipalities and cities of Nueva Ecija. The study was carried out through remote sensing and GIS approach using Landsat Images (Landsat 4 TM, Land Sat 7 ETM+, Landsat 5 TM, and Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS). For this purpose, a supervised classification technique was applied to Landsat images acquired in 1989 to 2018. Results indicated that land cover changes have occurred in agricultural, urban, and forestry areas which happened in the study areas from 1989 to 2018. Urban areas, although covering a much smaller proportion of the landscape/land cover in both time periods, increased at a much higher rate than any other land cover classes. The increase in agricultural and urban areas mostly result in deforestation, which means some forest areas were removed and converted to agriculture and settlement in the municipalities/cities.

TI  - Field scale wheat LAI retrieval from multispectral Sentinel 2A-MSI and LandSat 8-OLI imagery: effect of atmospheric correction, image resolutions and inversion techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the effect of atmospheric correction algorithms, inversion techniques and image spatial and spectral resolution on wheat crop LAI retrieval using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI imagery. The LAI retrievals were validated with in-situ measurements collected in farmers' fields. The MSI-based LAI retrievals improved significantly when images were atmospherically corrected using MODTRAN than using the libRadtran code. Among the two PROSAIL inversion approaches, look-up table outperforms artificial neural network for LAI retrievals. Using the best strategy of atmospheric correction and inversion, the effect of spatial resolution from 20 m (MSI) to 30 m (OLI) while using common six bands, showed non-significant improvement in LAI retrievals. The inclusion of additional two red-edge bands as available in MSI significantly reduced the uncertainly in LAI retrievals over that obtained by using six bands, while inclusion of only additional VNIR band did not show any significant effect on LAI retrievals.

TI  - A genetic algorithm based approach to estimate the volume of a drinking water reservoir in Chennai city, South India, using multi-spectral satellite images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is concerned with the use of satellite image processing and remote sensing approaches to determine the water-spread area and capacity of a drinking water reservoir in Poondi, near Chennai City, south India. Estimation of water-spread area and volume of the reservoirs using traditional methods like field surveys, acoustic surveys and hydrographic surveys is time-consuming, laborious and expensive. To overcome these problems, many researchers have used satellite images and the per-pixel (hard classification), the sub-pixel (soft classification) and the super resolution mapping approaches. The conventional hard and soft classification approaches do not give accurate results due to the presence of mixed pixels in the image scene of the periphery of the reservoir. In this work, a per-pixel algorithm (Maximum Likelihood), a sub-pixel algorithm (Fuzzy C Means) and a super resolution mapping algorithm (Genetic algorithm) are developed and the water-spread area is estimated for the reservoir using multi-date Landsat8 OLI images. The volume of the reservoir at different water levels are estimated using the water-spread area and the Trapezoidal formula. The capacity estimated from satellite image-derived area is compared with the capacity data obtained from the Poondi reservoir authority. The error in estimation due to the per-pixel approach is 16.74%, while it is 9.06% for the sub-pixel approach and a mere 3.25% for the super-resolution approach. Thus, the super-resolution mapping approach results in minimum error when compared to the sub-pixel approach which in turn gives lesser error result when comparing with the per-pixel approach.

TI  - The Role of the Amazon River Plume on the Intensification of the Hydrological Cycle
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon River low-salinity plume takes part in important ocean and atmosphere processes that influence climate. In the last three decades, the intensification of the hydrological cycle has increased the interannual variability of total freshwater discharged into the ocean. However, the feedback mechanisms of the Amazon River plume acting on this intensification are not fully understood. Correlation maps and multiple regression analysis applied to 16 years of satellite data and river flow measurements indicate that a positive precipitation trend of 15 mm/year in the western Amazon basin follows the long-term warming of the tropical Atlantic. This increased the total amount of freshwater discharged into the ocean and reduced the Amazon River plume salinity by 3.5% per year in the main plume water export pathway. Based on these results we propose a process-oriented model of the feedback process that explains the intensification of the Amazon hydrological cycle.

TI  - Nationwide randomised trial evaluating elective neck dissection for early stage oral cancer (SEND study) with meta-analysis and concurrent real-world cohort
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines remain unclear over whether patients with early stage oral cancer without overt neck disease benefit from upfront elective neck dissection (END), particularly those with the smallest tumours.METHODS: We conducted a randomised trial of patients with stage T1/T2 N0 disease, who had their mouth tumour resected either with or without END. Data were also collected from a concurrent cohort of patients who had their preferred surgery. Endpoints included overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We conducted a meta-analysis of all six randomised trials.RESULTS: Two hundred fifty randomised and 346 observational cohort patients were studied (27 hospitals). Occult neck disease was found in 19.1% (T1) and 34.7% (T2) patients respectively. Five-year intention-to-treat hazard ratios (HR) were: OS HR = 0.71 (p = 0.18), and DFS HR = 0.66 (p = 0.04). Corresponding per-protocol results were: OS HR = 0.59 (p = 0.054), and DFS HR = 0.56 (p = 0.007). END was effective for small tumours. END patients experienced more facial/neck nerve damage; QoL was largely unaffected. The observational cohort supported the randomised findings. The meta-analysis produced HR OS 0.64 and DFS 0.54 (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: SEND and the cumulative evidence show that within a generalisable setting oral cancer patients who have an upfront END have a lower risk of death/recurrence, even with small tumours.

TI  - Elevational contrast in predation and parasitism risk to caterpillars in a tropical rainforest
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Invertebrate predators and parasitoids are among the most important natural enemies of insect herbivores. Yet, the strength of natural enemy pressure along an altitudinal gradient and interactions between the groups of natural enemies (such as predation on parasitized prey) are not well known. Various methods are used to reveal the mortality factors of herbivores. Predation pressure is usually assessed through exposure of artificial prey. However, this method cannot provide information about the attacks of parasitoids, or their eventual interactions with predators. Furthermore, artificial or dead prey might not attract predators because they do not show expected host behavior, and this method mostly cannot distinguish between predation and scavenging. For the first time in a tropical rainforest, we quantified elevational contrast in mortality factors using exposure of live caterpillars. We exposed a total of 800 live caterpillars of Talanga excelsalis moresbyensis Strand (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) on saplings of Ficus copiosa Steud. (Moraceae) at two elevations in primary tropical rain forest in Papua New Guinea (200 and 1 200 m a.s.l.). We exposed the caterpillars in two treatments: exposed to and protected from invertebrate predators and parasitoids. Disappearance of caterpillars was significantly higher in the exposed treatment. Furthermore, caterpillar disappearance was significantly higher in lowlands than in highlands (43 vs. 12%). We consider the vast majority of the disappearance to be due to predation, as migration of the caterpillars from the focal trees was not observed (except one caterpillar). This estimate of invertebrate predation rate corresponds with studies which used artificial caterpillar models. No significant difference in parasitism rate between the two elevations was observed (12 vs. 13%). The combination of the disappearance and parasitism rate patterns means that larval parasitoids face stronger pressure from invertebrate predators through higher predation of their hosts in the lowlands than in the highlands.

M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that originates from cells of the melanocytic lineage and is associated with an invasive growth pattern and early spread. Besides endogenous risk factors such as fair skin type or genetic disposition for the formation of multiple nevi, exposure to ultraviolet light is the most important exogenous risk factor. Treatment of patients with primary tumors includes the complete excision of the primary lesion with appropriate safety margins and in patients with an increased risk of metastasis sentinel lymph node excision. Prognostically significant parameters are the Breslow invasion depth, ulceration of the primary lesion, and sentinel lymph node status. Systemic therapy plays an important role in the adjuvant setting and for inoperable tumors. Depending on the indication and the molecular profile of the tumor tissue, immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted kinase inhibitors can be used and may result in a significant prolongation of survival times.

TI  - Detection and Analysis of Coal Fire in Jharia Coalfield (JCF) Using Landsat Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal fires are common and serious problem in most of the coal producing countries of the world. In India, Jharia Coalfield (JCF) has one of the dense surface-subsurface coal fires in the world. The paper presents a case study of fire mapping and its propagation dynamics of JCF during 2001 to 2016 using Landsat data at consecutive 5 year interval. The study reveals that there are three distinct zones of fire in JCF viz., Eastern zone (Rajapur, Lodna, Kustore, Eastern Jharia, Bastacola, Chasnala (IISCO) and Bhowrah), Western Zone (Barora area of Shatabdi, Muraidih open cast mines) and Central zone (Kustor, Tisra, Bhulanbarari, Gonudih Khas Kusunda Colliery (GKKC), Sijua and Modidih colliery). The maximum temperature observed from Landsat data in JCF for years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 is 50 degrees C, 53 degrees C, 57.5 degrees C and 56.5 degrees C, respectively. In the year 2016, the eastern part of JCF was relatively more affected by coal fire than the western part, showing prevalence of major surface and subsurface coal fire. The same trend was maintained from 2001 to 2016. The total fire area is 8.85 km(2), 9.34 km(2), 9.78 km(2), 8.42 km(2) in the years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016, respectively. The total fire area is reduced by 0.43 km(2) (from 8.85 to 8.42 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.

TI  - Mercury in Populations of River Dolphins of the Amazon and Orinoco Basins
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Amazon and Orinoco basins, mercury has been released from artisanal and industrial gold mining since the Colonial time, as well as a result of deforestation and burning of primary forest, that release natural deposits of methyl mercury, affecting the local aquatic vertebrate fauna. This study reports the presence of mercury in river dolphins' genera Inia and Sotalia. Mercury concentrations were analysed in muscle tissue samples collected from 46 individuals at the Arauca and Orinoco Rivers (Colombia), the Amazon River (Colombia), a tributary of the Itenez River (Bolivia) and from the Tapajos River (Brazil). Ranges of total mercury (Hg) concentration in muscle tissue of the four different taxa sampled were: I. geoffrensis humboldtiana 0.003-3.99 mg kg(-1) ww (n = 21, M-e = 0.4), I. g. geoffrensis 0.1-2.6 mg kg(-1) ww (n = 15, M-e = 0.55), I. boliviensis 0.03-0.4 mg kg(-1) ww (n = 8, M-e = 0.1) and S. fluviatilis 0.1-0.87 mg kg(-1) ww (n = 2, M-e = 0.5). The highest Hg concentration in our study was obtained at the Orinoco basin, recorded from a juvenile male of I. g. humboldtiana (3.99 mg kg(-1) ww). At the Amazon basin, higher concentrations of mercury were recorded in the Tapajos River (Brazil) from an adult male of I. g. geoffrensis (2.6 mg kg(-1) ww) and the Amazon River from an adult female of S. fluviatilis (0.87 mg kg(-1) ww). Our data support the presence of total Hg in river dolphins distributed across the evaluated basins, evidencing the role of these cetaceans as sentinel species and bioindicators of the presence of this heavy metal in natural aquatic environments.

TI  - Hepcidin mediates hypoferremia and reduces the growth potential of bacteria in the immediate post-natal period in human neonates
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Septicemia is a leading cause of death among neonates in low-income settings, a situation that is deteriorating due to high levels of antimicrobial resistance. Novel interventions are urgently needed. Iron stimulates the growth of most bacteria and hypoferremia induced by the acute phase response is a key element of innate immunity. Cord blood, which has high levels of hemoglobin, iron and transferrin saturation, has hitherto been used as a proxy for the iron status of neonates. We investigated hepcidin-mediated redistribution of iron in the immediate post-natal period and tested the effect of the observed hypoferremia on the growth of pathogens frequently associated with neonatal sepsis. Healthy, vaginally delivered neonates were enrolled in a cohort study at a single center in rural Gambia (N = 120). Cord blood and two further blood samples up to 96 hours of age were analyzed for markers of iron metabolism. Samples pooled by transferrin saturation were used to conduct ex-vivo growth assays with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia. A profound reduction in transferrin saturation occurred within the first 12 h of life, from high mean levels in cord blood (47.6% (95% CI 43.7-51.5%)) to levels at the lower end of the normal reference range by 24 h of age (24.4% (21.2-27.6%)). These levels remained suppressed to 48 h of age with some recovery by 96 h. Reductions in serum iron were associated with high hepcidin and IL-6 levels. Ex-vivo growth of all sentinel pathogens was strongly associated with serum transferrin saturation. These results suggest the possibility that the hypoferremia could be augmented (e.g. by mini-hepcidins) as a novel therapeutic option that would not be vulnerable to antimicrobial resistance. Trial registration: The original trial in which this study was nested is registered at ISRCTN, number 93854442.

TI  - An integrated approach to estimate surface soil moisture in agricultural lands
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 data were used to retrieve soil moisture from top soil surface (0-5 cm depth) at agricultural land (area under wheat crop). After pre-processing of satellite data and removal of vegetation influence (sigma degrees(veg)) using Water Cloud Model (WCM), total backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees(total)) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to simulate backscattering from soil (sigma degrees(soil)). Modified Dubois Model (MDM) and Topp's Model were used to retrieve soil moisture using epsilon. Further, modelled soil moisture was evaluated using in situ soil moisture measurements and a Time Domain Reflectometer during Sentinel-1 overpass (24 January, 25 February and 13 March 2018). Statistical tests showed that an integrated approach has potential to improve soil moisture estimates over the vegetated/cropped area for agricultural and hydrological studies.

TI  - Repeated mosquito net distributions, improved treatment, and trends in malaria cases in sentinel health facilities in Papua New Guinea
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN), improved diagnosis and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) have reduced malaria prevalence in Papua New Guinea since 2008. Yet, national incidence trends are inconclusive due to confounding effects of the scale-up of rapid diagnostic tests, and inconsistencies in routine reporting. Methods Malaria trends and their association with LLIN and ACT roll-out between 2010 and 2014 in seven sentinel health facilities were analysed. The analysis included 35,329 fever patients. Intervention effects were estimated using regression models. Results Malaria incidence initially ranged from 20 to 115/1000 population; subsequent trends varied by site. Overall, LLIN distributions had a cumulative effect, reducing the number of malaria cases with each round (incidence rate ratio ranging from 0.12 to 0.53 in five sites). No significant reduction was associated with ACT introduction. Plasmodium falciparum remained the dominant parasite in all sentinel health facilities. Resurgence occurred in one site in which a shift to early and outdoor biting of anophelines had previously been documented. Conclusions LLINs, but not ACT, were associated with reductions of malaria cases in a range of settings, but sustainability of the gains appear to depend on local factors. Malaria programmes covering diverse transmission settings such as Papua New Guinea must consider local heterogeneity when choosing interventions and ensure continuous monitoring of trends.

TI  - Recurrence of retained placenta in multiple consecutive deliveries
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Retained placenta is a leading cause of maternal hemorrhage. A history of retained placenta is a well-recognized risk factor for recurrence; however, recurrence risk pattern has not been previously described. We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal recurrence pattern of retained placenta in multiple consecutive deliveries. Methods: This is a retrospective computerized base study conducted at Shaare Zedek Medical Center, a university-affiliated hospital, between 2005 and 2018. Medical records of parturient who had at least one coded diagnosis of either retained partial or complete placenta were retrieved. The first delivery with retained placenta diagnosis was chosen as the index delivery. In order to account for dependency between deliveries of the same individual parturient, we used a multivariate binary logistic regression with generalized estimating equation (GEE) to calculate the individual recurrence risk, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval). Results: During the study period, we identified 2177 parturient diagnosed with retained placenta in the index delivery and that had at least one subsequent delivery; overall 300 (13.8%) parturient had at least one subsequent event of retained placenta: 9.3% for the subsequent delivery and 6% in later deliveries. Induction of labor and epidural analgesia either in the index or in the subsequent delivery were found to be independently associated with recurrence 1.61 (1.16-2.24), 1.45 (1.10-1.90) and 1.46 (1.11-1.93), 1.82 (1.45-2.28), respectively. Complete and not partial retained placenta in the index delivery was also found to be independently associated with recurrence 4.90 (3.90-6.32). Conclusion: For the individual parturient, an event of retained placenta is a sentinel of the subsequent deliveries and has modifiable recurrence risks.

TI  - CT lymphography for sentinel lymph node mapping of clinically N0 early oral cancer
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The objectives of this retrospective study were to evaluate the usefulness of computed tomography lymphography (CTL) and to clarify the optimal timing of CTL in sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping of clinically N0 early oral cancer. Methods Twenty patients with clinically N0 early oral cancer underwent CTL with a 128 multi-detector row CT scanner to detect SLN the day before resection of primary tumor and SLN biopsy with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence guidance. CT scanning was performed in the first 10 patients at 2, 5, and 10 min after submucosal injection of iopamidol and in the remaining 10 patients at 2, 3.5, 5, and 10 min after the injection of contrast medium. We evaluated the SLN detection rate at each scan timing and the number and location of SLNs. We evaluated whether CTL-enhanced SLNs could be identified intraoperatively as ICG fluorescent lymph nodes. Results SLNs were detected by CTL in 19 of the 20 patients (95.0%), and the mean number of SLNs was 2 (range, 1-4). All SLNs were located on the ipsilateral side; 35 of 37 SLNs were located at level I and II, and 2 SLNs were lingual lymph nodes. All SLNs could be detected 2 min and 3.5-5 min after contrast medium injection, and CTL-enhanced SLNs could be identified intraoperatively as fluorescent lymph nodes. Conclusions CTL could facilitate the detection of SLNs in early oral cancer, and the optimal timing of CT scanning was at 2 and 5 min after injection of contrast medium.

TI  - Usefulness of real-time elastography for diagnosing lymph node metastasis of skin cancer: does elastography potentially eliminate the need for sentinel lymph node biopsy in squamous cell carcinoma?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor for overall survival of skin cancer patients. The sonographic technique of freehand real-time tissue elastography (RTE), which displays tissue rigidity as a colour overlay of the tissue image, was developed. Objective Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of RTE for detecting lymph node metastases of skin cancer non-invasively before operation. Methods We first selected lymph nodes of skin cancer patients which had already been diagnosed by biopsy as being reactive or metastatic, and then retrospectively collected images of RTE and B-mode and colour Doppler ultrasound on those lymph nodes performed preoperatively. Twenty-one lymph nodes from 12 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 23 lymph nodes from 14 patients with malignant melanoma (MM) and 14 lymph nodes from six patients with extramammary Paget disease (Paget) were investigated. Elastographic images were assessed on a scale of one to four according to the percentage of high elasticity (hard) area (HEA) in the lymph node. Results In all three skin cancers, lymph nodes evaluated as grade 3 or 4 by RTE were metastatic. All lymph nodes evaluated as grade 1 or 2 by RTE were reactive in SCC, whereas some lymph nodes evaluated as grade 1 or 2 were metastatic in MM and Paget. Conclusion Real-time tissue elastography may aid in distinguishing reactive lymph nodes from metastatic ones especially in SCC.

TI  - The Arts and Tools for Using Routine Health Data to Establish HIV High Burden Areas: The Pilot Case of KwaZulu-Natal South Africa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To optimally allocate limited health resources in responding to the HIV epidemic, South Africa has undertaken to generate local epidemiological profiles identifying high disease burden areas. Central to achieving this, is the need for readily available quality health data linked to both large and small geographic areas. South Africa has relied on national population-based surveys: the Household HIV Survey and the National Antenatal Sentinel HIV and Syphilis Prevalence Survey (ANC) amongst others for such data for informing policy decisions. However, these surveys are conducted approximately every 2 and 3 years creating a gap in data and evidence required for policy. At subnational levels, timely decisions are required with frequent course corrections in the interim. Routinely collected HIV testing data at public health facilities have the potential to provide this much needed information, as a proxy measure of HIV prevalence in the population, when survey data is not available. The South African District health information system (DHIS) contains aggregated routine health data from public health facilities which is used in this article. Methods: Using spatial interpolation methods we combine three "types" of data: (1) 2015 gridded high-resolution population data, (2) age-structure data as defined in South Africa mid-year population estimates, 2015; and (3) georeferenced health facilities HIV-testing data from DHIS for individuals (15-49 years old) who tested in health care facilities in the district in 2015 to delineate high HIV disease burden areas using density surface of either HIV positivity and/or number of people living with HIV (PLHIV). For validation, we extracted interpolated values at the facility locations and compared with the real observed values calculating the residuals. Lower residuals means the Inverse Weighted Distance (IDW) interpolator provided reliable prediction at unknown locations. Results were adjusted to provincial published HIV estimates and aggregated to municipalities. Uncertainty measures map at municipalities is provided. Data on major cities and roads networks was only included for orientation and better visualization of the high burden areas. Results: Results shows the HIV burden at local municipality level, with high disease burden in municipalities in eThekwini, iLembe and uMngundgudlovu; and around major cities and national routes. Conclusion: The methods provide accurate estimates of the local HIV burden at the municipality level. Areas with high population density have high numbers of PLHIV. The analysis puts into the hand of decision makers a tool that they can use to generate evidence for HIV programming. The method allows decision makers to routinely update and use facility level data in understanding the local epidemic.

TI  - Compact models for adaptive sampling in marine robotics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding high-value locations for in situ data collection is of substantial importance in ocean science, where diverse bio-physical processes interact to create dynamically evolving phenomena. These cover a variable spatial extent, and are sparse and difficult to predict. Autonomous robotic platforms can sustain themselves in harsh conditions with persistent presence, but require deployment at the correct place and time. To that end, we consider the use of remote sensing data for building compact models that can improve skill in predicting sub-mesoscale features and inform onboard sampling. The model enables prediction of regional patterns based on sparse in situ data, a capability that is essential in regions where use of satellite remote sensing in real time is often limited by cloud cover. Our model is based on classification of sea-surface temperature (SST) images, but the technique is general across any remotely sensed parameter. Images having similar magnitude and spatial patterns are grouped into a compact set of conditional means representing the dominant states. The classification is unsupervised and uses a combination of dictionary learning and hierarchical clustering. The method is demonstrated using SST images from Monterey Bay, California. The consistency of the classification result is verified and compared with oceanographic forcing using historical wind measurements. The established model is then shown to work in a real application using measurements from an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), together with forecast and sampling strategies. Finally an analysis of the model prediction error is presented and compared across different paths and survey duration.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection within non-stationary and unequally spaced remote sensing time series has become a key methodology for a broad range of environmental applications. A new method of analysing vegetation variation over lands is proposed. Four regions in northern Tunisia with various characteristics are selected, and a non-stationary and unequally spaced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series is obtained for each region since 2000. The Landsat 7 remote sensing satellite imagery with insignificant cloud-shadow coverage is used to calculate the NDVI after atmospheric correction. The Least-Squares Wavelet (LSWAVE) software is implemented to rigorously analyse each NDVI time series and study the relationship between the vegetation of olive trees and temperature/precipitation in one of the regions. To investigate possible effects of temperature on the green cover caused by increasing water salinity, the coherency between the NDVI and sea surface temperature time series is also shown in the region of Lake Ichkeul in Tunisia.

TI  - Cross-comparison of cloud liquid water path derived from observations by two space-borne and one ground-based instrument in northern Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is one of the target atmospheric parameters retrieved remotely from ground-based and space-borne platforms using different observation methods and processing algorithms. Validation of LWP retrievals is a complicated task since a cloud cover is characterised by strong temporal and spatial variability while remote sensing methods have different temporal and spatial resolutions. An attempt has been made to compare and analyse the collocated LWP data delivered by two satellite instruments SEVIRI and AVHRR together with the data derived from microwave observations by the ground-based radiometer RPG-HATPRO. The geographical region of interest is the vicinity of St. Petersburg, Russia, where the RPG-HATPRO radiometer is operating. The study is focused on two problems. The first one is the so-called scale difference problem, which originates from dissimilar spatial resolutions of measurements. The second problem refers to the land-sea LWP gradient. The radiometric site is located 2.5 km from the coastline where the effects of the LWP gradient are pronounced. A good agreement of data obtained at the microwave radiometer location by all three instruments (HATPRO, SEVIRI, and AVHRR) during warm and cold seasons is demonstrated (the largest correlation coefficient 0.93 was detected for HATPRO and AVHRR datasets). The analysis showed no bias of the SEVIRI results with respect to HATPRO data and a large positive bias (0.013-0.017 kg m(-2)) of the AVHRR results for both warm and cold seasons. The analysis of LWP maps plotted on the basis of the SEVIRI and AVHRR measurements over land and water surfaces in the vicinity of St. Petersburg revealed the unexpectedly high LWP values delivered by AVHRR during the cold season over the Neva River bay and over the Saimaa Lake and the abnormal land-sea LWP gradient in these areas. For the detailed evaluation of atmospheric state and ice cover in the considered geographical regions during the periods of ground-based and satellite measurements, reanalysis data were used. It is shown that the most probable reason for the observed artefacts in the AVHRR measurements over water and ice surfaces is the coarse resolution of the land-sea and snow-ice masks used by the AVHRR retrieval algorithm. The influence of a cloud field inhomogeneity on the agreement between the satellite and the ground-based data is studied. For this purpose, the simple estimate of the LWP temporal variability is used as a measure of the spatial inhomogeneity. It has been demonstrated that both instruments are equally sensitive to the inhomogeneity of a cloud field despite the fact that they have different spatial resolutions.

TI  - Intercomparison of Snow Melt Onset Date Estimates From Optical and Microwave Satellite Instruments Over the Northern Hemisphere for the Period 1982-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust melt season timing and length estimates are important for hydrological and climatological applications; due to the large area and sparse in situ measurements, snow melt monitoring at the continental scale is only possible from satellites. We intercompared melt onset date (MOD) estimates obtained from optical and microwave satellite sensors over the Northern Hemisphere between 1982 and 2015 and subsequently analyzed the causes of the similarities and dissimilarities found. The optical satellite data are based on the mean surface albedo from the Satellite Application Facility for Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) CLouds, Albedo and RAdiation second release Surface ALbedo (CLARA-A2 SAL) data set. The microwave satellite data are based on temporal variations in the differences of the brightness temperature from satellite passive microwave radiometers. The analysis shows that the microwave-based method detects melt onset on average 10 days later than the albedo-based method, which results from the different melt detection methods; the albedo-based method observes the point when the spring snow metamorphism begins to have a detectable effect on snow albedo, whereas the microwave-based method detects the appearance of meltwater in snowpack. The difference in MOD decreases in forests, because canopy protects snow from sunlight delaying snow metamorphism. Additionally, we analyzed the MOD estimates for trends across the Northern Hemisphere and separately for Eurasia and North America. A statistically significant negative trend toward earlier melt onset exists in all cases, which is consistent with previous studies.

TI  - Combining Ground- and ASTER-Based Thermal Measurements to Constrain Fumarole Field Heat Budgets: The Case of Vulcano Fossa 2000-2019
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vulcano Fossa's fumarole field (Italy) has been active for more than a century and has become a well-studied benchmark for fumarolic degassing, often being considered the "model" hydrothermal system. Satellite thermal monitoring is increasingly being used to monitor such systems, so we here use Vulcano to test a new method for assessing heat flux at such systems. Our methodology involves converting ground-based vent temperature measurements to heat fluxes emitted by the fumaroles, with the diffuse heat flux obtained from satellite-sensor (in our case Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data. While diffuse heat losses were typically 9 MW, vent heat losses were 1 MW. The average total flux of 10 MW over the 19-year period of study places Vulcano in the top 20 most active hydrothermal systems globally. This work highlights the value of high spatial resolution infrared satellite data in building thermal inventories for persistently active hydrothermal systems.

TI  - Effects of land tenure and urbanization on the change of land use of cacao (<i>Theobroma cacao</i>) agroforestry systems in southeast Mexico
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Production of cacao and its products such as chocolate generate a global market. Despite demand, production has declined in a region historically important in the domestication of cacao in Mesoamerica. Chontalpa in southeast Mexico is an important area for cacao agroforestry systems, but a number of factors have affected current production, resulting in the elimination of many agroforestry systems. This study analyzes land use changes in the cacao production region of Tabasco State of SE Mexico using Landsat images from 2003 to 2016 to evaluate whether changes in cacao agroforestry systems into other land use forms are related to land tenure and distance to urban centers. Our results determined that land use changes were significantly lower in ejido lands, compared to other types of land tenure. A shorter distance to urban centers was associated with a higher probability of changing from cacao agroforestry systems to other land uses (grasslands, urban constructions). Members of young generations in the Chontalpa tend to move to urban centers that are continually growing at the expense of other land uses. Therefore, cacao agroforestry systems close to urban areas are more likely to change into this type of land use.

TI  - Development of Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval Algorithms for Geostationary Satellite Data (Himawari-8/AHI)
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides an overview of the development of sea surface temperature retrieval algorithms by using Himawari-8/AHI data as a proxy data of GK-2A with quite similar spectral bands except for 2.26-mu m and 1.38-mu m bands. For contingency preparation, several potential algorithms, such as Multi-channel SST (MCSST), Non-linear SST (NLSST), Hybrid SST, and Multi-band SST, were developed over the full disk region. The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed by determining the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias errors from the regression procedure of the matchup database between satellite data and quality controlled drifter temperature in-situ data for a year, from August 2016 to July 2017. Comparison of the four algorithms revealed that the Multi-band algorithm performed markedly well, with the smallest RMSE of similar to 0.4 degrees C. Time-varying validation of the estimated SST accuracy highlighted consistently low RMSE as well as the stability of the Multi-band algorithm. In addition, it is suggested that SSTs with a satellite zenith angle exceeding 60 degrees tended to have relatively large errors which degraded the quality of the estimated SSTs. It is concluded that the SST coefficients should be updated each day, based on the previous one-month matchup database, contributing to the expected SST accuracy in the future with the degradation of the sensor or other aging effects. Further, this work discusses the importance of cloudy or cloud-contaminated pixels for the better performance of SST retrieval procedures and their real-time operational use.

TI  - Gene expression comparison between primary triple-negative breast cancer and paired axillary and sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies examine the genomics of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The aim was to characterize and compare gene expression patterns of primary breast cancers and paired ALN metastases. Patients with stage 2-3 ER/PR negative, HER2 negative TNBC with ALN macrometastasis without neo-adjuvant therapy were selected. Tumor-specific area was isolated from breast and ALN tissue sections. Gene expression of 2567 cancer-associated genes was analyzed with the HTG EdgeSeq system coupled with Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS). Seventeen pairs of TNBC and autologous ALN metastasis were analyzed. Compared with the primary, ALN metastasis had 257 statistically significant differentially expressed genes, including 123 upregulated genes and 134 downregulated genes. Notably, there was an upregulation of anti-apoptosis and survival signaling genes (BIRC3, TCL1A, FLT3, and VCAM1) in the ALN metastasis. There was also an upregulation of chemotaxis genes (CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and TNFSF11). The most striking feature is the downregulation of genes known to regulate cell microenvironment interaction (MMP2, MMP 3, MMP 7, MMP 11, MMP14, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL6A6, COL11A1, and COL17A1). In TNBC, ALN metastases have a distinct gene expression profile. Genes associated with anti-apoptosis, survival responses, and chemotaxis are upregulated, and genes associated with regulation of extracellular matrix are downregulated when compared to autologous primary cancer. TNBC cells metastatic to lymph nodes undergo a change in order to metastasize and survive in the new microenvironment, which may lead to insights into the metastatic process.

TI  - Test of the RUSLE and Key Influencing Factors Using GIS and Probability Methods: A Case Study in Nanling National Nature Reserve, South China
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purposes of the study were to test the performance of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and to understand the key factors responsible for generating soil erosion in the Nanling National Nature Reserve (NNNR), South China, where soil erosion has become a very serious ecological and environmental problem. By combining the RUSLE and geographic information system (GIS) data, we first produced a map of soil erosion risk at 30 m-resolution pixel level with predicted factors. We then used consecutive Landsat 8 satellite images to obtain the spatial distribution of four types of soil erosion and carried out ground truth checking of the RUSLE. On this basis, we innovatively developed a probability model to explore the relationship between four types of soil erosion and the key influencing factors, identify high erosion area, and analyze the reason for the differences derived from the RUSLE. The results showed that the overall accuracy of image interpretation was acceptable, which could be used to represent the currently actual spatial distribution of soil erosion. Ground truth checking indicated some differences between the spatial distribution and class of soil erosion derived from the RUSLE and the actual situation. The performance of the RUSLE was unsatisfactory, producing differences and even some errors when used to estimate the ecological risks posed by soil erosion within the NNNR. We finally produced a probability table revealing the degree of influence of each factor on different types of soil erosion and quantitatively elucidated the reason for generating these differences. We suggested that soil erosion type and the key influencing factors should be identified prior to soil erosion risk assessment in a region.

TI  - Drying landscape and interannual herbivory-driven habitat degradation control semiaquatic mammal population dynamics
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiaquatic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) are in decline throughout their native range. We report on the environmental and behavioural mechanisms responsible for a half-century of muskrat decline in a model system floodplain region of the Peace-Athabasca Delta ("Delta"). Using the Landsat satellite record, trapping and population survey records, and ecological field studies of muskrat, we develop conceptual and quantitative models to investigate mechanisms driving muskrat population decline at Egg Lake, an archetypal Delta region. Simulation results show processes occurring over nested timescales control population decline: Multidecadal drying has diminished shoreline habitat, and inter-annual shoreline habitat deterioration resulted from excessive herbivory by muskrat thereby exacerbating their die-off. Simulations without herbivory feedback show peak population values up to 73% higher than simulations with herbivory. Simulation results also suggest that trapping is not the primary cause of declines in muskrat abundance. The process model highlights factors responsible for long-term decline and rapid die-off, providing insights into mechanisms for observed muskrat population decline.

TI  - A Semi-Empirical Split-Window Algorithm for Retrieving near Surface Air Temperature from MODIS Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to develop an effective algorithm to directly derive near surface air temperature from EOS/MODIS data. From a theoretical viewpoint, the split-window algorithm for retrieving near surface air temperature was developed based on the radiative transfer equation, which includes the calculation of atmospheric thermal radiance, the linearization of Planck functions, the transformation from effective atmospheric mean temperature to near surface air temperature and other derivation processes. Considering that the coefficients of the theoretical algorithm are highly dependent on the atmospheric profile, which is difficult to acquire in practical applications, a semi-empirical split-window algorithm is generated on the basis of the theoretical algorithm to improve the practicality. The semi-empirical algorithm was applied and validated in the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) Region and the Jiang-Zhe-Hu-Wan (JZHW) Region in China. Results indicate that the algorithm achieves an MAE of 2.11 degrees C in the JJJ Region and an MAE of 2.22 degrees C in the JZHW Region. The semi-empirical split-window algorithm also shows better stability than linear regression and machine learning methods when being applied to other data periods. Due to its accuracy and simplicity, the semi-empirical split-window algorithm is a novel method for retrieving near surface air temperature from MODIS thermal bands.

TI  - A quantitative method to decompose SWE differences between regional climate models and reanalysis datasets
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The simulation of snow water equivalent (SWE) remains difficult for regional climate models. Accurate SWE simulation depends on complex interacting climate processes such as the intensity and distribution of precipitation, rain-snow partitioning, and radiative fluxes. To identify the driving forces behind SWE difference between model and reanalysis datasets, and guide model improvement, we design a framework to quantitatively decompose the SWE difference contributed from precipitation distribution and magnitude, ablation, temperature and topography biases in regional climate models. We apply this framework within the California Sierra Nevada to four regional climate models from the North American Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) run at three spatial resolutions. Models generally predict less SWE compared to Landsat-Era Sierra Nevada Snow Reanalysis (SNSR) dataset. Unresolved topography associated with model resolution contribute to dry and warm biases in models. Refining resolution from 0.44 degrees to 0.11 degrees improves SWE simulation by 35%. To varying degrees across models, additional difference arises from spatial and elevational distribution of precipitation, cold biases revealed by topographic correction, uncertainties in the rain-snow partitioning threshold, and high ablation biases. This work reveals both positive and negative contributions to snow bias in climate models and provides guidance for future model development to enhance SWE simulation.

TI  - Impact of urban greenspace spatial pattern on land surface temperature: a case study in Beijing metropolitan area, China
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Urban greenspace can significantly decrease the land surface temperature (LST). The spatial characteristics and vegetation composition of urban greenspace have a great influence on its cooling capacity. Objectives We sought to distinguish the cooling effect by different spatial pattern factors of greenspace and by the interaction of these factors, which may be useful in understanding cooling effect and designing urban greenspace. Methods Both the greenspace derived from SPOT6 and LST retrieved from Landsat-8 images are employed to identify the dominant factors influencing LST and investigate the interaction between any two dominant factors in the Beijing metropolitan area. Results The results indicate that the dominant spatial factors affecting LST vary by greenspace type, i.e., for grass, the number of patches (NP) and patch density (PD) have a significant effect on LST while for coniferous forest, the landscape shape index (LSI) is the dominant spatial factor. And the NP and percentage of landscape are the dominant spatial factors for broad-leaved forest and mixed forest, respectively. The interaction of any two dominant factors is larger than their individual effects, and the interaction between the NP and LSI of greenspace is not as strong as the interaction between the NP and PD. Conclusions Urban greenspace design and planning need to consider the spatial pattern of different types of greenspace. On this basis, we proposed a pattern effective in cooling LST in cities climatically similar to Beijing, which could provide theoretical reference for the design and planning of urban greenspace.

TI  - Impacts of Physical and Biological Processes on Spatial and Temporal Variability of Particulate Organic Carbon in the North Pacific Ocean during 2003-2017
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Pacific Ocean is a significant carbon sink region, but little is known about the dynamics of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the influences of physical and biological processes in this region at the basin scale. Here, we analysed high-resolution surface POC data derived from MODIS-Aqua during 2003-2017, together with satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll and temperature (SST). There are large spatial and temporal variations in surface POC in the North Pacific. Surface POC is much lower in the subtropical region (<50 mg m(-3)) than in the subarctic region (>100 mg m(-3)), primarily resulting from the south-to-north variability in biological production. Our analyses show significant seasonal and interannual variability in surface POC. In particular, there is one peak in winter-spring in the western subtropical region and two peaks in late spring and fall in the western subarctic region. Surface POC is positively correlated with chlorophyll (r = similar to 1) and negatively correlated with SST (r = similar to-0.45, P < 0.001) south of 45 degrees N, indicating the strong influence of physically driven biological activity on the temporal variability of POC in the subtropical region. There is a significantly positive but relatively lower correlation coefficient (0.6-0.8) between POC and chlorophyll and an overall non-significantly positive correlation between POC and SST north of 45 degrees N, reflecting the reduction in the POC standing stock due to the fast sinking of large particles. The climate modes of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have large impacts on POC in various seasons in the subtropical region and weak influences in the subarctic region. Surface POC was anomalously high after 2013 (increased by similar to 15%) across the basin, which might be the result of complex interactions of physical and biological processes associated with an anomalous warming event (the Blob).

TI  - Retrieving the microphysical properties of opaque liquid water clouds from CALIOP measurements
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud droplet effective radius (CER) and number concentration (CDNC) are two critical microphysical properties of liquid water clouds, which play essential roles in the Earth's radiative energy balance and atmospheric hydrological cycle. Even though many satellite remote sensing techniques have been developed to obtain these two properties, the observations are often limited to the daytime. In this study, a method to estimate CER and CDNC of liquid water clouds over global ocean area during both daytime and nighttime from CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) measurements is presented. The size sensitivity of the dual-wavelength (532 nm & 1064 nm) layer-integrated attenuated backscattering signals from CALIOP is checked and information content for liquid water cloud CER retrieval is found. Taking use of the artificial neural network (ANN) technique, the CER and then the CDNC are estimated from CALIOP by combining the polarization ratio and the dual wavelength attenuated backscattering signals. The comparisons with CER and CDNC estimated from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) during daytime demonstrate the feasibility of this new method. Both the daytime and nighttime CER and CDNC derived from CALIOP observations are presented in this paper and the day-night variation of liquid water cloud is discussed which would provide useful day-night variation of liquid water cloud properties.

In order to ameliorate the information, principal components analysis (PCA) and co-occurrence measurement algorithm were used for choosing bands and data transformation. Images differencing was applied on image pairs derived from classification to analyze sand encroachment evolution. All classifiers present enhanced performances, and revealed that area covered by sand was increased by 7%, 4.66% and 4.59% for ML, MD and SVM, respectively. Consequently, images differencing results confirmed that sand material increasing arise not only from coastal area contribution but also mostly from erosion of complicated sand dunes exist in the middle part of the studied area. Evaluating of the presented phenomenon dimensions and its consequences are extremely important to increase the local authorities awareness and mainly for avoiding or minimizing the consequences of the future sand dunes threats.

TI  - Effect of traditional check dams (<i>jessour</i>) on soil and olive trees water status in Tunisia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the arid regions of south eastern Tunisia, the land use is predominated by olive trees cropping, where two main cultivation strategies can be found: using of water harvesting techniques to overcome the scarcity and variability of rainfall (in the Matmatta mountains) and dryland farming (in the Jeffara plain). In these arid areas, soil moisture is the main limiting factor for crop growth and it should be monitored to benchmark different management options. Different conventional methods are available for point soil moisture monitoring, but the increased availability of remotely sensed data offers major opportunities for spatial analyses. The aim of this paper is to perform a comparative study on the soil water status for rainfed olive tree growing in three major landscape areas: in the mountains with traditional water harvesting check dams (called jessour), in the piedmont on floodwater harvesting (called tabias), and in the plain with full dryland farming conditions. Time series of Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), derived from Landsat 7 satellite, were retrieved from the novel Google Earth Engine platform. NDII values were related to measured soil water content, which was taken at non-regular time intervals between 2009 and 2017. The analysis of NDII data, indicating the water content of the vegetation, shows that jessour can adequately ensure water supply for olive trees. Increased soil moisture conditions in the jessour areas are visible both in the dry and the humid seasons, indicating the effectiveness of this traditional water harvesting system. Moreover, our results show that Landsat 7 NDII values are correlated with the root-zone soil moisture in the monitoring sites (r(2) ranging from 0.62 to 0.67), allowing the use of NDII to estimate soil water contents in our study area.

TI  - A kriging-calibrated machine learning method for estimating daily ground-level NO<sub>2</sub> in mainland China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is unclear how to develop a model based on the combined satellite data and ground monitoring data to accurately estimate daily NO2 levels. Furthermore, the conventional cross-validation (CV) results represent average levels but the model performance may vary greatly from grid to grid. It is an essential issue to evaluate model's prediction ability in different grids and determine the factors affecting model extrapolating ability, which have never been well examined to date.The aim of this study was to compare the ability of three different methods to estimate the daily NO2 across mainland China during 2014-2016; and to develop a novel two-stage meta-analysis method for exploring the influence of the number and the distribution of nearby sites on grid-level prediction accuracy.For better estimating the daily NO2 level, we developed and compared three methods, including universal kriging model, satellite-based method (Non-linear exposure-lag-response model & Extreme gradient boosting combined technique) and the kriging-calibrated satellite method. For exploring influencing factors, the two-stage meta-analysis method was purposed.The kriging-calibrated satellite method had an overall CV R-square and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.85 and 7.87 mu g/m(3), better than the Universal Kriging model and the satellite-based method (CV R-2 = 0.57 and 0.81). The two-stage meta-analysis method revealed that the model performance did decrease with the sparser distribution of nearby sites. And adding 5 sites within 50 km in the random mode can bring 17.51% improvement in model extrapolating ability.The kriging-calibration can help satellite-based machine learning to provide more accurate NO2 prediction. Our novel evaluation method can provide the suggestion of adding new sites effectively within a limit budget. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of meteorological factors and land use pattern on hydrological elements in a semi-arid basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The allocation of water resources to meet both human wellbeing and environmental requirements is a critical challenge in a semi-arid landscape. Hydrological models are widely used to understand the influence mechanism of hydrological elements, which is helpful for optimizing water resources management However, the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological dynamics has been largely omitted in prior studies, partly because it's difficult to correctly simulate the spatial distributions of hydrological elements due to roughly representing the surface biophysical parameters in the hydrological model. In this study, the Distributed Hydrological Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was incorporated with the high-resolution remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) data in a semi-arid basin, located in the upstream of the Xar Moron River Basin, to explore the impacts of meteorological factors (i.e., air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, shortwave radiation, and precipitation) and LAI on hydrological processes of forests, grasslands, and farmlands. Our results show that the spatial distribution of LAI slightly improves the accuracy of streamflow simulations and significantly promotes the model performance of spatial hydrological element simulations. For the area in study, precipitation, LAI, and relative humidity are the three major influential factors in the forest hydrological dynamics. The hydrological elements of grasslands and farmlands are mainly affected by shortwave radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, and LAI. Compared with grasslands and farmlands. LAI has greater negative influence on forest water availability. To mitigate the negative effects of drying and warming climate and promote ecosystems sustainability, the forest area should be converted into grassland while the native grassland should be maintained for soil water conservation.

TI  - Monitoring Mangrove forest landcover changes in the coastline of Bangladesh from 1976 to 2015
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used multi-date Landsat images to quantify mangrove cover changes in the whole of Bangladesh from 1976 to 2015. Images were pre-processed with an atmospheric correction using Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) and Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) using Pseudo-Invariant Features (PIFs). Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) classification map was generated using Maximum Likelihood (MaxLike) algorithm, indicating the areal extent of mangroves increased by 3.1% between 1976 and 2015, where 1.79% of this increase occurred between 2000 and 2015. Though mangrove areas remained almost constant in the Sundarbans, Chakaria Sundarbans has almost disappeared between 1976 and 1989. The overall accuracy of Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and L8 OLI classified images were 80%, 80%, 87%, and 97% respectively. The study also found deforestation, shrimp & salt farm, coastal erosion and sedimentation, and mangrove plantation could be responsible for mangrove changes in Bangladesh.

TI  - Assessment of Workforce Systems Preferences/ Skills Based on Employment Domain
T2  - ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the growing demand for a workforce with an understanding of system of systems, there is a need to assess an individual's systems thinking skills. This research was undertaken to address this need by measuring an individual's inclination to work on complex system problems based on their systems thinking score. This article investigates the correlation between employment domains and an individual's systems thinking preferences/skills. Results of this research show that each employment domain is significantly different in their systems thinking preferences/skills profiles as well as significantly different in how the employment domains perceive change and their system's worldview.

TI  - Construction and Application of Greedy Triangulation for Lidar Point-Cloud Data Based on Inverse-Distance-Weighted Interpolation
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The research on three-dimensional (31)) reconstruction after the processing of pointcloud data from airborne lidar has received considerable attention for a long time. Because of the deficiencies of greedy triangulation (GT) algorithm for the 31) reconstruction of stockpile point-cloud data, a GT algorithm based on inverse-distanceweighted interpolation is proposed herein. This proposed algorithm can obtain data of unmeasured arca; further, it can acquire uniform data by controlling the interpolation arca. The proposed GT algorithm is used for the 31) reconstruction of stockpile in the spot, and comparison experiments show that the proposed algorithm produces results that arc closer to reality and that it has strong application potential.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phthalates are widely used in several consumer products, including plastics, toys, cosmetics, and medical devices. Little is known about phthalate exposure in pet animals, however, even though they share an indoor environment with humans; this is the first study to measure such exposure. We measured 21 phthalate monoester metabolites (PhMs) in the wine of pet cats (n = 50) and dogs (n = 50) collected from New York State, USA. PhMs were widely detected in all samples, and 12 of 21 PhMs had detection frequencies (Dfs) >80%. The median urinary concentrations of total PhMs in pet cats and clogs were 630 ng/mL and 186 ng/mL, respectively. Monoethyl phthalate (mEP) was the most abundant compound in both cats and dogs. Phthalic acid (PA; a non-specific metabolite of phthalates) was found at very high concentrations in cats (median: 520 ng/mL). The estimated daily intake (EDI) and hazard quotient (HQ) for major phthalates in pets showed that DEHP exposures in cats and dogs were only 2-fold less than the US Environmental Protection Agency suggested reference dose (RID) for humans.

TI  - Final Analysis of DeCOG-SLT Trial: No Survival Benefit for Complete Lymph Node Dissection in Patients With Melanoma With Positive Sentinel Node
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSEWe have previously reported on the 3-year results of the phase III German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group trial (DeCOG; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02434107) comparing distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with positive sentinel lymph-node biopsy who were randomly assigned to complete lymph node dissection (CLND) or observation. Here, we report the final analysis with 72 months of median follow up.PATIENTS AND METHODSThe multicenter randomized phase III trial included patients with cutaneous melanoma of the trunk and extremities who were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo CLND or observation. DMFS was analyzed as the primary end point, and RFS, OS, and recurrences in the regional lymph node basin were secondary end points. The analysis was by intention to treat. Disease and survival information were collected quarterly.RESULTSFrom January 2006 to December 2014, 5,547 patients were screened to identify 1,256 with metastases in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Of these, 483 (39%) were included: 241 in the observation arm and 242 in the CLND arm. In the final analysis, median follow up was 72 months (interquartile range, 67-77 months). No significant treatment-related difference was seen in the 5-year DMFS between the observation and CLND arms (67.6% v 64.9%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; P = .87). The 5-year RFS and OS also showed no difference (HR, 1.01 and 0.99, respectively). Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects occurred in 32 patients (13%) in the CLND arm; lymphedema (n = 20) and delayed wound healing (n = 5) were most common and no serious adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONThe final results of the German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group trial with a median follow up of 72 months showed higher event rates, but similar HRs compared with those at the 3-year analysis. These results confirm that immediate CLND in SLN-positive patients is not superior to observation in terms of DMFS, RFS, or OS and support not recommending CLND in patients with SLN metastasis.

TI  - Strain penetration of high-strength steel bars anchored in reinforced concrete beam-column connections
T2  - STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING AND MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents experimental and analytical investigations on additional fixed-end rotations resulting from the strain penetration of high-strength reinforcement in reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column connections under monotonic loading. The experimental part included the test of 18 interior beam-column connections with straight long steel bars and 24 exterior beam-column connections with hooked and headed steel bars. Rebar strains along the anchorage length were recorded at the yielding and ultimate states. Furthermore, a numerical program was developed to study the effect of strain penetration in beam-column connections. The numerical results showed good agreement with the test results. Finally, 87 simulated specimens were designed with various parameters based on the test specimens. The effect of concrete compressive strength (f(c)), yield strength (f(y)), diameter (d(b)), and anchorage length (l(ah)) of the reinforcement in the beam-column connection was examined through a parametric study. The results indicated that additional fixed-end rotations increased with a decrease in fc and an increase in f(y), d(b) and l(ah). Moreover, the growth rate of additional fixed-end rotations at the yielding state was faster than that at the ultimate state when high-strength steel bars were used.

TI  - A comparative time series analysis and modeling of aerosols in the contiguous United States and China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term trend analysis and modeling of aerosol distribution is of paramount importance to study radiative forcing, climate change, and human health. Previous studies on spatiotemporal trend analysis have not fully considered the impact of spatial and temporal gaps of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) on precise aerosol characterization. In addition, very few studies analyzed inter-country aerosol variations, trends, driving forces, and predictions at the regional level, which is important to draw lessons from the experiences of one another. This study is focused on comparative time series analyses and modeling of aerosols over the contiguous United States (US.) and China during 2003-2015 using MODIS Collection 6 retrievals. An econometric model, namely autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), is employed to reproduce and predict AOD variability over U.S. and China. Results show that high AOD values are observed in the eastern part of US. and China. Temporal variations indicate that AODs reach their peak values in summer for both countries. A sustained negative AOD trend is present throughout the U.S. while a distinct spatial variation of AOD trend is exhibited in China. The large differences in variations and trends are closely linked to the energy strategies, economic and urban development, and lifestyle activities of these two countries. Time series modeling reveals that reasonably good performances are found in most parts of these two countries. In particular, the model replicates AOD time series that has clear seasonal variations with much more accuracy. The results suggest that areas most suitable for applying the model for prediction are those with high AOD quality, high completeness of AOD data, and low-AOD values. Overall, the satisfactory predicted results indicate the applicability and feasibility of the ARIMA modeling technique for accurately extracting AOD profiles, predicting future AOD values as well as extrapolating missed AOD values at the regional scale. The retrieved and predicted AOD values may serve as reliable estimates for air quality and epidemiological studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bioenergy and ecosystem services trade-offs and synergies in marginal agricultural lands: A remote-sensing-based assessment method
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing non-food crops in marginal lands has been proposed as a solution to avoid land competition with food production. Mapping marginal agricultural lands is therefore fundamental for the sustainable development of rural landscapes. This study proposes a method based on remote sensing data to identify marginal agricultural lands for the production of wood biomass, and analyse potential trade-offs and synergies between the new wood crops, food production, and Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by vegetation. The province of Rovigo (northern Italy) was chosen as a representative case study. Three classes of marginal agricultural lands were mapped through the use of the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI): i) abandoned or unused agricultural lands, ii) potentially poorly or non-managed croplands, and iii) potentially low productivity croplands. Results showed that marginal agricultural lands cover 1.7% of the agricultural areas of the province, and approximately 13,642 MWh yr(-1) of Second-Generation (2G) bioenergy can be produced in marginal agricultural areas while enhancing ES provided by vegetation, and avoiding any trade-off with food production. Since this energy potential covers just 8.4% of the total potential authorized in the province, the enhancement of ES could provide a suitable argument to support the conversion of marginal agricultural lands and increase the multifunctionality of the agricultural landscape.

TI  - The ligaments of counter-terrorism regime: sexual violence and the vicarious traumatisation of female non-governmental organisation workers: evidence from Nigeria
T2  - SMALL WARS AND INSURGENCIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a dearth of studies on indirect victims of sexual violence in counter-terrorism efforts. Using Nigeria as a case study, this paper argues that global and state-level counter-terrorism policies have generally failed to account for the psychological effects of the engagement of female NGO workers in counter-terrorism operations or mitigating the effects of terrorism in conflict zones. Specifically, there has been an increase in sexual violence perpetrated by some members of the security agencies involved in counter-terrorism operations in North-eastern Nigeria. As a result, female NGO workers carry out Medicare, psychosocial counselling and advocacy for these victims. Female NGO workers become exposed to the trauma of victims of sexual violence, which affects their mental health and thus performances in counter-terrorism activities in the country. This altered their worldview on issues of safety even among secured locations or among the presence of security agents and reinforced feelings of powerlessness.

TI  - Summer albedo variations in the Arctic Sea ice region from 1982 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal changes in the sea ice region albedo over the entire Arctic region and in eight subregions (the Central Arctic Ocean [CAO], the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas [BC], the East Siberian and Laptev Seas [ESL], Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea [BL], the Canadian Archipelago [CA], the Greenland Sea [GS], Hudson Bay [HB] and the Kara and Barents Seas [KB]) in the summer of 1982-2015 are analysed with CLARA-A2-SAL data. The results indicate that in the summer of 1982-2015, the Arctic Sea ice region albedo fluctuated with a downward trend of -1.6% per decade (significance level of 99%). The BC had the largest decline in the albedo trend of -2.7% per decade (significance level of 99%), and most other subregions had downward trends except the GS, which exhibited a slight upward trend. The mean Arctic Sea ice region albedo was 44%. The high albedo areas were mainly concentrated in the CAO and the vicinity of Greenland. The albedo decreased with decreasing latitude, while the low-value areas were mainly concentrated in the outer sea ice area. In the Arctic region, both the sea ice concentration (SIC) and the sea ice extent (SIE) showed a decreasing trend, while the near-surface air temperature (NSAT) and the summer Central Arctic Index (CAI) showed an increasing trend. The Arctic Sea ice region albedo was positively correlated with the SIC and the SIE (0.84, 0.78) and negatively correlated with the NSAT (-0.72), all with a statistical significance level of 99%. The correlation between sea ice region albedo and the summer CAI revealed different relationships in these regions. The BC and ESL had a significant negative correlation, and the GS showed a significant positive correlation. These findings indicated that the decrease in albedo is closely related to the reduction in Arctic Sea ice and the increase in air temperature. In addition, the sea ice region albedo variations in the BC, ESL and GS are also greatly influenced by atmospheric circulation.

TI  - Assessment of five satellite-derived LAI datasets for GPP estimations through ecosystem models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem models have been widely used for obtaining gross primary productivity (GPP) estimations at multiple scales. Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical variable in these models for describing the vegetation canopy structure and predicting vegetation-atmosphere interactions. However, the uncertainties in LAI datasets and the effects of their representation on simulated GPP remain unclear, especially over complex terrain. Here, five most popular datasets, namely the Long-term Global Mapping (GLOBMAP) LAI, Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI, Geoland2 version 1 (GEOV1) LAI, Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) LAl,and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI, were selected to examine the influences of LAI representation on GPP estimations at 95 eddy covariance (EC) sites. The GPP estimations from the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model and the Eddy Covariance Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE) model were evaluated against EC GPP to assess the performances of LAI datasets. Results showed that MODIS LAI had stronger linear correlations with GLASS and GEOV1 than GIMMS and GLOMAP at the study sites. The GPP estimations from GLASS LAI had a better agreement with EC GPP than those from other four LAI datasets at forest sites, while the GPP estimations from GEOVI LAI matched best with EC GPP at grass sites. Additionally, the GPP estimations from GLASS and GEOVI LAI presented better performances than the other three LAI datasets at crop sites. Besides, the results also showed that complex terrain had larger discrepancies of LAI and GPP estimations, and flat terrain presented better performances of LAI datasets in GPP estimations. Moreover, the simulated GPP from BEPS was more sensitive to LAI than those from EC - LUE, suggesting that LAI datasets can also lead to different uncertainties in GPP estimations from different model structures. Our study highlights that the satellite-derived LAI datasets can cause uncertainties in GPP estimations through ecosystem models. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Radiation Calibration Accuracy Assessment of FY-3D Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Based on Inter-Comparison
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision radiometric calibration of hyperspcctral infrared sounders is crucial for its quantitative application. In this study, the relative deviation obtained by radiance calibration of infrared hyperspectral atmospheric sounder ( HIRAS) on FY-3D satellite is evaluated based on infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) on European meteorological satellites MetOp-A and MetOp-H and Y-3D satellite through simultaneous nadir overpass. According to the observation data of strictly spatial and temporal matching of both instruments, the uniform scenes arc selected by using the higher spatial resolution data of medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI-II) on the same platform of FY-3D. The spectral resolution of IASI data is converted to the same spectral resolution of HIRAS through forward-inverse Fourier transform method before inter-comparison. Because the matching samples which satisfy the collocation criteria arc distributed in the North and South Arctic regions with low target temperatures, the inter-comparison results arc evaluated by mean and standard deviation of HIRAS-IASI brightness temperature (ET). The results show that the comparison results between HIRAS and MetOp-A/B arc similar, the consistency of North Arctic regions with high temperature is better than that of South Arctic regions. HIRAS agrees well with IASI at the long-wave IR (LWIR) and middle-wave IR (MWIR) in low temperature environment with less than 1 K mean deviation and below 0.5 K in most channels. There arc no apparent scene-dependent features for individual spectral channels, the standard deviation is less than 2 K, and varies with the spectral channels, slightly larger at the position where the absorption line is sharp. The spectral ET of HIRAS is lower than that of IASI with <1.5 K mean deviation in most channels at short-wave IR (SWIR), the deviation shows scene-dependent features, and the standard deviation decreases as the target temperature increases. The long-term trend of ET difference (from April to December, 2018) analysis shows that long-term consistency of HIRAS is stable, the mean deviation at SWIR is slightly larger in the lower target temperature conditions.

TI  - Estimation of hydrological vulnerability in river basins of Argentinean plains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding, economic losses in agricultural activity and climatological variability are very natural phenomena on plains. In particular, the central plains in Argentina, that are the most productive agrarian areas in the country, are characterized by significant alternate inter-annual droughts and floods. Moreover, the topographic features of the study area contribute to high exposure to flooding. In this study, a method for estimating the Hydrological Vulnerability (HV), related to the hydrological surplus, is developed for three river basins in the Pampas plains in Argentina, which includes a comprehensive analysis and scoring of various physical, climatological and hydrological variables. All the data were processed in a raster format, in a GIS environment. Finally, the method was validated, in a qualitative and a quantitative form, with a world and national disasters database, government national and satellite data and previous studies. It provides a structured approach for carrying out an assessment of hydrological vulnerability, which is applicable at different spatial scales.

TI  - Incorporating the effect of ALS-derived DEM uncertainty for quantifying changes due to the landslide in 2011, Mt. Umyeon, Seoul
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The landslide, which occurred at Umyeon mountain (Mt. Umyeon) in Seoul, Korea in 2011, was a prime example that raised awareness about the landslide in the highly urbanized area. Although many studies have been done on Umyeon landslide, there is a lack of research that detects the area where the landslide occurred and quantifies the elevation changes through remote sensing data. In this regard, this paper aims to detect and assess topographic changes quantitatively over Mt. Umyeon by using digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Since Mt. Umyeon was hilly and covered with dense trees during summer, traces of the landslide were detected by estimating the spatially distributed uncertainty of ALS-derived DEMs. The probabilistic analysis with Bayes'(TM) theorem considering the spatially distributed DEM of difference (DoD) uncertainty enabled to detect the landslide traces efficiently and was less affected by the influence of ALS errors. The results indicated that ALS-derived DEMs have the potential to detect landslides with their uncertainty estimation, although the ALS data were acquired in hilly and densely vegetated areas. Moreover, quantifying topographic changes due to landslides with high reliability is considered to be beneficial and practically helpful for disaster recovery.

TI  - Flying, phones and flu: Anonymized call records suggest that Keflavik International Airport introduced pandemic H1N1 into Iceland in 2009
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Data collected by mobile devices can augment surveillance of epidemics in real time. However, methods and evidence for the integration of these data into modern surveillance systems are sparse. We linked call detail records (CDR) with an influenza-like illness (ILI) registry and evaluated the role that Icelandic international travellers played in the introduction and propagation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus in Iceland through the course of the 2009 pandemic. Methods This nested case-control study compared odds of exposure to Keflavik International Airport among cases and matched controls producing longitudinal two-week matched odds ratios (mORs) from August to December 2009. We further evaluated rates of ILI among 1st- and 2nd-degree phone connections of cases compared to their matched controls. Results The mOR was elevated in the initial stages of the epidemic from 7 August until 21 August (mOR = 2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35, 4.78). During the two-week period from 17 August through 31 August, we calculated the two-week incidence density ratio of ILI among 1st-degree connections to be 2.96 (95% CI: 1.43, 5.84). Conclusions Exposure to Keflavik International Airport increased the risk of incident ILI diagnoses during the initial stages of the epidemic. Using these methods for other regions of Iceland, we evaluated the geographic spread of ILI over the course of the epidemic. Our methods were validated through similar evaluation of a domestic airport. The techniques described in this study can be used for hypothesis-driven evaluations of locations and behaviours during an epidemic and their associations with health outcomes.

TI  - Characterizing 40 years of natural <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> var. <i>mongolica</i> carbon stocks in Northeast China using stand age from remote sensing time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS)-assisted estimates of forest carbon stocks are essential for modelling carbon budgets at large scales. Research on the dynamic variations in forest biomass and carbon stocks is important to improve the sustainable use of forest resources and understand forest carbon budgets in China. The Honghuaerji region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is where Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv. (MP) originated. MP forests contained the most important coniferous silvicultural tree species and were later introduced to the desert regions of northern China. However, there has been very little research on carbon stocks (vegetation and soil carbon) over time in the original MP forests. Our goal was to estimate the changes in the carbon stocks of the natural MP forests in the Honghuaerji region using a 40-year RS time series, forest survey data and laboratory data. First, we mapped MP forests and estimated forest ages based on Key Hole 9 and Landsat time series stacks from 1975 to 2015, and the estimated forest ages were shown to be consistent with the surveyed tree ages with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.96. Second, fifteen vegetation indices were evaluated as indicators of diameter at breast height (DBH). Of these, tasselled cap greenness provided the best relationships, and an RS-based DBH equation was constructed with an R-2 of 0.65. Third, the carbon densities in the different ages of MP forests were obtained at regional scales. Finally, the dynamics of the carbon stocks in the natural MP forest ecosystem (including stems, branches, leaves, roots and soils) over 40 years were obtained. The results of this study indicated that the total MP forest ecosystem carbon stocks increased significantly from 7.36 +/- 1.92 Tg C in 1975 to 11.52 +/- 2.51 Tg C in 2015 at a rate of 1.42% year(-1), among which vegetation carbon stocks increased 5.54% year(-1) and soil carbon stocks increased 0.45% year(-1). The results reveal a notable carbon increase in the MP forests in the Honghuaerji region over the past four decades and provide information on the role of natural forest conservation and management in China in mitigating global climate change.

TI  - The application of a hybrid sea surface temperature algorithm to COMS geostationary satellite data in the Northwest Pacific Ocean
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hybrid sea surface temperature (SST) algorithm derives coefficients for SST estimation based on the regression procedure of incremental values between the satellite-observed brightness temperature (BT) minus the first-guess BT and the in-situ temperature minus the first-guess SST. In this study, the hybrid SST algorithm was applied to retrieve the SST coefficients of which the results were compared with extensively used regression algorithms of Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) and Non-Linear SST (NLSST) using data obtained by the Meteorological Imager of the first Korean geostationary satellite, the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite, in the Northwest Pacific Ocean in May 2014. The empirical regression SSTs and hybrid SSTs exhibited similar root-mean-squared errors in the range of 0.61-0.84 degrees C. Although the SST errors were quite similar to each other, the comparison of the hybrid SSTs with the in-situ SSTs indicated a slightly higher accuracy of approximately 0.2 degrees C compared with that of the empirically derived SSTs. SST retrieval using the hybrid algorithm reduced the errors near the cloud edges. The differences between the hybrid SST and regression SST tended to be greater when the distance to the nearest cloudy pixel was less than 0.2 degrees. This study discusses the potential causes of the differences between the SST errors of the algorithms and addresses a few constraints in the execution of the hybrid algorithm related to the numerical model.

TI  - Efficacy of Ultrasound and Shear Wave Elastography for the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To assess the feasibility of ultrasound and shear wave elastography (SWE) in the diagnosis of breast cancer-related lymphedema. Methods Forty-one patients with a history of unilateral breast surgery and axillary dissection or sentinel lymph node excision were included in this prospective study. The patients were classified as having normal findings, latent lymphedema, and clinical lymphedema on the basis of a physical examination, lymphedema index scores, and limb circumference measurements. The thickness and stiffness of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the forearm and arm were measured by ultrasound and SWE. The thickness and stiffness of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected limb and contralateral limbs of the normal, latent lymphedema, and clinical lymphedema groups were compared. Results The mean age +/- SD of the 41 patients was 55.42 +/- 10.12 years. There were 15 patients with normal findings, 10 with latent lymphedema, and 16 with clinical lymphedema. In the latent lymphedema group, the thickness measurements of the cutaneous tissue of the affected forearm and the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected arm were significantly greater than those of the contralateral forearm and arm (P = .034; P = .022; and P = .002, respectively), and the stiffness measurements of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected forearm were significantly greater than those of the contralateral forearm (P = .011; and P = .002). In the clinical lymphedema group, the thickness and stiffness measurements of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected forearm and arm were significantly greater than those of the contralateral limb (P < .001-P = .032). Conclusions Ultrasound and SWE are effective for diagnosing breast cancer-related lymphedema even at a latent stage.

TI  - Assessing the efficacy of Landsat-8 OLI imagery derived models for remotely estimating chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration in the Upper Ganga River, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) serves as an indicator of productivity in surface water. Estimating chl-a concentration is pivotal for monitoring and subsequent conservation of surface water quality. Artificial neural network (ANN) based models were validated and tested for their efficacy against various regression models to determine the chl-a concentration in the Upper Ganga river. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance (SR) imagery for May and October along with in-situ data over a period of 2 years (2016-2017) was used to develop and validated models. Regression model performance was acceptable with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.57, 0.63, 0.66 and 0.68 for linear, exponential, logarithmic and power model, respectively. However, there was a significant improvement in the efficacy of chl-a determination using ANN model performance having a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.52 mu g l(-1) and R-2 = 0.97 in comparison to the best-performing regression model (power) with RMSE = 9.86 mu g l(-1) and R-2 = 0.68. ANN exhibited comparatively more precise spatial and seasonal variability with mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.26 mu g l(-1) as compared to the best regression model (power) MAE = 7.98 mu g l(-1) suggesting the applicability of ANN for large-scale spatial and temporal monitoring river stretches using Landsat-8 OLI SR images.

TI  - Exploring parameter selection for carbon monitoring based on Landsat-8 imagery of the aboveground forest biomass on Mount Tai
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a fundamental role in stabilizing the global climate. Aboveground biomass (AGB) is important to the global carbon balance and environmental protection. Remotely sensed features such as single-band information, vegetation indices, texture features and terrain factors have been assessed to accurately estimate the forest biomass. A feature selection SVM-RFE (support vector machine recursive feature elimination) method is proposed to explore the relationship between the biomass and parameters derived from the Mount Tai area Landsat-8 imagery, thereby improving the AGB estimation accuracy. The least significant parameter is recursively removed according to a scoring function to determine the optimal subset of parameters. The performance of the SVM-RFE algorithm biomass feature selection method is then compared with the widely used stepwise regression method. The results show that the SVM-RFE method is superior to the stepwise linear regression method. And it could accurately estimate the AGB compared with field measurements in the context of the recent reducing emissions from forest deforestation and degradation (REDD) mechanism adopted by the United Nations.

TI  - Mesoscale movement and recursion behaviors of Namibian black rhinos
T2  - MOVEMENT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding rhino movement behavior, especially their recursive movements, holds significant promise for enhancing rhino conservation efforts, and protecting their habitats and the biodiversity they support. Here we investigate the daily, biweekly, and seasonal recursion behavior of rhinos, to aid conservation applications and increase our foundational knowledge about these important ecosystem engineers. Methods Using relocation data from 59 rhinos across northern Namibia and 8 years of sampling efforts, we investigated patterns in 24-h displacement at dawn, dusk, midday, and midnight to examine movement behaviors at an intermediate scale and across daily behavioral modes of foraging and resting. To understand recursion patterns across animals' short and long-term ranges, we built T-LoCoH time use grids to estimate recursive movement by each individual. Comparing these grids to contemporaneous MODIS imagery, we investigated productivity's influence on short-term space use and recursion. Finally, we investigated patterns of recursion within a year's home range, measuring the time to return to the most intensively used patches. Results Twenty four-hour displacements at dawn were frequently smaller than 24-h displacements at dusk or at midday and midnight resting periods. Recursion analyses demonstrated that short-term recursion was most common in areas of median rather than maximum NDVI values. Investigated across a full year, recursion analysis showed rhinos most frequently returned to areas within 8-21 days, though visits were also seen separated by months likely suggesting seasonality in range use. Conclusions Our results indicate that rhinos may frequently stay within the same area of their home ranges for days at a time, and possibly return to the same general area days in a row especially during morning foraging bouts. Recursion across larger time scales is also evident, and likely a contributing mechanism for maintaining open landscapes and browsing lawns of the savanna.

TI  - Potential flood hazard zone mapping based on geomorphologic considerations and fuzzy analytical hierarchy model in a data scarce West African basin
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) was employed to map and rank flood hazard zones within the Northwest Benin Owena River Basin (NWBORB). Topographic wetness index, elevation, altitude above channel, slope, drainage density, convergence index, and runoff contributing to water accumulation/stagnation were processed to generate the flood hazard map of the basin. Values for the relative importance of each factor for flood occurrence were obtained using FAHP; these factors were super-imposed using weighted overlay. Sensitivity analysis of the weights was conducted to determine their influence on the overall analysis. The resultant flood hazard map was classified into five zones very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. Sensitivity analysis of the result showed that runoff and slope were the most sensitive factors in the analysis with values of 1.163 and 1.132, respectively. A comparison between flood hazard map and historical floods within the basin established the reliability of the methodology.

TI  - Underestimation of Global Photosynthesis in Earth System Models Due to Representation of Vegetation Structure
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of vegetation structure on the absorption of shortwave radiation in Earth System Models (ESMs) is potentially important for accurate modeling of the carbon cycle and hence climate projections. A proportion of incident shortwave radiation is used by plants to photosynthesize and canopy structure has a direct impact on the fraction of this radiation which is absorbed. This paper evaluates how modeled carbon assimilation of the terrestrial biosphere is impacted when clumping derived from satellite data is incorporated. We evaluated impacts of clumping on photosynthesis using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator, the land surface scheme of the UK Earth System Model. At the global level, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) increased by 5.53 +/- 1.02 PgC/year with the strongest absolute increase in the tropics. This is contrary to previous studies that have shown a decrease in photosynthesis when similar clumping data sets have been used to modify light interception in models. In our study additional transmission of light through upper canopy layers leads to enhanced absorption in lower layers in which photosynthesis tends to be light limited. We show that this result is related to the complexity of canopy scheme being used.

TI  - Radar Satellite Imagery for Detecting Bark Beetle Outbreaks in Forests
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe overall objective of this paper is to review the state of knowledge on the application of radar data for detecting bark beetle attacks in forests. Due to the increased availability of high spatial and temporal resolution radar data (e.g. Sentinel-1 (S1)), the question is how this time series data can support operational forest management with respect to forest insect damage prevention. Furthermore, available radar systems will be listed and their potential for detecting bark beetle attacks will be discussed. To increase the understanding of the potential of radar time series for detecting bark beetle outbreaks, a theoretical background about the interaction of the radar signals with the forest canopy is given. Finally, gaps in the available knowledge are identified and future research questions are formulated which could advance our understanding of using radar data for detecting forest bark beetle attacks.Recent FindingsFew studies already demonstrate the high potential of S1 time series data for forest disturbance mapping in general. It was demonstrated that multi-temporal S1 data provide an excellent data source of describing the phenological characteristics of forests, which provide the basic knowledge for detecting bark beetle induced forest damages. It has been found that the optimal time for data acquisition is April to June for the pre-event and August to October for the post-event acquisitions.SummaryFor detecting bark beetle induced forest damages, the literature review shows that mono-temporal radar data are of limited use, that shorter wavelength (e.g. C-band; X-band) have a higher potential than longer wavelength such as L-band and that the current S1 time series data have a high potential for operational applications.

TI  - Reduced RhoA expression enhances breast cancer metastasis with a concomitant increase in CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokines signaling
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of RhoA GTPases in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis is unclear. Early studies within which mutations in RhoA were designed based on cancer-associated mutations in Ras supported an oncogene role for RhoA. However, recent whole-genome sequencing studies of cancers raised the possibility that RhoA may have a tumor suppression function. Here, using a syngeneic triple negative breast cancer murine model we investigated the physiological effects of reduced RhoA expression on breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis. RhoA knockdown had no effect on primary tumor formation and tumor proliferation, concurring with our in vitro findings where reduced RhoA had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation and clonogenic growth. In contrast, primary tumors with RhoA knockdown efficiently invaded sentinel lymph nodes and significantly metastasized to lungs compared to control tumors. Mechanistically, the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes in the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer showing the ability of RhoA to suppress chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells. Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer.

TI  - Mapping distribution of water hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) in Rwanda using multispectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (C. Mart) Solms (Pontederiaceae), is an invasive aquatic macrophyte with major negative economic and ecological impacts in Rwanda and other East African countries since its establishment in the region in the 1960s. Reliable estimates of water hyacinth distribution are required to determine the severity of the problem and identify waterbodies requiring management. Remote sensing techniques, based on the Landsat 8 sensor, offer promising alternatives to accurately detect, map and monitor the extent of the water hyacinth invasion in Rwandan waterbodies. The aim of the current study was to investigate the utility of multispectral remote sensed imagery using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms to detect and map water hyacinth in Rwandan waterbodies. Random Forest had a high overall accuracy of 85%, compared with Support Vector Machine (65%). These algorithms confirmed different levels of water hyacinth infestations in three main Rwandan rivers. Many of the wetlands along these riparian systems and most of the lakes, particularly those from the Eastern Province of the country were found to be invaded by water hyacinth. These findings would, therefore, assist government partners and policy makers to put in place sustainable methods, such as biological control, along with integrated pest management, to control the of water hyacinth invasion in Rwanda.

TI  - Saharan Dust Modeling Over the Mediterranean Basin and Central Europe: Does the Resolution Matter?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean Basin is frequently affected by desert dust outbreaks coming from the north of Africa. The presence of this type of particulate matter (PM) joint to others (in particular, anthropogenic pollution from the intense human activities) makes the air quality over this region a worrying issue. In this sense, an accurate characterization of the dust transport is essential. This study tries to shed some light on the sensitivity of dust modeling to the spatial resolution by using the online integrated meteorological-chemical model (WRF-Chem). Three simulations only differing on spatial resolution (D1 at 1.32 degrees, D2 at 0.44 degrees and D3 at 0.11 degrees), during a representative omega-blocking situation over Europe causing Saharan dust transport over the Mediterranean and central Europe were evaluated against MODIS and AERONET. This evaluation revealed an improvement in the model AOD representation when resolution becomes finer, specially over the Saharan desert dust affected area. These discrepancies between resolutions could be attributed to changes both in thermodynamics and dynamics, since AOD is sensitive to aerosol mass, size distribution and water uptake. Relative humidity (RH) and PM-ratio (PM2.5/PM10) present non-local differences due to the increase of the resolution as a consequence of changes in the long-range transport spatial pattern. Henceforth, the comparison of wind speed and direction, geopotencial height and sea level pressure (SLP) against ERA5 data shows a better representation of the dynamical patterns when decreasing spatial resolution.

TI  - From small-scale forest structure to Amazon-wide carbon estimates
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle. High-resolution remote sensing techniques, e.g., spaceborne lidar, can measure complex tropical forest structures, but it remains a challenge how to interpret such information for the assessment of forest biomass and productivity. Here, we develop an approach to estimate basal area, aboveground biomass and productivity within Amazonia by matching 770,000 GLAS lidar (ICESat) profiles with forest simulations considering spatial heterogeneous environmental and ecological conditions. This allows for deriving frequency distributions of key forest attributes for the entire Amazon. This detailed interpretation of remote sensing data improves estimates of forest attributes by 20-43% as compared to (conventional) estimates using mean canopy height. The inclusion of forest modeling has a high potential to close a missing link between remote sensing measurements and the 3D structure of forests, and may thereby improve continent-wide estimates of biomass and productivity.

TI  - Food Web Complexity of High Mountain Lakes is Largely Affected by Glacial Retreat
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - High mountain lakes provide essential ecosystem services and have a high conservation value. Therefore, understanding how glacier retreat will affect their ecological functioning and water quality is crucial. Here, we tested how shallow high mountain lakes having different glacial influences differ in their abiotic main features and food web structure using a multiple ecological indicator approach. We identified 13 functional groups within the planktonic and littoral communities, each one representing a biotic indicator and a node in a simplified food web network. The abiotic environment and most functional groups differed significantly as a consequence of the glacial influence. In general, runoff from glacial meltwaters resulted in highly simplified food webs. Considering that many turbid glacially fed lakes are losing their hydrological connection with disappearing/retreating glaciers and shifting to a clear state, our results suggest that this shift could enhance food web complexity, but at the cost of losing specific habitats. Further, retreat of large glaciers will form new glacially fed lakes, but it remains unclear whether this will buffer the expected habitat and biodiversity loss.

TI  - Identification of optimal single date for rice crop discrimination and relationships between backscatter and biophysical parameters using RISAT-1 hybrid polarimetric SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors operate in all weather conditions and have a great potential for agricultural applications. Its usefulness in rainy (kharif) season during cloud cover when optical data cannot provide information is proven. The SAR images were used to discriminate cropped area, specifically rice cropped area using temporal images. These temporal images are costly and analysis intensive. The selection of date or growth stage is crucial part while using single date polarimetric SAR images for rice crop mapping. In this study, a single date was identified from a set of imagery during the rainy season for accurate rice mapping using C-band Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) hybrid polarimetric data. The single optimal date imagery was selected by understanding the scattering mechanism, backscattering response and crop-based canopy architecture. The backscatter values and scattering mechanism of rice varying with growth stages were studied. The backscatter was low at transplanting stage and then as the crop grows, its backscatter increases. The saturation of backscatter was observed when the crop reaches harvest stage. At transplanting and harvest stages, odd and volume scattering dominates than double bounce scattering. Double bounce scattering was dominant at vegetative stage than other scattering mechanisms due to near vertical orientation of rice canopy and the crop height also reached maximum stage. Temporal variations of backscatter and sensitivity of backscatter to Leaf Area Index (LAI) were analyzed, and found that the relationship between backscatter and LAI showed good correlation. The analysis of multidate SAR data reflected good performance for LAI quantification and identification of optimal date for rice crop discrimination.

TI  - Modelling biomass burning emissions and the effect of spatial resolution: a case study for Africa based on the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale fire emission estimates may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the model and input datasets used. Especially in areas with relatively heterogeneous land cover, a coarse model resolution might lead to substantial errors in estimates. We developed a model using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations of burned area and vegetation characteristics to study the impact of spatial resolution on modelled fire emission estimates. We estimated fire emissions for sub-Saharan Africa at 500 m spatial resolution (native MODIS burned area) for the 2002-2017 period, using a simplified version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) modelling framework, and compared this to model runs at a range of coarser resolutions (0.050, 0.125, 0.250 degrees). We estimated fire emissions of 0.68 Pg C yr(-1) at 500 m resolution and 0.82 Pg C yr(-1) at 0.25 degrees resolution; a difference of 24 %. At 0.25 degrees resolution, our model results were relatively similar to GFED4, which also runs at 0.25 degrees resolution, whereas our 500 m estimates were substantially lower. We found that lower emissions at finer resolutions are mainly the result of reduced representation errors when comparing modelled estimates of fuel load and consumption to field measurements, as part of the model calibration. Additional errors stem from the model simulation at coarse resolution and lead to an additional 0.02 Pg C yr(-1) difference in estimates. These errors exist due to the aggregation of quantitative and qualitative model input data; the average- or majority - aggregated values are propagated in the coarse-resolution simulation and affect the model parameterization and the final result. We identified at least three error mechanisms responsible for the differences in estimates between 500 m and 0.25 degrees resolution simulations, besides those stemming from representation errors in the calibration process, namely (1) biome misclassification leading to errors in parameterization, (2) errors due to the averaging of input data and the associated reduction in variability, and (3) a temporal mechanism related to the aggregation of burned area in particular. Even though these mechanisms largely neutralized each other and only modestly affect estimates at a continental scale, they lead to substantial error at regional scales with deviations of up to a factor 4 and may affect large-scale estimates differently for other continents. These findings could prove valuable in improving coarse-resolution models and suggest the need for increased spatial resolution in global fire emission models.

TI  - A spatio-temporal prediction of NDVI based on precipitation: an application for grazing management in the arid and semi-arid grasslands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for predicting the dynamic spatio-temporal variations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on precipitation is proposed using combined nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) networks and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed method is validated by applying to predict the spatio-temporal NDVI for the Hulunbuir grassland located in Inner Mongolia, China. The results show the good predictive ability for the spatio-temporal variations of NDVI with the mean absolute percentage error of 11.59%, mean absolute error of 7.11 x 10(-2) and root mean square error of 8.06 x 10(-2), respectively. The approach presented in the paper can be further used as the guidance to reduce the occurrence of overgrazing in the arid and semi-arid grasslands.

TI  - Towards monitoring groundwater-dependent ecosystems using synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) relies largely on assumption-laden evaporation models, and few global, direct, and real-time monitoring techniques exist. We propose a new synthetic aperture radar imagery-derived index, SARGDE, to identify and monitor these ecosystems across Australia. The index captures vegetation reliance on groundwater during dry periods by estimating the relative stability of foliage and branch structure from the vertical/horizontal cross-polarized band and InSAR coherence. SARGDE is tested over two contrasting study sites in Australia. To build and verify the index, a total of 90 Sentinel-1 interferometric wide images are processed and stacked in two data-cubes. GDE response to the SAR signal is explored using a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm. Relevant statistical parameters are derived from data-cubes and combined to form the index. As the index relies on a 1-year time series of globally, freely available, and cloud-insensitive SAR imagery, SARGDE offers unprecedented capabilities for large-scale, annual monitoring of GDEs. Such monitoring will aid reconciliation of human and ecosystem groundwater needs by acting as a systematic monitoring tool, helping policy makers to assure ecosystem sustainability where impacts related to mining, agriculture, or climate change may occur.

TI  - The Impact of Ship Emission Controls Recorded by Cloud Properties
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of aerosols on cloud properties is one of the leading uncertainties in the human forcing of the climate. Ships are large, isolated sources of aerosol creating linear cloud formations known as shiptracks. These are an ideal opportunity to identify and measure aerosol-cloud interactions. This work uses over 17,000 shiptracks during the implementation of fuel sulfur content regulations to demonstrate the central role of sulfate aerosol in ship exhaust for modifying clouds. By connecting individual shiptracks to transponder data, it is shown that almost half of shiptracks are likely undetected, masking a significant contribution to the climate impact of shipping. A pathway to retrieving ship sulfate emissions is demonstrated, showing how cloud observations could be used to monitor air pollution.

TI  - Comparative Approach to the Temporo-Spatial Organization of the Tumor Microenvironment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The complex ecosystem in which tumor cells reside and interact, termed the tumor microenvironment (TME), encompasses all cells and components associated with a neoplasm that are not transformed cells. Interactions between tumor cells and the TME are complex and fluid, with each facet coercing the other, largely, into promoting tumor progression. While the TME in humans is relatively well-described, a compilation and comparison of the TME in our canine counterparts has not yet been described. As is the case in humans, dog tumors exhibit greater heterogeneity than what is appreciated in laboratory animal models, although the current level of knowledge on similarities and differences in the TME between dogs and humans, and the practical implications of that information, require further investigation. This review summarizes some of the complexities of the human and mouse TME and interjects with what is known in the dog, relaying the information in the context of the temporo-spatial organization of the TME. To the authors' knowledge, the development of the TME over space and time has not been widely discussed, and a comprehensive review of the canine TME has not been done. The specific topics covered in this review include cellular invasion and interactions within the TME, metabolic derangements in the TME and vascular invasion, and the involvement of the TME in tumor spread and metastasis.

TI  - Numerical simulation of seasonal mesoscale atmospheric flow-field variables using ARW over the Singapore region: impact of land use land cover
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the effect of land use land cover information on the simulation of seasonal planetary boundary layer (PBL) flow-field variables over the Singapore region is analysed using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW) mesoscale model. The results achieved are compared using the standard ARW Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (ARW-MODIS) global land cover data and a regional land cover map produced at the Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing (ARW-CRISP), Singapore. The high-resolution simulations are conducted with triple-nested domains (horizontal grid spacing 27, 9 and 3 km) and 51 unequally spaced vertical sigma levels. The evolution of PBL variables and rainfall are modelled for four seasons (northeast monsoon season, first inter-monsoon period, southwest monsoon season and second inter-monsoon period). For the purpose of numerical simulations, 30days in each season were considered and the model-simulated variables were validated with in situ available meteorological observations and rainfall at four stations over Singapore. The simulation results highlight the broad variation of the low-level flow-field in different seasons. The ARW mesoscale model simulated diurnal trends in surface meteorological variables and rainfall are in better agreement with observations by using the ARW-CRISP regional land cover map compared to ARW-MODIS global land cover data. Stronger winds are found during monsoon seasons compared with inter-monsoon periods. Overall, the results of the present study indicate that regional level air quality monitoring and prediction capabilities around Singapore can be improved by using up-to-date land cover products designed to take into account regional land cover characteristics.

TI  - Analysis and quantification of ENSO-linked changes in the tropical Atlantic cloud vertical distribution using 14 years of MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 14 years (September 2002 to September 2016) of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) monthly mean cloud data are used to quantify possible changes in the cloud vertical distribution over the tropical Atlantic.For the analysis multiple linear regression techniques are used. For the investigated time period significant linear changes were found in the domain-averaged cloud-top height (CTH) (-178m per decade), the high-cloud fraction (HCF) (-0.0006 per decade), and the low-cloud amount (0.001 per decade). The interannual variability of the time series (especially CTH and HCF) is highly influenced by the El NinoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). Separating the time series into two phases, we quantified the linear change associated with the transition from more La Nina-like conditions to a phase with El Nino conditions (Phase 2) and vice versa (Phase 1). The transition from negative to positive ENSO conditions was related to a decrease in total cloud fraction (TCF) (-0.018 per decade; not significant) due to a reduction in the high-cloud amount (0 :024 per decade; significant). Observed anomalies in the mean CTH were found to be mainly caused by changes in HCF rather than by anomalies in the height of cloud tops themselves.Using the large-scale vertical motion omega at 500 hPa (from ERA-Interim ECMWF reanalysis data), the observed anomalies were linked to ENSO-induced changes in the atmospheric large-scale dynamics. The most significant and largest changes were found in regions with strong large-scale upward movements near the Equator.Despite the fact that with passive imagers such as MODIS it is not possible to vertically resolve clouds, this study shows the great potential for large-scale analysis of possible changes in the cloud vertical distribution due to the changing climate by using vertically resolved cloud cover and linking those changes to large-scale dynamics using other observations or model data.

TI  - A proposal for changes to the European Union syphilis surveillance case definition using evidence from evaluations in Ireland
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Syphilis remains a disease of public health importance, with considerable health effects if not treated. Concurrent infection with syphilis and untreated HIV facilitates HIV transmission. The incidence of syphilis in Europe has been increasing, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and in MSM with HIV. However, there is heterogeneity among countries in the case definition used for syphilis and in reported syphilis notification rates. In Ireland, we have undertaken a number of refinements of the national syphilis surveillance system since 2014, including refinement of the laboratory thresholds for notification (rapid plasma reagin 1:16 and/or positive IgM). This article outlines the steps taken and some of the challenges we faced. Our current case definition now accurately reflects the epidemiology of syphilis in Ireland and our current surveillance provides timely information for action, while not reducing the sensitivity of the system too much. For countries where surveillance is driven mainly by laboratory reporting and where obtaining clinical details is challenging, these thresholds for notification may be a pragmatic solution.

TI  - Allies and Enemies of Fascism in the Reports of Italian Military Attaches
T2  - WAR IN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of the reports of the Italian military attaches in London, Paris, and Berlin during the 1930s suggests that these officers' perception of the countries they observed was increasingly influenced by the totalitarian evolution of the regime. While traditional interpretation of the relationship between the Italian Army and the regime is that the alliance between the two granted meaningful autonomy to the former, this article suggests that the Italian military had absorbed a worldview seeing democracy as weak and decadent and authoritarianism as the way ahead, and perceived the world according to strong national and racial stereotypes.

TI  - Performance of surveillance case definitions for respiratory syncytial virus infections through the sentinel influenza surveillance system, Portugal, 2010 to 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Well-established influenza surveillance systems (ISS) can be used for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance. In Portugal, RSV cases are detected through the ISS using the European Union (EU) influenza-like illness (ILI) case definition. Aim: To investigate clinical predictors for RSV infection and how three case definitions (EU ILI, a modified EU acute respiratory infection, and one respiratory symptom) performed in detecting RSV infections in Portugal. Methods: This observational retrospective study used epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data (October 2010-May 2018). Associations between clinical characteristics and RSV detection were analysed using logistic regression. Accuracy of case definitions was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A 0.05 significance level was accepted. Results: The study involved 6,523 persons, including 190 (2.9%) RSV cases. Among 183 cases with age information, RSV infection was significantly more frequent among individuals 5 years (n=23;12.6%) and >= 65 years (n=45; 24.6%) compared with other age groups (p < 0.0001). Cough (odds ratio (OR): 2.4; 95%confidence interval (CI):1.2-6.5) was the best RSV-infection predictor considering all age groups, while shortness of breath was particularly associated with RSV-positivity among site year olds (OR: 6.7; 95%CI: 2.6-17.4 for 0-4 year olds and OR: 6.7; 95%CI:1.5-28.8 for 5-14year olds). Systemic symptoms were significantly associated with RSV-negative and influenza-positive cases. None of the case definitions were suitable to detect RSV infections (AUC = 0.51). Conclusion: To avoid underestimating the RSV disease burden, RSV surveillance within the Portuguese sentinel ISS would require a more sensitive case definition than ILI and, even a different case definition according to age.

TI  - Genetic parameters for total lactation yields of milk, fat, protein, and somatic cell score in New Zealand dairy goats
T2  - ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for lactation yields of milk (MY), fat (FY), protein (PY), and somatic cell score (SCS) of New Zealand dairy goats. The analysis used 64,604 lactation records from 23,583 does, kidding between 2004 and 2017, distributed in 21 flocks and representing 915 bucks. Estimates of genetic and residual (co) variances, heritabilities, and repeatabilities were obtained using a multiple-trait repeatability animal model. The model included the fixed effects of contemporary group (does kidding in the same flock and year), age of the doe (in years), and as covariates, kidding day, proportion of Alpine, Nubian, Toggenburg, and "unknown" breeds (Saanen was used as the base breed), and heterosis. Random effects included additive animal genetic and doe permanent environmental effects. Estimates of heritabilities were 0.25 for MY, 0.24 for FY, 0.24 for PY, and 0.21 for SCS. The phenotypic correlations between MY, FY, and PY ranged from 0.90 to 0.96, and the genetic correlations ranged from 0.81 to 0.93. These results indicate lactation yield traits exhibit useful heritable variation and that multiple trait selection for these traits could improve milk revenue produced from successive generations of New Zealand dairy goats.

TI  - Heterogeneity in influenza seasonality and vaccine effectiveness in Australia, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa: early estimates of the 2019 influenza season
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared 2019 influenza seasonality and vaccine effectiveness (VE) in four southern hemisphere countries: Australia, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa. Influenza seasons differed in timing, duration, intensity and predominant circulating viruses. VE estimates were also heterogeneous, with all-ages point estimates ranging from 7-70% (I-2: 33%) for A(H1N1) pdm09, 4-57% (I-2: 49%) for A(H3N2) and 29-66% (I-2: 0%) for B. Caution should be applied when attempting to use southern hemisphere data to predict the northern hemisphere influenza season.

TI  - Coupling remote sensing data with <i>in-situ</i> optical measurements to estimate suspended particulate matter under the Evros river influence (North-East Aegean sea, Greece)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the riverine output of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) distribution in marine embayment is a crucial factor for the water quality of neighbouring coastal regions. This study presents satellite-derived SPM calculations against in-situ measurements in the continental shelf of North-East Aegean surrounding the transboundary Evros river mouth. Surface SPM, Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data were collected in a field campaign during low river discharge period (June 2016). The relationship between the optical backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) and the in-situ SPM concentrations was investigated. Subsequently, an empirical single band model was applied for estimating SPM concentrations by using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) red band and the model was then locally tuned within the study area. Furthermore, a multi-band SPM-retrieval algorithm was developed using the in-situ surface reflectance R-rs for calibration and it was validated using the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation technique (LOOCV). The relationship between in-situ SPM and backscattering coefficient values showed good proportionality, thus, nominating the predominance of terrestrial mineral particles. Validation against field measurements indicated that the SPM concentrations derived from the newly-developed multi-band algorithm had an improved significance correlation (96%), compared to both the single band model (not-tuned) (coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.82) and its locally tuned version (R-2 = 0.83). Most importantly, the generated multi-band model apart from exhibiting the best performance (R-2 = 0.93), it revealed high SPM spots which were not detected by the locally tuned single band model, indicating additional processes originating from river outflows, coastal erosion and subaqueous thermal springs in the area. In contrast, the locally tuned single band model overestimated SPM values in offshore waters, where low concentrations are encountered under the influence of the clear Black Sea Water (BSW).

TI  - The calcium sensor OsCBL1 modulates nitrate signaling to regulate seedling growth in rice
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrate signaling integrates and coordinates gene expression and plant growth; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Our previous study revealed that rice calcineurin B-like protein 1 (OsCBL1) modulates lateral root elongation by affecting auxin biosynthesis. Here, we report that OsCBL1 also modulates nitrate signaling to regulate rice seedlings growth. Compared with wild-type seedlings, seedlings of OsCBL1-knockdown (OsCBL1-KD) plants showed a suppressed growth phenotype, which included reduced root and shoot fresh weights and shorter radicles, crown roots, and lateral roots, when grown in nitrogen-free conditions. Although the growth defects of OsCBL1-KD plants could be partially rescued by the addition of nitrate to the growth conditions, the nitrate uptake capability of the OsCBL1-KD plants did not differ from that of wild-type plants as assessed via nitrate content and (NO3-)-N-15 influx experiments. The nitrate-regulated expression of nitrate signal sentinel genes (OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2) was affected in the OsCBL1-KD plants under both long- and short-term nitrate treatments. Overall, our results showed a novel role for OsCBL1 in the regulation of nitrate signaling and nitrate-mediated rice growth.

TI  - Estimation of Downwelling Shortwave and Longwave Radiation in the Tibetan Plateau Under All-Sky Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Downwelling shortwave radiation (DSWR) and downwelling longwave radiation (DLWR) are two important components of the Earth's surface radiation balance. In this study, the Heliosat method and the parameterization of Crawford and Duchon (1999, , hereafter CD99) were calibrated to make them suitable for estimation of DSWR and DLWR over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Based on meteorological data, forcing data, and observations from polar-orbiting satellites, the cloud albedo was calculated, and the clear-sky index estimation scheme of the Heliosat method was improved. These improvements were then applied to derive 10-day DSWR under all-sky conditions over the TP by combining the clear-sky shortwave radiation scheme with a clear-sky index. The coefficient of the CD99 parameterization scheme clear-sky DLWR was also calibrated, and 10-day all-sky DLWR was then determined and validated using ground-based measurements. The spatiotemporal distributions of DSWR and DLWR were analyzed in detail. The results showed that the modified methods are efficient and applicable for downward radiation retrieval under all-sky conditions over the TP with a reasonable accuracy. The mean percentage errors for DSWR and DLWR were -4.75% and 0.11%, respectively. The variation in the monthly DSWR (DLWR) showed a convex shape, with a maximum appearing in May (July). The spatial distributions of DLWR showed a southeast-high and northwest-low pattern. As the subsolar point moves northward, DSWR increases gradually and is clearly influenced by the Asian summer monsoon.

T2  - NURSING FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this article is to provide conceptual clarification of secondary traumatic stress (STS) in nurses.BackgroundAs an empathetic helping profession, nurses are at increased risk for STS. Interchangeable usage of related terms among multidisciplinary literature has resulted in lack of conceptual clarity resulting in conflation of terms. Conceptual clarity is necessary for a foundation for further research on treatment.MethodsRodgers' evolutionary model of concept analysis.ResultsNurses are predisposed to STS due to exposure, empathy, bonding, and personal factors. Essential attributes were found to be posttraumatic stress disorder-like symptoms, biological symptoms, social symptoms, and psychological symptoms. Resultant consequences included an altered worldview, interpersonal difficulties, and decreased occupational commitment.ConclusionThis concept analysis, the first focusing on STS, provides conceptual clarity and a concept map of STS within the nursing population.

TI  - Spatial flood susceptibility prediction in Middle Ganga Plain: comparison of frequency ratio and Shannon's entropy models
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on comparing results of flood susceptibility modelling in the part of Middle Ganga Plain, Ganga foreland basin. Following inclusivity rule, 12 major flood explanatory factors including a new one, geomorphology, have been utilized. Out of 1000 randomly generated flood-points from 2008 Landsat 5 TM image derived flood polygon, 70% have been utilized for the training purpose of Shannon's entropy (SE) model and 30% for area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) method of validation of both, SE and frequency ratio (FR), models. Result from FR shows that the contributions of specific classes of different explanatory factors to flooding susceptibility vary whereas the SE model suggests that geomorphology is the most contributing factor. The AUROC curve for SE (0.90) was better than that for FR (0.85). Hence, the SE model predicts flood-susceptible areas more accurately than the multivariate statistical model FR in the study area.

TI  - A nomogram constructed using intraoperative ex vivo shear-wave elastography precisely predicts metastasis of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo develop a nomogram and validate its use for the intraoperative evaluation of nodal metastasis using shear-wave elastography (SWE) elasticity values and nodal sizeMethodsWe constructed a nomogram to predict metastasis using ex vivo SWE values and ultrasound features of 228 axillary LNs from fifty-five patients. We validated its use in an independent cohort comprising 80 patients. In the validation cohort, a total of 217 sentinel LNs were included.ResultsWe developed the nomogram using the nodal size and elasticity values of the development cohort to predict LN metastasis; the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.856 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.783-0.929). In the validation cohort, 15 (7%) LNs were metastatic, and 202 (93%) were non-metastatic. The mean stiffness (23.54 and 10.41 kPa, p = 0.005) and elasticity ratio (3.24 and 1.49, p = 0.028) were significantly higher in the metastatic LNs than those in the non-metastatic LNs. However, the mean size of the metastatic LNs was not significantly larger than that of the non-metastatic LNs (8.70 mm vs 7.20 mm, respectively; p = 0.123). The AUC was 0.791 (95% CI, 0.668-0.915) in the validation cohort, and the calibration plots of the nomogram showed good agreement.ConclusionsWe developed a well-validated nomogram to predict LN metastasis. This nomogram, mainly based on ex vivo SWE values, can help evaluate nodal metastasis during surgery.Key Points center dot A nomogram was developed based on axillary LN size and ex vivo SWE values such as mean stiffness and elasticity ratio to easily predict axillary LN metastasis during breast cancer surgery.center dot The constructed nomogram presented high predictive performance of sentinel LN metastasis with an independent cohort.center dot This nomogram can reduce unnecessary intraoperative frozen section which increases the surgical time and costs in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Linear downscaling from MODIS to landsat: connecting landscape composition with ecosystem functions
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextThe open and free access to Landsat and MODIS products have greatly promoted scientific investigations on spatiotemporal change in land mosaics and ecosystem functions at landscape to regional scales. Unfortunately, there is a major mismatch in spatial resolution between MODIS products at coarser resolution (>= 250 m) and landscape structure based on classified Landsat scenes at finer resolution (30 m).ObjectivesBased on practical needs for downscaling popular MODIS products at 500 m resolution to match classified land cover at Landsat 30 m resolution, we proposed an innovative modelling approach so that landscape structure and ecosystem functions can be directly studied for their interconnections. As a proof-of-concept of our downscaling approach, we selected the watershed of the Kalamazoo River in southwestern Michigan, USA as the testbed.MethodsMODIS products for three fundamental variables of ecosystem function are downscaled to ensure the approach can be extrapolated to multiple functional measurements. They are blue-sky albedo (0-1), evapotranspiration (ET, mm), and gross primary production (GPP, Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). An object-oriented classification of Landsat images in 2011 was processed to generate a land cover map for landscape structure. The downscaling model was tested for the five Level IV ecoregions within the watershed.ResultsWe achieved satisfactory downscaling models for albedo, ET, and GPP for all five ecoregions. The adjusted R-2 was>0.995 for albedo, 0.915-0.997 for ET, and 0.902-0.962 for GPP. The estimated albedo, ET, and GPP values appear different in the region. The estimated albedo was the lowest for water (0.076-0.107) and the highest for cropland (0.166-0.172). Estimated ET was the highest for the built-up cover type (525.6-687.1 mm) and the lowest for forest (209.7-459.7 mm). The estimated GPP was the highest for the build-up cover type (8.65-9.85 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and the lowest for forest.ConclusionsEstimated values for albedo, ET, and GPP appear reasonable for their ranges in the Kalamazoo River region and are consistent with values reported in the literature. Despite these promising results, the downscaling approach relies on strong assumptions and can carry substantial uncertainty. It is only valid at a spatial scale where similar climate, soil, and landforms exist (i.e., values in isolated patches of the same cover type are similar). Plausibly, the uncertainties associated with each estimation, as well as the model residuals, can be explored for other pattern-process relationships within the landscape.

TI  - Quantifying the high coastal dynamics of tropical mesotidal barrier island-spit systems: case study in Northeast Brazil
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to quantify the morphological variations of the tropical mesotidal barrier-spit systems (MBs) in Northeast Brazil to understand their evolution. Therefore, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images were used to construct two multitemporal analyses: one in 4-year intervals (low frequency) and another in 1-year intervals (high frequency). The results revealed that the coastal dynamic was so intense that only high-frequency analysis could represent its evolutionary behavior. Low-frequency analysis, on the other hand, could lead to the misinterpretation of the data. Despite the strong coastal dynamic, there was a long-term equilibrium in the areas occupied by the MBs. Furthermore, regarding evolutionary behavior, there were two different types of MBs: migrant and stationary. Migrant MB movement resulted from the joint actions of the meteo-oceanographic forcings that generally push the whole barrier westward, conserving its shape. The migration rate can reach 100 m per year. This process represents the visible and massive movement of sediment along the shore. The changes observed in most MBs, whether migrant or stationary, reflect their ephemeral nature and must serve as a warning for human interventions.

TI  - Determinants of tree cover in tropical floodplains
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree cover differentiates forests from savannas and grasslands. In tropical floodplains, factors differentiating these systems are poorly known, even though floodplains cover 10% of the tropical landmass. Seasonal inundation potentially presents trees with both challenges (soil anoxia) and benefits (moisture and nutrient deposition), the relative importance of which may depend on ecological context, e.g. if floods alleviate water stress more in more arid ecosystems. Here, we use remotely sensed data across 13 large tropical and sub-tropical floodplain ecosystems on five continents to show that climatic water balance (i.e. precipitation-potential evapotranspiration) strongly increases floodplain tree cover in interaction with flooding, fire and topography. As predicted, flooding increases tree cover in more arid floodplains, but decreases tree cover in climatically wetter ones. As in uplands, frequent fire reduced tree cover, particularly in wet regions, but-in contrast with uplands-lower elevation and sandier soils decreased tree cover. Our results suggest that predicting the impacts of changing climate, land use and hydrology on floodplain ecosystems depends on considering climate-disturbance interactions. While outright wetland conversion proceeds globally, additional anthropogenic activities, including alteration of fire frequencies and dam construction, will also shift floodplain tree cover, especially in wet climates.

TI  - Daily minimum temperature and precipitation control on spring phenology in arid-mountain ecosystems in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate anomaly has caused substantial shifts in phenology of mountain ecosystems, but the underlying mechanism of phenological responses to climate change is still not well understood. In essence, the abundance of vegetation communities increases the complexity of phenology-climate relationships, leading to a certain limitation in predictions of future dynamics among different vegetation types using a unified model. In this study, we focused on the climatic constraints on spring phenology in arid mountains (AMs) of China, and emphasis was laid on accurate representation of mechanisms that control phenology across different vegetation types. We Firstly explored spatio-temporal variations in satellite-derived estimates of starting date of vegetation growing season (SOS) over the period 2000-2015 using moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Phenological models in response to climate variability were then established by using mixed-effect models based on satellite observations and an extensive dataset of climatic measurements. Our results showed that the climatic regulation on SOS varied greatly over vegetation types. More climatic factors that regulate phenological development were found in grassland than forest and shrubland. At ecosystem level, two critical climate factors, daily minimum temperature (T-min) and precipitation, explained 74-95% of total variability in predicted SOS. The observed sensitivity to T-min is expected to be closely linked with the risk of frost damage, while preseason precipitation determines water availability in spring. The varying ecosystem sensitivity revealed the different resilience and adaptability to changing climate among vegetation types, which have been linked to their eco-physiological characteristics (e.g., water use efficiency) and environmental conditions (e.g., elevation). Overall, our results indicate a strong dependence of spring phenology on T-min and precipitation, and create an opportunity for a more realistic representation of vegetation phenology and growth of AM plants in China in land surface models.

TI  - Preparation of pitch-based activated carbon with surface-treated fly ash for SO<sub>2</sub> gas removal
T2  - CARBON LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fly ash consists of various metal oxides which can remove SO2 gas by the catalyst effect. When fly ash is added in the preparation process of pitch-based activated carbon, the pitch particles aggregate and fly ash is embedded in the activated carbon. To increase SO2 gas removal performance, activated carbon was prepared by surface-treated fly ash and petroleum-based pitch. Carboxyl groups were introduced into the fly ash by malic acid treatment. The introduced carboxyl groups acted as an activation agent to create micropore around the fly ash, and created micropores were exposed to the fly ash outside of the activated carbon. The exposed fly ash increased removal amount of SO2 gas by a catalytic effect of the metal oxides. The SO2 gas removal performance improved by 34% because of the catalyst effect of the exposed fly ash and improvement in the micropore structure in the activated carbon.

TI  - Seasonal Hydropower Planning for Data-Scarce Regions Using Multimodel Ensemble Forecasts, Remote Sensing Data, and Stochastic Programming
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In data-scarce regions, seasonal hydropower planning is hindered by the unavailability of reliable long-term streamflow observations, which are required for the construction of inflow scenario trees. In this study, we develop a methodological framework to overcome the problem of streamflow data scarcity by combining precipitation forecasts from ensemble numerical weather prediction models, spatially distributed hydrologic models, and stochastic programming. We use evapotranspiration as a proxy for streamflow in generating reliable reservoir inflow forecasts. Using the framework, we compare three different formulations of inflow scenario structures and their applicability to data-scarce regions: (1) a single deterministic forecast, (2) a scenario fan with the first stage deterministic, and (3) a scenario fan with all stages stochastic. We apply the framework to a cascade of two reservoirs in the Omo-Gibe River basin in Ethiopia. Future reservoir inflows are generated using a 3-model 30-member ensemble seasonal precipitation forecast from the North American Multimodel Ensemble and the Noah-MP hydrologic model. We then perform deterministic and stochastic optimization for hydropower operation and planning. Comparing the results from the three different inflow scenario structures, we observe that the uncertainty in reservoir inflows is significant only for the dry stages of the planning horizon. In addition, we find that the impact of model parameter uncertainty on hydropower production is significant (0.14-0.18x10(6) MWh).

TI  - Capability of multidate RADARSAT-2 data to identify sugarcane lodging
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane lodging monitoring in large areas is a fundamental requirement for damage reduction, yield prediction, and loss evaluation. The polarimetric features extracted from polarimetric synthetic radar aperture have proved to be sensitive to wheat lodging, but for sugarcane lodging monitoring, there are three influences that make it more complicated: heterogeneity of sugarcane scattering, variations of sugarcane growing conditions, and sugarcane growth. A process was proposed to identify sugarcane lodging. First, object-based image segmentation was applied to extract the homogeneous sugarcane fields. Complex Wishart classifier was used to identify sugarcane fields from other land cover types, and 18 polarimetric features were extracted from six consecutive RADARSAT-2 datasets. Then, monthly variations of the polarimetric features were used to overcome the influence of variations of sugarcane growing conditions. We found that it was impossible to identify the lodged sugarcane based on the data from a single date. Finally, the influence of sugarcane growth was reduced by finding the polarimetric features, for which the monthly variations before and after lodging happened were opposite. This study indicated a great potential capability of C-band RADARSAT-2 data for monitoring sugarcane lodging. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Squamous cell carcinoma of the nail bed: A case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nail bed is a poorly reported malignant subungual tumor. Because it presents with nonspecific symptoms and signs, it is frequently misdiagnosed by dermatologists or surgeons. A delay in diagnosis and/or wrong treatment might increase the possibility of disease progression. Thus, new perspectives are needed to assist dermatologists and surgeons with diagnosing and treating SCC. This rare case presented with a 2-year delay in the diagnosis of SCC teaches a valuable lesson.CASE SUMMARYA 62-year-old female presented with a non-healing subungual growth in the nail bed of the right middle finger for 2 years. The lesion was first medicated with iodine by the patient herself without any relief. Twenty months later, a dermatologist diagnosed the lesion as paronychia and treated it with nail avulsions repeatedly with no obvious alleviation. A lesionectomy confirmed the lesion was SCC. An extended excision of the tumor with amputation of the distal interphalangeal joint was subsequently performed. A biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes was negative. Due to the result of preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanning, sweeping of axillary lymph nodes was considered dispensable and was skipped. At the 2-year follow-up, the patient showed a quick recovery and no sign of recurrence.CONCLUSIONOur successful diagnosis and treatment of the case highlights the need for additional attention to long-standing non-healing lesions of the nail bed and the necessity for discreet evaluation and customization of surgical interventions.

TI  - Spatially Disaggregating Satellite Land Surface Temperature With a Nonlinear Model Across Agricultural Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is a promising tool for predicting surface evapotranspiration (ET). The spatial resolution of commonly existing daily satellite products (i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS] LST) is similar to 1 km, which remains relatively low for used in estimating ET. This paper developed a model that disaggregates similar to 1-km spatial resolution MODIS-derived LST data to fine spatial resolutions of 250 m. The proposed model was achieved by using a spatial and temporal nonlinear strategy that contains the predictor variables of the Bowen ratio, the photochemical reflectance index, and the normalized difference vegetation index. The proposed disaggregation model was assessed mainly at two agriculture sites, including the Heihe River Basin in China and the Walnut Creek Watershed in the United States, during the growing seasons. The assessment procedure was conducted at both the field scale and the image scale in terms of disaggregated LST and ET. The statistical results demonstrated that the proposed model produced 250-m LST and ET that matched better with the observed values and achieved more accurate LST and ET relative to other reference ones. Our study shows that surface moisture status and vegetation physiological dynamic are important factors in improving the LST disaggregation over the agriculture region. The results of this study have the potential to improve water resource management and sustainable water use.

TI  - Wave Retrieval Under Typhoon Conditions Using a Machine Learning Method Applied to Gaofen-3 SAR Imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial resolution of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image, a pixel size of 500 m at azimuth/flight direction for Global Observation (GLO) and 100 m for Wide ScanSAR (WSC) modes, is relatively coarse, and waves shorter than 100 m are undetectable. In this study, SAR images collected under typhoon conditions by the GF-3 mission are exploited for wave retrieval purposes. In detail, six imagery collected during 2017 and 2018 over the China Seas captured four typhoons. The GLO and WSC modes images are collocated with simulated wave fields using a numeric wave model, called WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) and are processed using a machine learning method to retrieve sea surface waves. In this work, the criterion for the training completion in the process of machine learning is set as 0.15 m of Root mean Square Error (RMSE) for the Significant Wave Height (SWH). Then, the retrieved SWH is compared with measurements collected by the Jason-2 altimeter, showing a 0.61 m RMSE. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform empirical approaches developed to retrieve the SWH using GF-3 SAR imagery acquired in the GLO and WSC imaging modes.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lymph node metastases significantly worsen the prognosis in cervical carcinoma. Risk factors-pathological and patient related-could select patients at high risk for lymph node involvement. Methods This retrospective analysis was performed by analyzing data from patients with cervical carcinoma treated between 2000 and 2017 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University Hospital Ulm. Results In total, 261 patients with cervical carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA-IIB) and lymphadenectomy with at least 10 removed lymph nodes were available for analysis. Overall, 86 (33.0%) patients had lymph node metastases; 73 patients had pelvic lymph node metastases only and 13 patients had both pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases. Lymph node metastases were found most often in the region of the external iliac artery and obturator fossa, with 57.0% and 54.7% of all 86 node-positive patients, respectively. Univariable analyses showed that presence of lymph node metastases was significantly associated with both preoperative FIGO stage (p = 0.001) and final pathological tumor stage (p < 0.001), status of resection margin (p = 0.002), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), (p < 0.001) and vascular space invasion, (p < 0.001). In a multivariable logistic regression model with presence of lymph node metastases (yes/no) as binary response variable, only LVSI (p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI), (p = 0.035) remained as significant independent predictors of lymph node involvement. Subgroup analyses showed that LVSI was a significant predictive factor for lymph node involvement in patients with a preoperatively assessed FIGO stage < IIB (p < 0.001), but not for patients with a preoperatively assessed FIGO stage >= IIB (p = 0.122). Conclusions The risk factor LVSI should play an important role in deciding whether an individualized therapy concept is based on escalating or deescalating treatment. In future, the sentinel concept could reduce morbidity and at the same time provide an important prognostic assessment for a subset of cervical cancer patients.

T2  - APSIPA TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has demonstrated its superiority in computer vision. Landsat images have specific characteristics compared with natural images. The spectral and texture features of the same class vary along with the imaging conditions. In this paper, we extend the use of deep learning to remote sensing image classification to large geographical regions, and explore a way to make deep learning classifiers transferable for different regions. We take Jingjinji region and Henan province in China as the study areas, and choose FCN, ResNet, and PSPNet as classifiers. The models are trained by different proportions of training samples from Jingjinji region. Then we use the trained models to predict results of the study areas. Experimental results show that the overall accuracy decreases when trained by small samples, but the recognition ability on mislabeled areas increases. All methods can obtain great performance when used to Jingjinji region while they all need to be fine-tuned with newtraining samples from Henan province, due to the reason that images of Henan province have different spectral features from the original trained area.

TI  - The impact of rapid urban expansion on coastal mangroves: a case study in Guangdong Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves serve many important ecological functions and consequently represent a dominant coastal ecosystem. However, coastal regions are very susceptible to ecological damage due to their high population density, urban expansion being one of the most important influencing factors. Accordingly, it is vital to ascertain how urban expansion endangers mangrove ecosystems. This study used the decision-tree classification method based on classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm to extract areas of mangrove and built-up land from Landsat images. A correlation analysis was performed between the change in the area of mangroves and the change in the area of built-up land at the cell scale. This study aimed to reveal the magnitude of the influence of urban expansion on mangrove forests in different periods and in different regions, and to identify the places that are seriously affected by urban expansion. The results demonstrate that this approach can be used to quantitatively analyze the impact of urban expansion on mangrove forests, and show that larger areas of mangrove were affected by urban expansion in the past 30 years. The effects of urban expansion were stronger over time, with approximately 12% of cells containing mangroves showing a negative correlation between the increase in the area of built-up land and the change in the area of mangrove forests to different degrees from 2005 to 2015. The same quantitative analysis was also carried out in three subregions of Guangdong Province, namely western Guangdong Province, the Pearl River Delta, and eastern Guangdong Province. It was found that the situations in these three regions were very different due to discrepancies in the distribution of mangroves, the rate of urban expansion, and the awareness of the local government regarding environmental protection. These results can assist in the management of coastal cities and the protection of mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of Temperature and Precipitation on the Vegetation Dynamics of High and Moderate Altitude Natural Forests in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the high-altitude vegetation dynamics of natural forest cover were analyzed to find the effect of local hydrology for about 10 years. Vegetation dynamics in four different topographical and climatic conditions in India were studied using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from vegetation sensor of SPOT satellite, and daily temperature and precipitation data from Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation project. The main objective was to understand how and to what extent the natural vegetation reciprocates in various climatic conditions. First, the vegetation data was denoised by using empirical mode decomposition technique. The relation between the vegetation growth and hydrological parameters was studied to find the anomalies. Then, the wavelet analysis of the hydrological data was carried out to find the frequency and extent of the anomalies. Finally, nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Sen's slope analysis were applied to find the trend of the vegetation, temperature, and precipitation dynamics. Results indicate that the growth of the vegetation starts when the average temperature is 10 degrees C or higher. Beyond that the increase in temperature may have a negligible effect on growth of vegetation. The vegetation also shows positive change in monthly NDVI with the increase in precipitation depending forest type and local climate. However, with excessive rainfall, a declining trend in vegetation growth was observed. The NDVI data show positive trend in all four sites. In northern region, the temperature showed positive trend, while precipitation had negative trend. In eastern and western regions, the temperature had negative trend and precipitation had positive trend.

TI  - Sixty years since the creation of Lake Kariba: Thermal and oxygen dynamics in the riverine and lacustrine sub-basins
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current boom of dam construction at low latitudes endangers the integrity and function of major tropical river systems. A deeper understanding of the physical and chemical functioning of tropical reservoirs is essential to mitigate dam-related impacts. However, the development of predictive tools is hampered by a lack of consistent data on physical mixing and biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs. In this study, we focus on Lake Kariba (Southern Africa), the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam forms a transboundary reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and therefore its management represents a socio-politically sensitive issue because the Kariba Dam operation completely changed the downstream hydrological regime. Although Lake Kariba represents a unique and scientifically interesting case study, there is no consistent dataset documenting its physical and chemical behaviour over time. This limits the scope for quantitative studies of this reservoir and its downstream impacts. To address this research gap, we aggregated a consistent database of in situ measurements of temperature and oxygen depth profiles for the entire 60 years of Lake Kariba's lifetime and performed a detailed statistical analysis of the thermal and oxygen regime of the artificial lake to classify the different behaviours of the lake's sub-basins. We demonstrate that the seasonal stratification strongly depends on the depth of the water column and on the distance from the lake inflow. Satellite data confirm these spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, and reveal a consistent longitudinal warming trend of the lake surface water temperature of about 1.5 degrees C from the inflow to the dam. Finally, our results suggest that the stratification dynamics of the lacustrine sub-basins have the potential to alter the downstream Zambezi water quality. Future research should focus on assessing such alterations and developing strategies to mitigate them.

TI  - Effect of PM2.5 on macrosomia in China: A nationwide prospective cohort study
T2  - PEDIATRIC OBESITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Macrosomia is associated with both neonatal complications and adult diseases (obesity, diabetes mellitus, etc.). Previous studies have reported maternal exposure to PM2.5 might influence metabolism and fetal development and cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. Studies conducted in areas with low PM2.5 concentration have found relationship between gestational PM2.5 exposure and birth weight. However, the impact of air pollution on macrosomia has not been studied, especially in highly polluted areas. Objective To evaluate the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during pregnancy and the risk of macrosomia. Methods Data from preconception health examination and prenatal and postnatal records were collected from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 in the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project. Monthly mean of PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy was estimated from satellite data using an ensemble machine learning model. A newborn with birth weight above 4000 g was defined as macrosomia. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between maternal exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of macrosomia, after adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, neonatal sex, duration of gestation, seasonality, educational level, smoking and drinking habits, past history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and family history of diabetes mellitus. Restricted cubic spline models were used to evaluate the dose-response relationship between the risk of macrosomia and PM2.5 concentration. Results Of 177 841 singleton nonlow birth weight newborns included, 14 598 (8.2%) had macrosomia. The mean PM2.5 concentrations were 70.7, 71.5, and 80.9 mu g/m(3) in the first, second, and third trimesters. In full-adjusted logistic regression models, significant associations were found between increased risk of macrosomia and every 10 mu g/m(3) increase of PM2.5 concentration over the first (odds ratio [OR]: 1.045; 95% CI, 1.037-1.052), second (OR: 1.035; 95% CI, 1.028-1.043), and third (OR: 1.033; 95% CI, 1.026-1.039) trimesters. There was a nonlinear does-response association between PM2.5 concentration and the risk of macrosomia. Conclusions Maternal exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of macrosomia in China.

TI  - Investigating the assimilation of CALIPSO global aerosol vertical observations using a four-dimensional ensemble Kalman filter
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol vertical information is critical to quantify the influences of aerosol on the climate and environment; however, large uncertainties still persist in model simulations. In this study, the vertical aerosol extinction coefficients from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) are assimilated to optimize the hourly aerosol fields of the Non-hydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) online coupled with the Spectral Radiation Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) using a four-dimensional local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4-D LETKF). A parallel assimilation experiment using bias-corrected aerosol optical thicknesses (AOTs) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is conducted to investigate the effects of assimilating the observations (and whether to include vertical information) on the model performances. Additionally, an experiment simultaneously assimilating both CALIOP and MODIS observations is conducted. The assimilation experiments are successfully performed for 1 month, making it possible to evaluate the results in a statistical sense. The hourly analyses are validated via both the CALIOP-observed aerosol vertical extinction coefficients and the AOT observations from MODIS and the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Our results reveal that both the CALIOP and MODIS assimilations can improve the model simulations. The CALIOP assimilation is superior to the MODIS assimilation in modifying the incorrect aerosol vertical distributions and reproducing the real magnitudes and variations, and the joint CALIOP and MODIS assimilation can further improve the simulated aerosol vertical distribution. However, the MODIS assimilation can better reproduce the AOT distributions than the CALIOP assimilation, and the inclusion of the CALIOP observations has an insignificant impact on the AOT analysis. This is probably due to the nadir-viewing CALIOP having much sparser coverage than MODIS. The assimilation efficiencies of CALIOP decrease with increasing distances of the overpass time, indicating that more aerosol vertical observation platforms are required to fill the sensor-specific observation gaps and hence improve the aerosol vertical data assimilation.

TI  - Guns, identity, and nationhood
T2  - PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides a theoretical perspective on the symbolic meaning of the right to bear arms in modern America, especially among its conservative movement. Neglecting this issue, scholarship on gun symbolism has commonly focused on guns possessed by offenders in inner-cities, such as juveniles or gang members. Offering a multidisciplinary and comparative outlook, the article explains how guns have become symbols of a worldview under which armed patriots must stand ready to defend America from "tyranny," "big government," "socialism," and other existential threats. In particular, the U.S. conservative movement does not merely perceive the right to bear arms as a means of self-defense against criminals, but as a safeguard against an oppressive government that "patriots" may have to overthrow by force. The article examines the hypothesis that guns foster a sense of belonging in this conception of nationhood. This worldview is not solely limited to politicians, elites, or activists, as it can encompass rank-and-file conservatives. Group identification can rest on sharing radical beliefs that enhance cohesion, including rallying against perceived threats. This mindset helps explain resistance to elementary reforms to regulate firearms. If one believes that an unbridled right to bear arms is not only key to protecting the United States, but also key to what it means to be an American, concessions on gun control become difficult to envision. While conservatives in other Western democracies tend to support significant gun control, a key dimension of American exceptionalism is the relative normalization of a conservative identity in which firearms have acquired a peculiar symbolic value.

TI  - A Pilot Study on the Use of Indocyanine Green Near-Infrared Technique for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Endometrial Cancers in Singapore
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We report our initial experience with indocyanine green (ICG) with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in clinical stage I endometrial cancer. Methods: A single center prospective cohort study was carried out from November 2015 to February 2017. Patients with clinically early endometrial cancer undergoing laparoscopic staging surgery and without computed tomography evidence of distant metastases or lymphadenopathy were recruited. The cervical route was utilized for the ICG injection. The SLN was harvested first followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Results: A total of 35 patients were included in the study. Seven patients opted not to have systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. The median lymph node count was 18 nodes and the median number of SLNs harvested was 2 per patient. The overall detection rate was 97% (34/35) and bilateral mapping in 88.6% (31/35). There were two patients (5.7%) with positive pelvic lymph nodes and both were identified through SLN biopsy. There were no false negative cases. Four patients (11.4%) were upstaged to stage II or stage IIIC1. There were no allergic reactions or operative complications related to ICG use. Conclusion: The role of SLN mapping through ICG-NIR fluorescence imaging in clinical stage I endometrial cancer is highly promising and it appears to be a viable alternative to complete lymphadenectomy for surgical staging.

TI  - Using Overshooting Top Area to Discriminate Potential for Large, Intense Tornadoes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent work established strong links between storm updraft width and the tornado intensity, suggesting that updraft width could be used to gauge potential tornado intensity. It was also posited that overshooting top area (OTA) could be used as an analog for updraft width and, thus, as a means to assess potential tornado intensity in observed storms. The implementation of new high-resolution GOES-R series satellites presents a unique opportunity to investigate these findings in severe weather observations. Herein, a method using GOES-16 longwave infrared satellite data to quantify OTA of tornadic storms is explored. A comparison between observed tornado strength and OTA yields a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.54). These results show the potential of these quantifications to be used with real-time observations of tornadic storms, irrespective of storm mode, seasonality, or geographic location, allowing forecasters to determine which storms pose the highest risk to life and property.

TI  - Developing a Community of Practice for Applied Uses of Future PACE Data to Address Marine Food Security Challenges
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission will include a hyperspectral imaging radiometer to advance ecosystem monitoring beyond heritage retrievals of the concentration of surface chlorophyll and other traditional ocean color variables, offering potential for novel science and applications. PACE is the first NASA ocean color mission to occur under the agency's new and evolving effort to directly engage practical end users prior to satellite launch to increase adoption of this freely available data toward societal challenges. Here we describe early efforts to engage a community of practice around marine food-related resource management, business decisions, and policy analysis. Obviously one satellite cannot meet diverse end user needs at all scales and locations, but understanding downstream needs helps in the assessment of information gaps and planning how to optimize the unique strengths of PACE data in combination with the strengths of other satellite retrievals, in situ measurements, and models. Higher spectral resolution data from PACE can be fused with information from satellites with higher spatial or temporal resolution, plus other information, to enable identification and tracking of new marine biological indicators to guide sustainable management. Accounting for the needs of applied researchers as well as non-traditional users of satellite data early in the PACE mission process will ultimately serve to broaden the base of informed users and facilitate faster adoption of the most advanced science and technology toward the challenge of mitigating food insecurity.

TI  - Satellite-based monitoring of groundwater depletion in California's Central Valley
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Range change data, obtained from Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites, form the basis for estimates of aquifer volume change in California's Central Valley. The estimation algorithm incorporates a function penalizing changes far from known well locations, linking the aquifer volume changes to agricultural, industrial, and municipal pumping within the Tulare basin. We show that the range changes are compatible with the hypothesis that the source of aquifer volume changes are variations in effective pressure around documented wells. Specifically, inclusion of the well distance penalty does not degrade the fit to the observations, inversions with and without it both give variance reductions of 99.6%. The patterns of aquifer volume change vary significantly from the drought year, between October 2015 and October 2016, to a wet year in 2017, and into 2018, a year with near average rainfall. The 2.3 million acre-feet of estimated volume reduction, a lower bound on the amount of water extracted from the basin between October 2015 and 2016, agrees with independent estimates of 1.8 and 2.3 million acrefeet. The aquifer volume reduction is also compatible with a loss of 3.1 km(3) (2.5 million acre-feet) in groundwater volume derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data.

TI  - Size of Sentinel Node Metastasis Predicts Non-sentinel Node Involvement in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To analyze the relationship between the size of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and the risk of non-sentinel lymph node (non-SLN) metastasis in endometrial cancer. Patients and Methods From a total of 328 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent SLN mapping from January 2013 to April 2019, 142 patients also underwent systematic completion pelvic +/- paraaortic node dissections, and they form the basis of this study. The SLNs were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) when the hematoxylin-eosin stain was negative. Results The median age was 60 years. The overall detection rate for SLNs was 87.5%, and bilateral SLNs were observed in 66.2%, with a median of 2 SLNs resected (range 1-8). Twenty-nine (20.4%) cases had positive SLNs, with a median of one positive SLN. Regarding the size of SLN metastasis, 5 (3.5%) cases had isolated tumor cells (ITCs), 13 (9.2%) had micrometastases, and 11 (7.7%) had macrometastases. Notably, 14/29 (48.3%) had node metastases that were detected after IHC. Eight (27.6%) patients had positive non-SLNs, with a median count of 7 positive nodes (range 2-23). Regarding the size of SLN metastasis, non-SLN involvement was not present in cases with ITC (0/5) but was present in 15.4% (2/13) of cases with micrometastases and 54.5% (6/11) of cases with macrometastases. The only risk factor for positive non-SLNs was the size of SLN metastasis. Conclusions Our data suggest that size of SLN metastasis is associated with the risk of non-SLN metastasis. No patients with ITCs in SLNs had another metastatic lymph node in this study.

TI  - Marine top predators as climate and ecosystem sentinels
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The rapid pace of environmental change in the Anthropocene necessitates the development of a new suite of tools for measuring ecosystem dynamics. Sentinel species can provide insight into ecosystem function, identify hidden risks to human health, and predict future change. As sentinels, marine apex (top) predators offer a unique perspective into ocean processes, given that they can move across ocean basins and amplify trophic information across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Because use of the terms "ecosystem sentinel" and "climate sentinel" has proliferated in the scientific literature, there is a need to identify the properties that make marine predators effective sentinels. We provide a clear definition of the term "sentinel", review the attributes of species identified as sentinels, and describe how a suite of such sentinels could strengthen our understanding and management of marine ecosystems. We contend that the use of marine predators as ecosystem sentinels will enable rapid response and adaptation to ecosystem variability and change.

AB  - Remote sensing can advance the work of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program through monitoring of satellite-derived terrestrial and marine physical and ecological variables. Standardized data facilitate an unbiased comparison across variables and environments. Using MODIS standard products of land surface temperature, percent snow covered area, NDVI, EVI, phenology, burned area, marine chlorophyll, CDOM, sea surface temperature, and marine primary productivity, significant trends were observed in almost all variables between 2000 and 2017. Analysis of seasonal data revealed significant breakpoints in temporal trends. Within the terrestrial environment, data showed significant increasing trends in land surface temperature and NDVI. In the marine environment, significant increasing trends were detected in primary productivity. Significantly earlier onset of green up date was observed in bioclimate subzones C&E and longer end of growing season in B&E. Terrestrial and marine parameters showed similar rates of change with unidirectional change in terrestrial and significant directional and magnitude shifts in marine.

TI  - Acral malignant melanoma; emphasis on the primary metastasis and the usefulness of preoperative ultrasound for sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the most common primary metastatic location of acral malignant melanoma and to evaluate the usefulness of preoperative ultrasound for sentinel lymph node metastasis. Ninety-eight Korean acral malignant melanoma patients were enrolled. Acral malignant melanoma was present in 76 lower limbs and in 22 upper limbs. The most common origin location was the sole (33.7%). The most common location of primary metastasis was loco-regional recurrence (22/34, 64.7%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of preoperative sentinel lymph node ultrasound was 29.1%, 94.6%, 63.6%, and 80.5%, respectively. We postulate the unusefulness of preoperative ultrasound for sentinel lymph node metastasis in acral malignant melanoma.

TI  - Retrieval of aerosol components directly from satellite and ground-based measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel methodology for the remote monitoring of aerosol components over large spatial and temporal domains. The concept is realized within the GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) algorithm to directly infer aerosol components from the measured radiances. The observed aerosols are assumed to be mixtures of hydrated soluble particles embedded with black carbon, brown carbon, iron oxide, and other (non-absorbing) insoluble inclusions. The complex refractive indices of the dry components are fixed a priori (although the refractive index of the soluble host is allowed to vary with hydration), and the complex refractive indices of the mixture are computed using mixing rules. The volume fractions of these components are derived along with the size distribution and the fraction of spherical particles, as well as the spectral surface reflectance in cases when the satellite data are inverted. The retrieval is implemented as a statistically optimized fit in a continuous space of solutions. This contrasts with most conventional approaches in which the type of aerosol is either associated with a preassumed aerosol model that is included in a set of lookup tables, or determined from the analysis of the retrieved aerosol optical parameters (e.g., single scattering albedo, refractive index, among others, provided by the AERONET retrieval algorithm); here, we retrieve the aerosol components explicitly. The approach also bridges directly to the quantities used in global chemical transport models. We first tested the approach with synthetic data to estimate the uncertainty, and then applied it to real ground-based AERONET and spaceborne POLDER/PARASOL observations; thus, the study presents a first attempt to derive aerosol components from satellite observations specifically tied to global chemical transport model quantities. Our results indicate aerosol optical characteristics that are highly consistent with standard products (e.g., R of similar to 0.9 for aerosol optical thickness) and demonstrate an ability to separate intrinsic optical properties of fine- and coarse-sized aerosols. We applied our method to POLDER/PARASOL radiances on the global scale and obtained spatial and temporal patterns of the aerosol components that agree well with existing knowledge on aerosol sources and transport features. Finally, we discuss limitations and perspectives of this new technique.

TI  - Land surface temperature variability across India: a remote sensing satellite perspective
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in the surface energy budget computation and land surface process studies. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites provide comprehensive global LST estimates at a fine spatial resolution. The MODIS products were recently upgraded to Collection 6, and shown to be more accurate than its predecessor Collection 5 products. In this study, LST and its variability have been examined across India from Collection 6 of the Aqua MODIS data at 0.05 degrees spatial resolution for the period of 2003 to 2017. All-India mean LST characteristics show distinctive features as compared to the well-documented mean characteristics of near-surface air temperature. All land cover types except permanent snow and ice, and cold desert areas exhibit bimodal peaks in seasonal variations of daytime LST. The daytime LST over the coldest and high-altitude regions of northern India shows anomalous positive linear relationship with NDVI at a monthly scale. However, monthly domain-mean daytime LST of cropland regions is largely negatively correlated with NDVI as compared to other land cover types. Results reveal that about 17% of the Indian landmass received its hottest LST during 2010 followed by 2016. Linear trend analysis for the 15-year period of mean annual LST shows a decrease in diurnal temperature range over most parts of the country due to rather rapid increase in nighttime LST than daytime LST, similar as changes in near-surface air temperature across the country.

TI  - New analytical solution and associated software for computing full-tensor gravitational field due to irregularly shaped bodies
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new analytical solution to compute the full-tensor gravity gradient due to a body mass of uniform density with arbitrary geometry. The solution is an extension of an existing analytical computation of gravitational anomalies of a polyhedron source, based on a transition of the general expressions from surface to line integrals. These developments enable the computation of the gravity gradient tensor using the same simple procedures as the gravitational field. The method is validated by comparing with a closed analytical solution, including on/in the near field of the body surface. The algorithm is implemented in the freely available MATLAB-based software called Gal Eotvos Earth Calculator. It is tested successfully for various measurement distances and body mass sizes, enabling applications from local geophysical prospecting to global topographic effect for satellite data. Due to its flexibility, the new solution, and the associated software, is particularly well suited for joint analyses of all types of gravity measurements regardless of the extent, altitude and irregularity of their spatial distribution.

TI  - Assessing changes of urban vegetation cover and aboveground carbon stocks using LiDAR and Landsat imagery data in Auckland, New Zealand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation can help to offset carbon emissions. However, urban vegetation cover is vulnerable to urbanization. This study attempts to detect the change in vegetation cover and to quantify its impact on aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks in Auckland, New Zealand, between 1989 and 2014. Field-measured vegetation parameters were used to calculate the amount of carbon stored in plants at the plot-level. Plot-level AGC stocks were linked with vegetation spectral/structural features derived from Landsat images and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. These data were also used to map vegetation cover and to estimate AGC stock. Vegetation cover decreased from 394.0 km(2) in 1989 to 379.4 km(2) in 2014. AGC stock in 1989 was estimated at 1,001,184 Mg C from Landsat 4 data. The total AGC in 2014 was estimated at 1,459,530 Mg C from Landsat 8 data. Thus, total AGC stock increased by 458,346 Mg C (45.8%) in spite of a 3.7% decrease in vegetation cover (14.6 km(2)) during the same period. The increase in AGC stock was derived partly from tree growth and tree plantings. Vegetation growth contributed more to the increase in AGC stock than its gain from non-vegetation to vegetation changes. The AGC stored in trees and shrubs estimated at 1,333,011 Mg C from the 2014 Landsat data is 5.7% lower than 1,414,607 Mg C estimated from the 2013 LiDAR data, due to the inability of optical imagery to capture the sub-canopy structure of forests and the saturation effect. Thus, LiDAR data provided a more accurate estimate of AGC stock, especially when the stock density is high (e.g. >97.9 Mg C ha(-1)).

TI  - A multi-sensor-based evaluation of the morphometric characteristics of Opa river basin in Southwest Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have shown that many river basins in the sub-Saharan Africa are largely unmonitored, partly because they are poorly or totally ungauged. In this study, remote sensing products (Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer; ASTER and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; SRTM) that are freely available in the region were harnessed for the monitoring of Opa river basin in southwestern Nigeria. The remote sensing products were complementarily used with topographical sheets (1:50,000), ground based observation and global positioning systems to determine selected morphometric characteristics as well as changes in landuse/landcover and its impact on peak runoff in the Opa river basin. Results showed that the basin is a 5(th) order basin whose land area has been subjected to different natural and anthropogenic influences within the study period. Urbanisation is a major factor that threatens the basin with degradation and observed changes, and the threats are expected to become worse if restoration is not considered from some tributaries. The study concluded that commentary use of available remote sensing products in the region will provide an important level of decision support information for management and monitoring of river basins.

TI  - Monitoring water quality in two dammed reservoirs from multispectral satellite data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing relatively fine spatial resolution multispectral data, Landsat-8, Landsat-7 (L8 and L7, respectively) and Sentinel-2 (S2) from 2013 to 2018 have been used in this study for enabling high-frequency monitoring of water quality of two small (the smaller with an area of 1.6 km(2)) freshwater dammed reservoirs. Located in Sardinia (Italy) and Crete (Greek), respectively, Mulargia and Aposelemis represent vital resources to supply drinking water in downstream valleys. A total of 400 cloud-free satellite images were turned into information on water quality by using an image processing chain implementing physically based methods for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), turbidity, Secchi disk depth (SDD) and surface water temperature. These estimates have been successfully validated (the lower Pearson correlation r was 0.88 for Chl-a) with 23 match-ups of in situ and satellite data. Results of the multi-temporal analyses showed a decrease of SDD due to the increase of Chl-a in Aposelemis or an increase of turbidity in Mulargia. For both freshwater reservoirs, the satellite-derived trophic state index assigned both lakes to mesotrophic conditions. The results finally suggested the effectiveness of S2 and Landsat in increasing, for the latest investigated years, the frequency of observations.

TI  - Understanding satellite-derived bathymetry using Sentinel 2 imagery and spatial prediction models
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite data is an efficient and complementary method to hydrographic surveys for deriving bathymetry in shallow coastal waters. Empirical approaches (in particular, the models of Stumpf and Lyzenga) provide a practical methodology to derive bathymetric information from remote sensing. Recent studies, however, have focused on enhancing the performance of such empirical approaches by extending them via spatial information. In this study, the relationship between multibeam depth and Sentinel-2 image bands was analyzed in an optically complex environment using the spatial predictor of kriging with an external drift (KED), where its external drift component was estimated: a) by a ratio of log-transformed bands based on Stumpf's model (KED_S) and b) by a log-linear transform based on Lyzenga's model (KED_L). Through the calibration of KED models, the study objectives were: 1) to better understand the empirical relationship between Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite reflectance and depth, 2) to test the robustness of KED to derive bathymetry in a multitemporal series of Sentinel-2 images and multibeam data, and 3) to compare the performance of KED against the existing non-spatial models described by Stumpf et al. and Lyzenga. Results showed that KED could improve prediction accuracy with a decrease in RMSE of 89% and 88%, and an increase in R-2 of 27% and 14%, over the Stumpf and Lyzenga models, respectively. The decrease in RMSE provides a worthwhile improvement in accuracy, where results showed effective prediction of depth up to 6 m. However, the presence of higher concentrations of suspended materials, especially river plumes, can reduce this threshold to 4 m. As would be expected, prediction accuracy could be improved through the removal of outliers, which were mainly located in the channel of the river, areas influenced by the river plume, abrupt topography, but also very shallow areas close to the shoreline. These areas have been identified as conflictive zones where satellite-derived bathymetry can be compromised.

A1  - NASH Clinical Res Network
TI  - A Pilot Genome-Wide Analysis Study Identifies Loci Associated With Response to Obeticholic Acid in Patients With NASH
T2  - HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A significantly higher proportion of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who received obeticholic acid (OCA) had histological improvement relative to placebo in the FLINT (farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for noncirrhotic, NASH treatment) trial. However, genetic predictors of response to OCA are unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in FLINT participants to identify variants associated with NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. Genotyping was performed using the Omni2.5 content GWAS chip. To avoid false positives introduced by population stratification, we focused our GWAS on white participants. Six regions on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 15, and 17 had multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive association (P 10-4) with NASH resolution. A sentinel SNP, rs75508464, near CELA3B on chromosome 1 was associated with NASH resolution, improvement in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score, portal inflammation, and fibrosis. Among individuals carrying this allele, 83% achieved NASH resolution with OCA compared with only 33% with placebo. Eight regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 11, 13, and 18 had multiple SNPs associated with fibrosis improvement; of these, rs12130403 near TDRD10 on chromosome 1 was also associated with improvement in NASH and portal inflammation, and rs4073431 near ANO3 on chromosome 11 was associated with NASH resolution and improvement in steatosis. Multiple SNPs on chromosome 11 had suggestive association with pruritus, with rs1379650 near ANO5 being the top SNP. Conclusion: We identified several variants that may be associated with histological improvement and pruritus in individuals with NASH receiving OCA. The rs75508464 variant near CELA3B may have the most significant effect on NASH resolution in those receiving OCA.

TI  - Satellite Data-Based 3-D Simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability and Induced Magnetic Reconnection at the Earth's Magnetopause
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a 3-D two-fluid simulation using plasma parameters as measured by MMS on 8 September 2015 concerning the nonlinear development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the Earth's magnetopause. We observe an extremely rich nonlinear dynamics including the development of a complex magnetic topology, vortex merging, and secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability driven by large-scale vortices distributed asymmetrically in latitude. Vortex induced and midlatitude magnetic reconnection coexist and produce an asymmetric distribution of magnetic reconnection events. These results are in good agreement with MMS observations on the same day, in particular for the presence of both equatorial and off-equator reconnection. Regarding the latter only, we note a predominance of reconnection in the Southern Hemisphere during the early nonlinear phase. The estimated effective diffusion coefficient associated with the dynamics is found to be large enough to account for the observed mass transport at the Earth's magnetospheric flanks.

TI  - Introduction of Variable Correlation for the Improved Retrieval of Crop Traits Using Canopy Reflectance Model Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Look-up table (LUT)-based canopy reflectance models are considered robust methods to estimate vegetation attributes from remotely sensed data. However, the LUT inversion approach is sensitive to measurements and model uncertainties, which raise the ill-posed inverse problem. Therefore, regularization options are needed to mitigate this problem and reduce the uncertainties of estimates. In this study, we introduce a new method to regularize the LUT inversion approach to improve the accuracy of biophysical parameters (leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (fCover)). This was achieved by incorporating known variable correlations that existed at the test site into the LUT approach to correlate the model variables of the Soil-Leaf-Canopy (SLC) model using the Cholesky decomposition algorithm. The retrievals of 27 potato plots obtained from the regularized LUT (LUTreg) were compared with the standard LUT (LUTstd), which did not consider variable correlations. Different solutions from both types of LUTs (LUTreg and LUTstd) were utilized to improve the quality of the model outputs. Results indicate that the present method improved the accuracy of LAI estimation, with the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.74 and normalized root-mean-square error NRMSE = 24.45% in LUTreg, compared with R-2 = 0.71 and NRMSE = 25.57% in LUTstd. In addition, the variability of LAI decreased in LUTreg (5.10) compared with that in LUTstd (12.10). Hence, our results give new insight into the impact of adding the correlation between variables to the LUT inversion approach to improve the accuracy of estimations. In this study, only two correlated variables (LAI and fCover) were examined; in subsequent studies, the full correlation matrix based on the Cholesky algorithm should be explored.

TI  - Effects of radiotherapy on plasma energy metabolites in patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is employed in patients with breast cancer (BC) with the aim of reducing tumor burden and improving surgical outcomes. We evaluated the levels of energy metabolites pre- and post-radiotherapy (RT) in breast cancer (BC) patients who previously received NACT and investigated the alterations of these metabolites in relation to the patient achieving a pathologic complete response to NACT. Materials and methods We included 37 BC patients who were treated with NACT following surgery and analyzed the concentrations of energy balance-related metabolites using targeted metabolomics before and one month after the end of RT. The control group was composed of 44 healthy women. Results Pre-radiotherapy, patients had significant decreases in the plasma levels of 12 metabolites. RT corrected these alterations and the improvement was superior in patients with a pathologic complete response. Conclusion Our results highlight the importance of metabolism in the outcomes of patients with BC.

TI  - Comparison and Validation of the Ionospheric Climatological Morphology of FY3C/GNOS with COSMIC during the Recent Low Solar Activity Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the accumulation of the ionospheric radio occultation (IRO) data observed by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) occultation sounder (GNOS) onboard FengYun-3C (FY3C) satellite, it is possible to use GNOS IRO data for ionospheric climatology research. Therefore, this work aims to validate the feasibility of FY3C/GNOS IRO products in climatology research by comparison with that of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), laying the foundation for its application in climatology study. Since previous verification works of FY3C/GNOS were done by comparison with ionosondes, this work matched NmF2/hmF2 of FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC into data pairs to verify the profile-level accuracy of FY3C/GNOS IRO data. The statistical results show that the overall correlation coefficients of both NmF2 and hmF2 are above 0.9, the overall bias and std of NmF2 differences between FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC are -2.19% and 17.48%, respectively, and the bias and std of hmF2 differences are -3.29 and 18.01 km, respectively, indicating a high profile-level precision consistency between FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC. In ionospheric climatology comparison, we divided NmF2/hmF2 of FY3C/GNOS into four seasons, then presented the season median NmF2/hmF2 in 5 degrees x 10 degrees grids and compared them with that of COSMIC. The results show that the ionospheric climatological characteristics of FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC are highly matched, both showing the typical climatological features such as equatorial ionosphere anomaly (EIA), winter anomaly, semiannual anomaly, Weddell Sea anomaly (WSA) and so on, though minor discrepancies do exist like the differences in magnitude of longitude peak structures and WSA, which verifies the reliability of FY3C/GNOS IRO products in ionospheric climatology research.

TI  - Temporal Decorrelation of C-Band Backscatter Coefficient in Mediterranean Burned Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burned area algorithms from radar images are often based on temporal differences between pre- and post-fire backscatter values. However, such differences may occur long past the fire event, an effect known as temporal decorrelation. Improvements in radar-based burned areas monitoring depend on a better understanding of the temporal decorrelation effects as well as its sources. This paper analyses the temporal decorrelation of the Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient over burned areas in Mediterranean ecosystems. Several environmental variables influenced the radar scattering such as fire severity, post-fire vegetation recovery, water content, soil moisture, and local slope and aspect were analyzed. The ensemble learning method random forests was employed to estimate the importance of these variables to the decorrelation process by land cover classes. Temporal decorrelation was observed for over 32% of the burned pixels located within the study area. Fire severity, vegetation water content, and soil moisture were the main drivers behind temporal decorrelation processes and are of the utmost importance for areas detected as burned immediately after fire events. When burned areas were detected long after fire (decorrelated areas), due to reduced backscatter coefficient variations between pre- to post-fire acquisitions, water content (soil and vegetation) was the main driver behind the backscatter coefficient changes. Therefore, for efficient synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring of burned areas, detection, and mapping algorithms need to account for the interaction between fire impact and soil and vegetation water content.

TI  - On the Interest of Optical Remote Sensing for Seasonal Snowmelt Parameterization, Applied to the Everest Region (Nepal)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the central part of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region, snowmelt is one of the main inputs that ensures the availability of surface water outside the monsoon period. A common approach for snowpack modeling is based on the degree day factor (DDF) method to represent the snowmelt rate. However, the important seasonal variability of the snow processes is usually not represented when using a DDF method, which can lead to large uncertainties for snowpack simulation. The SPOT-VGT and the MODIS-Terra sensors provide valuable information for snow detection over several years. The aim of this work was to use those data to parametrize the seasonal variability of the snow processes in the hydrological distributed snow model (HDSM), based on a DDF method. The satellite products were corrected and combined in order to implement a database of 8 day snow cover area (SCA) maps over the northern part of the Dudh Koshi watershed (Nepal) for the period 1998-2017. A revisited version of the snow module of the HDSM model was implemented so as to split it into two parameterizations depending on the seasonality. Corrected 8 day SCA maps retrieved from MODIS-Terra were used to calibrate the seasonal parameterization, through a stochastic method, over the period of study (2013-2016). The results demonstrate that the seasonal parameterization reduces the error in the simulated SCA and increases the correlation with the MODIS SCA. The two-set version of the model improved the yearly RMSE from 5.9% to 7.7% depending on the basin, compared to the one-set version. The correlation between the model and MODIS passes from 0.73 to 0.79 in winter for the larger basin, Phakding. This study shows that the use of a remote sensing product can improve the parameterization of the seasonal dynamics of snow processes in a model based on a DDF method.

TI  - Bi-Directional Reflectance Factor Determination of the Railroad Valley Playa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration is the determination of an on-orbit sensor's radiometric response using measurements over test sites such as Railroad Valley (RRV), Nevada. It has the highest accuracy when a remote sensor's view angle is aligned with that of the surface measurements, namely at a nadir view. For view angles greater than 10 degrees, the dominant error is the uncertainty in the off-nadir correction factor. The factor is largest in the back-scatter principal plane and can reach 20%. The Orbiting-Carbon Observatory has access to a number of datasets to determine this deviation. These include measurements from field instruments such as the Portable Apparatus for Rapid Acquisition of Bidirectional Observation of the Land and Atmosphere (PARABOLA), as well as satellite measurements from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The correction factor derived from PARABOLA is consistent in time and space to within 2% for view angles as large as 30 degrees. Field spectrometer data show that the correction term is spectrally invariant. For this reason, a time-invariant model of RRV surface reflectance, along with empirically derived coefficients, is sufficient to use in the calibration of off-nadir sensors, provided there has been no recent rainfall. With this off-nadir correction, calibrations can be expected to have uncertainties within 5%.

TI  - Extended D-TomoSAR Displacement Monitoring for Nanjing (China) City Built Structure Using High-Resolution TerraSAR/TanDEM-X and Cosmo SkyMed SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data coupled with the ongoing refinement of tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) technology has made use of radar data feasible for preventive monitoring and assessment of built structures. In this study, we first applied extended differential TomoSAR (D-TomoSAR) to a set of 26 scenes of TerraSAR/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX) (2013-2015) and 32 scenes of Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) (2015-2017) images to estimate motions of skyscrapers, bridges and historical monuments in Nanjing City, China. The calculation and isolation of unknown parameters in the D-TomoSAR model, including linear velocity, thermal dynamics and structural heights, helped to estimate millimetric statistics of motion time series. Then, aforementioned two SAR datasets were tentatively tested using amplitude dispersion and phase stability indicators, highlighting the performance and sensitivity of X-band SAR in structural displacement monitoring. Experimental results demonstrated that motion indexes, e.g., heterogeneities of thermal amplitudes and spatiotemporal displacements, were useful to evaluate the conditions of built structures being monitored, in particular when their structural topology were visible owing to the enhanced density of persistent scatterer (PS) measurements. This study implies the value of high-resolution D-TomoSAR tools in the preventive monitoring and health diagnosis of built structures elsewhere over the world.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite-Based Algorithms to Retrieve Chlorophyll-a Concentration in the Canadian Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing reflectance data collected by ocean colour satellites are processed using bio-optical algorithms to retrieve biogeochemical properties of the ocean. One such important property is the concentration of chlorophyll-a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass that serves a multitude of purposes in various ocean science studies. Here, the performance of two generic chlorophyll-a algorithms (i.e., a band ratio one, Ocean Colour X (OCx), and a semi-analytical one, Garver-Siegel Maritorena (GSM)) was assessed against two large in situ datasets of chlorophyll-a concentration collected between 1999 and 2016 in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) and Northwest Atlantic (NWA) for three ocean colour sensors: Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). In addition, new regionally-tuned versions of these two algorithms are presented, which reduced the mean error (mg m(-3)) of chlorophyll-a concentration modelled by OCx in the NWA from -0.40, -0.58 and -0.45 to 0.037, -0.087 and -0.018 for MODIS, SeaWiFS, and VIIRS respectively, and -0.34 and -0.36 to -0.0055 and -0.17 for SeaWiFS and VIIRS in the NEP. An analysis of the uncertainties in chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval showed a strong seasonal pattern in the NWA, which could be attributed to changes in phytoplankton community composition, but no long-term trends were found for all sensors and regions. It was also found that removing the 443 nm waveband for the OCx algorithms significantly improved the results in the NWA. Overall, GSM performed better than the OCx algorithms in both regions for all three sensors but generated fewer chlorophyll-a retrievals than the OCx algorithms.

TI  - Inter-Calibration of the OSIRIS-REx NavCams with Earth-Viewing Imagers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth-viewed images acquired by the space probe OSIRIS-REx during its Earth gravity assist flyby maneuver on 22 September 2017 provided an opportunity to radiometrically calibrate the onboard NavCam imagers. Spatially-, temporally-, and angularly-matched radiances from the Earth viewing GOES-15 and DSCOVR-EPIC imagers were used as references for deriving the calibration gain of the NavCam sensors. An optimized all-sky tropical ocean ray-matching (ATO-RM) calibration approach that accounts for the spectral band differences, navigation errors, and angular geometry differences between NavCam and the reference imagers is formulated in this paper. Prior to ray-matching, the GOES-15 and EPIC pixel level radiances were mapped into the NavCam field of view. The NavCam 1 ATO-RM gain is found to be 9.874 x 10(-2) Wm(-2)sr(-1)mu m(-1)DN(-1) with an uncertainty of 3.7%. The ATO-RM approach predicted an offset of 164, which is close to the true space DN of 170. The pre-launch NavCam 1 and 2 gains were compared with the ATO-RM gain and were found to be within 2.1% and 2.8%, respectively, suggesting that sensor performance is stable in space. The ATO-RM calibration was found to be consistent within 3.9% over a factor of +/- 2 NavCam 2 exposure times. This approach can easily be adapted to inter-calibrate other space probe cameras given the current constellation of geostationary imagers.

TI  - Applicability of the MultiTemporal Coherence Approach to Sentinel-1 for the Detection and Delineation of Burnt Areas in the Context of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) Mapping Validation, the applicability of the MultiTemporal Coherence (MTC) technique using Sentinel-1 data and the software made available by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), for the detection and delineation of burnt areas was tested. The main purpose of the study was to test a methodology that would benefit from the advantages of delineating burnt areas based on radar data with respect to optical data due to its capacity to acquire data both night and day and to avoid the interference of clouds and/or smoke. Moreover, the study aimed to acheive the delineation of the burnt areas using Sentinel-1 and SNAP in the frame of an emergency mapping where processing time is constrained due to the necessity of giving a quick response to the emergency. Four Sentinel-1 images were acquired over a mountainous area mainly covered by Mediterranean vegetation that suffered from massive forest fires in the summer of 2016. The burnt area delineation was obtained by an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of the resulting MTC image followed by a visual inspection. The effects of the polarization, the acquisition mode, and the incidence angle of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery were studied in order to assess the contribution of these sensor varaibles on the results. Results of the Sentinel-1 based delineation were compared to those using optical imagery, which is traditionally used for this application. Therefore, the fire delineation that was derived was compared to that derived using three optical images: pre- and post-event Sentinel-2 images and a post-event SPOT 6 image. The first two were used to calculate the differences of the burnt area index (dBAI), used to derive the burnt area delineation by OBIA and photo interpretation with the help of the SPOT 6 image. Results of the comparison showed the feasibility of using the MTC technique for burnt area delineation, as high overall accuracy values were observed when compared to the burnt area delineation derived from optical imagery. The importance of the incidence angle of the Sentinel-1 images was assessed as well, with lower angles resulting in higher overall accuracies. In addition, the availability of double polarization of the Sentinel-1 images, allowed us to give recommendations regarding which polarization gave the best results. The potential for the use of SAR data, obtaining equivalent results to those obtained from optical imagery, is significant in an emergency context given that radar sensors acquire images continuosly and in all weather conditions.

TI  - Integrating LiDAR, Multispectral and SAR Data to Estimate and Map Canopy Height in Tropical Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing accurate methods to map vegetation structure in tropical forests is essential to protect their biodiversity and improve their carbon stock estimation. We integrated LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), multispectral and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data to improve the prediction and mapping of canopy height (CH) at high spatial resolution (30 m) in tropical forests in South America. We modeled and mapped CH estimated from aircraft LiDAR surveys as a ground reference, using annual metrics derived from multispectral and SAR satellite imagery in a dry forest, a moist forest, and a rainforest of tropical South America. We examined the effect of the three forest types, five regression algorithms, and three predictor groups on the modelling and mapping of CH. Our CH models reached errors ranging from 1.2-3.4 m in the dry forest and 5.1-7.4 m in the rainforest and explained variances from 94-60% in the dry forest and 58-12% in the rainforest. Our best models show higher accuracies than previous works in tropical forests. The average accuracy of the five regression algorithms decreased from dry forests (2.6 m +/- 0.7) to moist (5.7 m +/- 0.4) and rainforests (6.6 m +/- 0.7). Random Forest regressions produced the most accurate models in the three forest types (1.2 m +/- 0.05 in the dry, 4.9 m +/- 0.14 in the moist, and 5.5 m +/- 0.3 the rainforest). Model performance varied considerably across the three predictor groups. Our results are useful for CH spatial prediction when GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar) data become available.

TI  - Denoising Algorithm for the FY-4A GIIRS Based on Principal Component Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) is the first high-spectral resolution advanced infrared (IR) sounder onboard the new-generation Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite FengYun-4A (FY-4A). The GIIRS has 1650 channels, and its spectrum ranges from 700 to 2250 cm(-1) with an unapodized spectral resolution of 0.625 cm(-1). It represents a significant breakthrough for measurements with high temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions worldwide. Many GIIRS channels have quite similar spectral signal characteristics that are highly correlated with each other in content and have a high degree of information redundancy. Therefore, this paper applies a principal component analysis (PCA)-based denoising algorithm (PDA) to study simulation data with different noise levels and observation data to reduce noise. The results show that the channel reconstruction using inter-channel spatial dependency and spectral similarity can reduce the noise in the observation brightness temperature (BT). A comparison of the BT observed by the GIIRS (O) with the BT simulated by the radiative transfer model (B) shows that a deviation occurs in the observation channel depending on the observation array. The results show that the array features of the reconstructed observation BT (rrO) depending on the observation array are weakened and the effect of the array position on the observations in the sub-center of the field of regard (FOR) are partially eliminated after the PDA procedure is applied. The high observation and simulation differences (O-B) in the sub-center of the FOR array notably reduced after the PDA procedure is implemented. The improvement of the high O-B is more distinct, and the low O-B becomes smoother. In each scan line, the standard deviation of the reconstructed background departures (rrO-B) is lower than that of the background departures (O-B). The observation error calculated by posterior estimation based on variational assimilation also verifies the efficiency of the PDA. The typhoon experiment also shows that among the 29 selected assimilation channels, the observation error of 65% of the channels was reduced as calculated by the triangle method.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Data Product from NESDIS GET-D System Upgraded for GOES-16 ABI Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the global and regional water cycle. An operational Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) ET and Drought (GET-D) product system has been developed by the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for numerical weather prediction model validation, data assimilation, and drought monitoring. GET-D system was generating ET and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) maps at 8 km spatial resolution using thermal observations of the Imagers on GOES-13 and GOES-15 before the primary operational GOES satellites transitioned to GOES-16 and GOES-17 with the Advanced Baseline Imagers (ABI). In this study, the GET-D product system is upgraded to ingest the thermal observations of ABI with the best spatial resolution of 2 km. The core of the GET-D system is the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inversion (ALEXI) model, which exploits the mid-morning rise in the land surface temperature to deduce the land surface fluxes including ET. Satellite-based land surface temperature and solar insolation retrievals from ABI and meteorological forcing from NOAA NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) are the major inputs to the GET-D system. Ancillary data required in GET-D include land cover map, leaf area index, albedo and cloud mask. This paper presents preliminary results of ET from the upgraded GET-D system after a brief introduction of the ALEXI model and the architecture of GET-D system. Comparisons with in situ ET measurements showed that the accuracy of the GOES-16 ABI based ET is similar to the results from the legacy GET-D ET based on GOES-13/15 Imager data. The agreement with the in situ measurements is satisfactory with a correlation of 0.914 averaged from three Mead sites. Further evaluation of the ABI-based ET product, upgrade efforts of the GET-D system for ESI products, and conclusions for the ABI-based GET-D products are discussed.

TI  - Comparing DInSAR and PSI Techniques Employed to Sentinel-1 Data to Monitor Highway Stability: A Case Study of a Massive Dobkoviky Landslide, Czech Republic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Single-pair differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) as well as more advanced methods, such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), allow vertical displacements to be detected at the sub-centimeter level. Since 2014 free SAR data-Sentinel-1-have been collected systematically under the COPERNICUS program at a high temporal resolution and with global coverage. Such an open-access policy greatly helps build a wide user-community and develop diverse SAR-based applications. In this study conventional single-pair DInSAR and the PSI techniques were employed to monitor the vertical displacements of the newly constructed D8 highway, more specifically the part passing through the Ceske Stredohori Mountains, where, during highway construction, a massive landslide occurred in June 2013. For both DInSAR and PSI, free Sentinel-1 radar data were used; moreover, the conventional single-pair DInSAR workflow was processed using freely available SNAP software. Results from the radar interferometry were validated using in situ techniques, such as geodetic measurements, 3D inclinometers, and laser scanning. Both approaches proved their ability to achieve reliable results in detecting vertical displacement "hotspots". Additionally, in terms of absolute values, the PSI interferometry corresponds very well with the in situ measurements. This study also shows that open-source solutions (free data and SW) provided under the COPERNICUS program bring a great potential for monitoring vertical displacements.

TI  - Enhanced Feature Extraction for Ship Detection from Multi-Resolution and Multi-Scene Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Independent of daylight and weather conditions, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have been widely used for ship monitoring. The traditional methods for SAR ship detection are highly dependent on the statistical models of sea clutter or some predefined thresholds, and generally require a multi-step operation, which results in time-consuming and less robust ship detection. Recently, deep learning algorithms have found wide applications in ship detection from SAR images. However, due to the multi-resolution imaging mode and complex background, it is hard for the network to extract representative SAR target features, which limits the ship detection performance. In order to enhance the feature extraction ability of the network, three improvement techniques have been developed. Firstly, multi-level sparse optimization of SAR image is carried out to handle clutters and sidelobes so as to enhance the discrimination of the features of SAR images. Secondly, we hereby propose a novel split convolution block (SCB) to enhance the feature representation of small targets, which divides the SAR images into smaller sub-images as the input of the network. Finally, a spatial attention block (SAB) is embedded in the feature pyramid network (FPN) to reduce the loss of spatial information, during the dimensionality reduction process. In this paper, experiments on the multi-resolution SAR images of GaoFen-3 and Sentinel-1 under complex backgrounds are carried out and the results verify the effectiveness of SCB and SAB. The comparison results also show that the proposed method is superior to several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.

TI  - Fast Super-Resolution of 20 m Sentinel-2 Bands Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Images provided by the ESA Sentinel-2 mission are rapidly becoming the main source of information for the entire remote sensing community, thanks to their unprecedented combination of spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, as well as their associated open access policy. Due to a sensor design trade-off, images are acquired (and delivered) at different spatial resolutions (10, 20 and 60 m) according to specific sets of wavelengths, with only the four visible and near infrared bands provided at the highest resolution (10 m). Although this is not a limiting factor in general, many applications seem to emerge in which the resolution enhancement of 20 m bands may be beneficial, motivating the development of specific super-resolution methods. In this work, we propose to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to provide a fast, upscalable method for the single-sensor fusion of Sentinel-2 (S2) data, whose aim is to provide a 10 m super-resolution of the original 20 m bands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can achieve better performance with respect to most of the state-of-the-art methods, including other deep learning based ones with a considerable saving of computational burden.

TI  - Mapping drought-induced changes in rice area in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is a staple food crop of India and is grown on 44 Mha (2011-12), 58.6% of which are irrigated. An inevitable phenomenon which looms over all aspects of human life and affects rice production in India is drought. Assessing drought damage using geospatial datasets available in the public domain, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), can provide specific and local ecoregion information for developing drought-resistant rice varieties. Based on multi-temporal NDVI data and field observations in 2009, we developed a methodology to identify and map drought-affected areas in India. A long-term (10-year) average of NDVI during the rainy (kharif) season (June-October) was compared with NDVI from a known drought year (2002-03) to identify changes in rice area. Rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) was used to support the drought analysis. Spectral matching techniques were used to categorise the drought-affected rice areas into three classes - severe, moderate, and mild based on the intensity of damage assessed through field sampling. Based on these ground survey samples, spectral signatures were generated. It was found that the rice area was about 16% less in the drought year (2002-03) than in a normal year (2000-01). A comparison of the MODIS-derived rice area affected by drought in 2002 for each state and district against the difference in the kharif season harvested rice area between 2000 and 2002 (from official statistics) revealed a substantial difference in harvested area in 2002 that was largely attributable to drought. An 84.7% correlation was found between the MODIS-derived drought-affected area in 2002 and the reduction in harvested area from 2000-01 to 2002-03. Good spatial correlation was found between the drought-affected rice areas and reduction of rice harvested areas in different rice ecologies, indicating the usefulness of such geospatial datasets in assessing abiotic stress such as drought and its consequences.

TI  - Assessment of China's Offshore Wind Resources Based on the Integration of Multiple Satellite Data and Meteorological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind resources assessment plays a significant role in site selection for the construction of offshore wind farms. Mean wind speeds (MWS), wind power densities (WPD), and Weibull parameters are the most important variables for wind resources assessment. These variables were estimated with the synergetic use of multiple satellite data (QuikSCAT + WindSAT + ASCAT) and meteorological data from coastal stations using spatial interpolation methods, including inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), and ordinary co-kriging (OCK). The spatial variability of offshore wind energy resources over the China Sea is assessed at heights of 10 m and 100 m (hub height of wind turbine). Then, 8 buoy measurements were used to evaluate the accuracy of the offshore wind resources assessment. Our results show that combining multiple satellite data and coastal meteorological data improves the accuracy of wind resources assessment in the offshore areas and the OCK method show the best performance for accuracy in most cases. The statistical results comparing buoy-derived MWS and interpolated MWS show a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17 m/s and correlation coefficient (Corr.) of 0.987 at a height of 10 m. Statistics of the comparison between buoy-derived WPD and interpolated WPD by OCK show a RMSE of 23.38 W/m(2) at a height of 10 m. The results show that the highest wind resources are mainly found in the Taiwan Strait and offshore regions in Fujian province.

TI  - Groundwater quality under land use/land cover changes: A temporal study from 2005 to 2015 in Xi'an, Northwest China
T2  - HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns significantly affect groundwater quality. This study investigated groundwater quality and LULC conversion of Xi'an City in Guanzhong Basin over ten years, from 2005 to 2015. The relationship between groundwater quality and LULC patterns were also explored. Piper diagram, Gibbs diagram, and self-organizing map (SOM) were used to investigate the hydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality in the city. Remote sensing image data generated by Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were used to extract the LULC patterns of Xi'an City in those three years. These data were used to determine the LULC conversion between 2005 and 2010, and between 2010 and 2015. Entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI), curved streamline searchlight model (CS-SLM), and multiple linear regression analysis were used to relate groundwater quality to the LULC patterns of Xi'an City in the three years. The Piper diagram indicated that groundwater in Xi'an City was mainly characterized as HCO3-Na type and/or HCO3-Ca center dot Mg type. The Gibbs diagram indicated that the dominant evolution of hydrogeochemistry was through rock weathering and water-rock interactions. SOM classified the groundwater into eight clusters, and revealed different spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters. The LULC classification indicated that the urban land in Xi'an City has expanded by more than 160%, while forest and agricultural land areas have reduced by 52.54% and 83.08%, respectively, from 2005 to 2015. Indicated by the coefficient of multiple linear regression of EWQI and the percentages of LULC types in CS-SLM for the wells, urban land, agricultural land, and industrial land had negative effects on groundwater quality, while the forest positively impacted the groundwater quality in the same period. This study is meaningful and significant because it supports sustainable urban development and groundwater management in Xi'an City.

TI  - Developing Land Surface Directional Reflectance and Albedo Products from Geostationary GOES-R and Himawari Data: Theoretical Basis, Operational Implementation, and Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new generation of geostationary satellite sensors is producing an unprecedented amount of Earth observations with high temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions, which enable us to detect and assess abrupt surface changes. In this study, we developed the land surface directional reflectance and albedo products from Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite-R (GOES-R) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data using a method that was prototyped with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in a previous study, and was also tested with data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8. Surface reflectance is usually retrieved through atmospheric correction that requires the input of aerosol optical depth (AOD). We first estimated AOD and the surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) model parameters simultaneously based on an atmospheric radiative transfer formulation with surface anisotropy, and then calculated the "blue-sky" surface broadband albedo and directional reflectance. This algorithm was implemented operationally by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to generate the GOES-R land surface albedo product suite with a daily updated clear-sky satellite observation database. The "operational" land surface albedo estimation from ABI and AHI data was validated against ground measurements at the SURFRAD sites and OzFlux sites and compared with the existing satellite products, including MODIS, Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), and Global Land Surface Satellites (GLASS) albedo products, where good agreement was found with bias values of -0.001 (ABI) and 0.020 (AHI) and root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) less than 0.065 for the hourly albedo estimation. Directional surface reflectance estimation, evaluated at more than 74 sites from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), was proven to be reliable as well, with an overall bias very close to zero and RMSEs within 0.042 (ABI) and 0.039 (AHI). Results show that the albedo and reflectance estimation can satisfy the NOAA accuracy requirements for operational climate and meteorological applications.

TI  - Assessment of Leaf Area Index of Rice for a Growing Cycle Using Multi-Temporal C-Band PolSAR Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data has been previously explored for estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of rice. Although the rice-growing cycle was partially covered in most of the studies, details for each phenological phase need to be further characterized. Additionally, the selection and exploration of polarimetric parameters are not comprehensive. This study evaluates the potential of a set of polarimetric parameters derived from multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 datasets for rice LAI estimation. The relationships of rice LAI with backscattering coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters have been examined in a complete phenological cycle. Most polarimetric parameters had weak relationships (R-2 < 0.30) with LAI at the transplanting, reproductive, and maturity phase. Stronger relationships (R-2 > 0.50) were observed at the vegetative phase. HV/VV and RVIFD had significant relationships (R-2 > 0.80) with rice LAI for the whole growth period. They were utilized to develop empirical models. The best LAI inversion performance (RMSE = 0.81) was obtained when RVIFD was used. The acceptable error demonstrated the possibility to use the decomposition parameters for rice LAI estimation. The HV/VV-based model had a slightly lower estimation accuracy (RMSE = 1.29) but can be a practical alternative considering the wide availability of dual-polarized datasets.

TI  - A visual-textual fused approach to automated tagging of flood-related tweets during a flood event
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, social media such as Twitter have received much attention as a new data source for rapid flood awareness. The timely response and large coverage provided by citizen sensors significantly compensate the limitations of non-timely remote sensing data and spatially isolated river gauges. However, automatic extraction of flood tweets from a massive tweets pool remains a challenge. Taking the Houston Flood in 2017 as a study case, this paper presents an automated flood tweets extraction approach by mining both visual and textual information a tweet contains. A CNN architecture was designed to classify the visual content of flood pictures during the Houston Flood. A sensitivity test was then applied to extract flood-sensitive keywords that were further used to refine the CNN classified results. A duplication test was finally performed to trim the database by removing the duplicated pictures to create the flood tweets pool for the flood event. The results indicated that coupling CNN classification results with flood-sensitive words in tweets allows a significant increase in precision while keeps the recall rate in a high level. The elimination of tweets containing duplicated pictures greatly contributes to higher spatio-temporal relevance to the flood.

TI  - Evaluation of Incident Light Sensors on Unmanned Aircraft for Calculation of Spectral Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Including incident light sensors (ILS) with multispectral sensors is an important development for agricultural remote sensing because spectral reflectances are necessary for accurate determination of plant biophysical variables such as leaf area index and leaf chlorophyll content. Effects of different aircraft flight conditions on accuracy of surface reflectances retrieved using an ILS are not known. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of ILS orientation with respect to sun and aircraft altitude. A Tetracam Miniature Multiple Camera Array (Mini-MCA) was mounted on a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) with the ILS mounted on top of the aircraft's fuselage. On two dates the aircraft flew over six 50-ha agricultural fields with center-pivot irrigation at three different altitudes (450, 650 and 1800 m above ground level (AGL)). Ground reflectances were estimated using atmospherically corrected Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data acquired at or near the time of the aircraft overflights. Because the aircraft had a positive pitch during flight, the ILS pointed opposite to the flight direction. The first date had flight lines closely oriented towards and away from the sun. The second date had flight lines oriented perpendicularly to the solar azimuth. On the first date, red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances were significantly higher when the ILS was oriented away from the sun, whereas ILS orientation had little effect on the second date. For both dates, red and near-infrared reflectances were significantly greater at 450 m compared to 1800 m. Both the effects of ILS orientation and flight altitude are correctable during image processing because the physical basis is well known.

TI  - Optimal Input Features for Tree Species Classification in Central Europe Based on Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed knowledge about tree species composition is of great importance for forest management. The two identical European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites provide data with unprecedented spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we investigated the potential benefits of using high temporal resolution data for classification of five coniferous and seven broadleaved tree species in a diverse Central European Forest. To run the classification, 18 cloud-free S2 acquisitions were analyzed in a two-step approach. The available scenes were first used to stratify the study area into six broad land-cover classes. Subsequently, additional classification models were created separately for the coniferous and the broadleaved forest strata. To permit a deeper analytical insight in the benefits of multi-temporal datasets for species identification, classification models were developed taking into account all 262,143 possible permutations of the 18 S2 scenes. Each model was fine-tuned using a stepwise recursive feature reduction. The additional use of vegetation indices improved the model performances by around 5 percentage points. Individual mono-temporal tree species accuracies range from 48.1% (January 2017) to 78.6% (June 2017). Compared to the best mono-temporal results, the multi-temporal analysis approach improves the out-of-bag overall accuracy from 72.9% to 85.7% for the broadleaved and from 83.8% to 95.3% for the coniferous tree species, respectively. Remarkably, a combination of six-seven scenes achieves a model quality equally high as the model based on all data; images from April until August proved most important. The classes European Beech and European Larch attain the highest user's accuracies of 96.3% and 95.9%, respectively. The most important spectral variables to distinguish between tree species are located in the Red (coniferous) and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands (broadleaved), respectively. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of multi-temporal S2 data for species-level classifications in Central European forests.

TI  - High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Data at Coastal Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) images are essential to study the highly variable small-scale oceanic phenomena in a coastal region. Most previous SST algorithms are focused on the low or medium resolution SST from the near polar orbiting or geostationary satellites. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) makes it possible to obtain high-resolution SST images of coastal regions. This study performed a matchup procedure between 276 Landsat 8 images and in-situ temperature measurements of buoys off the coast of the Korean Peninsula from April 2013 to August 2017. Using the matchup database, we investigated SST errors for each formulation of the Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) and the Non-Linear SST (NLSST) by considering the satellite zenith angle (SZA) and the first-guess SST. The retrieved SST equations showed a root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 0.59 to 0.72 degrees C. The smallest errors were found for the NLSST equation that considers the SZA and uses the first-guess SST, compared with the MCSST equations. The SST errors showed characteristic dependences on the atmospheric water vapor, the SZA, and the wind speed. In spite of the narrow swath width of the Landsat 8, the effect of the SZA on the errors was estimated to be significant and considerable for all the formations. Although the coefficients were calculated in the coastal regions around the Korean Peninsula, these coefficients are expected to be feasible for SST retrieval applied to any other parts of the global ocean. This study also addressed the need for high-resolution coastal SST, by emphasizing the usefulness of the high-resolution Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data for monitoring the small-scale oceanic phenomena in coastal regions.

TI  - Daily River Discharge Estimation Using Multi-Mission Radar Altimetry Data and Ensemble Learning Regression in the Lower Mekong River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating river discharge (Q) is critical for ecosystems and water resource management. Traditionally, estimating Q has depended on a single rating curve or the Manning equation. In contrast to the single rating curve, several rating curves at different locations have been linearly combined in an ensemble learning regression method to estimate Q (ELQ) at the Brazzaville gauge station in the central Congo River in a previous study. In this study, we further tested the proposed ELQ and apply it to the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB) with three locations: Stung Treng, Kratie, and Tan Chau. Two major advancements for estimating Q with ELQ are presented. First, ELQ successfully estimated Q at Tan Chau, downstream of Kratie, where hydrodynamic complexities exist. Since the hydrologic characteristics downstream of Kratie are extremely diverse and complex in time and space, most previous studies have estimated Q only upstream from Kratie with hydrologic models and statistical methods. Second, we estimated Q over the LMRB using ELQ with water levels (H) obtained from two radar altimetry missions, Envisat and Jason-2, which made it possible to estimate Q seamlessly from 2003 to 2016. Owing to ELQ with multi-mission radar altimetry data, we have overcome the problems of a single rating curve: Locations for estimating Q have to be close to virtual stations, e.g., a few tens of kilometers, because the performance of the single rating curve degrades as the distance between the location of Q estimation and a virtual station increases. Therefore, most previous studies had not used Jason-2 data whose cross-track interval is about 315 km at the equator. On the contrary, several H obtained from Jason-2 altimetry were used in this study regardless of distances from in-situ Q stations since the ELQ method compensates for degradation in the performance for Q estimation due to the poor rating curve with virtual stations away from in-situ Q stations. In general, the ELQ-estimated Q ((Q) over cap (ELQ)) showed more accurate results compared to those obtained from a single rating curve. In the case of Tan Chau, the root mean square error (RMSE) of (Q) over cap (ELQ) decreased by 1504/1338 m(3)/s using Envisat-derived H for the training/validation datasets. We successfully applied ELQ to the LMRB, which is one of the most complex basins to estimate Q with multi-mission radar altimetry data. Furthermore, our method can be used to obtain finer temporal resolution and enhance the performance of Q estimation with the current altimetry missions, such as Sentinel-3A/B and Jason-3.

TI  - Deep Learning-Generated Nighttime Reflectance and Daytime Radiance of the Midwave Infrared Band of a Geostationary Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Midwave infrared (MWIR) band of 3.75 mu m is important in satellite remote sensing in many applications. This band observes daytime reflectance and nighttime radiance according to the Earth's and the Sun's effects. This study presents an algorithm to generate no-present nighttime reflectance and daytime radiance at MWIR band of satellite observation by adopting the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGAN) model. We used the daytime reflectance and nighttime radiance data in the MWIR band of the meteoritical imager (MI) onboard the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), as well as in the longwave infrared (LWIR; 10.8 mu m) band of the COMS/MI sensor, from 1 January to 31 December 2017. This model was trained in a size of 1024 x 1024 pixels in the digital number (DN) from 0 to 255 converted from reflectance and radiance with a dataset of 256 images, and validated with a dataset of 107 images. Our results show a high statistical accuracy (bias = 3.539, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 8.924, and correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.922 for daytime reflectance; bias = 0.006, RMSE = 5.842, and CC = 0.995 for nighttime radiance) between the COMS MWIR observation and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated MWIR outputs. Consequently, our findings from the real MWIR observations could be used for identification of fog/low cloud, fire/hot-spot, volcanic eruption/ash, snow and ice, low-level atmospheric vector winds, urban heat islands, and clouds.

TI  - Optimizing harmonics from Landsat time series data: the case of mapping rainfed and irrigated agriculture in Zimbabwe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Explicit and large-scale information on farming systems is important for many applications such as crop production estimates, drought impact assessments or water footprint analysis. This contribution investigated the possibility of optimizing harmonic functions fitted to cloud-corrected Landsat NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series imagery to effectively map rainfed and irrigated croplands in Zimbabwe. The following harmonic optimizations were investigated: the effect of the linear trend, length of the time series data and the harmonics degree. The verification accuracy scores for mapping the two farming systems were used to ascertain the most optimal harmonics settings. The most accurate classification results (overall accuracy of 97%) were produced when the linear trend was excluded and the full time period (2013 to 2018) with a 7(th) degree harmonics fitting function was used. Optimized harmonics provide an effective way to compute vegetation seasonality signals while accounting for data gaps and residual noise inherent in Landsat time-series data.

TI  - Aerosol-induced perturbation of surface fluxes over different landscapes in a tropical region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global picture of modification of land surface fluxes due to aerosol loading, especially over different landscapes, is not yet clear. The impact of aerosols on surface fluxes over Indo-Gangetic Basin, a highly polluted region, is studied by selecting four stations in the north Indian plains that are agriculturally heterogeneous in nature, viz., short crop area, industrial area, seasonal agricultural area, and permanent dense canopy area. Data from satellite (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)), model (Global Land Data Assimilation (GLDAS-NOAH), National Centre for Environmental Prediction/Oregon State University/Airforce/Hydrology Research Laboratory, and reanalysis (MERRA-Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) as well as ground observations (AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) and Dibrugarh University measurements) on daily and monthly scales are used to validate and assess the aerosol-induced modification of surface fluxes. To ensure that satellite products are reasonably accurate, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and evapotranspiration (ET) from MODIS are validated against ground truth of AOD and ET from GLDAS-NOAH and found to have correlations of 0.90 and 0.76, respectively. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was calculated as the difference between 'clear sky' and 'clean clear sky' of net radiation (R) at surface obtained from MERRA. Since surface fluxes are perturbed directly by ARF on a daily scale with maximum effect during 'sunlit' hours, change in fluxes is calculated on the daily scale. The impact of aerosols alone on latent heat flux (LE) is quantified by using the linear relation between R and LE along with the aerosol-induced reduction of net radiation. Latent heat flux and R from GLDAS-NOAH showed an excellent correlation between 0.75 and 0.97. The impact of aerosols on surface fluxes, represented as perturbed latent and sensible heat fluxes normalized by ARF, is found to be followed an asymptotic curve against Bowen ratio (B) which indicates aridity of the land surface. This study shows that the aerosols reduce LE by 60% of ARF over the permanent dense canopy with considerable soil moisture (B = 0.5), while the same amount of ARF reduces LE by 25% only over the semi-arid region (B = 2) over the north Indian plains for the period from October 2008 to May 2009.

TI  - Large-eddy simulation of the Mississippi River under base-flow condition: hydrodynamics of a natural diffluence-confluence region
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We conduct large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate the turbulent flow in a 3.2?km long reach of the Mississippi River. The digital elevation model of the study reach was reconstructed from remote sensing data (light detection and ranging; LiDAR) and field measurements. Flow depth and velocity profile measurements were carried out in five field campaigns in 2009, 2014 and 2015 under base-flow condition using acoustic Doppler current profiler. The detailed geometry of the river bathymetry, islands, and hydraulic structures were incorporated in the numerical simulation using the curvilinear immersed boundary approach. LES results are used to demonstrate and gain insight into the complexity of the river flow dynamics induced by the interaction of shear-layers developing along the intricate geometry of the islands and bar within the study area. Our results also show the long-range impacts of hydraulic structures on the downstream flow structures. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-resolution LES for large-scale rivers by taking into account the detailed bathymetry and submerged hydraulic structures.

TI  - Change in the Recent Warming Trend of Sea Surface Temperature in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) over Decades (1982-2018)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term trends of sea surface temperature (SST) of the East Sea (Sea of Japan, EJS) were estimated by using 37-year-long satellite data, for the observation period from 1982 to 2018. Overall, the SST tended to increase with time, for all analyzed regions. However, the warming trend was steeper in the earlier decades since the 1980s and slowed down during the recent two decades. Based on the analysis of the occurrence of events with extreme SST (high in the summertime and low in the wintertime), a shift toward the more frequent occurrence of events with extremely high SST and the less frequent occurrence of events with extremely low SST has been observed. This supports the observations of the consistent warming of the EJS. However, seasonal trends revealed continuous SST warming in the summertime, but frequent extreme SST cooling in the wintertime, in recent decades. The observed reduction in the warming rates occurred more frequently in specific regions of the EJS, where the occurrence frequency of events with extremely low SST was unusually high in the recent decade. The recent tendency toward the SST cooling was distinctively connected with variations in the Arctic Oscillation index. This suggests that changes in the Arctic Ocean environment likely affect the recently observed SST changes in the EJS, as one of the marginal seas in the mid-latitude region far from the polar region.

TI  - Collective Trauma and the Evolution of Nehru's Worldview: Uncovering the Roots of Nehruvian Non-Alignment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HISTORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholarship on Nehruvian non-alignment often assumes an artificial continuity between Jawaharlal Nehru's pre-independence thinking and post-independence decision, as India's prime minister, to pursue a policy of rejecting any international blocs or military alliances. This article demonstrates that, in fact, the ideas that constituted Nehruvian non-alignment were largely absent from Nehru's pre-independence thought - during the decades before India's independence Nehru articulated a strong willingness to cede India's sovereignty to international groupings for idealistic aims. To explain Nehru's shift from idealistic internationalist to professed internationalist but de facto isolationist with regard to alliances and blocs, I advocate a first-image, constructivist approach which considers the impact of collective trauma on Nehru's worldview. Drawing upon a novel, synthesized approach to theorizing collective trauma's impact on national identity, this article argues that the collective trauma Nehru witnessed and experienced during the decades before Indian independence profoundly impacted his trust in international institutions and views on representational diplomacy. In turn, this trauma affected his interpretation of various ideational and strategic considerations, contributing to the formulation of Nehruvian non-alignment.

TI  - Multimodal and Multi-Model Deep Fusion for Fine Classification of Regional Complex Landscape Areas Using ZiYuan-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification (LCC) of complex landscapes is attractive to the remote sensing community but poses great challenges. In complex open pit mining and agricultural development landscapes (CMALs), the landscape-specific characteristics limit the accuracy of LCC. The combination of traditional feature engineering and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) is not sufficient for LCC in CMALs. Deep belief network (DBN) methods achieved success in some remote sensing applications because of their excellent unsupervised learning ability in feature extraction. The usability of DBN has not been investigated in terms of LCC of complex landscapes and integrating multimodal inputs. A novel multimodal and multi-model deep fusion strategy based on DBN was developed and tested for fine LCC (FLCC) of CMALs in a 109.4 km(2) area of Wuhan City, China. First, low-level and multimodal spectral-spatial and topographic features derived from ZiYuan-3 imagery were extracted and fused. The features were then input into a DBN for deep feature learning. The developed features were fed to random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for classification. Experiments were conducted that compared the deep features with the softmax function and low-level features with MLAs. Five groups of training, validation, and test sets were performed with some spatial auto-correlations. A spatially independent test set and generalized McNemar tests were also employed to assess the accuracy. The fused model of DBN-SVM achieved overall accuracies (OAs) of 94.74% +/- 0.35% and 81.14% in FLCC and LCC, respectively, which significantly outperformed almost all other models. From this model, only three of the twenty land covers achieved OAs below 90%. In general, the developed model can contribute to FLCC and LCC in CMALs, and more deep learning algorithm-based models should be investigated in future for the application of FLCC and LCC in complex landscapes.

TI  - A CNN-Based Pan-Sharpening Method for Integrating Panchromatic and Multispectral Images Using Landsat 8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of sensors enables the combination of a high-spatial-resolution panchromatic image and a low-spatial-resolution multispectral image, which has become a hotspot in recent years for many applications. To address the spectral and spatial distortions that adversely affect the conventional methods, a pan-sharpening method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed in this paper, where the low-spatial-resolution multispectral image is upgraded and integrated with the high-spatial-resolution panchromatic image to produce a new multispectral image with high spatial resolution. Based on the pyramid structure of the CNN architecture, the proposed method has high learning capacity to generate more representative and robust hierarchical features for construction tasks. Moreover, the highly nonlinear fusion process can be effectively simulated by stacking several linear filtering layers, which is suitable for learning the complex mapping relationship between a high-spatial-resolution panchromatic and low-spatial-resolution multispectral image. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental analyses were carried out on images captured from a Landsat 8 on-board operational land imager (LOI) sensor to demonstrate the method's performance. The results regarding the sensitivity analysis of the involved parameters indicate the effects of parameters on the performance of our CNN-based pan-sharpening approach. Additionally, our CNN-based pan-sharpening approach outperforms other existing conventional pan-sharpening methods with a more promising fusion result for different landcovers, with differences in Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthse (ERGAS), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and spectral angle mapper (SAM) of 0.69, 0.0021, and 0.81 on average, respectively.

TI  - Radiometric Variations of On-Orbit FORMOSAT-5 RSI from Vicarious and Cross-Calibration Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new Taiwanese satellite, FORMOSAT-5 (FS-5), with a payload remote sensing instrument (RSI) was launched in August 2017 to continue the mission of its predecessor FORMOSAT-2 (FS-2). Similar to FS-2, the RSI provides 2-m resolution panchromatic and 4-m resolution multi-spectral images as the primary payload on FS-5. However, the radiometric properties of the optical sensor may vary, based on the environment and time after being launched into the space. Thus, maintaining the radiometric quality of FS-5 RSI imagery is essential and significant to scientific research and further applications. Therefore, the objective of this study aimed at the on-orbit absolute radiometric assessment and calibration of on-orbit FS-5 RSI observations. Two renowned approaches, vicarious calibrations and cross-calibrations, were conducted at two calibration sites that employ a stable atmosphere and high surface reflectance, namely, Alkali Lake and Railroad Valley Playa in North America. For cross-calibrations, the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (LS-8 OLI) was selected as the reference. A second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model was performed to compute the surface reflectance, atmospheric effects, and path radiance for the radiometric intensity at the top of the atmosphere. Results of vicarious calibrations from 11 field experiments demonstrated high consistency with those of seven case examinations of cross-calibration in terms of physical gain in spectra, implying that the practicality of the proposed approaches is high. Moreover, the multi-temporal results illustrated that RSI decay in optical sensitivity was evident after launch. The variation in the calibration coefficient of each band showed no obvious consistency (6%-24%) in 2017, but it tended to be stable at the order of 3%-5% of variation in most spectral bands during 2018. The results strongly suggest that periodical calibration is required and essential for further scientific applications.

TI  - Comparison of Five Spatio-Temporal Satellite Image Fusion Models over Landscapes with Various Spatial Heterogeneity and Temporal Variation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many spatial and temporal satellite image fusion (STIF) methods have been developed to solve the problems of trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution of satellite sensors. This study, for the first time, conducted both scene-level and local-level comparison of five state-of-art STIF methods from four categories over landscapes with various spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation. The five STIF methods include the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and Fit-FC model from the weight function-based category, an unmixing-based data fusion (UBDF) method from the unmixing-based category, the one-pair learning method from the learning-based category, and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method from hybrid category. The relationship between the performances of the STIF methods and scene-level and local-level landscape heterogeneity index (LHI) and temporal variation index (TVI) were analyzed. Our results showed that (1) the FSDAF model was most robust regardless of variations in LHI and TVI at both scene level and local level, while it was less computationally efficient than the other models except for one-pair learning; (2) Fit-FC had the highest computing efficiency. It was accurate in predicting reflectance but less accurate than FSDAF and one-pair learning in capturing image structures; (3) One-pair learning had advantages in prediction of large-area land cover change with the capability of preserving image structures. However, it was the least computational efficient model; (4) STARFM was good at predicting phenological change, while it was not suitable for applications of land cover type change; (5) UBDF is not recommended for cases with strong temporal changes or abrupt changes. These findings could provide guidelines for users to select appropriate STIF method for their own applications.

TI  - Identifying Linear Traces of the Han Dynasty Great Wall in Dunhuang Using Gaofen-1 Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery and the Hough Transform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Han Dynasty Great Wall (GH), one of the largest and most significant ancient defense projects in the whole of northern China, has been studied increasingly not only because it provides important information about the diplomatic and military strategies of the Han Empire (206 B.C.-220 A.D.), but also because it is considered to be a cultural and national symbol of modern China as well as a valuable archaeological monument. Thus, it is crucial to obtain the spatial pattern and preservation situation of the GH for next-step archaeological analysis and conservation management. Nowadays, remote sensing specialists and archaeologists have given priority to manual visualization and a (semi-) automatic extraction approach is lacking. Based on the very high-resolution (VHR) satellite remote sensing imagery, this paper aims to identify automatically the archaeological features of the GH located in ancient Dunhuang, northwest China. Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data were first processed and enhanced after image correction and mathematical morphology, and the M-statistic was then used to analyze the spectral characteristics of GF-1 multispectral (MS) data. In addition, based on GF-1 panchromatic (PAN) data, an auto-identification method that integrates an improved Otsu segmentation algorithm with a Linear Hough Transform (LHT) is proposed. Finally, by making a comparison with visual extraction results, the proposed method was assessed qualitatively and semi-quantitatively to have an accuracy of 80% for the homogenous background in Dunhuang. These automatic identification results could be used to map and evaluate the preservation state of the GH in Dunhuang. Also, the proposed automatic approach was applied to identify similar linear traces of other generations of the Great Wall of China (Western Xia Dynasty (581 A.D.-618 A.D.) and Ming Dynasty (1368 A.D.-1644 A.D.)) in various geographic regions. Moreover, the results indicate that the computer-based automatic identification has great potential in archaeological research, and the proposed method can be generalized and applied to monitor and evaluate the state of preservation of the Great Wall of China in the future.

TI  - Modeling Population Density Using a New Index Derived from Multi-Sensor Image Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detailed information about the spatial distribution of the population is crucial for analyzing economic growth, environmental change, and natural disaster damage. Using the nighttime light (NTL) imagery for population estimation has been a topic of interest in recent decades. However, the effectiveness of NTL data in population estimation has been impeded by some limitations such as the blooming effect and underestimation in rural regions. To overcome these limitations, we combine the NPP-VIIRS day/night band (DNB) data with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite, to create a new vegetation temperature light population index (VTLPI). A statistical model is developed to predict 250m grid-level population density based on the proposed VTLPI and the least square regression approach. After that, a case study is implemented using the data of Sichuan Province, China in 2015, and the results indicates that the VTLPI-estimated population density outperformed the results from other two methods based on nighttime light imagery or human settlement index, and the three publicized population products, LandScan, WorldPop, and GPW. When using the census data as reference, the mean relative error and median absolute relative error on a township level are 0.29 and 0.12, respectively, and the root-mean-square error is 212 persons/km(2). The results show that our VTLPI-based model can achieve a better estimation of population density in rural areas and urban suburbs and characterize more spatial variations at 250m grid level both in both urban and rural areas. The resultant population density offers better population exposure data for assessing natural disaster risk and loss as well as other related applications.

TI  - Validation of Earth Observation Time-Series: A Review for Large-Area and Temporally Dense Land Surface Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Large-area remote sensing time-series offer unique features for the extensive investigation of our environment. Since various error sources in the acquisition chain of datasets exist, only properly validated results can be of value for research and downstream decision processes. This review presents an overview of validation approaches concerning temporally dense time-series of land surface geo-information products that cover the continental to global scale. Categorization according to utilized validation data revealed that product intercomparisons and comparison to reference data are the conventional validation methods. The reviewed studies are mainly based on optical sensors and orientated towards global coverage, with vegetation-related variables as the focus. Trends indicate an increase in remote sensing-based studies that feature long-term datasets of land surface variables. The hereby corresponding validation efforts show only minor methodological diversification in the past two decades. To sustain comprehensive and standardized validation efforts, the provision of spatiotemporally dense validation data in order to estimate actual differences between measurement and the true state has to be maintained. The promotion of novel approaches can, on the other hand, prove beneficial for various downstream applications, although typically only theoretical uncertainties are provided.

TI  - Distributed input observers to integrate satellite data with 3-D atmospheric models
T2  - COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical transport models (CTMs) simulate the concentration of gas pollutants and particulate matter in the atmosphere. Most CTMs include significant model mismatch from the true atmosphere due to uncertainty in the inputs like meteorology and emission fields, extrapolation and simplification of experimentally-derived relationships for the process dynamics, and possibly un-accounted for atmospheric processes. In this paper we estimate uncertain parameters by utilizing daily satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth, related to particulate matter. A passivity-based input observer (PBIO) projects the high-dimensional CTM to a set of inventory variables. The passive system, in which the input and output is based on the inventories, is stable with proportional feedback. We integrate distributed PBIOs with a 3D CTM to estimate time-varying sea spray emission scaling factors across the Southern Ocean band. We find the measurement error decreases from 305% to 55% by utilizing distributed PBIOs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban-Rural Surface Temperature Deviation and Intra-Urban Variations Contained by an Urban Growth Boundary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) concept describes heat trapping that elevates urban temperatures relative to rural temperatures, at least in temperate/humid regions. In drylands, urban irrigation can instead produce an urban cool island (UCI) effect. However, the UHI/UCI characterization suffers from uncertainty in choosing representative urban/rural endmembers, an artificial dichotomy between UHIs and UCIs, and lack of consistent terminology for other patterns of thermal variation at nested scales. We use the case of a historically well-enforced urban growth boundary (UGB) around Portland (Oregon, USA): to explore the representativeness of the surface temperature UHI (SUHI) as derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature data, to test common assumptions of characteristically "warm" or "cool" land covers (LCs), and to name other common urban thermal features of interest. We find that the UGB contains heat as well as sprawl, inducing a sharp surface temperature contrast across the urban/rural boundary. The contrast ranges widely depending on the end-members chosen, across a spectrum from positive (SUHI) to negative (SUCI) values. We propose a new, inclusive "urban thermal deviation" (UTD) term to span the spectrum of possible UHI-zero-UCI conditions. We also distinguish at finer scales "microthermal extremes" (MTEs), discrete areas tending in the same thermal direction as their LC or surroundings but to extreme (hot or cold) values, and microthermal anomalies (MTAs), that run counter to thermal expectations or tendencies for their LC or surroundings. The distinction is important because MTEs suggest a need for moderation in the local thermal landscape, whereas MTAs may suggest solutions.

TI  - Assessment of Integrated Water Vapor Estimates from the iGMAS and the Brazilian Network GNSS Ground-Based Receivers in Rio de Janeiro
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is pressing demand for knowledge improvement of the integrated water vapor (IWV) distribution in regions affected by heat islands that are associated with extreme rainfall events such as in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro (MARJ). This work assessed the suitability and evaluation of the spatiotemporal distribution of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) IWV from the cooperation of the International GNSS Monitoring and Assessment System (iGMAS) and the National Observatory (Observatorio Nacional, ON) of Brazil, from the Brazilian Network for Continuous Monitoring (RBMC), and IWV products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and radiosonde, jointly with surface meteorological data, in two sectors of the state of Rio de Janeiro from February 2015-August 2018. High variability of the near surface air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) were observed among eight meteorological sites. The mean T differences between sites, up to 4.4 degrees C, led to mean differences as high as 3.1 K for weighted mean temperature (T-m) and hence 0.83 mm for IWV differences. Local grid points of MODIS IWV estimates had relatively good agreement with the GNSS-derived IWV, with mean differences from -2.4-1.1 mm for the daytime passages of the satellites TERRA and AQUA and underestimation from -9 mm to -3 mm during nighttime overpasses. A contrasting behavior was found in the radiosonde IWV estimates compared with the estimates from GNSS. There were dry biases of 1.4 mm (3.7% lower than expected) by radiosonde IWV during the daytime, considering that all other estimates were unbiased and the differences between IWVGNSS and IWVRADS were consistent. Based on the IWV comparisons between radiosonde and GNSS at nighttime, the atmosphere over the radiosonde site is about 1.2 mm and 2.3 mm wetter than that over the RBMC RIOD and iGMAS RDJN stations, respectively. The atmosphere over the site RIOD was 1.2 mm wetter than over that of RDJN for all three-hour means. These results showed that there were important variabilities in the meteorological conditions and in the distribution of water vapor in the MERJ. The data from the iGMAS RDJN station were feasible, together with those from the RBMC, MODIS, and radiosonde data, to investigate IWV in the region with occurrence of heat islands and peculiar physiographic and meteorological characteristics. This work recommends the magnification of the GNSS network in the state of Rio de Janeiro with the use of data from complete meteorological station collocated near every GNSS receiver, aiming to improve local IWV estimates and serving as additional support for operational numerical assimilation, weather forecast, and nowcast of extreme rainfall and flooding events.

TI  - Evaluation of a high resolution UAV imagery model for rooftop solar irradiation estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) installations on rooftops in urban environments have a significant potential to reduce human environmental impact. However, the quality of remote sensing data available for solar potential estimates in different regions varies and regional authorities or policy makers need to know if the available data are suitable for solar potential estimates and/or whether to invest into expensive data collection. Published studies often mention the importance of identification of small disturbing structures on the roof (e.g. chimneys), which is however questionable due to the fact that estimated energy yields are much more dependent on the variability of annual solar irradiation. We used two different models: (i) Photovoltaic Geographical Information System based on coarse data and (ii) ArcGIS Area Solar Radiation tool based on digital surface models at very high resolutions (<= 1 m) acquired from UAV photogrammetry. We compared solar irradiation estimates with ground-truth data from a PV system installed on the roof. We show that the effect of adopted model and resolution on estimated irradiation is negligible in comparison with the year-to-year variation of meteorological conditions. We suggest that accurate predictions can be made with relatively coarse building data (e.g. simple roof shapes that do not include dormers and chimneys).

TI  - Spectral Diversity Metrics for Detecting Oil Pollution Effects on Biodiversity in the Niger Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring in the Niger delta has become pertinent in view of the incessant spillages from oil production activities and the socio-economic impact of these spillages on the inhabitants who depend on the resources for their livelihood. Conventional methods of post-impact assessments are expensive, time consuming, and cause damage to the environment, as they often require the removal of affected samples/specimens for laboratory analysis. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space while using the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). The SVH proposes that the species diversity of a sampled area is linearly correlated with the variability of spectral reflectance of the area. Several authors have tested the SVH on various land cover types and spatial scales; however, the present study evaluated the validity of the SVH against the backdrop of oil pollution impact on biodiversity while using vascular plant species as surrogates. Species richness and diversity indices were computed from vegetation data collected from polluted and non-polluted transects. Spectral metrics that were derived from Sentinel 2 bands and broadband vegetation indices (BVIs) using various algorithms, including averages, spread, dimension reduction, and so on, were assessed for their ability to estimate vascular plants species richness and diversity. The results showed significant differences in vegetation characteristics of polluted and control transects (H = 76.05, p-value = <0.05 for abundance and H = 170.03, p-value < 0.05 for richness). Spectral diversity metrics correlated negatively with species data on polluted transects and positively on control transects. The metrics computed using Sentinel 2A bands and vegetation indices proved to be sensitive to changes in vegetation characteristics following oil pollution. The most robust relationship was observed between the metrics and indices on control transects, whereas the weakest relationships were observed on polluted transects. Index-wise, the Simpson's diversity index regressed better with spectral metrics (R-2 > 0.5), whereas the Chao-1 richness index regressed the least (R-2 < 0.5). The strength of the relationship resulted in successfully estimating species richness and diversity values of investigated transects, thereby enhancing biodiversity monitoring over time and space.

TI  - Mapping Succession in Non-Forest Habitats by Means of Remote Sensing: Is the Data Acquisition Time Critical for Species Discrimination?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of secondary succession is one of the most significant threats to non-forest (natural and semi-natural open) Natura 2000 habitats in Poland; shrub and tree encroachment taking place on abandoned, low productive agricultural areas, historically used as pastures or meadows, leads to changes to the composition of species and biodiversity loss, and results in landscape transformations. There is a perceived need to create a methodology for the monitoring of vegetation succession by airborne remote sensing, both from quantitative (area, volume) and qualitative (plant species) perspectives. This is likely to become a very important issue for the effective protection of natural and semi-natural habitats and to advance conservation planning. A key variable to be established when implementing a qualitative approach is the remote sensing data acquisition date, which determines the developmental stage of trees and shrubs forming the succession process. It is essential to choose the optimal date on which the spectral and geometrical characteristics of the species are as different from each other as possible. As part of the research presented here, we compare classifications based on remote sensing data acquired during three different parts of the growing season (spring, summer and autumn) for five study areas. The remote sensing data used include high-resolution hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data acquired simultaneously from a common aerial platform. Classifications are done using the random forest algorithm, and the set of features to be classified is determined by a recursive feature elimination procedure. The results show that the time of remote sensing data acquisition influences the possibility of differentiating succession species. This was demonstrated by significant differences in the spatial extent of species, which ranged from 33.2% to 56.2% when comparing pairs of maps, and differences in classification accuracies, which when expressed in values of Cohen's Kappa reached similar to 0.2. For most of the analysed species, the spring and autumn dates turned out to be slightly more favourable than the summer one. However, the final recommendation for the data acquisition time should take into consideration the phenological cycle of deciduous species present within the research area and the abiotic conditions.

TI  - Application of DInSAR-PSI Technology for Deformation Monitoring of the Mosul Dam, Iraq
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-going monitoring of deformation of dams is critical to assure their safe and efficient operation. Traditional monitoring methods, based on in-situ sensors measurements on the dam, have some limitations in spatial coverage, observation frequency, and cost. This paper describes the potential use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes from Sentinel-1A for characterizing deformations at the Mosul Dam (MD) in NW Iraq. Seventy-eight Single Look Complex (SLC) scenes in ascending geometry from the Sentinel-1A scenes, acquired from 03 October 2014 to 27 June 2019, and 96 points within the MD structure, were selected to determine the deformation rate using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI). Maximum deformation velocity was found to be about 7.4 mm.yr(-1) at a longitudinal subsidence area extending over a length of 222 m along the dam axis. The mean subsidence velocity in this area is about 6.27 mm.yr(-1) and lies in the center of MD. Subsidence rate shows an inverse relationship with the reservoir water level. It also shows a strong correlation with grouting episodes. Variations in the deformation rate within the same year are most probably due to increased hydrostatic stress which was caused by water storage in the dam that resulted in an increase in solubility of gypsum beds, creating voids and localized collapses underneath the dam. PSI information derived from Sentinel-1A proved to be a good tool for monitoring dam deformation with good accuracy, yielding results that can be used in engineering applications and also risk management.

TI  - Salinity stress detection in rice crops using time series MODIS VI data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the abiotic stresses that constrains rice crop growth in the extensive coastal regions of India. Monitoring soil condition on such a large scale is time-consuming and expensive and alternative approaches have been proposed. Crop condition can be used as a reference to detect salinity-affected soils in rice crops instead of direct detection of soil condition. Vegetation indices derived from high temporal resolution satellites like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have the potential to detect soil salinity in a cost- and time-efficient manner. This study analysed the temporal trend of salinity in the kharif (wet) season and the behaviour of rice crop phenological indicators under different levels of salinity. We tested the applicability of MODIS time series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data for soil salinity detection in rice crops in the coastal region of Odisha, India. We used smoothed time series profiles of MODIS EVI 8 day composite data from 2011 to 2015 to extract rice crop phenological parameters. A total of 350 soil samples were periodically collected from 80 sites during the kharif season. Results showed that soil salinity was negatively correlated with EVI (r = - 0.76). Among all the rice crop parameters, the seasonal integral (SI) and amplitude of the EVI signal were the most promising indicators of soil salinity and its intensity. We observed consistently low SI and amplitude values of EVI in homogeneous rice pixels at high saline levels from 2011 to 2015 (P > 0.050). Our study showed that the extraction of phenological parameters from MODIS EVI is a promising method for detecting soil salinity in rice growing areas at regional scales even at low salinity levels.

TI  - Demonstration and Evaluation of 3D Winds Generated by Tracking Features in Moisture and Ozone Fields Derived from AIRS Sounding Retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than 15 years, polar winds from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery have been generated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS). These datasets are a NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) operational satellite product that is used at more than 10 major numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers worldwide. The MODIS polar winds product is composed of both infrared window (IR-W) and water vapor (WV) tracked features. The WV atmospheric motion vectors (AMV) yield a better spatial distribution than the IR-W since both cloud and clear-sky features can be tracked in the WV images. As the new generation polar satellite-era begins with the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), there is currently no WV channel on the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), resulting in a data gap with only IR-W derived AMVs possible. This scenario presents itself as an opportunity to evaluate hyperspectral infrared moisture retrievals from consecutive overlapping satellite polar passes to extract atmospheric motion from clear-sky regions on constant (and known) pressure surfaces, i.e., estimating winds in retrieval space rather than radiance space. Perhaps most significantly, this method has the potential to provide vertical wind profiles, as opposed to the current MODIS-derived single-level AMVs. In this study, the winds technique is applied to Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) moisture retrievals from NASA's Aqua satellite. The resulting winds are assimilated into the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5). The results are encouraging, as the AIRS retrieval polar AMVs have a similar quality as the MODIS AMVs and exhibit a positive impact in the hemispheric Day 4.5 to 6.5 forecasts for a one-month experiment in July 2012.

TI  - Mapping Trajectories of Coastal Land Reclamation in Nine Deltaic Megacities using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing demand for land resources at the coast has exerted immense pressure on vulnerable environments. Population and economic growth in coastal cities have combined to produce a scarcity of suitable space for development, the response to which has frequently been the reclamation of land from the sea, most prominently in China. Urbanization is a key driver of such changes and a detailed investigation of coastal land reclamation at the city scale is required. This study analyzed remote sensing imagery for the period 1990 to 2018 to explore the trajectories of coastal land reclamation in nine major urban agglomerations across the three largest deltas in China using the JRC Global Surface Water (Yearly Water Classification History, v1.1) (GSW) dataset on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results are considered in the context of major national policy reforms over the last three decades. The analysis reveals that total land reclaimed among nine selected cities had exceeded 2800 km(2) since 1984, 82% of which occurred after 2000, a year following the enactment of China's agricultural 'red line' policy. Shanghai exhibited the greatest overall area of land extension, followed by Ningbo and Tianjin, especially in the period following the privatization of property rights in 2004. In analyzing annual trends, we identified the developmental stages of a typical coastal reclamation project and how these vary between cities. Scrutiny of the results revealed voids in nighttime light satellite data (2014-2018) in some localities. Although these voids appeared to be characterized by construction, they were occupied by vacant buildings, and were therefore examples of so-called "ghost cities." In China, as elsewhere, continual land reclamation needs to be considered in relation to, inter alia, sea level rise and land subsidence that pose significant challenges to the vision of sustainable urban development in these three deltaic megacities.

TI  - Rice yield estimation using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the ORYZA crop growth model: development and application of the system in South and South-east Asian countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A rice yield estimation system was developed based on the crop growth model ORYZA and SAR-derived key information such as start of season (SOS) and leaf area growth rate. Results from study sites in South and South-east Asian countries suggest that incorporating remote sensing data, specifically Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), into a process-based crop model improves the spatial distribution of yield estimates. This article highlights the detailed methodology of SAR data incorporation into crop yield simulation and comprehensive validation of yield forecast and estimates in the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Tamil Nadu, India. Remote sensing data assimilation into a crop model effectively captures the responses of rice crops to environmental conditions over large spatial coverage, which otherwise is practically impossible to achieve. A process-based crop simulation model is used in the system to ensure that climate information is captured, and this provides the capacity to deliver a mid-season yield forecast for national planning and policy for rice. Good agreement between SAR-based yield and crop-cut-based yield and official yield statistics and ensuring efficiency of the processing suggest that the system is a promising solution for the needed timely information on rice yield for application in food security and policies, climate disaster management, and crop insurance programs.

TI  - Urban Land Use and Land Cover Classification Using Multisource Remote Sensing Images and Social Media Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) are diverse and complex in urban areas. Remotely sensed images are commonly used for land cover classification but hardly identifies urban land use and functional areas because of the semantic gap (i.e., different definitions of similar or identical buildings). Social media data, "marks" left by people using mobile phones, have great potential to overcome this semantic gap. Multisource remote sensing data are also expected to be useful in distinguishing different LULC types. This study examined the capability of combined multisource remote sensing images and social media data in urban LULC classification. Multisource remote sensing images included a Chinese ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) high-resolution image, a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral image, and a Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. Social media data consisted of the hourly spatial distribution of WeChat users, which is a ubiquitous messaging and payment platform in China. LULC was classified into 10 types, namely, vegetation, bare land, road, water, urban village, greenhouses, residential, commercial, industrial, and educational buildings. A method that integrates object-based image analysis, decision trees, and random forests was used for LULC classification. The overall accuracy and kappa value attained by the combination of multisource remote sensing images and WeChat data were 87.55% and 0.84, respectively. They further improved to 91.55% and 0.89, respectively, by integrating the textural and spatial features extracted from the ZY-3 image. The ZY-3 high-resolution image was essential for urban LULC classification because it is necessary for the accurate delineation of land parcels. The addition of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1A SAR, or WeChat data also made an irreplaceable contribution to the classification of different LULC types. The Landsat 8 OLI image helped distinguish between the urban village, residential buildings, commercial buildings, and roads, while the Sentinel-1A SAR data reduced the confusion between commercial buildings, greenhouses, and water. Rendering the spatial and temporal dynamics of population density, the WeChat data improved the classification accuracies of an urban village, greenhouses, and commercial buildings.

TI  - The growth of peer support: an international charter
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: While mental health peer support originated in its contemporary form in English-speaking countries, it is now spreading rapidly across the globe. This rapid growth presents two major challenges. The first pertains to "role integrity" and the second to the possible culture-bound nature of peer support; a concern which has attended the emergence of peer support in countries that have significantly different worldviews. Method: Recognizing the growth of peer support and the resulting challenges, this report results from the convening of an international consortium of peer leaders from six continents (all but Antarctica). Following an environmental scan of the state of peer support globally, this group moved to develop consensus on a common, core set of guiding principles and values to ensure a robust future for the development of effective, culturally responsive forms of peer support. Findings: Key principles, values and practices considered essential to peer support are presented. Conclusions and implications for practice: Assuming that sufficient political and community support are generated, there can be considerable enthusiasm for the expansion of peer support around the globe. Peer leaders are encouraged, however, to develop and deliver peer support both with integrity to its founding values in a civil rights and social justice framework and with responsiveness to local cultural worldviews.

TI  - Purifying SLIC Superpixels to Optimize Superpixel-Based Classification of High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate classification of high spatial resolution remote sensing image is important for many applications. The usage of superpixels in classification has been proposed to accelerate the speed of classification. However, although most superpixels only contain pixels from single class, there are still some mixed superpixels, which mostly locate near the edge of different classes, and contain pixels from more than one class. Such mixed superpixels will cause misclassification regardless of classification methods used. In this paper, a superpixels purification algorithm based on color quantization is proposed to purify mixed Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixels. After purifying, the mixed SLIC superpixel will be separated into smaller superpixels. These smaller superpixels are pure superpixels which only contain a single kind of ground object. The experiments on images from the dataset BSDS500 show that the purified SLIC superpixels outperform the original SLIC superpixels on three segmentation evaluation metrics. With the purified SLIC superpixels, a classification scheme in which only edge superpixels are selected to be purified is proposed. The strategy of purifying edge superpixels not only improves the efficiency of the algorithm, but also improves the accuracy of the classification. The experiments on a remote sensing image from WorldView-2 satellite demonstrate that purified SLIC superpixels at all scales can generate classification result with higher accuracy than original SLIC superpixels, especially at the scale of 20 x 20, for which the accuracy increase is higher than 4%.

TI  - Crop classification with WorldView-2 imagery using Support Vector Machine comparing texture analysis approaches and grey relational analysis in Jianan Plain, Taiwan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production estimation is of crucial concern in Taiwan, and the government has invested much effort including employing manpower and technologies. Artificial intelligence or data mining technology have been successfully applied on land-cover recognition of remote-sensing imagery. Most studies are employing a pixel-based classification approach to generate the thematic map of land covers. Few studies consider the spatial correlation of adjacent pixels of the same category. Mixed pixel issues usually degrade the prediction accuracy according to previous studies. It is thus the main goal of the present study to explore the spatial effect of adjacent pixels on land-cover mapping. The study region is a WorldView-2 satellite image in Jianan Plain, Taiwan, taken in 2014. Support Vector Machine is used as the underlying classifier. In addition to the eight spectral band intensities, normalized difference vegetation index and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures are included as ancillary attributes. Furthermore, grey relational analysis (GRA) is employed to assist in classifying croplands. The findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) GLCM texture information improves classification accuracy marginally and renders slightly better thematic map, (2) GRA is used to acquire the most important factors concerning discriminating land covers, (3) grey relational grade threshold, a metric designed through GRA, can be used to locate uncertain region of a specified crop, which is possibly caused by mixed pixels.

TI  - Going Deeper with Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks for Multispectral Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising performance in the field of multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) image fusion (MS pansharpening). However, the small-scale data and the gradient vanishing problem have been preventing the existing CNN-based fusion approaches from leveraging deeper networks that potentially have better representation ability to characterize the complex nonlinear mapping relationship between the input (source) and the targeting (fused) images. In this paper, we introduce a very deep network with dense blocks and residual learning to tackle these problems. The proposed network takes advantage of dense connections in dense blocks that have connections for arbitrarily two convolution layers to facilitate gradient flow and implicit deep supervision during training. In addition, reusing feature maps can reduce the number of parameters, which is helpful for reducing overfitting that resulted from small-scale data. Residual learning is explored to reduce the difficulty for the model to generate the MS image with high spatial resolution. The proposed network is evaluated via experiments on three datasets, achieving competitive or superior performance, e.g. the spectral angle mapper (SAM) is decreased over 10% on GaoFen-2, when compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Multispectral Image Super-Resolution Burned-Area Mapping Based on Space-Temperature Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral imaging (MI) provides important information for burned-area mapping. Due to the severe conditions of burned areas and the limitations of sensors, the resolution of collected multispectral images is sometimes very rough, hindering the accurate determination of burned areas. Super-resolution mapping (SRM) has been proposed for mapping burned areas in rough images to solve this problem, allowing super-resolution burned-area mapping (SRBAM). However, the existing SRBAM methods do not use sufficiently accurate space information and detailed temperature information. To improve the mapping accuracy of burned areas, an improved SRBAM method utilizing space-temperature information (STI) is proposed here. STI contains two elements, a space element and a temperature element. We utilized the random-walker algorithm (RWA) to characterize the space element, which encompassed accurate object space information, while the temperature element with rich temperature information was derived by calculating the normalized burn ratio (NBR). The two elements were then merged to produce an objective function with space-temperature information. The particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA) was employed to handle the objective function and derive the burned-area mapping results. The dataset of the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) from Denali National Park, Alaska, was used for testing and showed that the STI method is superior to the traditional SRBAM method.

TI  - Subpixel mapping of urban built-up areas using spatial-spectral information from satellite multispectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method for subpixel mapping of urban built-up areas (SMUBA) using spatial-spectral information from satellite multispectral remote sensing imagery is proposed. SMUBA contains two terms, a spatial term and a spectral term. First, a spatial attraction model is used to produce the spatial term. The Normalized difference built-up index is then utilized to obtain the spectral term. Finally, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the two terms and obtain the final mapping result. Since the spatial-spectral information of the urban built-up areas from multispectral imagery is fully utilized by the two terms, the final mapping result is improved. Experimental results on two Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data show that SMUBA produces better mapping results than state-of-the-art subpixel mapping methods. Moreover, the proposed method does not need any prior shape information.

TI  - Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Estimating the Soil Salinity of Salt-Affected Soil Using Field Spectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt-affected soil is a prominent ecological and environmental problem in dry farming areas throughout the world. China has nearly 9.9 million km(2) of salt-affected land. The identification, monitoring, and utilization of soil salinization have become important research topics for promoting sustainable progress. In this paper, using field-measured spectral data and soil salinity parameter data, through analysis and transformation of spectral data, five machine learning models, namely, random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), gradient-boosted regression tree (GBRT), multilayer perceptron regression (MLPR), and least angle regression (Lars) are compared. The following performance measures of each model were evaluated: the collinear problems, handling data noise, stability, and the accuracy. In terms of these four aspects, the performance of each model on estimating soil salinity is evaluated. The results demonstrate that among the five models, RFR has the best performance in dealing with collinearity, RFR and MLPR have the best performance in dealing with data noise, and the SVR model is the most stable. The Lars model has the highest accuracy, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.87, ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2.67, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.18, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11. Then, the comprehensive comparison and analysis of the five models are carried out, and it is found that the comprehensive performance of RFR model is the best; hence, this method is most suitable for estimating soil salinity using hyperspectral data. This study can provide a reference for the selection of regression methods in subsequent studies on estimating soil salinity using hyperspectral data.

TI  - A hierarchical extension of a multiple-component scattering model with unitary transformation of the coherency matrix
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The overestimation of volume scattering (OVS) is an essential shortcoming of the model-based polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) target decomposition method. It is likely to affect the measurement accuracy and result in mixed ambiguity of the scattering mechanism. In this paper, a hierarchical extended multi-component decomposition method (ExMCSM) that can adaptively select the refined volume scattering models based on the artificial area extraction result is proposed for overcoming the OVS. First, artificial areas are extracted from the image to distinguish between artificial areas and non-artificial areas. Then, orientation angle compensation (OAC) and helix angle compensation (HAC) are applied to the coherency matrix to reduce the complexity of the operation. Finally, the volume scattering model of each pixel is refined to more effectively adapt to various scattering mechanisms. Spaceborne Gaofen-3 full PolSAR data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed decomposition method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed decomposition method can accurately represent the scattering characteristics of the ambiguous regions and the oriented building areas can be well discriminated as dihedral or odd-bounce structures.

TI  - Predicting osteoporosis medication receipt in Veterans with a spinal cord injury: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To describe frequency and predictors of use of pharmacological therapies for osteoporosis in persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI).Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: United States Veterans Health Administration (VA) national databases.Participants: 11,048 persons with a traumatic SCI who received VA health care between Fiscal Years (FY) 2005-2015. Pharmacy data from VA's Corporate Data Warehouse were used to identify prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, denosumab, raloxifene and teriparatide.Outcome Measures: Demographics, clinical and SCI-related characteristics, receipt of a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and prevalent lower extremity fractures were examined to determine factors related to receiving a pharmacological agent for osteoporosis.Results: 1,041 persons (9.4%) had a prescription for a pharmacological agent for osteoporosis; the majority (n = 964, 93.0%) were bisphosphonates. There was a significant decline in the number of these prescriptions from FY 2005 (13.0%) to FY 2015 (2.2%). In multivariable analysis, age (>50 years) (OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.31-1.94); female sex (OR = 4.09, 95% CI 2.74-6.09); opioid (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.51) or corticosteroid (OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.01-1.51) prescriptions; complete injury (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.53); receipt of a DXA scan (OR = 84.03, 95% CI 59.80-118.07) and prevalent fracture (OR = 5.43, 95% CI 4.13-7.15) were positive predictors. Black race (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.57) and obese BMI (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.76) were negative predictors.Conclusions: Prescriptions for osteoporosis medications for persons with a SCI declined in recent years. The strongest predictors for having filled these prescriptions were having had a DXA or a prevalent fracture.

TI  - A Crop Group-Specific Pure Pixel Time Series for Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long timeseries of Earth observation data for the characterization of agricultural crops across large scales are of high interest to crop modelers, scientists, and decision makers in the fields of agricultural and environmental policy as well as crop monitoring and food security. They are particularly important for regression-based crop monitoring systems that rely on historic information. The major challenge lies in identifying pixels from satellite imagery that represent pure enough crop signals. Here, we present a data-driven semi-automatic approach to identify pure pixels of two crop groups (i.e., winter and spring crops and summer crops) based on a MODIS-NDVI timeseries. We applied this method to the European Union at a 250 m spatial resolution. Pre-processed and smoothed, daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data (2001-2017) were used to first extract the phenological data. To account for regional characteristics (varying climate, agro-management, etc.), these data were clustered by administrative units and by year using a Gaussian mixture model. The number of clusters was pre-defined using data from regional agricultural acreage statistics. After automatic labelling, clusters were filtered based on agronomic knowledge and phenological information extracted from the same timeseries. The resulting pure pixels were validated with two different datasets, one based on high-resolution Sentinel-2 data (5 sites, 2 years) and one based on a regional crop map (1 site, 7 years). For the winter and spring crop class, pixel purity amounted to 93% using the first validation dataset and to 73% using the second one, averaged over the different years. For summer crops, the respective values were 61% (91% without one critical validation site) and 72%. The phenological analyses revealed a clear trend towards an earlier NDVI peak (approximately -0.28 days/year) for winter and spring crops across Europe. We expect that this dataset will be useful for various applications, from crop model calibration to operational crop monitoring and yield forecasting.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Fractional Woody Vegetation Cover in the Arid Savannas of Namibia Using LiDAR Training Data, Machine Learning, and ALOS PALSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Namibia is a very arid country, which has experienced significant bush encroachment and associated decreased livestock productivity. Therefore, it is essential to monitor bush encroachment and widespread debushing activities, including selective bush thinning and complete bush clearing. The aim of study was to develop a system to map and monitor fractional woody cover (FWC) at national scales (50 m and 75 m resolution) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data (Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) global mosaics, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016) and ancillary variables (mean annual precipitation-MAP, elevation), with machine learning models that were trained with diverse airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data sets (244,032 ha, 2008-2014). When only the SAR variables were used, an average R-2 of 0.65 (RSME = 0.16) was attained. Adding either elevation or MAP, or both ancillary variables, increased the mean R-2 to 0.75 (RSME = 0.13), and 0.79 (RSME = 0.12). The inclusion of MAP addressed the overestimation of FWC in very arid areas, but resulted in anomalies in the form of sharp gradients in FWC along a MAP contour which were most likely caused by to the geographic distribution of the LiDAR training data. Additional targeted LiDAR acquisitions could address this issue. This was the first attempt to produce SAR-derived FWC maps for Namibia and the maps contain substantially more detailed spatial information on woody vegetation structure than existing national maps. During the seven-year study period the Shrubland-Woodland Mosaic was the only vegetation structural class that exhibited a regional net gain in FWC of more than 0.2 across 9% (11,906 km(2)) of its area that may potentially be attributed to bush encroachment. FWC change maps provided regional insights and detailed local patterns related to debushing and regrowth that can inform national rangeland policies and debushing programs.

TI  - Is the Recommendation of a Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Conjunction with Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients Justified? Report from a Multidisciplinary Expert Panel Meeting
T2  - ADVANCES IN THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Pelvic lymphadenectomy (pLA) in prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common uro-oncologic surgical procedures. An increased complication rate is accompanied by unproven oncologic benefit. Extent of pLA and mechanisms of metastasis are discussed controversially. We aimed to explore evidence and knowledge gaps in pLA and mechanisms of metastasis in PCa and to develop further steps to clarify oncologic benefits through an expert panel. Methods A multidisciplinary expert meeting was initiated, compiling available facts on pLA and mechanisms of metastasis in PCa. Questions and hypotheses were formulated. The resulting protocol was modeled on priority and consistency in four anonymized voting rounds using the Delphi method (March 2018-June 2018). Results The oncologic benefit of pLA in PCa is still unclear. Results of randomized trials (RCTs) are pending. Extent and techniques of pLA are differently applied and inconsistently recommended by the guidelines as well as the indication for pLA. Different growth rates for the primaries and metastases and different survival curves for lymph node and organ metastasis at diagnosis argue against metastasis originating from positive nodes. However, results from clinical and basic research support this opportunity in PCa. Conclusions The RCTs required to clarify the estimated low oncologic benefit of pLA prove to be difficult because of the great effort (e.g., high case number). Establishing a network of treatment centers for implementation of high-quality cohort studies could be an alternative approach. Future studies with larger panels and international participants based on the presented feasibility should be launched to set this process in motion. Until valid data are available, benefits and harms of pLA should be weighted under consideration of low-invasive techniques (e.g., sentinel pLA).

TI  - Self-Adjusting Thresholding for Burnt Area Detection Based on Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of regional fires would make it possible to analyse their environmental, social and economic impact, as well as to develop better fire management systems. However, automatic mapping of burnt areas has proved to be a challenging task, due to the wide diversity of vegetation cover worldwide and the heterogeneous nature of fires themselves. Here, we present an algorithm for the automatic mapping of burnt areas using medium-resolution optical images. Although developed for Landsat images, it can be also applied to Sentinel-2 images without modification. The algorithm draws upon the classical concept of differences in pre- and post-fire reflectance, but also takes advantage of the object-oriented approach and a new threshold calculation method. It consists of four steps. The first concerns the calculation of spectral indices and their differences, together with differences in spectral layers based on pre- and post-fire images. In the second step, multiresolution segmentation and masking are performed (clouds, water bodies and non-vegetated areas are removed from further analysis). Thirdly, 'core' burnt areas are detected using automatically-adjusted thresholds. Thresholds are calculated on the basis of specific functions established for difference layers. The last step combines neighbourhood analysis and patch growing to define the final shape of burnt areas. The algorithm was tested in 27 areas located worldwide, and covered by various types of vegetation. Comparisons with manual interpretation show that the fully-automated classification is accurate. Over 82% of classifications were considered satisfactory (overall accuracy > 90%; user and producer accuracy > 70%).

TI  - Semi-automatic selection of optimum image pairs based on the interferometric coherence for time series SAR interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (TS-InSAR) has been widely used for monitoring ground deformation. The selection of interferometric image pairs directly affects the quality of the interferograms and the accuracy of deformation monitoring. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) method has been widely adopted to form interferograms in TS-InSAR. However, the selection of low-quality interferograms or missed selection of good interferograms due to temporal and/or spatial baselines exceeding the thresholds sometimes occurs in the traditional SBAS method. This letter proposes a new method, namely, the semi-automatic selection of optimum image pairs (SASOIP), based on the interferometric coherence. By quantitatively evaluating the coherence of point targets in a small feature region, the SASOIP results in high-quality interferometric image pairs selected from all possible interferometric combinations for any two SAR images. The SASOIP method can effectively reduce the probability of poor selection and missed selection of quality image pairs. Twenty-nine COSMO-SkyMed SAR images acquired from 27 August 2011, to 29 July 2015, over Tianjin, China, are used to test the proposed algorithm. Validation with 102 levelling data points demonstrates that the accuracy of ground deformation derived from the interferograms by the SASOIP method is 23.13% higher than that based on the SBAS method.

TI  - Assessment of the Impacts of Image Signal-to-Noise Ratios in Impervious Surface Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium spatial resolution satellite images are frequently used to characterize thematic land cover and a continuous field at both regional and global scales. However, high spatial resolution remote sensing data can provide details in landscape structures, especially in the urban environment. With upgrades to spatial resolution and spectral coverage for many satellite sensors, the impact of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in characterizing a landscape with highly heterogeneous features at the sub-pixel level is still uncertain. This study used WorldView-3 (WV3) images as a basis to evaluate the impacts of SNR on mapping a fractional developed impervious surface area (ISA). The point spread function (PSF) from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) was used to resample the WV3 images to three different resolutions: 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m. Noise was then added to the resampled WV3 images to simulate different fractional levels of OLI SNRs. Furthermore, regression tree algorithms were incorporated into these images to estimate the ISA at different spatial scales. The study results showed that the total areal estimate could be improved by about 1% and 0.4% at 10-m spatial resolutions in our two study areas when the SNR changes from half to twice that of the Landsat OLI SNR level. Such improvement is more obvious in the high imperviousness ranges. The root-mean-square-error of ISA estimates using images that have twice and two-thirds the SNRs of OLI varied consistently from high to low when spatial resolutions changed from 10 m to 20 m. The increase of SNR, however, did not improve the overall performance of ISA estimates at 30 m.

Many models have been developed for mitigating or eliminating the terrain effects on the quality of remote sensing images in hilly and mountainous areas. However, these models usually use global parameters, which may lead to overcorrections for regions with poor illumination and steep slopes. In this study, we present a local parameter estimation (LPE) method based on a pixel-moving window for topographic correction (TC), which can be considered as a general optimization framework for most semiempirical TC models. We set seven kernel sizes for the presented framework, which are 15 pixels, 25 pixels, 50 pixels, 100 pixels, 250 pixels, 500 pixels, and 1000 pixels, respectively. The proposed method was then applied to four traditional TC models, Minnaert (MIN), C Correction (CC), Sun Canopy Sensor + C (SCSC) and Statistical Empirical Correction (SEC), to form four new TC models. These new models were used to estimate forest carbon density of a mountainous area in Southern China using field plot data and a Landsat 8 image. Four evaluation methods, including correlation analysis, the stability of land covers, comparison of reflectance between sunlit and shaded slopes, and accuracy assessment of forest carbon density, were employed to evaluate the contributions of moving window sizes, and assess the performance of the TC models for forest carbon density estimation. The results show that the four TC models with LPE perform much better than the traditional TC models in reducing the topographic effects and improving the estimation accuracy of forest carbon density for the study area. Among the traditional TC models, SEC performs slightly better than SCSC, CC, and MIN. Therefore, the SEC-based model with LPE, that is, LPE-SEC, gets greater R-2 and smaller relative RMSE values in estimating forest carbon density than other models. Moreover, all the means of the predicted forest carbon density values fall in the confidence interval of the validation data at a significant level of 0.05. Overall, this study implies that the proposed method with LPE provides great potential to improve the performance of TC and forest carbon density estimation for the study area. It is expected that the improved TC method can be applied to other mountainous areas to improve the quality of remotely sensed images.

TI  - Using Multi-Sensor Satellite Images and Auxiliary Data in Updating and Assessing the Accuracies of Urban Land Products in Different Landscape Patterns
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate updating of urban land areas is of great significance to the study of environmental changes. Although there are many urban land products (ULPs) at present, such as GlobeLand30, Global Urban Footprint (GUF), and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), these products are all static data of a certain year, and are not able to provide high-accuracy updating of urban land areas. In addition, the accuracies of these data and their application value in the update of urban land areas need to be urgently proven. Therefore, we proposed an approach to quickly and accurately update urban land areas in the Kuala Lumpur region of Malaysia, and assessed the accuracies of urban land products in different urban landscape patterns. The approach combined the advantages of multi-source data including existing ULPs, OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images. Three main steps make up this approach. First, the urban land training samples were selected in the urban areas consistent with GlobeLand30, GUF, and GHSL, and samples of bare land, vegetation, water bodies, and road auxiliary data were obtained by GlobeLand30 and OSM. Then, the random forest was used to extract urban land areas according to the object's features in the OLI and PALSAR images. Last, we assessed the accuracies of GlobeLand30, GUF, GHSL, and the results of this study (ULC) by using point and area validation methods. The results showed that the ULC had the highest overall accuracy of 90.18% among the four products and could accurately depict urban land in different urban landscapes. The GHSL was the second most accurate of the four products, and the accuracy in urban areas was much higher than that in rural areas. The GUF had many omission errors in urban land areas and could not delineate a large area of complete spatial information of urban land, but it could effectively extract scattered residential land with small patches. GlobeLand30 had the lowest accuracy and could only express rough, large-scale urban land. The above conclusions provide evidence that ULPs and the approach proposed in this study have a great application potential for high-accuracy updating of urban land areas.

TI  - Winter Wheat Mapping Based on Sentinel-2 Data in Heterogeneous Planting Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and mapping the spatial distribution of winter wheat accurately is important for crop management, damage assessment and yield prediction. In this study, northern and central Anhui province were selected as study areas, and Sentinel-2 imagery was employed to map winter wheat distribution and the results were verified with Planet imagery in the 2017-2018 growing season. The Sentinel-2 imagery at the heading stage was identified as the optimum period for winter wheat area extraction after analyzing the images from different growth stages using the Jeffries-Matusita distance method. Therefore, ten spectral bands, seven vegetation indices (VI), water index and building index generated from the image at the heading stage were used to classify winter wheat areas by a random forest (RF) algorithm. The result showed that the accuracy was from 93% to 97%, with a Kappa above 0.82 and a percentage error lower than 5% in northern Anhui, and an accuracy of about 80% with Kappa ranging from 0.70 to 0.78 and a percentage error of about 20% in central Anhui. Northern Anhui has a large planting scale of winter wheat and flat terrain while central Anhui grows relatively small winter wheat areas and a high degree of surface fragmentation, which makes the extraction effect in central Anhui inferior to that in northern Anhui. Further, an optimum subset data was obtained from VIs, water index, building index and spectral bands using an RF algorithm. The result of using the optimum subset data showed a high accuracy of classification with a great advantage in data volume and processing time. This study provides a perspective for winter wheat mapping under various climatic and complicated land surface conditions and is of great significance for crop monitoring and agricultural decision-making.

TI  - Estimating Spatio-Temporal Variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using VIIRS-Derived AOD in the Guanzhong Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from satellite remote sensing is widely used to estimate surface PM2.5 (dry mass concentration of particles with an in situ aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m) concentrations. In this research, a two-stage spatio-temporal statistical model for estimating daily surface PM2.5 concentrations in the Guanzhong Basin of China is proposed, using 6 km x 6 km AOD data available from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument as the main variable and meteorological factors, land-cover, and population data as auxiliary variables. The model is validated using a cross-validation method. The linear mixed effects (LME) model used in the first stage could be improved by using a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model or the generalized additive model (GAM) in the second stage, and the predictive capability of the GWR model is better than that of GAM. The two-stage spatio-temporal statistical model of LME and GWR successfully captures the temporal and spatial variations. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the bias and the root-mean-squared prediction errors (RMSEs) of the model fitting to the two-stage spatio-temporal models of LME and GWR were 0.802, -0.378 mu g/m(3), and 12.746 mu g/m(3), respectively, and the model cross-validation results were 0.703, 1.451 mu g/m(3), and 15.731 mu g/m(3), respectively. The model prediction maps show that the topography has a strong influence on the spatial distribution of the PM2.5 concentrations in the Guanzhong Basin, and PM2.5 concentrations vary with the seasons. This method can provide reliable PM2.5 predictions to reduce the bias of exposure assessment in air pollution and health research.

TI  - Reconstructing One Kilometre Resolution Daily Clear-Sky LST for China's Landmass Using the BME Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter used to characterize the interaction between land and the atmosphere. Therefore, obtaining highly accurate, spatially consistent and temporally continuous LSTs in large areas is the basis of many studies. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product is commonly used to achieve this. However, it has many missing values caused by clouds and other factors. The current gap-filling methods need to be improved when applied to large areas. In this study, we used the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method, which considers spatial and temporal correlation, and takes multiple regression results of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), longitude and latitude as soft data to reconstruct space-complete daily clear-sky LSTs with a 1 km resolution for China's landmass in 2015. The average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of this method was 1.6 K for the daytime and 1.2 K for the nighttime when we simultaneously covered more than 10,000 verification points, including blocks that were continuous in space, and the average RMSE of a single discrete verification point for 365 days was 0.4 K for the daytime and 0.3 K for the nighttime when we covered four discrete points. Urban and snow land cover types have a higher accuracy than forests and grasslands, and the accuracy is higher in winter than in summer. The high accuracy and great ability of this method to capture extreme values in urban areas can help improve urban heat island research. This method can also be extended to other study areas, other time periods, and the estimation of other geographical attribute values. How to effectively convert clear-sky LST into real LST requires further research.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Deep Learning Models for Early Crop Classification Using Sentinel-1A Imagery Time Series-A Case Study in Zhanjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of the area and distribution of crops is vital for food security. Optical remote sensing has been a key technique for acquiring crop area and conditions on regional to global scales, but great challenges arise due to frequent cloudy days in southern China. This makes optical remote sensing images usually unavailable. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) could bridge this gap since it is less affected by clouds. The recent availability of Sentinel-1A (S1A) SAR imagery with a 12-day revisit period at a high spatial resolution of about 10 m makes it possible to fully utilize phenological information to improve early crop classification. In deep learning methods, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM RNNs), and gated recurrent unit RNNs (GRU RNNs) have been shown to efficiently extract temporal features for classification tasks. However, due to the complexity of training, these three deep learning methods have been less used in early crop classification. In this work, we attempted to combine them with an incremental classification method to avoid the need for training optimal architectures and hyper-parameters for data from each time series. First, we trained 1D CNNs, LSTM RNNs, and GRU RNNs based on the full images' time series to attain three classifiers with optimal architectures and hyper-parameters. Then, starting at the first time point, we performed an incremental classification process to train each classifier using all of the previous data, and obtained a classification network with all parameter values (including the hyper-parameters) at each time point. Finally, test accuracies of each time point were assessed for each crop type to determine the optimal time series length. A case study was conducted in Suixi and Leizhou counties of Zhanjiang City, China. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we also implemented the classic random forest (RF) approach. The results were as follows: (i) 1D CNNs achieved the highest Kappa coefficient (0.942) of the four classifiers, and the highest value (0.934) in the GRU RNNs time series was attained earlier than with other classifiers; (ii) all three deep learning methods and the RF achieved F measures above 0.900 before the end of growth seasons of banana, eucalyptus, second-season paddy rice, and sugarcane; while, the 1D CNN classifier was the only one that could obtain an F-measure above 0.900 for pineapple before harvest. All results indicated the effectiveness of the solution combining the deep learning models with the incremental classification approach for early crop classification. This method is expected to provide new perspectives for early mapping of croplands in cloudy areas.

TI  - Integrating the Continuous Wavelet Transform and a Convolutional Neural Network to Identify Vineyard Using Time Series Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grape is an economic crop of great importance and is widely cultivated in China. With the development of remote sensing, abundant data sources strongly guarantee that researchers can identify crop types and map their spatial distributions. However, to date, only a few studies have been conducted to identify vineyards using satellite image data. In this study, a vineyard is identified using satellite images, and a new approach is proposed that integrates the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the original time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) are reconstructed by applying an iterated Savitzky-Golay (S-G) method to form a daily time series for a full year; then, the CWT is applied to three reconstructed time series to generate corresponding scalograms; and finally, CNN technology is used to identify vineyards based on the stacked scalograms. In addition to our approach, a traditional and common approach that uses a random forest (RF) to identify crop types based on multi-temporal images is selected as the control group. The experimental results demonstrated the following: (i) the proposed approach was comprehensively superior to the RF approach; it improved the overall accuracy by 9.87% (up to 89.66%); (ii) the CWT had a stable and effective influence on the reconstructed time series, and the scalograms fully represented the unique time-related frequency pattern of each of the planting conditions; and (iii) the convolution and max pooling processing of the CNN captured the unique and subtle distribution patterns of the scalograms to distinguish vineyards from other crops. Additionally, the proposed approach is considered as able to be applied to other practical scenarios, such as using time series data to identify crop types, map landcover/land use, and is recommended to be tested in future practical applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images via Very Deep Convolutional Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion provides an effective way to fuse two types of remote sensing data featured by complementary spatial and temporal properties (typical representatives are Landsat and MODIS images) to generate fused data with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper presents a very deep convolutional neural network (VDCN) based spatiotemporal fusion approach to effectively handle massive remote sensing data in practical applications. Compared with existing shallow learning methods, especially for the sparse representation based ones, the proposed VDCN-based model has the following merits: (1) explicitly correlating the MODIS and Landsat images by learning a non-linear mapping relationship; (2) automatically extracting effective image features; and (3) unifying the feature extraction, non-linear mapping, and image reconstruction into one optimization framework. In the training stage, we train a non-linear mapping between downsampled Landsat and MODIS data using VDCN, and then we train a multi-scale super-resolution (MSSR) VDCN between the original Landsat and downsampled Landsat data. The prediction procedure contains three layers, where each layer consists of a VDCN-based prediction and a fusion model. These layers achieve non-linear mapping from MODIS to downsampled Landsat data, the two-times SR of downsampled Landsat data, and the five-times SR of downsampled Landsat data, successively. Extensive evaluations are executed on two groups of commonly used Landsat-MODIS benchmark datasets. For the fusion results, the quantitative evaluations on all prediction dates and the visual effect on one key date demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves more accurate fusion results than sparse representation based methods.

TI  - Tracking Reforestation in the Loess Plateau, China after the "Grain for Green" Project through Integrating PALSAR and Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An unprecedented reforestation process happened in the Loess Plateau, China due to the ecological restoration project 'Grain for Green Project', which has affected regional carbon and water cycles as well as brought climate feedbacks. Accurately mapping the area and spatial distribution of emerged forests in the Loess Plateau over time is essential for forest management but a very challenging task. Here we investigated the changes of forests in the Loess Plateau after the forest reconstruction project. First, we used a pixel and rule-based algorithm to identify and map the annual forests from 2007 to 2017 in the Loess Plateau by integrating 30 m Landsat data and 25 m resolution PALSAR data in this study. Then, we carried out the accuracy assessment and comparison with several existing forest products. The overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of the resultant map, were about 91% and 0.77 in 2010, higher than those of the other forest products (FROM-GLC, GlobeLand30, GLCF-VCF, JAXA, and OU-FDL) with OA ranging from 83.57% to 87.96% and Kappa coefficients from 0.52 to 0.68. Based on the annual forest maps, we found forest area in the Loess Plateau has increased by around 15,000 km(2) from 2007 to 2017. This study clearly demonstrates the advantages of data fusion between PALSAR and Landsat images for monitoring forest cover dynamics in the Loess Plateau, and the resultant forest maps with lower uncertainty would contribute to the regional forest management.

TI  - Assessment of sedimentation process in flood water spreading system using IRS (P5) and supervised classification algorithms (case study: Dahandar plain, Minab city, south of Iran)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many parts of Iran are dry plains that seem suitable places for building flood spreading systems and diverting flash floods to infiltration areas in order to recharge ground water resources. After passing a period of time, sediment deposition decreases the artificial recharge capacity of flood spreading system infiltration basins. Panchromatic images of IRS(P5) satellite are appropriate tools for studying sediment distribution, texture and thickness on the surface of these systems. For monitoring sediment distribution, the panchromatic images used that were taken in 2007,2010 and 2016. For evaluating sediment texture and thickness, 40 samples were collected from surface soil of different places all over Dahandar flood spreading system, in Minab city. By using Hydrometer method and soil texture triangle, different percentages of sand, silt, clay, soil texture types and sediment thickness were determined. Then by using simple linear regression the relationship between different percentages of sand, silt, clay and sediment thickness with the digital numbers of 2016 Panchromatic image were evaluated. The values of R-2 for sand, silt, clay and sediment thickness were 0.428, 0.343, 0.227 and 0.429 respectively. Different algorithms of supervised classification (maximum likelihood, minimum distance, parallelepiped) were used for creating maps with different classes of sand, silt, clay, soil texture types and sediment thickness. For sand particles, maximum likelihood algorithm with over all accuracy of 64%, for silt particles minimum distance-raw algorithm with over all accuracy of 51%, for clay particles minimum distance-normalized with over all accuracy of 46% showed the greatest values. For sediment thickness, different algorithms had the same function. The mentioned methods could reasonably explain the distribution of sand, silt and clay particles, soil texture and sediment thickness all over the flood spreading system.

TI  - Land Assessment for Agricultural Use in Jizan Basin, KSA, After 48 Years of Jizan Dam Construction
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land evaluation, using a scientific method, is crucial to distinguish the potential and limitations of a given land for specific use in terms of its suitability. The main objective of the study is to assess the land capability and suitability in Jizan Basin in front of Jizan Dam, KSA, and its suitability for agricultural crops using multi-criteria evaluation technique. It covers an area of 460 km(2) and is bounded by the coordinate 42 degrees 57 ' 22 ''-42 degrees 33 ' 28 '' E and 16 degrees 53 ' 12 ''-17 degrees 02 ' 27 '' N. The data of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager were used to delineate the physiographic units to be a base for the soil taxonomic units. The physiographic units were precisely distinguished using a digital elevation model such as alluvial stands, alluvial fans, playa and valley. Seventy-four soil profiles were studied to represent the soil units. The thematic maps of the soil properties spatial variations were produced using ArcGIS software. The results indicate that most of soils in Jizan Basin are sandy Loam, which had a very noteworthy influence on their physical and chemical characteristics. The values of organic matter, CaCO3, EC and soil pH were low in most of the study area. Soil taxa were classified into aquisalids and calcigypsids. These taxonomic units were potentially evaluated for soil capability classification. The study area classification showed that 32.3% of the total area belonged to C2 class, 40.7% fit in C3 class, while C4, C5 and C6 classes occupied 27%. Soil suitability analysis showed that the olive, barley and alfalfa were highly suitable (S1) with area percentages of 83.3% 63.2% and 60.3%, respectively. From agriculture point of view, the soils near the red sea, west of Jizan Dam, showed the worst soil properties and lowest agricultural land capability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial Gamma-Ray Surveys (GRS) are ideal for tracking anthropogenic gamma radiation releases and transport. The interpretation of a GRS can be complicated by natural gamma-ray sources such as atmospheric radon, cosmic rays, geologic materials, and even the survey equipment itself. Some of these complicating factors can be accounted for or corrected by calibration or mathematic techniques. Real-time algorithms that attempt to enhance potential radiogenic anomalies over background are also in use. However, natural geology is a source of significant background gamma-ray production and neither mathematical corrections nor real-time algorithmic approaches directly account for geology and geochemistry. In this study, we advance techniques to predict geologic background exposure rates using rapid and practical methods which can be achieved in the field. In addition we generate models that focus specifically on highlighting radiogenic anomalies for emergency response or further investigation. Predictive models developed in this study were generally able to predict background with medians of +/- 1.0 mu R/h compared to measured data, and were also able to highlight anomalous areas even where radiation exposure rates were within the range of natural background.

TI  - Development of Land-Use/Land-Cover Maps Using Landsat-8 and MODIS Data, and Their Integration for Hydro-Ecological Applications
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Athabasca River watershed plays a dominant role in both the economy and the environment in Alberta, Canada. Natural and anthropogenic factors rapidly changed the landscape of the watershed in recent decades. The dynamic of such changes in the landscape characteristics of the watershed calls for a comprehensive and up-to-date land-use and land-cover (LULC) map, which could serve different user-groups and purposes. The aim of the study herein was to delineate a 2016 LULC map of the Athabasca River watershed using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images, and other ancillary data. In order to achieve this, firstly, a preliminary LULC map was developed through applying the iterative self-organizing data analysis (ISODATA) clustering technique on 24 scenes of Landsat-8 OLI. Secondly, a Terra MODIS-derived 250-m 16-day composite of 30 EVI images over the growing season was employed to enhance the vegetation classes. Thirdly, several geospatial ancillary datasets were used in the post-classification improvement processes to generate a final 2016 LULC map of the study area, exhibiting 14 LULC classes. Fourthly, an accuracy assessment was carried out to ensure the reliability of the generated final LULC classes. The results, with an overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa of 74.95% and 68.34%, respectively, showed that coniferous forest (47.30%), deciduous forest (16.76%), mixed forest (6.65%), agriculture (6.37%), water (6.10%), and developed land (3.78%) were the major LULC classes of the watershed. Fifthly, to support the data needs of scientists across various disciplines, data fusion techniques into the LULC map were performed using the Alberta merged wetland inventory 2017 data. The results generated two useful maps applicable for hydro-ecological applications. Such maps depicted two specific categories including different types of burned (approximately 6%) and wetland (approximately 30%) classes. In fact, these maps could serve as important decision support tools for policy-makers and local regulatory authorities in the sustainable management of the Athabasca River watershed.

TI  - Prioritization of Sub-Watersheds for Soil and Water Conservation in Parts of Narmada River through Morphometric Analysis Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - GIS-based prioritization of sub-watersheds of Hoshangabad and Budhni industrial area, Madhya Pradesh, India were carried out to describe the importance of morphometric parameters in the field of water and soil conservation. In the study, four sub-watersheds were prioritized through geomorphologic analysis for soil and water conservation. Topographic maps 55 F/9, 55 F/10 and 55 F/13 on scale 1:50,000 were used to evaluate the drainage characteristics of watershed. SRTM DEM data has been processed for slope analysis and delineation of sub-watersheds. LISS-III, IRS data was processed for land use/land cover analysis. Soil map has been generated by processing of NBSS & LUP soil map. The various morphometric parameters evaluated in each sub-watershed includes drainage network, drainage geometry and texture analysis and relief parameters in ArcGIS. Each sub-watershed has been prioritized by assigning ranks using compound parameter. After prioritization, land use, soil type and slope classes of each sub-watershed were integrated to propose suitable soil and water conservation structures at appropriate places. It has been suggested that the proposed soil and water conservation structures must be executed on priority basis to reduce the adverse effect on the land and environment. The study shows that classification and prioritization of sub-watersheds are very relevant, supportive and useful in the watershed, where there is high diversity in agricultural practices, soil texture and land cover. Thus, priority wise execution of the proposed soil and water conservation structures will not only reduce the soil erosion but also increase the surface and groundwater availability in the area. Therefore, prioritization of these sub-watersheds is found very helpful for soil conservation and management of groundwater in the watershed.

TI  - Geo-Spatial Dynamics of Snow Cover and Hydro-Meteorological Parameters of Hunza Basin, HKH Region, Pakistan
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover dynamics play an important role in the hydrological characteristics of Upper Indus Basin (UIB) of Pakistan in terms of seasonal accumulation and depletions. The current study has been carried out to understand the snow cover dynamics, hydrological regime and their inter-relationships. Remote sensing satellite data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) for the period 2000-2016 along with hydro-meteorological parameters was used to study the spatio-temporal changes in snow cover of Hunza basin. Snow cover dynamics were analyzed through temporal analysis of snow cover and its association with hydro-meteorological parameters using Pearson correlation, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and elevation-based sub zones. The study concluded that 25-40% of the basin area is covered by glacier. Snow covered area may reach up to 90-95% of the basin area due to accumulation of seasonal snow. Hydro-meteorological correlation matrices showed highly significant correlation (R = 0.78) among maximum and minimum temperatures and river runoff while no correlation was observed between river runoff and rainfall (R = -0.03). A highly significant negative correlation was found for River runoff and Hunza mean Snow covered area (R = -0.87). The negative coefficient value shows that river runoff increases with snow cover melting when temperature increases. At sub-altitudinal zones level, river runoff has high negative correlation with snow cover at high altitude zones (Zone 2, 3) (R = -0.84, -0.86) while at lower altitude (Zone 1) there was a moderate correlation (R = -0.6) between snow cover and river runoff. This study reveals that river discharge in Hunza basin is closely associated with its snow cover dynamics. River runoff is associated with basin's snow melt phenomenon triggered by seasonally increasing temperatures. River discharge increases with active snow melting with start of summer during the months of April and May. Snow melt starts first at lower altitude zones followed by higher elevation zones with higher vertical glacial deposits.

TI  - Estimation of flow in various sizes of streams using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in Han River Basin, Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a novel approach of estimating stream discharge using the European Space Agency Sentinel. 1 satellite data. Fifteen hydrological stations with a mean discharge ranging between 2 m(3) s(-1) and 305 m(3) s(-1) in the Han River Basin in Korea were chosen as test sites. A series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and observed streamflow data were selected to develop and validate the methodology. The methodology relates the stream discharge to the water area that is extracted from the satellite image analysis. The satellite image analysis involved the following sequential steps: (1) A series of SAR images for a given test site is preprocessed for thermal noise, radiometric calibration, speckle filtering and terrain correction; (2) The histogram matching technique is applied to all images to unify the backscatter distribution; (3) The polygonal area including the stream is manually delineated along the reach and the image filter with the shape of the polygon is applied to all images so that only the water area of the stream is extracted; (4) A single backscatter threshold value is applied to all images to extract a series of water area; (5) the power-law relationship between the series of the water area and the corresponding stream discharge is established and the correlation coefficient of the relationship is calculated; (6) The process of (4) and (5) was repeated to identify the optimal backscatter threshold that maximizes the correlation coefficient of the relationship. A clear relationship was developed for the 13 stations except for the two at which flow is highly influenced by hydraulic structures such as dam. At the 13 stream locations, the R value of the power-law relationship varied between 0.68 and 0.98 with a mean value of 0.89. The relationship was influenced by the geometric properties of the stream such as the size and side slope.

TI  - Spatial assessment of termites interaction with groundwater potential conditioning parameters in Keffi, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Termite mounds are traditionally presumed to be good indicators of groundwater in places they inhabit but this hypothesis is yet to be scientifically substantiated. To confirm this assertion, it is expected that termite mounds would have strong correlations with groundwater conditioning parameters (GCPs). In this study, termite mounds distribution covering an area of about 156 km(2) were mapped and their structural characteristics documented with the aim of examining their relationships with twelve (12) chosen GCPs. Other specific objectives were to identify specific mound types with affinity to groundwater and to produce a groundwater potential map of the study area. To achieve this, 12 GCPs including geology, drainage density, lineament density, lineament inter-section density, land use/land cover, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, elevation, plan curvature, static water level and groundwater level fluctuation were extracted from relevant sources. Frequency ratio (FR) and Spearman's rank correlation were used to find relationships and direction of such relationships. The result revealed a consistent agreement between FR and Spearman's rank correlation that tall (>= 1.8 m) and Cathedral designed mounds are good indicators of groundwater. Further, the groundwater potential map produced from the Random Forest (RF) model via Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) using best-first algorithm depicted an erratic nature of groundwater distribution in the study area. This was then classified using natural break into very-high, high, moderate, low and very low potential classes and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed an 86.5% validity of the model. About 75% of mapped termite mounds fell within the very-high to moderate potential classes thereby suggesting that although tall and cathedral mounds in particular showed good correlations with a number of GCPs, high mound density in a locality is also an indication of good groundwater potential.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor with a higher mortality rate than melanoma. Approximately 40% of MCC patients have nodal or distant metastasis at initial presentation, and one-third of patients will develop distant metastatic disease over their clinical course. Although MCC is rare, its incidence has been steadily increasing. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of MCC and its diagnostic and therapeutic application have made MCC one of the most rapidly developing topics in dermatology and oncology. Owing to the aggressive and complex nature of MCC, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for management of this tumor, including dermatologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and nuclear medicine physicians. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, planning for surgery or radiation therapy, and assessment of treatment response and surveillance. However, MCC is still not well recognized among radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians, likely owing to its rarity. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness of MCC among imaging experts by describing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of MCC and current clinical management with a focus on the role of imaging. The authors highlight imaging findings characteristic of MCC, as well as the clinical significance of CT, MRI, sentinel lymph node mapping, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT, and other nuclear medicine studies such as bone scintigraphy and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.

T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the massive production of cow and poultry manures, farmers in Saudi Arabia are moving towards the application of organic fertilizers in their farms. Therefore, the present work was conducted to study the response of soil and selected vegetable crops to poultry and cow manures, using ground data and Landsat-8 and Hyperion images. The studied vegetable crops are cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and lettuce. A total of 100 t ha(-1) organic manures were applied as a pre-planting treatment. A 12.5 ha field in Tawdeehiya Farms, 200 km southeast of Riyadh, was earmarked for this study. The field was divided into sectors cultivated with the above-mentioned vegetable crops. Soil characteristics, including the soil pH, the electric conductivity (EC), the nitrogen (N), the phosphorus (P) and the potassium (K), were examined before the application of manures and 25 days after the transplanting process. Observations on crops chlorophyll content, number of leaves, the diameter of merchantable products and yield were also investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the crop performance and yield was investigated through the satellite images generated vegetation indices (VIs). This study revealed the better performance of poultry manure compared to cow manure in terms of development and production parameters of the experimental crops. Dynamics of the chlorophyll content across the crop growth period revealed that all the tested crops responded significantly (R-2 = 0.69; P = 0.001) to the poultry manure treatments. Among the tested crops, the chlorophyll content, curd or head sizes and crop yields were quite better in poultry manure applied plots. The investigation of crop yield was significant with poultry manure (R-2 = 0.64; P = 0.001) than cow manure (R-2 = 0.57; P = 0.001) using the OSAVI and mNDVI, respectively.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban and vegetation in Al-Balqa Governorate/Jordan. Landsat Thematic Mapper Landsat 5 (1996) and 8-OLI (2018) were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), covering a period of 22 years. Supervised classification methodology has been employed using the maximum likelihood technique in GIS.10.5.2. The images of the study area were categorized into four different classes: vegetation, built-up area, barren area, and bodies of water. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was applied at a threshold value >= 0.1 to distinguish between the vegetated area and non-vegetated areas. The results showed that the vegetated areas at NDVI value threshold >= 0.1 decreased by 12.18% during the period 1996-2018. The built-up area expanded from 4.53 to 9.29 km(2) during the study period. The result indicated that a large amount of the rainfed area was replaced by urban services and barren land. This shift took place, where the mountainous region and Mediterranean climate prevail, which represents the best environment for rainfed agriculture, especially olive trees. The study recommends that more attention should be paid to protecting the agricultural area and suggests the need for better planning and management to balance between vegetation and urban area expansion.

TI  - ATHEISM AND POLYGENESIS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY: CHARLES BRADLAUGH'S RACIAL ANTHROPOLOGY
T2  - MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines a previously unexplored chapter in the history of atheism: its close links with nineteenth-century racial anthropology. These links are apparent especially in many atheists' interest in polygenesis, the theory that human races had separate origins, in contrast to the orthodox Christian doctrine of monogenesis that said all races descended from Adam and Eve. The article's focus is Charles Bradlaugh (1833-91), arguably the most important British atheist of the era, representing the radical working-class, secularist movement that emerged in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. The article charts the ways Bradlaugh and other atheists used the research on polygenesis from leading scientific racists in both Britain and the United States to critique Christianity. It also explores some of the contradictions of this use, namely the ways polygenesis clashed with Darwinism and a longer chronology of the age of the Earth. Finally, the article explores how polygenist ideas informed Bradlaugh's imperial worldview and notes that, despite his acceptance of polygenesis, Bradlaugh was a supporter of the rights of nonwhites in the British Empire, particularly in India.

TI  - Breast Cancer during Pregnancy-Current Paradigms, Paths to Explore
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy in pregnant women. The prevalence of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is up to 0.04% of pregnancies and is expected to rise in developed countries. PABC represents a unique clinical scenario which requires a delicate balance of risks and benefits for both maternal and fetal well-being. Currently, there is paucity of data regarding the short- and long-term outcomes of in-utero exposure to anti-neoplastic agents. In general, when possible, treatment for PABC should follow the same guidelines as in non-pregnant patients. Surgery, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, is possible during all trimesters of pregnancy. Radiotherapy is contraindicated during pregnancy, although it might be considered in highly selected patients based on risk-benefit assessment. Evidence supports that administration of chemotherapy may be safe during the second and third trimesters, with cessation of treatment three weeks prior to expected delivery. Currently, hormonal therapy and anti-HER2 agents are contraindicated during pregnancy and should be postponed until after delivery. Prematurity is associated with worse neonatal and long-term outcomes, and thus should be avoided. While current data on the long-term effects of anti-neoplastic treatments are reassuring, grade of evidence is lacking, hence additional large prospective studies with long-term follow-up are essential to rule out any treatment-induced adverse effects.

TI  - Hemorrhagic Complications after Pancreatic Surgery: A Comprehensive Review of Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PANCREAS
M3  - Review
AB  - Hemorrhage after pancreatic surgery is a common occurrence, accounting for 5-12% of post-pancreatectomy complications. Major risk factors for hemorrhage can be classified temporally as pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative, and include perioperative coagulopathy, technical failure of hemostasis at suture line, post-operative pancreatic fistulas grades B and C, biliary leakage, localized or intra-abdominal sepsis, higher age and Body Mass Index, and intraoperative transfusions, among others. Post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage can be mild or severe, with grading from A to C, and timing from early (within 24 hours) to late (after 24 hours): diagnostic and therapeutic modalities vary widely based on the grading and location of post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, while non-operative management is sufficient for mild grade. A post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, interventions such as angiography for extra-luminal and endoscopy for intraluminal hemorrhage are required for late grade B or C hemorrhage. Re-exploration to secure hemostasis is preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients, and is only used for late post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage after failure of less invasive modalities. Late post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage is associated with a poor prognosis, especially in low-flow centers. Careful monitoring for sentinel bleeding, as well as control over modifiable risk factors can help decrease the incident burden of post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, thereby reducing long-term morbidity and mortality after pancreatic surgery.

AB  - South Asia is susceptible to drought due to high variation in monthly precipitation. The drought indices deriving from remote sensing data have been used to monitor drought events. To secure agricultural land in South Asia, timely and effective drought monitoring is very important. In this study, TRMM data was utilized along with remote sensing techniques for reliable drought monitoring. The Drought Severity Index (DSI), Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), NDVI, and Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) are more helpful in describing the drought events in South Asia due to the dryness and low vegetation. To categorize drought-affected areas, the spatial maps of TRMM were used to confirm MODIS-derived TVDI, DSI, and NVSWI. The DSI, TVDI, NVSWI, and Normalized Monthly Precipitation Anomaly Percentage (NAP) indices with an integrated use of MODIS-derived ET/PET and NDVI were selected as a tool for monitoring drought in South Asia. The seasonal DSI, TVDI, NVSWI, NAP, and NDVI values confirmed that South Asia suffered an extreme drought in 2001, which continued up to 2003. The correlation was generated among DSI, NAP, NVWSI, NDVI, TVDI, and TCI on a seasonal basis. The significantly positive correlation values of DSI, TVDI, and NVSWI were in DJF, MAM, and SON seasons, which were described as good drought monitoring indices during these seasons. During summer, the distribution values of drought indicated that more droughts occurred in the southwest regions as compared to the northeast region of South Asia. From 2001 to 2017, the change trend of drought was characterized; the difference of drought trend was obviously indicated among different regions. In South Asia, generally, the frequency of drought showed declining trends from 2001 to 2017. It was verified that these drought indices are a comprehensive drought monitoring indicator and would reduce drought risk in South Asia.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The promotion of the patient safety culture makes part of the strategies proposed in the National Patient Safety Program. Objective: This paper presented the experience of the Patient Safety Nucleus during 2018 in promoting the patient safety culture. Method: The use of active learning methodologies in a medium-sized public hospital in Minas Gerais, that belongs to the Sentinel Network of Anvisa. Results: The "10 Goals - Patient Safety" campaign originated after the identification and prioritization of the macroproblems related to patient safety in the institution. The 10 goals defined were: 1) Effective communication; 2) Fall prevention; 3) Safe surgery; 4) Prevention of pressure injury; 5) Safe use of probes and catheters; 6) Safe identification; 7) Drug safety; 8) Clean and safe care; 9) Patient involved; and 10) Safe and rational use of blood. The structuring of educational strategies was based on active learning and problematization methodologies. Conclusions: It was observed that the use of active methodologies can stimulate and induce employees and users to discuss and know the meaning of the hospital safety culture.

TI  - Inductive Approach To Build State-and-Transition Models for Uruguayan Grasslands
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We report state-and-transition models for Uruguayan grasslands built on a methodological approach that objectively defined states/phases associated, a priori, with rangeland management. Such approach was based on randomly sampled areas corresponding to mapped grassland communities. Each sampled area matched a MODIS pixel. Vegetation structural indicators were recorded in every pixel. After a multivariate analysis, field observations were grouped according to similarities in terms of structure, and different "states" and "phases" were identified. Ecosystem functioning and the supply of regulating ecosystem services were estimated for each grassland state/phase using the normalized difference vegetation index derived from the MODIS sensor. Finally, workshops were held in order to detect local stakeholders' perceptions and discuss the management practices to promote the desired transitions among phases. Results were presented for two vegetation units of the Basaltic "Cuesta" region. The "inductive approach" applied led to not only the description of "states" but also the identification of more subtle changes in vegetation ("phases"). Our approach minimized biases due to personal experience, as well as differences derived from using different observation protocols. The two vegetation units presented an internal heterogeneity associated with changes in basal stratum height, total cover, stratification, frequency of decreasing species due to grazing, and proportion of plant life forms. The ecosystem functioning descriptors of each phase responded to extreme climatic events differently. On the basis of stakeholder's opinions and experiences, stocking rate, sheep/cattle ratio, and grazing method were the main management practices promoting the transition among phases.

TI  - Assessment of land use and climate change effects on land subsidence using a hydrological model and radar technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of land use and climate change (LUCC) on the pattern of groundwater and land subsidence at the Marand Plain was investigated in this study. Earth deformation was derived from ENVISAT ASAR (2003.12.17-2006.03.01) and Sentinel-1 (2015.05.03-2015.10.18) satellite data via the Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) small baseline subset (SBAS) time series analysis method. Time series analysis results showed the maximum deformation rate of 24 and 39 cm/yr extracted from ENVISAT ASAR and Sentinel-1, respectively. About 3141 ha of the plain area have been affected by the subsidence phenomenon, which has caused severe damage to constructions. Observed groundwater level (GWL) observed data, indicate a reduction of five meters on average for the period of 1997-2015. Linear regression was derived between GWL abatement and subsidence with average correlation coefficient of 0.73 and the rate of subsidence was about 2.6-8 cm for a one meter drop in the GWL. Owing to the obtained relations between GWL reduction and subsidence, the effects of LUCC on groundwater storage (GWS) variability, and consequently the plain subsidence was studied using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Climate change scenarios were represented by the delta change approach based on the trend for the past three (1985-2014) and last decade (2005-2014), respectively by low delta change (LDC) and high delta change (HDC), where the trend of the most recent decade yield a higher delta change when extrapolating into 2030. After calibration and validation of the SWAT model using the monthly flow data, baseline (Sb) and five different LUCC scenarios (S1-S5) were simulated and their effects on the GWS variability were compared with together. The simulated results of Sb vs. S4 and S5, which represent plausible scenarios show that LUCC may decrease GWS about 52-99% and 85-100% under LDC and HDC, respectively. The results of the scenarios show the significant value of climate change (CC), under HDC, compared to land use change (LUC) in the diminishing of the GWS and as a result, the severe occurrence of the subsidence in the region.

TI  - Effect of rapid urbanization on Mediterranean karstic mountainous drainage basins
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformation of permeable natural areas into impervious surfaces (e.g. roads, parking lots, and buildings) is altering the watershed response to precipitation, generating bigger runoff volumes with increased peak discharges. The runoff travels faster to the watershed outlet, accumulates, and might cause flooding. Urban areas are affected by flooding, with consequences that might result in severe economic damage and even hazard to life. The paper will estimate the effect of rapid urbanization on runoff and on groundwater recharge. The model includes the Shiloh catchment basin located in a karstic mountainous terrain in Israel for a time period of rapid development from 1978 to 2018. Evaluation of surface permeability was based on land-use classifications from Landsat datasets using the Q-GIS 3.4 platform. Multiyear runoff coefficient estimation was calculated based on annual runoff and rainfall series. The evaluation suggests natural permeable areas were constantly declining from about 400 km(2) (nearby 100% of the Shiloh basin) in 1978 to about 100 km(2) in 2018 and that nonpermeable areas increased to 95 km(2) and semi-permeable areas to 250 km(2). Despite annual precipitation decrease during the last two decades, the annual runoff coefficient has a pronounced tendency to increase. This research suggests that the anthropogenic impact on the Shiloh basin and, hence, similar watersheds encourages runoff accumulation, resulting in extreme flood events recurrence while significantly reducing the groundwater recharge.

TI  - Axillary Dissection <i>vs</i>. no Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer Patients With Positive Sentinel Lymph Node: A Single Institution Experience
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Axillary surgery of breast cancer patients is undergoing a paradigm shift, as axillary lymph node dissection's (ALND) usefulness is being questioned in the treatment of patients with tumor-positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The aim of this study was to investigate the overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with positive SLNB treated with ALND or not. Patients and Methods: We investigated 617 consecutive patients with cN0 operable breast cancer with positive SLNB undergoing mastectomy or conservative surgery. A total of 406 patients underwent ALND and 211 were managed expectantly. Results: No significant difference in OS and RFS was found between the two groups. The incidence of loco-regional recurrence in the SLNB-only group and the ALND group was low and not significant. Conclusion: The type of breast cancer surgery and the omission of ALND does not improve OS or RSF rate in cases with metastatic SLN.

TI  - The Indigenization Controversy For Whom and By Whom?
T2  - CRITICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to decolonize and Indigenize education are occurring throughout Canada, and to a lesser degree in the United States. Although initially about addressing the historical and continuing oppression of Indigenous peoples, I expand the goals to include the survival of all humans and our non-human relatives. In light of our global crises, we must move more forcefully toward truth, reconciliation and Indigenous sovereignty, while at the same time decolonizing and bringing Indigenous worldview and local Indigenous knowledge into and across the curriculum for the benefit of all students. Unfortunately, resistance from both Indigenous and non-Indigenous critics of this mandate continue. A main concern relates to who should be allowed to implement such education and who should have access to it. I offer a rationale for engaging all people in this enterprise in spite of the complexity and risks that our outweighed by the profound potential for bringing our world back into balance. Pointing out the important difference between pan-Indigenousism and local place-based knowledge and why both are needed, conclude with specific suggestions for how all educators can help with decolonizing and Indigenizing schooling immediately.

TI  - Application of Long Short-Term Memory neural network model for the reconstruction of MODIS Land Surface Temperature images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that supplies information about the skin temperature of the Earth surface. Remote sensing satellite systems with thermal bands can be used to obtain LST information. One of these satellite systems, namely, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is mostly utilized in LST studies. One of the problems of obtaining LST from the MODIS data is missing pixels because of the effects such as cloud coverage. This drawback can be encountered by applying Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with one-step-ahead prediction of MODIS data to reconstruct daily LST through the previous data. In this study, LSTM network was applied to the daytime and nighttime MODIS time-series, separately. MODIS LST data (MYD11A1) have the spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km with 1-day temporal resolution. The selected data range from Day of Year (DOY) 1 in 2017 (01 January 2017) to DOY 59 in 2019 (28 February 2019). MODIS images were processed for the reconstruction of daily LST images concerning an agricultural region in Ceyhan, Adana, Turkey. 82% of data were chosen as the training data while the remaining data were used for testing purposes. The data were reconstructed by feeding the network adding the new data in a moving window in each prediction step. The produced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) map regarding all reconstruction errors from daytime and nighttime images varied between 2 K to 9 K and 1 K-5 K, respectively. Besides, the coefficients of determination (R-2) at a selected pixel of time-series analysis were obtained as 0.894 and 0.905 for daytime and nighttime LST image, respectively. The results revealed that the LSTM network could be used to fix the missing pixels in LST images.

TI  - TerraBrasilis: A Spatial Data Analytics Infrastructure for Large-Scale Thematic Mapping
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical phenomena derived from an analysis of remotely sensed imagery provide a clearer understanding of the spectral variations of a large number of land use and cover (LUC) classes. The creation of LUC maps have corroborated this view by enabling the scientific community to estimate the parameter heterogeneity of the Earth's surface. Along with descriptions of features and statistics for aggregating spatio-temporal information, the government programs have disseminated thematic maps to further the implementation of effective public policies and foster sustainable development. In Brazil, PRODES and DETER have shown that they are committed to monitoring the mapping areas of large-scale deforestation systematically and by means of data quality assurance. However, these programs are so complex that they require the designing, implementation and deployment of a spatial data infrastructure based on extensive data analytics features so that users who lack a necessary understanding of standard spatial interfaces can still carry out research on them. With this in mind, the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has designed TerraBrasilis, a spatial data analytics infrastructure that provides interfaces that are not only found within traditional geographic information systems but also in data analytics environments with complex algorithms. To ensure it achieved its best performance, we leveraged a micro-service architecture with virtualized computer resources to enable high availability, lower size, simplicity to produce an increment, reliable to change and fault tolerance in unstable computer network scenarios. In addition, we tuned and optimized our databases both to adjust to the input format of complex algorithms and speed up the loading of the web application so that it was faster than other systems.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> isolated from dairy calves and bedding material
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction E. coif is a ubiquitous bacterium commonly used as a sentinel in antimicrobial resistance studies. Here, E. coif was isolated from three groups (sick calves, healthy calves and bedding material), to assess the presence of antimicrobial resistance, describe resistance profiles, and compare these resistances among groups.Material and methods: Samples were collected from calves and calving pens from 20 dairy farms. Using the disc diffusion method, E. coif isolates were screened for antimicrobial resistance against seven antimicrobials: Amoxicillin, Ceftiofur, Gentamicin, Enrofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, Florfenicol and Oxytetracycline. Isolates resistant to all these seven antimicrobials were tested again against an extended 19 antimicrobial drug panel and for the presence of the most common E. coif pathogenicity genes through PCR.Results & discussion: Three hundred forty-nine E. coif isolates were obtained; most isolates were resistant to a single antimicrobial, but 2.3% (8) were resistant to 16 to 19 of the antimicrobials tested. The group with the highest percentage of multiresistant isolates was the calves with diarrhea group. Younger calves provided samples with higher antimicrobial resistance levels.Conclusions: There is a high rate of antimicrobial resistance in dairy farms calving pens. These bacteria could not only be a resistance gene reservoir, but also could have the potential to spread these determinants through horizontal gene transfer to other susceptible bacteria. Measures should be taken to protect colonization of younger calves, based on hygienic measures and proper management.

TI  - Public Health Research Priorities to Address Female Genital Mutilation or Cutting in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C), an age-old tradition that is stillwidely practiced around the world, is gaining recognition as an important publichealth issue in the United States. Increasingly, because ofmigration, women and girls affected by FGM/C have become members of host communities where the practice is not culturally acceptable.According to recent conservative estimates, more than 513 000 immigrant women and girls living in the United States have undergone or are at risk for FGM/C, a significant increase from the 1990 estimate of 168 000. The arrests of physicians in Michigan in 2017 for performing FGM/C on minors underscores the fact that cutting is happening in the United States.We have identified numerous gaps in our understanding of the magnitude of the problem in the United States and in the availability of scientific data informing a variety of interventions (preventive, clinical, educational, legal). We catalog thesemajor gaps and propose a research agenda that can help public health experts, researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders to establish priorities as we confront FGM/C as an important health issue affecting hundreds of thousands of women and girls in the United States.

TI  - SAR Pancake Ice Thickness Retrieval in the Terra Nova Bay (Antarctica) during the PIPERS Expedition in Winter 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pancake and frazil ice represent an important component of the Arctic and Antarctic cryosphere, especially in marginal ice zones. The retrieval of their thickness by remote sensing is, in general, a difficult task. A processing system was developed and refined by the present authors in the framework of the EU SPICES project; it is meant for routinely deriving ice thickness in frazil-pancake regions using the spectral changes in wave spectra from imagery provided by space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems. This methodology was successfully tested in the Beaufort Sea through comparison with ground truth collected during the cruise of the "Sikuliaq" in the fall of 2015. In the present study, this technique has been adapted and applied to Antarctic frazil/pancake icefields using COSMO-SkyMed satellite images. Our retrievals were analyzed and validated through a comparison with co-located in situ observations collected during the 2017 PIPERS cruise in Terra Nova Bay polynya. A broad agreement was found between measured thicknesses and those retrieved from the SAR analysis. Results and statistics presented and discussed in detail in this study represent a step towards the autonomous measurement of pancake icefields in remote areas such as Antarctic coastal polynyas and marginal ice zones.

TI  - Factors Affecting the Health Condition of Spruce Forests in Central European Mountains-Study Based on Multitemporal RapidEye Satellite Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce stands in the mountains of Central Europe are particularly valuable, not only because of their natural and scenic values but also because of their role in the protection of watersheds and soil. Over the past decades, these stands were frequently exposed to massive deforestation caused by various biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors. The current health condition of spruce stands in the Eastern Sudetes shows that the next phase of deterioration of these stands has begun. Bearing in mind past experiences and the current situation in these mountain areas, it is particularly important to understand the processes and factors that may short-term (2012-2016) spruce health analyses based on the normalized difference red-edge index and RapidEye satellite imagery, which is being delivered annually. Aided by remote sensing data and Boosted Regression Trees, it was possible to determine the topographic and tree stand features having the greatest impact on the vitality of spruce in all analyzed areas during 2012-2016. As the results show, the highest impact on the value of the normalized difference red-edge index indicator comes from a height above sea level, age of stands, terrain slopes, and exposure. In various areas, these factors may affect the vitality of spruce to varying degrees but not always in the same way. Our models accurately explained 74-81% of the randomly selected input data (predicted 72-80% of the excluded data) for site A, 50-58% for site B (48-57% for tested data) and 54-70% for site C (52-69% for excluded data).

TI  - Deforestation Processes in the Polish Mountains in the Context of Terrain Topography
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - y In the 1980s, the Western Sudety Mountains were affected by a forest dieback process, resulting in large-scale deforestation covering an area of about 15,000 ha. A similar phenomenon is presently being observed in the Western Beskidy and Eastern Sudety Mountains, where the course of the process and the final effects are similar. The presented study analyzed the relationships between forest dieback processes today and in the past. Among others, the impact of the following factors was examined: exposure, slope, altitude, and topographic index, which was generated based on the airborne LIDAR (also airborne laser scanning abbreviated as ALS) data. The identification of forest dieback areas in the past was carried out based on the archived Landsat satellite imagery, as well as data obtained from the Polish State Forests. The identification of forest dieback areas at present was carried out based on the ALS data (single-tree detection approach) and color infrared aerial images. In the study, inter-dependencies between forest dieback today and in the past were compared. The performed analyses show significant differences between forests' dieback specifics in all three areas. The process first occurred at 800-900 m a.s.l., and afterwards at over 900 m. Mortality was especially intensive on the western and southwestern slopes. Below 700 m a.s.l., forests survived quite well. In the 1980s, significantly higher concentrations of hazardous chemical compounds were noted, which resulted in respectively greater deforestations on aspects open to the operation of prevailing winds (mainly west). Nowadays, a proportionately higher number of trees die on the southern aspects, which is particularly visible in the Western Sudety Mountains.

TI  - How Accurate Are Modern Atmospheric Reanalyses for the Data-Sparse Tibetan Plateau Region?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 6000 independent radiosonde observations from three major Tibetan Plateau experiments during the warm seasons (May-August) of 1998, 2008, and 2015-16 are used to assess the quality of four leading modern atmospheric reanalysis products (CFSR/CFSv2, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2), and the potential impact of satellite data changes on the quality of these reanalyses in the troposphere over this data-sparse region. Although these reanalyses can reproduce reasonably well the overall mean temperature, specific humidity, and horizontal wind profiles against the benchmark independent sounding observations, they have nonnegligible biases that can be potentially bigger than the analysis-simulated mean regional climate trends over this region. The mean biases and mean root-mean-square errors of winds, temperature, and specific humidity from almost all reanalyses are reduced from 1998 to the two later experiment periods. There are also considerable differences in almost all variables across different reanalysis products, though these differences also become smaller during the 2008 and 2015-16 experiments, in particular for the temperature fields. The enormous increase in the volume and quality of satellite observations assimilated into reanalysis systems is likely the primary reason for the improved quality of the reanalyses during the later field experiment periods. Besides differences in the forecast models and data assimilation methodology, the differences in performance between different reanalyses during different field experiment periods may also be contributed by differences in assimilated information (e.g., observation input sources, selected channels for a given satellite sensor, quality-control methods).

TI  - Pre-fire vegetation drives post-fire outcomes in sagebrush ecosystems: evidence from field and remote sensing data
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors that influence vegetation responses to disturbance is important because vegetation is the foundation of food resources, wildlife habitat, and ecosystem properties and processes. We integrated vegetation cover data derived from field plots and remotely sensed Landsat images in two focal areas over a 37-yr period (1979-2016) to investigate how historical changes to community composition influence contemporary responses of vegetation to fire in sagebrush ecosystems in the Great Basin. Our objectives were (1) to quantify the magnitude and direction of change in the cover of native and exotic plant functional groups in relation to their exposure to fire; (2) to relate plant community changes to their historical composition, exposure to fire, and environmental conditions; and (3) to test for consistency of trends revealed by vegetation cover data derived from field plots and Landsat images. Historical (1979-1981) field data originated from 298 locations, Landsat-derived data and contemporary (2011-2016) field data originated from 448 locations, and an expanded set of locations were included in some analyses of Landsat-derived data. We found that areas burned by fire since the 1980s had higher annual herbaceous cover than unburned areas both historically and contemporarily. Models revealed a significant interaction between historical community composition and exposure to fire, which suggests that plots with historically high herbaceous cover were more susceptible to burning. Trends revealed by field and Landsat-derived cover data were only partially consistent, potentially due in part to methods used to predict cover values from Landsat images, and the time period over which each data set was collected. Our results suggest that burned areas historically occupied by sagebrush-dominated plant communities may have been invaded by exotic annuals prior to burning, possibly because of prior land uses, and after burning, have now transitioned to a persistent herbaceous-dominated state. This type of state transition has important consequences for forage quality, wildlife habitat, soil nutrients, and future disturbances, such as drought and wildfire.

TI  - Mapping woody vegetation cover across Australia's arid rangelands: Utilising a machine-learning classification and low-cost Remotely Piloted Aircraft System
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the extent and degree of wooded vegetation cover in the arid parts of Australia is essential for land-holders and management agencies. The balance between wooded and ground-cover vegetation is important to livestock production and landscape health. Adequate mapping of changes in wooded vegetation cover allows the assessment of its expansion and contraction as input for improved management of production and conservation. The aim of this study was to develop a method to accurately map the extent and degree of wooded tree and shrub cover across an area of arid rangeland in central Australia. Its open and sparse distribution throughout the landscape and its adaptation to an arid environment present challenges to obtaining both representative field measurements and scale appropriate remotely sensed imagery. Recent advancements and access to high spatial resolution satellite imagery provide opportunities for improved mapping. The rapid development of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or drones also provides further opportunities to improve the accuracy of field measurements used in the classification of wooded vegetation. An optimised machine-learning classification was developed using high resolution Planet Dove cube-sat and Sentinel2 imagery and compared to medium resolution Landsat8 imagery. An efficient method of collecting plot scale (ha) wooded vegetation cover estimates for the training and assessment of the satellite image classification was also developed using the RPAS. It was comparable to other field based measurements. The results of the classifications showed a moderate degree of accuracy in distinguishing wooded cover from non-wooded cover, highest with the Planet Dove imagery. An improved accuracy in distinguishing between wooded cover classes was also seen in the Sentinel2 classification. The mapping and subsequent monitoring of wooded vegetation in these landscapes has been shown to be improved with higher resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - A Proposal for Personalised and Relational Qualitative Religious Studies Methodology
T2  - CONSTRUCTIVIST FOUNDATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - > Context. For many people, religion and/or spiritual experiences are an important part of their daily lives-shaping their thinking and actions. Studying these experiences relies on qualitative religious studies (RS) research that engages respondents on a deeply personal level.> Problem center dot Researchers are unable to provide an a political, value-free approach to research.There lacks a rigorous methodological approach to qualitative RS research that addresses this epistemological obstacle. This is particularly relevant when studying a cohort with radically different beliefs from the researcher. >Method. Researcher coupling is presented as a topic that defines the researcher and her participants as a systemic entity. By demonstrating how the researcher's worldview is tied to her research, an argument for personalised and relational observer-dependent research is presented. Five reflexive questions are proposed as a starting point for personalised research to demonstrate the relational and intersubjective nature of this activity. > Results. By linking the researcher to her research and changing the goal of research from independent and objective research to one that is relational and contextual,the scholar can report on her research in an ethical and socially just manner by linking her worldview to her research. >Implications. The traditional research activity is redefined as one that should embrace the scholar's worldview instead of attempting to hide it. The scientific ideals of independence and objectivity are replaced by interdependence and hence a proposal is made for personalised research that embraces the intersubjective nature of this activity. This proposal is meant to alleviate some of the epistemological weaknesses in RS. This paradigm shift promotes rigour as a qualifier for methodology including changes to how research is categorised. >Constructivist content. Margaret Mead's ideas of observer dependence in anthropological research and how the observer constructs her research findings, are discussed. The circularity that exists in this relational context is analysed according to Bradford Keeney's ideas on recursion and resultant future behavioural correction. Ranulph Glanville's ideas of intersubjectivity and his concept of "in the between" are used as a foundation for the researcher-participant relationship. Ross Ashby's notion of experimenter coupling is used as a basis for researcher coupling.

CP  - 16th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Consensus Conference (SGIBCC) - Optimizing Early Breast Cancer Therapies
CL  - Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - Three recently published prospective trials on regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in early breast cancer showed a reduction on breast cancer mortality, any first breast recurrence and/or distant recurrence rate. The positive outcomes of the modern trials reflect the development in radiotherapy by being more precise nowadays in radiation dose delivery to the lymph nodes, while reducing the radiation dose to heart and lungs. The possibility of axillary radiotherapy (ART) to replace axillary node dissection (ALND) after positive sentinel node (SLNB) biopsy is explored in a few trials. In the AMAROS trial both ALND and ART provide excellent and comparable LRR in SN+ patients. While the lymphedema was 2 times higher after ALND compared to ART. The ACOSOG Z001110 years results did not show a significant difference in locoregional recurrence rate or survival. These equal results were seen despite that in 27.4% of the patients had additional positive nodes removed beyond SLN in the patients who received axillary dissection (ALND). The IBCSG 23-01 phase III trial showed that there is no need for extra treatment of the axilla after micro-metastases in SLNB, however in this trial nearly all patients received breast irradiation including part of the axilla, often combined with adjuvant therapy. The introduction of neo- adjuvant systemic treatment (NACT) may lead to less RNI in early breast cancer, especially as NACT leads to pCR in axillary lymph nodes in about one third of the patient.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns in green infrastructure as driver of land surface temperature variability: The case of Sydney
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The 'green infrastructure typology' (GIT) scheme is a standardised framework to map and classify urban landscapes into 34 standard classes, each defined by a specific land cover composition and spatial configuration of vegetation. Previous studies have confirmed that GIT classifications can be successfully derived from airborne remote sensing data; nonetheless, the promotion of the GIT scheme as a framework for the assessment of ecosystem services such as 'climate moderation' requires further validations using a range of study areas with different vegetation conditions, and datasets from different seasons and times of the day. This study expands on previous research and evaluates the quality of thermal delineations by examining the spatio-temporal patterns and intra-/inter-typology differences of land surface temperatures (LSTs) using Sydney as case study. Further, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the classification framework and methods for mapping and assessing the thermal conditions of green infrastructure (GI). Evidence indicates a strong spatial dependericy of LSTs that may have significant implications in the interpretation and precision of numerical or predictive models. Results for spatial clustering demonstrate that the GIT scheme can be implemented for a rapid identification of hotspots to prioritise urban areas for heat mitigation. Statistical results confirm that LST differences among GIT classes are statistically significant for different times of the day and seasons. Significant thermal contrasts were found for most GITs at daytime (86.9% in summer and 85.5% in winter) and night-time (80.9% in summer and 73.8% in winter). Temperature differences are more distinguishable in summer and daytime, due to longer solar exposure of surfaces. It was found that the cooling effects of pervious surfaces, water and trees are significantly disturbed by transmission of heat from surrounding impervious materials. Despite good thermal differentiations among GITs, a considerable intra-variability of LSTs was detected in classes with a large proportion of impervious materials with contrasting radiative properties. This causes numerous complexities and challenges that should be explored by future studies.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Antarctic Glacier and Ice Shelf Fronts from Sentinel-1 Imagery Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet is influenced by changes in glacier and ice shelf front position. Still, little is known about seasonal glacier and ice shelf front fluctuations as the manual delineation of calving fronts from remote sensing imagery is very time-consuming. The major challenge of automatic calving front extraction is the low contrast between floating glacier and ice shelf fronts and the surrounding sea ice. Additionally, in previous decades, remote sensing imagery over the often cloud-covered Antarctic coastline was limited. Nowadays, an abundance of Sentinel-1 imagery over the Antarctic coastline exists and could be used for tracking glacier and ice shelf front movement. To exploit the available Sentinel-1 data, we developed a processing chain allowing automatic extraction of the Antarctic coastline from Seninel-1 imagery and the creation of dense time series to assess calving front change. The core of the proposed workflow is a modified version of the deep learning architecture U-Net. This convolutional neural network (CNN) performs a semantic segmentation on dual-pol Sentinel-1 data and the Antarctic TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM). The proposed method is tested for four training and test areas along the Antarctic coastline. The automatically extracted fronts deviate on average 78 m in training and 108 m test areas. Spatial and temporal transferability is demonstrated on an automatically extracted 15-month time series along the Getz Ice Shelf. Between May 2017 and July 2018, the fronts along the Getz Ice Shelf show mostly an advancing tendency with the fastest moving front of DeVicq Glacier with 726 +/- 20 m/yr.

TI  - Burned area detection and mapping using Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient and thermal anomalies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a burned area mapping algorithm based on change detection of Sentinel-1 backscatter data guided by thermal anomalies. The algorithm self-adapts to the local scattering conditions and it is robust to variations of input data availability. The algorithm applies the Reed-Xiaoli detector (RXD) to distinguish anomalous changes of the backscatter coefficient. Such changes are linked to fire events, which are derived from thermal anomalies (hotspots) acquired during the detection period by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Land cover maps were used to account for changing backscatter behaviour as the RXD is class dependent. A machine learning classifier (random forests) was used to detect burned areas where hotspots were not available. Burned area perimeters derived from optical images (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) were used to validate the algorithm results. The validation dataset covers 21 million hectares in 18 locations that represent the main biomes affected by fires, from boreal forests to tropical and sub-tropical forests and savannas. A mean Dice coefficient (DC) over all studied locations of 0.59 +/- 0.06 (+/- confidence interval, 95%) was obtained. Mean omission (OE) and commission errors (CE) were 0.43 +/- 0.08 and 0.37 +/- 0.06, respectively. Comparing results with the MODIS based MCD64A1 Version 6, our detections are quite promising, improving on average DC by 0.13 and reducing OE and CE by 0.12 and 0.06, respectively.

TI  - Livestock Herbivory Shapes Fire Regimes and Vegetation Structure Across the Global Tropics
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock grazing is the most extensive human land use and one of the key drivers of the conversion of tropical forests into grasslands. Livestock effects on vegetation structure are complex, as they can prevent tree recruitment and growth through browsing and trampling, but they can also affect vegetation indirectly through fire interactions. However, a systematic analysis of the overall effects of livestock across the global tropics is lacking. We analyzed remote sensing data on vegetation height and cover, climate, and fire as well as ground data on livestock density. We used generalized linear models and structural equation models to analyze the effects of livestock on fire regimes and vegetation structure. Across the global tropics, higher livestock densities are associated to lower fire frequency and a higher cover of shrubs and dwarf trees. This pattern occurs across continents, and is particularly pronounced at intermediate precipitation levels (1000-1500 mm y(-1)) where fire frequency is highest. In those regions, fire frequency is on average 49% lower in areas with high versus low livestock densities. South America has much higher livestock density and lower fire frequency than Africa and Asia-Australia across the whole precipitation gradient. Our findings suggest that livestock grazing reduces fire incidence through grass consumption and favors shrubs and a sparse cover of trees in regions where forests could potentially exist. Livestock can thus be a strong modifier of the climatic effect on vegetation structure, and livestock management changes can impact the structure and functioning of savannas and grasslands throughout the global tropics.

TI  - Evaluation of Deep Learning CNN Model for Land Use Land Cover Classification and Crop Identification Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) is popular as being widely used for classification of unstructured data. Land use land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data can be used for crop identification also. Present study aims to examine the use of deep learning CNN for LULC classification on Indian Pines dataset and for crop identification on our study area dataset. In the present work, AVIRIS sensor's Indian Pines standard dataset has been used for LULC classification. Study area from Phulambri, Aurangabad, MH, India, has been used for crop classification. Data have been gathered from EO-1 Hyperion sensor. The accuracy of CNN model depends on optimizer, activation function, filter size, learning rate and batch size. Deep learning CNN is evaluated by changing these parameters. It has been observed that deep learning CNN using optimized combination of parameters has provided 97.58% accuracy for the Indian Pines dataset, while 79.43% accuracy for our study area dataset. The empirical results demonstrate that CNN works well in practice for unstructured data as well as for small size dataset.

TI  - Pixel Tracking to Estimate Rivers Water Flow Elevation Using Cosmo-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of availability of historical and reliable river water level information is an issue that can be overcome through the exploitation of modern satellite remote sensing systems. This research has the objective of contributing in solving the information-gap problem of river flow monitoring through a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal processing technique that has the capability to perform water flow elevation estimation. This paper proposes the application of a new method for the design of a robust procedure to track over the time double-bounce reflections from bridges crossing rivers to measure the gap space existing between the river surface and bridges. Specifically, the difference in position between the single and double bounce is suitably measured over the time. Simulated and satellite temporal series of SAR data from COSMO-SkyMed data are compared to the ground measurements recorded for three gauges sites over the Po and Tiber Rivers, Italy. The obtained performance indices confirm the effectiveness of the method in the estimation of water level also in narrow or ungauged rivers.

TI  - Land use/land cover change along elevation and slope gradient in highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used Landsat TM, Landsat ETM +, and OLI data from 1986, 2003, and 2017, and topographic attributes derived from ASTER digital elevation model respectively, to map land use/land cover (LU/LC) in a predominantly agricultural region of northwestern highlands Ethiopia. LU/LC maps were created using supervised classification, and LU/LC change the mapping for the 1986-2003 and the 2003-2017 period determined using post-classification comparisons. The study found the proportion of agricultural land increased from 85.4% of the total area in 1986 to 93.3% in 2017. This increase coincided with a 3.5% decrease in a forested area, a 1.9% decrease in grazing land, and a 1.8% decrease in shrubland. The LU/LC changes mostly occurred in areas having a slope between 0 and 30.. This study has the potential to provide new and practical information for managers and planners for an infrequently studied region and contribute to the growing literature on the topographic factors for LU/LC changes.

TI  - Beyond consensus: perceptions of risk from petroleum developments in Lofoten, Vesteralen, and Senja, Norway
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The proposed petroleum developments in the Lofoten, Vesteralen, and Senja are a controversial issue in Norway. We ask how insights into legitimacy and risk perception can help to illuminate the disputed policy process for petroleum developments in Lofoten, Vesteralen, and Senja. Our Q-methodology elicits three key narratives that steer the policy process: (i) best practice and knowledge does not permit coexistence, and fishing takes priority; (ii) coexistence is possible with good process where the nation-state manages risk; and (iii) the state and industry cannot facilitate coexistence, science and conservation come first. We argue these narratives reflect divergence in worldview in three key ways: (i) differential perspectives on the priority of local, national, and global scales; (ii) emphasis on the role of knowledge, skill, and rectitude in finding best policy; and (iii) differential concern for fish, the nation-state, and conservation. We argue for a more realistic approach to coexistence in deliberative democracy that does not aim for consensus and win-win outcomes, and assert that disagreement and partial victories and losses is a natural and healthy state of affairs in a democracy.

TI  - Prognosis and Management of Thick and Ultrathick Melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Thick melanomas, defined as >= 4 mm in thickness, represent similar to 5% of new melanoma diagnoses and have been associated with poor overall survival (OS). Ultrathick melanomas, those lesions >= 8 mm in thickness, have been associated with worse survival. We sought to compare prognostic factors for thick and ultrathick melanoma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of all patients receiving an operation for melanoma, June 2005 to December 2016 was performed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Results: Of 95 patients with thick melanoma, 37 (39%) had ultrathick tumors (>= 8 mm thick). Thick and ultrathick lesions were not significantly different on the basis of tumor location, ulceration, mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, or performance or positivity of sentinel node biopsy or therapeutic lymphadenectomy. Disease recurrence was identified in 38 patients overall (40%), more commonly in ultrathick disease (55% vs. 29%, P=0.008). Serum neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was available for 36 patients, of whom 23 (64%) had high NLR (>3.0). Decreased PFS was independently associated with ultrathick tumors (HR, 2.9; P=0.003), head/neck location (HR, 2.6; P=0.023), and positive lymph nodes (HR, 3.3; P=0.004). Decreased OS was independently associated with high NLR (HR, 5.0; P=0.042). Conclusions: Disease progression was higher in the ultrathick melanoma group. Thicker tumors, head/neck location, and positive lymph nodes were associated with decreased PFS. High NLR was associated with decreased OS. Ultrathick melanomas represent advanced malignancy; however, patients may derive benefit from surgical treatment to achieve locoregional control.

TI  - An Invitation to Suffer: Evangelicals and Sports Ministry in the US
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - When American evangelicals sought to use the tools of sport for religious outreach in the mid-twentieth century, they began to wonder if the essential features of sport-competition and hierarchy-conflicted with their approach to salvation. For most evangelical Christians, salvation is an option for every human and each person must make an individual decision to accept or reject the salvific power of Jesus Christ. This is a worldview that relies heavily on separating believers from non-believers, but, importantly, the means of distinction is individual choice. There is not a competitive aspect to this framework; salvation is theoretically available for all. This article traces sports ministry's struggle over time to unite the competitive world of sport with their vision of salvation. By illuminating different approaches to the ethical challenge of uniting evangelicalism and sport, we can see that sports ministry is a field of complexity that invites believers to grapple with intense theological dilemmas without offering easy solutions. I argue that the struggle to reconcile sport and evangelical theology can be meaningful religious work. I will show that the kinds of suffering that athletic competition entails can align with the evangelical theodicy that God uses suffering to communicate with humans. It may be this feature of sport, the opportunity to experience meaningful suffering, that continues to motivate evangelicals to attempt to unite their religion with sport.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, satellite data has been used to estimate precipitation with the aim of increasing the accuracy of rainfall spatial distribution especially at ungauged locations. In this research, the satellite data, including visible and infrared reflection data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and observation data, consists of rainfall records (10 years 2005-2015) from three synoptic stations in Semnan province, were used to simulate rainfall using an artificial neural network (ANN) method. The network performance is evaluated through three performance criteria, i.e., correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS). Findings show that using a combination of visible reflection data of band 3 and infrared reelection data of bands 5, 18, and 19 as input data results in better performance compared with other possible combinations. In this model, the values of R, NS, and RMSE for test period data were 0.93, 0.81, and 1.49, respectively.

AB  - The new Sentinel-2 satellites present a significant scientific opportunity for the study of water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of Sentinel-2 imagery for estimating and mapping Secchi disk transparency (SDT) in Rio Tercero reservoir (Cordoba-Argentina). Field observations and a dataset of atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 images were used to generate and validate an algorithm to estimate water clarity in the studied reservoir. As a real application of the used methodology, the validated algorithm was used to obtain a spatial representation of water clarity in the reservoir during sampling campaigns. Results demonstrate capabilities of Sentinel-2 mission to make a substantial contribution to the current assessment and understanding of aquatic systems by estimating and mapping a water quality characteristic.

TI  - Evidence map of ductal carcinoma in situ management options
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has the potential to progress to invasive carcinoma. The optimal management of DCIS and methods for individualizing treatment of DCIS are still being determined. This evidence map depicts the robustness and topical span of research on DCIS management choice on patient-centered and clinical outcomes.Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed Health, PROSPERO, and clinical practice guideline sites to identify systematic reviews of DCIS management options and consulted with topic experts. A bubble plot visualizes the literature volume and research content for patient-centered outcomes. An online decision tree facilitates discussions with patients and guides through the available evidence.Results: In total, 40 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. The research syntheses addressed DCIS management options, including the role of magnetic resonance imaging, axillary surgery/sentinel lymph node biopsy, and excisional biopsy. The map shows existing evidence for mutually exclusive treatment options including active surveillance, breast-conserving surgery, nipple sparing mastectomy, and simple mastectomy. Research findings for intraoperative radiation, adjuvant radiation therapy, adjuvant hormone therapy, hypofractionation radiotherapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, radiation therapy plus boost, and combined radiation and hormone therapy, as well as for breast reconstruction after mastectomy and surveillance mammography postsurgery are also displayed. The evidence map highlights a scarcity of robust evidence on patient-centered outcomes.Conclusions: The evidence map provides an overview of DCIS research showing the range of management options and remaining decisional dilemmas that follow a diagnosis of DCIS. It maps the evidence in accessible tools to guide practice and future research.

TI  - Mobile Technology in Allergic Rhinitis: Evolution in Management or Revolution in Health and Care?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY-IN PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Smart devices and Internet-based applications (apps) are largely used in allergic rhinitis and may help to address some unmet needs. However, these new tools need to first of all be tested for privacy rules, acceptability, usability, and cost-effectiveness. Second, they should be evaluated in the frame of the digital transformation of health, their impact on health care delivery, and health outcomes. This review (1) summarizes some existing mobile health apps for allergic rhinitis and reviews those in which testing has been published, (2) discusses apps that include risk factors of allergic rhinitis, (3) examines the impact of mobile health apps in phenotype discovery, (4) provides real-world evidence for care pathways, and finally (5) discusses mobile health tools enabling the digital transformation of health and care, empowering citizens, and building a healthier society.

TI  - Decision making factors of the management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast with microinvasion
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction > Microinvasive in situ ductal carcinomas of the breast are rare and of good prognosis. They are grouped with early stage invasive carcinomas in the TNM 2017 classification. This study assessed practitioners' treatment decisions and their justifications in comparison to the literature.Materials and methods > Three clinical cases were evaluated by anonymous forms regarding sentinel node decisions, tumour bed boost irradiation and hormone therapy.Results > Sentinel lymph node was performed by 93.1%, 100% and 44.4% of the practitioners respectively. Radiation boost was a treatment option chosen by 62.1% and 61.1% of practitioners in both clinical cases. Hormone therapy was advocated for 65.5%, 94.7% and 50.0% patients depending on the clinical case.Conclusion > The therapeutic attitude proposed in microinvasive breast carcinomas was heterogeneous in this study, reflecting the absence of specific recommendations. In view of the existing literature, it is not currently possible to propose recommendations for these three therapeutic options. Prospective cohorts and meta-analyses of the microinvasive subgroup could provide answers.

TI  - Multispectral Image-Based Estimation of Drought Patterns and Intensity around Lake Chad, Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world population keeps increasing and cultivating more land, the extraction of vegetation conditions using remote sensing is important for monitoring land changes in areas with limited ground observations. Water supply in wetlands directly affects plant growth and biodiversity, which makes monitoring drought an important aspect in such areas. Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) which depends on thermal stress and vegetation state, is widely used as an indicator for drought monitoring using satellite data. In this study, using clear-sky Landsat multispectral images, VTCI was derived from Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Derived VTCI was used to observe the drought patterns of the wetlands in Lake Chad between 1999 and 2018. The proportion of vegetation from WorldView-3 images was later introduced to evaluate the methods used. With an overall accuracy exceeding 90% and a kappa coefficient greater than 0.8, these methods accurately acquired vegetation training samples and adaptive thresholds, allowing for accurate estimations of the spatially distributed VTCI. The results obtained present a coherent spatial distribution of VTCI values estimated using LST and NDVI. Most areas during the study period experienced mild drought conditions, though severe cases were often seen around the northern part of the lake. With limited in-situ data in this area, this study presents how VTCI estimations can be developed for drought monitoring using satellite observations. This further shows the usefulness of remote sensing to improve the information about areas that are difficult to access or with poor availability of conventional meteorological data.

TI  - Assessing plant production responses to climate across water-limited regions using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and change acting at broad scales can lead to divergent changes in plant production at local scales. Quantifying how production responds to variation in climate at local scales is essential to understand underlying ecological processes and inform land management decision-making, but has historically been limited in spatiotemporal scale based on the use of discrete ground-based measurements or coarse resolution satellite observations. With the advent of cloud-based computing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), production responses to climate can be evaluated across broad landscapes though time at a resolution useful for ecological and land management applications. Here, GEE was employed to synthesize a multi-platform Landsat time series (1988-2014) and evaluate relationships between the soil-adjusted vegetation index (a proxy for plant production) and climate across deserts and plant communities of the southwestern U.S. A "climate pivot point" approach was adopted in GEE to assess the trade-off between production responses to increasing wetness and resistances to drought at 30-m resolution. Consistent with a long-term seasonal climate gradient, production was most related to climate variance during the cool-season in the western deserts, during the warm-season in the eastern deserts, and equally related to both seasons within several desert areas. Communities dominated by grasses and deciduous trees displayed large production responses to an increase in wetness and low resistances to water deficit, while shrublands and evergreen woodlands had variable responses and high drought resistances. Production in plant communities that spanned multiple deserts responded differently to seasonal climate variability in each desert. Defining these plant production sensitivities to climate at 30-m resolution in GEE advances forecasts of how long-term climate trajectories may affect carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and the vulnerability of water-limited ecosystems.

TI  - A comparison of Landsat 8, RapidEye and Pleiades products for improving empirical predictions of satellite-derived bathymetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) enables rapid mapping of large coastal areas through measurement of optical penetration of the water column. The resolution of bathymetric mapping and achievable horizontal and vertical accuracies vary but generally, all SDB outputs are constrained by sensor type, water quality and other environmental conditions. Efforts to improve accuracy include physics-based methods (similar to radiative transfer models e.g. for atmospheric/vegetation studies) or detailed in-situ sampling of the seabed and water column, but the spatial component of SDB measurements is often under-utilised in SDB workflows despite promising results suggesting potential to improve accuracy significantly. In this study, a selection of satellite datasets (Landsat 8, RapidEye and Pleiades) at different spatial and spectral resolutions were tested using a log ratio transform to derive bathymetry in an Atlantic coastal embayment. A series of non-spatial and spatial linear analyses were then conducted and their influence on SDB prediction accuracy was assessed in addition to the significance of each model's parameters. Landsat 8 (30 m pixel size) performed relatively weak with the non-spatial model, but showed the best results with the spatial model. However, the highest spatial resolution imagery used Pleiades (2 m pixel size) showed good results across both non-spatial and spatial models which suggests a suitability for SDB prediction at a higher spatial resolution than the others. In all cases, the spatial models were able to constrain the prediction differences at increased water depths.

TI  - Information about Predators Varies across an Amazonian Rain Forest as a Result of Sentinel Species Distribution
T2  - AMERICAN NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about predation risk is of fundamental value in biological communities. Because many prey species have shared predators, eavesdropping on other species' alarms is a widely recognized mechanism underlying the formation of mixed-species groups. However, information transfer may vary both across and within groups because some species provide higher-quality information about predators than others. We tested this phenomenon in Amazonian understory mixed-species flocks of birds in which two sentinel species-the bluish-slate antshrike (Thamnomanes schistogynus) and the dusky-throated antshrike (Thamnomanes ardesiacus)-occupy different habitats and provide alarm calls that are used by eavesdropping flock mates. In a playback experiment, two associate species responded significantly more strongly to alarm calls from the same sentinel species, reflecting the greater reliability of information about predator threats that could affect survival and habitat choice. Our work provides evidence of a repeated asymmetry across space in the available information about threats.

TI  - Assessment of Open-Source Software, QGIS, to Estimate Hurricane Matthew Flood Extent in Robeson County, North Carolina, Using Unsupervised Classification
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent of flooding caused by Hurricane Matthew in Robeson County, NC, in October 2016 was investigated by comparing two Landsat-8 images (one flood and one non-flood) following K-means unsupervised classification for each in both ENVI, a proprietary software, and QGIS with Orfeo Toolbox, a free and open-source software. In this study, unsupervised classification was capable of rapidly producing regional maps, but poor accuracy constrained practical application. Of particular note, the open-source setup performed on par with the proprietary option for each of the classifications. Overall, remote sensing techniques using opensource software show promise in helping aid workers to cost-effectively conduct post-event analyses and relief efforts.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Haemosurveillance is an element for the safety of blood transfusion processes. The information provided by the Sentinel Network integrated the Post-National System of Sanitary Surveillance in registration and Post-Commercialization, with the purpose of subsidizing Sanitary Surveillance in the actions of regulation of these products. Objective: Obtain transfusion reaction rate (RT) values that reflect the situation of the institutions that make up the Sentinel Network, based on network monitoring data, in 2017. Method: A retrospective cross-sectional, descriptive study with a quantitative approach was performed. The study sample consisted of 172 spreadsheets from reports sent by 191 Sentinel Network member services, with data referring to the monitoring of at least one of the semesters of 2017. Results: Of the 254 accredited services in the Sentinel Network in 2017, 191 institutions submitted a report with data from at least one of the semesters during the study period. Of these services, 183 (95.8%) reported having had blood transfusions and 120 (62.8%) institutions sent spreadsheets with RT rates from the health facility. The overall rate of RT identified among institutions that make up the Sentinel Network for 2017 was 5.29 RT per 1,000 transfusions performed. Conclusions: The rate of RT identified was 5.29 RT per 1,000 transfusions. Identifying the transfusion reaction rate is an important step in institution's risk management as it enables the development of quality improvement strategies in the transfusion process.

TI  - Oil spill segmentation in SAR images using convolutional neural networks. A comparative analysis with clustering and logistic regression algorithms
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are a valuable source of information for the detection of marine oil spills. For their effective analysis, it is important to have segmentation algorithms that can delimit possible oil spill areas. This article addresses the application of clustering, logistic regression and convolutional neural network algorithms for the detection of oil spills in Envisat and Sentinel-1 satellite images. Large oil spills do not occur frequently so that the identification of a pixel as oil is relatively uncommon. Metrics based on Precision-Recall curves have been employed because they are useful for problems with an imbalance in the number of samples from the classes. Although logistic regression and clustering algorithms can be considered useful for oil spill segmentation, the combination of convolutional techniques and neural networks achieves the best results with low computing time. A convolutional neural network has been integrated into a decision support system in order to facilitate decision-making and data analysis of possible oil spill events. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Changes in glacier mass in the Lenglongling Mountains from 1972 to 2016 based on remote sensing data and modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial meltwater-fed streamflow from the Qilian Mountains provides a much-needed source of water for the northeastern margins of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and surrounding regions. We analyzed changes in glaciers located in the Lenglongling Mountains (LLM) in the eastern Qilian Mountains in terms of glacier area and surface elevation. These analyses were accomplished using multi-temporal satellite images and studying digital elevation models (DEMs) based on topographic maps and ZY-3 data. The results showed that from 1972 to 2016, glacier coverage decreased by 41.1 km(2), leaving only 62.1 km(2) extant in 2016. The mean rate of change in glacier surface elevation asl was -18.7 +/- 1.2 m (- 0.43 +/- 0.03 m a(-1)) over the same period. In situ measured data from Ningchan No.1 Glacier (NC01), combined with meteorological records, were also employed to develop a spatially distributed degree-day model for the LLM glaciers. These two approaches yielded similar results, allowing the reconstruction of a consistent time series that detailed annual changes in glacier mass over the past 44 years. In addition, we calculated that the mean annual glacial meltwater-fed streamflow from 1972 to 2013 in the Jiutiaoling Basin (JTLB) northeast of the LLM was equivalent to 1.4 x 10(7 )m(3), or 4.6% of the area's total annual streamflow. It is remarkable that, in years when streamflow was relatively lower, such as 1972, 1991 and 2013, glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion (more than 8%) of the streamflow.

TI  - Setting the stage: Contemporary staging of non-melanomatous skin cancer and implementation of the new American Joint Committee on cancer eighth edition staging manual
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-melanomatous skin cancer (NMSC) generally refers to basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The majority of patients are curatively treated with simple excision. Only few present with locally advanced disease or have evidence of high-risk features, placing them at an elevated risk of relapse. In such cases, further investigations may guide the multidisciplinary management plan. There are no universally agreed on indications for recommending additional staging investigations, due to a lack of prospective data reporting their impact on patient outcomes. Some generally agreed upon indications are discussed in this review article. Most commonly, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) are used in cases of locally advanced NMSC for staging purposes and surgical planning. While Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy have shown utility, data is lacking to establish their roles in the staging algorithm. An updated NMSC system was included in The American Joint Committee for Cancer eighth edition staging manual (AJCC8). Under AJCC8 the majority of patients with regional disease are upstaged by the presence of extranodal extension, however, this updated system appears to provide limited prognostic discrimination between the nodal categories and the overall TNM stages. This review article will explore the contemporary role of staging investigations, including evolving technologies, and review the changes implemented in AJCC8. It will also discuss the implications of the AJCC8 decision to assign patients with p16-positive cervical nodal SCC with an unknown primary to the oropharyngeal staging system, with particular relevance to clinicians working in areas of high NMSC incidence.

TI  - Freshwater microbial community diversity in a rapidly changing High Arctic watershed
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current models predict increases in High Arctic temperatures and precipitation that will have profound impacts on the Arctic hydrological cycle, including enhanced glacial melt and thawing of active layer soils. However, it remains uncertain how these changes will impact the structure of downstream resident freshwater microbial communities and ensuing microbially driven freshwater ecosystem services. Using the Lake Hazen watershed (Nunavut, Canada; 82 degrees N, 71 degrees W) as a sentinel system, we related microbial community composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) to physicochemical parameters (e.g. dissolved oxygen and nutrients) over an annual hydrological cycle in three freshwater compartments within the watershed: (i) glacial rivers; (ii) active layer thaw-fed streams and waterbodies and (iii) Lake Hazen, into which (i) and (ii) drain. Microbial communities throughout these freshwater compartments were strongly interconnected, hydrologically, and often correlated with the presence of melt-sourced chemicals (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon) as the melt season progressed. Within Lake Hazen itself, water column microbial communities were generally stable over spring and summer, despite fluctuating lake physicochemistry, indicating that these communities and the potential ecosystem services they provide therein may be resilient to environmental change. This work helps to establish a baseline understanding of how microbial communities and the ecosystem services they provide in Arctic watersheds might respond to future climate change.

TI  - Gross primary productivity in areas of different land cover in the western Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty regarding gross carbon sequestration at local, regional, and global scales can be reduced by monitoring the land surface processes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this sense, the objective of this study was to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) in a region of the western Brazilian Amazon using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images, and to evaluate possible changes in estimated productivity among areas of different land use and in different seasonal conditions (August 04, 2013, representing the dry season, and October 10, 2014, representing the rainy season). The images were subjected to atmospheric and radiometric corrections. As the basic input for the model, the balance of radiation and other components of the energy balance were calculated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land. The GPP estimated through the OLI/TIRS sensor was compared with the MOD17A2 product of the MODIS sensor. The comparison of GPP by the OLI/TIRS sensors and the MOD17A2H product were based on the mean error (ME), simple linear regression (r(2)) and correlation coefficient (r). The estimated GPP indicated distinctions among land use types, however, similarities with MOD17A2H were detected only with the image from the rainy season (r = 0.53), with a slight underestimation for all land uses. The dry season image showed r(2) = 0.11, r = 0.33 and ME = -0.48 gCm(-2)day(-1) for extractivism, while the land use types were overestimated by the model. The OLI/TIRS sensor estimates need to be validated with data from flow towers. The focus on carbon sequestration by forest ecosystems and the reduction of CO2 emissions is the foundation for mitigating climate change damage and consequences at regional and global levels. Currently deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is growing absurdly. Policies contrary to the control of deforestation will only cause accelerated climate change, which will endanger the lives of future generations.

TI  - Reconstruction of sea-land interactions between terrestrial vegetation cover and water quality constituents in the Mattapoisett Harbor area during the 1991 Hurricane Bob event
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricane Bob passed over the New England region in August 1991, causing significant damage to life, property, and the 'environment, making it one of the costliest hurricanes in New England history. The environmental impact of a hurricane of this magnitude warrants careful assessment to devise preventive measures and mitigation strategies to bolster water resources management programs against future events. In this paper, we show the reconstructed simultaneous impacts of Hurricane Bob on the vegetative cover of the Mattapoisett river watershed and the water quality of the Mattapoisett Harbor with the aid of remote sensing for earth observations. The water quality impacts, especially in terms of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), can be identified from variations of SSS and TOC near coastal estuaries due to the influx of freshwater from the coastal Mattapoisett River to the continent-ocean transition between natural tides and bay waves. Using the Landsat satellite images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and water quality constitutes (TOC and SSS) were reconstructed and retrieved for the assessment of the sea-land interactions during the Hurricane Bob event in 1991. Results indicate phenomenal interactive patterns between the harbor and the coastal watershed, as well as the riverine system. TOC and NDVI, especially in the upper watershed region, can be strongly correlated with hurricane impacts according to the singular value decomposition analysis.

AB  - The coastline is the dividing line between the ocean and land. Monitoring coastline dynamics is of crucial importance because it provides essential information for understanding the coastal response to contemporary climate change and human impacts. Real-time monitoring of coastlines has increasingly depended on remote sensing images at high temporal and spatial resolutions. In this study, a method combining the tasseled cap transformation (TCT) and feature knowledge is proposed to extract coastline information. Because traditional remote sensing methods cannot be used where total suspended sediment content is high, land and ocean separation was carried out using the wetness component of the Otsu method. A mathematical morphology analysis was used to remove the influence of lakes, rivers, and ships. Coastlines with shorter length were eliminated, and intermittent coastlines were connected based on a coordinate geometry description (such as length, distance, and direction). For the period of 2000-2018, Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper) and Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) images of the Zhoushan Islands, China, were used to extract coastline information using a method combining TCT and feature knowledge. A comparison of the results with reference data obtained by visual interpretation shows that the average of producer accuracy and user accuracy are 93.62% and 96.15%, respectively, and the average of length error was 2.45%. Therefore, the proposed method was effective in delineating the boundary between land and ocean and more effective than traditional methods in areas with high suspended sediment concentrations.

TI  - Statistical Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Distribution of Ozone Induced by Cut-Off Lows in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere over Northeast Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a statistical study of the spatiotemporal distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) regions induced by cut-off lows (COLs) over Northeast Asia. The analysis was based on high-resolution ERA-Interim ozone data and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) satellite data for the period from 2005-2015. A total of 186 COL events were detected. The observed ozone distribution revealed an ozone-rich region in the upper troposphere (300 hPa) located around the center of the COLs at the time when COLs reached their maximum intensity. This region corresponds to a region of high potential vorticity (PV). In the middle troposphere (500 hPa), enhanced levels of the ozone were distributed in two regions. The maximum concentration was located to the east of the COLs, and a secondary maximum region was in the center of the COLs. Further analysis revealed that this spatial distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere was affected mainly by decreased tropopause. The ozone was subject to a 'rotary' transport process in the middle troposphere, influenced mainly by the anticlockwise circulation of the COLs and the surrounding horizontal wind distribution. The temporal variations in ozone anomalies also revealed the ozone distribution patterns and transport processes. The variation in ozone anomalies implied that the magnitude of the ozone increase was closely related to the evolution of COLs lifecycle. The temporal and spatial distributions of the ozone revealed by the statistical analysis of the AIRS satellite data were overall consistent with those of the ERA-Interim data.

TI  - Assessing vertical and horizontal movements of algal blooms in a coastal water using satellite remote sensing for optimal operation of desalination plants
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are global concerns in coastal waters due to diffuse pollution and climate change. Emerging issues of HABs include their impact on desalination operations for water supply. This study utilizes composite satellite images to detect movement and propagation of algal blooms. Time series images from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for monitoring chlorophyll-a in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf, which neighboring countries depend upon for desalination as their freshwater resource. Bi-daily MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites were used to detect both vertical migration and horizontal movement of algal blooms. The results will be useful for creating an early warning system for desalination plants to anticipate operating strategies and intake locations to minimize impacts.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we develop two target parameters to model the interaction between a target and a polarization wave. The two parameters are the target ellipticity angle (TEA) and the target phase angle (TPA). The concept of reflection symmetry or rotation symmetry is used to explain the robustness of the estimation method and to show problems associated with other algorithms. C-band Radarsat-2 and L band ALOS PALSAR multi-look full polarimetric images are used to substantiate the parameters, and validate the effectiveness of them. In addition, the TEA and TPA are compared with alpha - beta model and Touzi TVSM model for single-look polarimetric SAR data. Experimental results show that the two target parameters are beneficial supplements for interpreting the target scattering processes and separating buildings from other targets.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Detecting Changes of Land Use in Taipei City, Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combined statistical analysis and remote sensing techniques to explore the environmental effect of land use and land cover changes in Taipei City, Taiwan. Together with SPOT satellite images from multiple periods (1993, 2003, and 2014), unsupervised Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis techniques were used to classify images into three categories: water, vegetation (green area), and non-planting (buildings) areas. An accuracy assessment was conducted to analyze the changes in each administrative region and to explore the differences in the green cover ratios of the various administrative regions through the spatial distribution characteristics of satellite images. We found that if the area of green cover must be increased, the need for green coverage and distribution can be quantified through geospatial analysis to identify preferred sites. In addition to increasing the proportion of green coverage in the city, this approach can effectively mitigate changes in the ambient temperature. The overall accuracy and kappa values of this study were more than 90% and 0.8, respectively, indicating that the image classification results had favorable reliability.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis and linear unmixing are common methods in image classification. The purpose of this study is to analyze the classification efficiency by integrating these two methods in the mountain area. This research selected Jiangle County, Fujian, as a study area. Two Landsat8 OLI images, which covered the county, were used. Linear spectral mixture model, multi-scale segmentation, and decision tree were applied in the classification. After image preprocessing, linear spectral mixture model was used to unmix the image into three fraction images-vegetation, shade, and soil. The principal component analysis and tasseled cap transformation were used to derived three principal components and the brightness, wetness, and greenness. Multi-scale segmentation is applied by eCognition. Under scale 40, the image was divided into vegetation and non-vegetation area, then under scale 20, the vegetation area was divided into different types by integrating the fraction with different methods. The accuracy assessment of the classification map was done using the forestry resource survey and the high-resolution image of Google Earth. This study indicated that the unmixed bands could improve the classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was 92.40% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.9032. Therefore, there is a conclusion that this approach is an efficient way to classify different plantation.

TI  - Assessment of aerosol types on improving the estimation of surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations by using ground-based aerosol optical depth dataset
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the influence of aerosol type classification on estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations was assessed by using ground-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 22 ground-based observation points in the United States. To clarify the influence, a two-stage model consisting of a multiple regression model (MRM) and an aerosol classification model (ACM) was proposed to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations, and results from a traditional MRM and the new ACM-MRM were compared. Results show that the average determination coefficient (R-2) of the ACM-MRM (0.52) was greater than that of the MRM (0.44), while the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the ACM-MRM (3.74 mu g/m(3) and 34.91%, respectively) were lower than the values obtained with the MRM (4.09 mu g/m(3) and 37.64%, respectively). The use of ACM improved the estimation of daily PM2.5 concentrations in different regions and different seasons by reducing the deviations caused by aerosol type changes. Further analysis demonstrated that aerosol type changes had adverse influences on the estimation of short-term PM2.5 concentrations and the introduction of ACM can effectively restrain the adverse influences when aerosols change frequently.

TI  - Retrieval of the Fraction of Radiation Absorbed by Photosynthetic Components (<i>FAPAR<sub>green</sub></i>) for Forest Using a Triple-Source Leaf-Wood-Soil Layer Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is generally divided into the fraction of radiation absorbed by the photosynthetic components (FAPAR(green) ) and the fraction of radiation absorbed by the non-photosynthetic components (FAPAR(woody) ) of the vegetation. However, most global FAPAR datasets do not take account of the woody components when considering the canopy radiation transfer. The objective of this study was to develop a generic algorithm for partitioning FAPAR(canopy) into FAPAR(green) and FAPAR(woody) based on a triple-source leaf-wood-soil layer (TriLay) approach. The LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework (LESS) model was used to validate the TriLay approach. The results showed that the TriLay FAPAR(green) had higher retrieval accuracy, as well as a significantly lower bias (R-2 = 0.937, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.064, and bias = -6.02% for black-sky conditions; R-2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.025 and bias = -4.04% for white-sky conditions) compared to the traditional linear method (R-2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.114, and bias = -18.04% for black-sky conditions; R-2 = 0.996, RMSE = 0.106 and bias = -16.93% for white-sky conditions). For FAPAR that did not take account of woody components (FAPAR(noWAI) ), the corresponding results were R-2 = 0.920, RMSE = 0.071, and bias = -7.14% for black-sky conditions, and R-2 = 0.999, RMSE = 0.043, and bias = -6.41% for white-sky conditions. Finally, the dynamic FAPAR(green) , FAPAR(woody) , FAPARcanopy and FAPAR(noWAI) products for a North America region were generated at a resolution of 500 m for every eight days in 2017. A comparison of the results for FAPAR(green) against those for FAPARnoWAI and FAPAR(canopy) showed that the discrepancy between FAPAR(green) and other FAPAR products for forest vegetation types could not be ignored. For deciduous needleleaf forest, in particular, the black-sky FAPAR(green) was found to contribute only about 23.86% and 35.75% of FAPAR(canopy) at the beginning and end of the year (from January to March and October to December, JFM and OND), and 75.02% at the peak growth stage (from July to September, JAS); the black-sky FAPAR(noWAI) was found to be overestimated by 38.30% and 28.46% during the early (JFM) and late (OND) part of the year, respectively. Therefore, the TriLay approach performed well in separating FAPARgreen from FAPAR(canopy) , which is of great importance for a better understanding of the energy exchange within the canopy.

TI  - A Nighttime Lights Adjusted Impervious Surface Index (NAISI) with Integration of Landsat Imagery and Nighttime Lights Data from International Space Station
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of impervious surface is essential for both urbanization monitoring and micro-ecosystem research. However, the confusion between impervious surface and bare soil is the major concern due to their high spectral similarity in optical imagery. Integration of multi-sensor images is considered to offer a better capacity for distinguishing impervious surface from background. In this paper, a new impervious surface index namely nighttime light adjusted impervious surface index (NAISI), which integrates information from Landsat and nighttime lights (NTL) data from International Space Station (NTL-ISS), is proposed. Parallel to baseline subtraction approaches, NAISI integrate the information from the first component of principal component (PC) transformation of NTL-ISS, the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the third component of tasseled cap transform (TC3) of the Landsat data. Visual interpretation and quantitative indices (SDI, Kappa and overall accuracy) were adopted to elevate the accuracy and separability of NAISI. Comparative analysis with NTL derived light intensity, optical indices, as well as existing optical-NTL indices were conducted to examine the performance of NAISI. Results indicate that NAISI achieves a more promising capability in impervious surface mapping. This demonstrates the superiority of integration of optical and nighttime lights information for imperviousness detection.

TI  - Delineating Seasonal Relationships Between Suomi NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light and Human Activity Across Shanghai, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The nighttime light (NTL) remote-sensing data have been widely applied in several applications for analyzing the urbanization process. The relationship between NTL intensity and human activity becomes a solid foundation for the applications using NTL data. However, there is no research, so far, revealing how the human activity seasonality could impact the seasonal change of NTL intensity. In this paper, a comparative analysis, box plot, and random forest algorithm were applied to NTL remote-sensing data and points of interest (POIs) data within Shanghai, China. The results show that in spring and autumn, the NTL is much brighter than that in summer and winter, especially within high human activity density area. The NTL intensity can be partly (approximately 40) explained as the joint effects of the five POI categories. By analyzing the contributions of each POI category to NTL intensity, we found that the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) could be used to dig more information about gross domestic product (GDP) and traffic-based applications with consideration of NTL seasonality.

TI  - Modification and improvement of microalgae strains for strengthening CO<sub>2</sub> fixation from coal-fired flue gas in power plants
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Biological CO2 capture using microalgae is a promising new method for reducing CO2 emission of coal-fired flue gas. The strain of microalgae used in this process plays a vital role in determining the rate of CO2 fixation and characteristics of biomass production. High requirements are put forward for algae strains due to high CO2 concentration and diverse pollutants in flue gas. CO2 can directly diffuse into the cytoplasm of cells by extra- and intracellular CO2 osmotic pressure under high CO2 concentrations. The flue gas pollutants, such as SOx, NOx and fly ashes, have negative effects on the growth of microalgae. This work reviewed the state-of-the-art advances on microalgae strains used for CO2 fixation, focusing on the modification and improvement of strains that are used for coal-fired flue gas. Methods such as genetic engineering, random mutagenesis, and adaptive evolution have the potential to facilitate photosynthesis, improve growth rate and reduce CO2 emission.

TI  - Forest-Type Classification Using Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping Analysis in Mountain Areas: A Case Study in Southern China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient methodologies for mapping forest types in complicated mountain areas are essential for the implementation of sustainable forest management practices and monitoring. Existing solutions dedicated to forest-type mapping are primarily focused on supervised machine learning algorithms (MLAs) using remote sensing time-series images. However, MLAs are challenged by complex and problematic forest type compositions, lack of training data, loss of temporal data caused by clouds obscuration, and selection of input feature sets for mountainous areas. The time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) is a supervised classifier, an adaptation of the dynamic time warping method for time series analysis for land cover classification. This study evaluates the performance of the TWDTW method that uses a combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 time-series images when applied to complicated mountain forest-type classifications in southern China with complex topographic conditions and forest-type compositions. The classification outputs were compared to those produced by MLAs, including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The results presented that the three forest-type maps obtained by TWDTW, RF, and SVM have high consistency in spatial distribution. TWDTW outperformed SVM and RF with mean overall accuracy and mean kappa coefficient of 93.81% and 0.93, respectively, followed by RF and SVM. Compared with MLAs, TWDTW method achieved the higher classification accuracy than RF and SVM, with even less training data. This proved the robustness and less sensitivities to training samples of the TWDTW method when applied to mountain forest-type classifications.

TI  - Monitoring Tangier (Morocco) coastal waters for As, Fe and P concentrations using ESA Sentinels-2 and 3 data: An exploratory study
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An exploratory study is presented to investigate human activities pollution in the coastal waters of a popular tourist destination in the west coast of Tangier, Morocco. A series of bathing water samples were examined for arsenic (As), iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the western coastal waters of Tangier. Additionally, quasi-simultaneous satellite images from Sentinels-2 and 3 were processed to retrieve water leaving reflectances in the same locations. The bathing water samples showed high concentrations of As, P and Fe in the Boukhalef River mouth and in two nearby beaches; Jbila and Sidikacem, which appeared closely correlated with Sentinel-3 reflectances at bands 6 (560 nm) and 7 (620 nm). Since algorithms for Chlorophyll-a and Total Suspended Matter Concentrations rely on these wavelengths, they too were found to be closely related to high As, Fe and P concentrations. Therefore, caution must be taken when analysing these level-2 products in close proximity to the Boukhalef River mouth, since results may be biased due to the presence of significant As, Fe and P concentrations. In this case, Sentinel data proved to be a potentially useful tool with prospects to be used for monitoring environmental hazardous substances such as metals (e.g. As and Fe) spatial distributions in the west coast of Tangier, Morocco.

TI  - Tree Species Classification by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Topographic Variables Using Maximum Entropy Method in a Mongolian Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are an important natural resource that achieve ecological balance by regulating water regimes and promoting soil conservation. Based on forest inventories, the government is able to make decisions to sustainably conserve, improve, and manage forests. Fieldwork for forestry investigation requires intensive physical labor, which is costly and time-consuming, especially for surveys in remote mountainous regions. Remote sensing technology has been recently used for forest investigation on a large scale. An informative forest inventory must include forest attributes, including details of tree species; however, tree species mapping is not always applicable due to the similarity of surface reflectance and texture between tree species. Topographic variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, and curvature are crucial in allocating ecological niches to different species; therefore, this study suggests that integrating topographic information and optical satellite image classification can improve mapping accuracy for tree species. The main purpose of this study is to classify forest tree species in Erdenebulgan County, Huwsgul Province, Mongolia, by integrating Landsat satellite imagery with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a Maximum Entropy algorithm. A forest tree species inventory from the Forest Division of the Mongolian Ministry of Nature and Environment was used as training data and as ground truth to perform the accuracy assessment. In this study, the classification was made using two different experimental approaches. First, classification was done using only Landsat surface reflectance data; and second, topographic variables were integrated with the Landsat surface reflectance data. The integration approach showed a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, indicating that an accurate forest inventory can be achieved by integrating satellite imagery data and other topographic information to enhance the practice of forest management in remote regions.

TI  - Polarimetric SAR Signatures for Characterizing Geological Units in the Canadian Arctic
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the polarimetric radar signatures of geological units in the Canadian Arctic to characterize their physical surface properties. It focuses on the Tunnunik and Haughton meteorite impact structures using RADARSAT-2 quad polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The geological units show different three-dimensional (3-D) polarimetric SAR signature plots (i.e., radar backscattering responses according to the orientation and the ellipticity of a polarization state). We analyzed the quantitative relationship between the polarimetric SAR signatures of the geological units and their surface roughness. The pedestal height and the standard deviation of linear copolarization responses (SDLP) were calculated from the 3-D copolarization power signature plot, and then compared to in situ surface roughness measurements derived from LiDAR scanned high-resolution surface topography. The results show that the pedestal height has a positive correlation coefficient of similar to 0.6 with surface roughness, while the SDLP has a negative correlation coefficient of similar to 0.8 with surface roughness. The variation between the different polarization responses is highly dependent on the surface roughness of the geological units. The SDLP is thus suggested as a promising parameter to characterize surface roughness, in addition to the pedestal height that has been commonly used.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics assessment of snow cover to infer snowline elevation mobility in the mountainous regions
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complex physics of both snow and snowmelt, particularly in mountainous topographic regions, studying the dynamics and variations of snow cover (SC) has been a very challenging task, and therefore, its relationship with snowline elevation (SLE) mobility has not been well documented. The spatiotemporal dynamics of SC in the Haraz Watershed, where streamflow is snowmelt-dominated, is of great importance, particularly for monitoring ecosystem processes, irrigation practices, and water management in the region. In the current study, due to the lack of a ground-based station, the remotely sensed eight-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were considered in order to assess the dynamics of SC through investigating the monthly-normalized difference snow index (NDSI) during 2001 to 2018. Additionally, the SLE mobility was inferred through representing and assessing three indices related to SC, including variability in the number of snowy pixels and variations of the minimum and mean elevation in snowy pixels over time. According to the results, generally, 99.49% of the study regions showed NDSI declines, and 56.85% of these pixels showed significant trends. Variations of SC frequency showed that 32% of the study area has a moderate to very high snow existence probability. The trend of minimum and average elevation in snowy pixels indicates that January and December had significant increases, meaning that SLE increases during that time and moves towards higher elevations. The rate of changes in the average elevation of snowy pixels indicated an increasing rate of SLE in the months of January, February, March, August, and December, respectively equal to 8.18, 0.69, 2.51, 22.59, and 5.82 m per year. Further, results indicated that the percentage of the significant decrease in SC is highest on the slope aspects of southeast, south, and southwest (respectively equal to 66.81%, 62.35%, and 62.35%), meaning that SLE increases faster on these slope aspects.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging improves the nodal yield in neck dissection in oral cavity cancer - A randomized study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Lymph node yield (LNY) in neck dissection has been identified as a prognostic factor in oral cavity cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of additional use of optical imaging on LNY in therapeutic ND in oral cancer.Methods: Consecutive patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma with clinical neck metastasis planned for primary tumor resection were randomized to conventional neck dissection or near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided neck dissection, respectively. In the intervention group, patients were injected with ICG-Nanocoll prior to surgery. Intraoperatively, an optical hand-held camera system was used for lymph node identification. Also, NIRF imaging of the neck specimen was performed, and optical signals were pinned with needle markings to guide the pathological examination. The endpoint of the study was LNY per neck side in levels Ib-III.Results: 31 patients were included with 18 neck sides in the control group and 18 neck sides in the intervention group for evaluation. During NIRF-guided ND, individual lymph nodes could be identified by a bright fluorescent signal and individual tumor-related drainage patterns could be observed in the neck. The LNY in the intervention group was significantly higher compared to the control group (p = 0.032) with a mean of 24 LN (range: 12-33 LN in levels Ib-III compared to 18 LN (range: 10-36 LN) in the control group, respectively.Conclusions: NIRF-guided ND significantly improved the nodal yield compared to the control group. Intraoperative real-time optical imaging enabled direct visualization of tumor-related drainage patterns within the neck lymphatics. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Technical Framework for Shallow-Water Bathymetry With High Reliability and No Missing Data Based on Time-Series Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow-water bathymetry based on multispectral satellite imagery (MSI) is an important technology for depth measurement, but it is difficult to obtain a bathymetric map with high reliability and no missing data because of the ubiquitous image noise. Here, we propose a time-series-based bathymetry framework (TSBF). First, a pixel-level time series is constructed using remote sensing images collected at multiple points in time. Then, a new time-domain denoising method, the maximum outlier removal method, is used to create an optimal image from this time series. Finally, bathymetric inversion is performed using this optimal image to obtain a bathymetric map. Anda Reef and northeastern Jiuzhang Atoll, which have complex noise features, were selected as test cases to validate the proposed framework. Results show that the proposed TSBF can obtain bathymetric maps with high accuracy, reliability, and no missing data, outperforming the conventional bathymetry framework based on a single image.

TI  - Rotation Effects on Corn and Soybean Yield Inferred from Satellite and Field-level Data
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides a way of studying agricultural systems when proprietary data and field studies are unavailable. As satellite data become more plentiful and accurate, they have been used to analyze crop yields and, when paired with field data, the effects of management practices. However, satellite data have rarely been used alone to quantify the effects of management practices. This study was conducted to determine whether satellite data can replicate field data findings on the yield benefits of rotation practices. We investigated the yield benefits of crop rotation on corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] using estimates generated from satellite imagery in Indiana, Iowa, and Illinois and compared these to yield benefits from field-level data between 2007 and 2012. After adjusting for environmental differences between fields with and without rotations, satellite data show yield benefits of 1.0% with a range of -8.9 to 9.7% for corn rotations and 10.8% with a range of 4.6 to 17.6% for soybean rotations, within the range of effects found in the literature and not significantly different from estimates of 4.3% for rainfed corn and 10.3% for rainfed soybean found using the field-level data. Based on our findings, we conclude that satellite data can be used to evaluate rotation practices without ground data.

T2  - Recenti Progressi in Medicina
M3  - Article
AB  - The Apple Watch 4 is a wearable device whose advertising launch made a lot of noise, not only for technological advances in general, but above all because the latest version is able to record an electrocardiogram. The device signals to the wearer the possible presence of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia that is often difficult to identify. There is also the possibility that the increased engagement of citizens causes excessive confidence in self-monitoring and in "do-it-yourself" diagnoses. Therefore medical experts are needed, who educate the user for a correct use, avoiding the risk of false positives and consequent false alarms. Currently, methodologically rigorous studies are lacking to validate the use of the device to integrate the traditional diagnostic tools.

TI  - Efficient sentinel surveillance strategies for preventing epidemics on networks
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary In a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease, what are the best locations to monitor in order to detect the infection before most damage can be done? In this paper we address this question by considering various heuristic strategies for sentinel placement that can potentially be implemented in real-world situations without requiring excessive amounts of computation, or even having perfect data about the structure of the network. We find that strategies that attempt to distribute sentinels over different regions of the network perform best in highly modular or spatially embedded networks, whereas the strategy of targeting the most well connected individuals works best when there is a considerable amount of contact heterogeneity between individuals. Our results may be used as a guideline to help decide when certain strategies should, or should not, be implemented.Surveillance plays a crucial role in preventing emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemic. In circumstances where it is possible to monitor the infection status of certain people, transport hubs, or hospitals, early detection of the disease allows interventions to be implemented before most of the damage can occur, or at least its impact can be mitigated. This paper addresses the question of which nodes we should select in a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease in order to minimize the number of casualties. By simulating disease outbreaks on a collection of empirical and synthetic networks we show that the best strategy depends on topological characteristics of the network. For highly modular or spatially embedded networks it is better to place the sentinels on nodes distributed across different regions. However, if the degree heterogeneity is high, then a strategy that targets network hubs is preferred. We further consider the consequences of having an incomplete sample of the network and demonstrate that the value of new information diminishes as more data is collected. Finally we find further marginal improvements using two heuristics informed by known results in graph theory that exploit the fragmented structure of sparse network data.

TI  - Overview, chronology, and impacts of the 2016-2017 eruption of Bogoslof volcano, Alaska
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016-2017 eruption of Bogoslof volcano, a back-arc shallow submarine volcano in Alaska's Aleutian arc, began in December 2016 and included 70 explosive events and at least two episodes of subaerial dome building. Because the volcano had no local monitoring stations during the eruption, a combination of distant seismic stations, regional infrasound sensors, lightning detection, a variety of satellite data and observer reports, and a field visit in 2018, were used to recreate the events that occurred during the nine-month eruption. Following precursory seismicity that started in September 2016, the eruption began in December 2016 with a series of explosive events that persisted through mid-March 2017. After a 6-week hiatus, activity resumed on May 17 and lasted through the end of August 2017 and consisted of additional explosions and two short-lived subaerial lava domes that formed in June and August. For most of the eruption, Bogoslof's vent was submerged in shallow seawater, though during several of the longer events a subaerial edifice grew, and the vent migrated above sea level resulting in more ash-rich volcanic clouds. Eruptive products, geophysical signals, and eruptive style are all broadly consistent with vulcanian activity where slow magma ascent led to repetitive dome or plug formation, overpressurization in the upper conduit, and sudden release during short-lived explosions. Infiltration of seawater may have prohibited large domes from forming especially in the first half of the eruption when explosions were closely spaced in time. The largest four explosions in the sequence occurred after inter-event times of 10 days or more. Three events produced ashfall on nearby communities and mariners east and south of Bogoslof and the eruption resulted in dozens of flight cancelations and flight diversions around the volcano and its ash clouds.

TI  - The changing therapeutic landscape of head and neck cancer
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous collection of malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract, salivary glands and thyroid. In this Review, we primarily focus on the changing therapeutic landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) that can arise in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. We highlight developments in surgical and non-surgical therapies (mainly involving the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy), outlining how these treatments are being used in the current era of widespread testing for the presence of human papillomavirus infection in patients with HNSCC. Finally, we describe the clinical trials that led to the approval of the first immunotherapeutic agents for HNSCC, and discuss the development of strategies to decrease the toxicity of different treatment modalities.

TI  - Determining a Threshold to Delimit the Amazonian Forests from the Tree Canopy Cover 2000 GFC Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Open global forest cover data can be a critical component for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) policies. In this work, we determine the best threshold, compatible with the official Brazilian dataset, for establishing a forest mask cover within the Amazon basin for the year 2000 using the Tree Canopy Cover 2000 GFC product. We compared forest cover maps produced using several thresholds (10%, 30%, 50%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95%) with a forest cover map for the same year from the Brazilian Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project (PRODES) data, produced by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). We also compared the forest cover classifications indicated by each of these maps to 2550 independently assessed Landsat pixels for the year 2000, providing an accuracy assessment for each of these map products. We found that thresholds of 80% and 85% best matched with the PRODES data. Consequently, we recommend using an 80% threshold for the Tree Canopy Cover 2000 data for assessing forest cover in the Amazon basin.

TI  - Extreme Drought Events over Brazil from 2011 to 2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought-related disasters are among the natural disasters that are able to cause large economic and social losses. In recent years, droughts have affected different regions of Brazil, impacting water, food, and energy security. In this study, we used the Integrated Drought Index (IDI), which combines a meteorological-based drought index and remote sensing-based index, to assess the drought events from 2011 to 2019 over Brazil. During this period, drought events were observed throughout the country, being most severe and widespread between the years 2011 and 2017. In most of the country, the 2014/15 hydrological year stands out due to the higher occurrence of severe and moderate droughts. However, drought intensity and observed impacts were different for each region, which is shown by the different case studies, assessing different types of impacts caused by drought in Brazil. Thus, it is fundamental to evaluate the impacts of droughts in a continental country such as Brazil, where a variety of vegetation, soil, land use, and especially different climate regimes predominate.

TI  - The SMAP and Copernicus Sentinel 1A/B microwave active-passive high resolution surface soil moisture product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission of NASA was launched in January 2015. Currently, SMAP has an L-band radiometer and a defunct L-band radar with a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna. On July 7th, 2015, the SMAP radar malfunctioned and became inoperable. Consequently, the production of high-resolution active-passive soil moisture product got hampered, and only similar to 2.5 months (April 15th, 2015 to July 7th, 2015) of data remain available. Therefore, during the SMAP post-radar phase, many ways were examined to restart the high-resolution soil moisture product generation of the SMAP mission. One of the feasible approaches was to substitute the SMAP radar with other available SAR data. Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B SAR data was found most suitable for combining with the SMAP radiometer data because of its nearly similar orbit configuration that allows overlapping of their swaths with a minimal time difference, a key feature/requirement for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. The Sentinel interferometric wide swath (IW) mode acquisition also provides the co-polarized and cross-polarized observations required for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. However, some differences do exist between the SMAP and Sentinel SAR data. They are mainly: 1) Sentinel has a C-band SAR whereas SMAP operates at L-band; 2) Sentinel has multiple incidence angles within its swath, and SMAP has one single incidence angle; and 3) Sentinel 1A/B Interferometric Wide (IW) swath width is similar to 250 km as compared to SMAP with 1000 km swath width. On any given day, the narrow swath width of the Sentinel observations significantly reduces the overlap spatial coverage between SMAP and Sentinel as compared to the original SMAP radar and radiometer swath coverage. Hence, the temporal resolution (revisit interval) suffers due to narrow overlapped swath width and degrades from 3 days to 12 days. One advantage of using very high-resolution resolution Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B data in the SMAP active-passive algorithm is the potential of obtaining the disaggregated brightness temperature and thus soil moisture at a much finer spatial resolution of 3 km and 1 km at global extent. The assessment of high-resolution product at 3 km and 1 km using the soil moisture calibration and validations sites shows reasonable accuracy of similar to 0.05 m(3)/m(3). The SMAP-Sentinel1 active-passive high-resolution product is now available to the public (new version released in October 2018) through NSIDC (NASA DAAC). The duration of this product is from April 2015 to current date.

M3  - Review
AB  - Oral cavity carcinoma (OCC) remains an ongoing public health problem. Emerging nanotechnology provides alternative treatment approaches. This review covers the up-to-date literature in the human OCC treatment field. We explored the growing body of evidence to reveal novel and highly promising diagnostic and therapeutic applications of nanotechnology in this field. Various types of nanoparticles have been tested for applications in OCC. Imaging modalities in addition to nanocarriers are discussed. The encouraging contribution of lymphotropic nanoparticles contrast in the diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes needs to be confirmed. The development of the sentinel lymph node procedure and photodynamic therapy may lead to breakthrough therapies in order improve clinical outcomes and quality of life. In this perspective, cancer nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of OCC patients.

TI  - Lipid biomarker temperature proxy responds to abrupt shift in the bacterial community composition in geothermally heated soils
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific soil bacterial membrane lipids, branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), are used as an empirical proxy for past continental temperatures. Their response to temperature change is assumed to be linear, caused by physiological plasticity of their, still unknown, source organisms. A well-studied set of geothermally warmed soils (Iceland) shows that the brGDGT fingerprint only changes when the soil mean annual temperature is warmer than 14 degrees C. This sudden change in brGDGT distribution coincides with an abrupt shift in the bacterial community composition in the same soils. Determining which bacterial OTUs are indicative for each soil cluster shows that Acidobacteria are possible brGDGT producers, together with representatives from the Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmationadetes and Proteobacteria. Projecting the lipid fingerprint of the cold and warm bacterial communities onto the global soil calibration dataset creates two distinct soil clusters, in which brGDGTs respond differently to temperature and, especially, soil pH. We show that, on a local scale, a community effect rather than physiological plasticity can be the primary driver of the brGDGT-based paleothermometer along large temperature gradients. This threshold response needs to be taken into account when interpreting brGDGT-based paleo-records. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Anatomical localization of radiocolloid tracer deposition affects outcome of sentinel node procedures in prostate cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Diagnostic imaging modalities have moderate sensitivity for the identification of lymph node (LN) metastases in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Mapping the lymphatic drainage from the prostate can help to identify the LNs directly draining from the tumour (sentinel nodes (SNs)); the LNs stated to have the highest chance of containing metastatic cancer cells. Although the lymphatic drainage may differ between segments within the prostate, the location of the primary tumour is not routinely taken into account during peripheral zone-aimed tracer administration. This study evaluates whether linking the SN procedure to the primary cancer deposits increases the identification accuracy of lymphatic metastases. Methods Sixty-seven PCa patients, scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) and extended lymph node dissection (ePLND) with subsequent SN biopsy, were included in this retrospective study. After injection of the hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid in the prostate, SN mapping was performed based on lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT. SNs were resected using a combination of radio- and fluorescence guidance. Pathology was used to determine the primary tumour location and metastatic spread. Fluorescence imaging of paraffin-embedded prostate tissue was used to determine the location of the tracer deposits in the prostate. This deposition was related to the primary tumour location, the lymphatic drainage pattern of the injected tracer, and the metastatic spread. Results In total 265 radioactive LNs (211 SNs and 54 higher-echelon nodes in 64 patients; 4.3 LNs per patient; IQR: 2-6) were identified. In three patients (4%) preoperative imaging did not allow identification of SNs. Tumour-positive SN visualization within the pelvis was shown to be influenced by intraprostatic location of tracer administration. This could be concluded from (1) a clear correlation between lymphatic drainage to the right or left side of the body and tracer deposition on the right or left side of the prostate, (2) visualization of a higher number of LNs after dorsal tracer deposition compared with ventral tracer deposition, (3) different drainage patterns observed for tracer deposition into the base or apex of the prostate, and (4) the indication that intratumoural tracer deposition increases the chance of visualizing nodal metastases compared with extratumoural tracer deposition. Conclusions The correlation between the location of the tracer deposits, the location of the primary tumour, and the visualization of the (tumour-positive) SNs indicated that placement of tracer deposits is of influence on the visualized lymphatic drainage pattern. This suggests that tracer injection near or into the primary tumour site is beneficial for the identification of metastatic spread.

TI  - Saving the Male Breast: A Systematic Literature Review of Breast-Conservation Surgery for Male Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. Male breast cancer (MBC) management is extrapolated from female BC. Mastectomy remains the most frequently used surgical procedure for male breast cancer (MBC). We performed a literature review to assess the use of breast-conservation (BCS) in MBC as well as outcomes following BCS.Methods. A systematic literature was performed, and articles screened to identify studies that measured overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), or local recurrence (LR) in patients undergoing BCS. Weighted averages based on study size were performed for LR, DFS, and 5-year OS.Results. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria with male breast surgery cases, and 859 (14.7%) underwent BCS. The mean follow-up time was 53 months, and mean age was 62.6 years, with stage II as the most common presentation. Two studies reported that 50-71.4% of patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, and four studies reported axillary lymph node dissection in 14.3-100%. Five studies reported on adjuvant radiation therapy in 12.0-100% of total patients undergoing BCS. Four studies reported use of hormonal therapy in 73.8-100% of patients. Four studies reported use of chemotherapy in 25-66.7% of patients. Seven studies reported LR among 116 patients, with a weighted average of 9.9%. Three studies reported on DFS in 14 patients, with a weighted average 85.6%. Two studies report OS in 143 patients with a weighted average of 84.4%.Conclusions. Breast conservation may be considered a safe alternative in the surgical treatment of MBC. Future research should focus on better standardization of local therapy for MBC and improved reporting of outcomes.

TI  - Feasibility of Point-of-Care Testing for Influenza Within a National Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network in England: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Point-of-care testing (POCT) for influenza promises to provide real-time information to influence clinical decision making and improve patient outcomes. Public Health England has published a toolkit to assist implementation of these tests in the UK National Health Service.Objective: A feasibility study will be undertaken to assess the implementation of influenza POCT in primary care as part of a sentinel surveillance network.Methods: We will conduct a mixed methods study to compare the sampling rates in practices using POCT and current virology swabbing practices not using POCT, and to understand the issues and barriers to implementation of influenza POCT in primary care workflows. The study will take place between March and May 2019. It will be nested in general practices that are part of the English national sentinel surveillance network run by the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre. The primary outcome is the number of valid influenza swabs taken and tested by the practices involved in the study using the new POCT.Results: A total of 6 practices were recruited, and data collection commenced on March 11, 2019. Moreover, 312 swab samples had been collected at the time of submission of the protocol, which was 32.5% (312/960) of the expected sample size. In addition, 68 samples were positive for influenza, which was 20.1% (68/338) of the expected sample size.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an evaluation study has been undertaken on POCT for influenza in general practice in the United Kingdom. This proposed study promises to shed light on the feasibility of implementation of POCT in primary care and on the views of practitioners about the use of influenza POCT in primary care, including its impact on primary care workflows.

TI  - Mapping three decades of annual irrigation across the US High Plains Aquifer using Landsat and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how irrigated areas change over time is vital to effectively manage limited agricultural water resources, but long-term, high-resolution, and spatially explicit datasets are rare. The High Plains Aquifer (HPA) in the central United States is one of the largest and most stressed aquifer systems in the world. It supports a $20 billion economy, but groundwater use is unsustainable over much of the aquifer. Emerging cloud computing tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE) make it possible to use the full Landsat record to monitor regional systems like the HPA with high spatial and temporal resolution over multiple decades. However, challenges remain to develop irrigation classification methods that are robust to a wide range of climate conditions and crop types, evolving management, and missing data. Here, we addressed these challenges to produce an annual, moderately high resolution (30 m) irrigation map time series from 1984 to 2017 over the aquifer. Leveraging GEE's extensive data catalog, we combined Landsat imagery, environmental covariables, and a large heterogeneous ground truth dataset to create a single random forest classifier applied annually to the entire region. Following classification, we applied the Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover (BULC) algorithm to fill imagery gaps and reduce commission errors in the provisional irrigation time series. Novel neighborhood greenness indices contributed to an overall 91.4% map accuracy across years; county statistics (r(2) = 0.86) were similarly well-matched. Trend analysis of irrigated area through time identified regions of stable, expanding, and declining irrigated area. Given declining aquifer storage, we estimate that up to 24% of currently irrigated area may be lost this century. To date, the map dataset is the longest, highest resolution large-scale record of where and when irrigation occurs. It is freely available for stakeholders, managers, and researchers to inform policies and management decisions, as well as for use in hydrology, agronomy, and climate models.

TI  - High-resolution DEM generation from spaceborne and terrestrial remote sensing data for improved volcano hazard assessment - A case study at Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanoes with rugged terrain remain a challenging target for generating high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), especially in tropical areas with frequent cloud cover. Using Nevado del Ruiz volcano as an example, we combined DEMs from the TanDEM-X (TDX) satellite mission, terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI), and Structure from Motion (SfM), to generate a new DEM with 10-m spatial resolution. This is the first study combining satellite radar, ground-based radar, photography, and freely available global DEMs to generate a high-resolution DEM without data gaps. TDX data from ascending and descending orbits were combined to generate the base DEM. Instead of using a raster format to fuse DEMs generated from different data sets with different resolutions, we developed a methodology based on 3-D point clouds: 1) re-georeference the 5-m TRI and similar to 1-m SfM DEMs to the 10-m TDX DEM using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to minimize the horizontal and vertical discrepancy between DEMs; then 2) merge the multiple point clouds to generate a final DEM without data gaps using an adaptive algorithm that uses two search distances to smooth the transition at the edges of different data sets. We assess the new 10-m DEM by comparing simulated inundation zones obtained with two volcano flow models, LaharZ (for lahars) and VolcFlow (for pyroclastic flows), and find significant differences with respect to the 30-m SRTM DEM. Our LaharZ simulation over the new DEM shows a longer lahar run-out distance. For pyroclastic flows, the VolcFlow simulation over the new DEM produces highly channelized flows over the steep portions of a river channel and gives a larger extent of thicker deposits compared to those obtained with the 30-m SRTM DEM. Quantitative and qualitative geomorphic analysis suggests that up-to-date DEMs with high spatial resolution (similar to 10 m or even better) need to be generated to improve volcano hazard assessment for active volcanoes.

TI  - Oil Palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) Mapping with Details: Smallholder versus Industrial Plantations and their Extent in Riau, Sumatra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm is rapidly expanding in Southeast Asia and represents one of the major drivers of deforestation in the region. This includes both industrial-scale and smallholder plantations, the management of which entails specific challenges, with either operational scale having its own particular social and environmental challenges. Although, past studies addressed the mapping of oil palm with remote sensing data, none of these studies considered the discrimination between industrial and smallholder plantations and, furthermore, between young and mature oil palm stands. This study assesses the feasibility of mapping oil palm plantations, by typology (industrial versus smallholder) and age (young versus mature), in the largest palm oil producing region of Indonesia (Riau province). The impact of using optical images (Sentinel-2) and radar scenes (Sentinel-1) in a Random Forest classification model was investigated. The classification model was implemented in a cloud computing system to map the oil palm plantations of Riau province. Our results show that the mapping of oil palm plantations by typology and age requires a set of optimal features, derived from optical and radar data, to obtain the best model performance (OA = 90.2% and kappa = 87.2%). These features are texture images that capture contextual information, such as the dense harvesting trail network in industrial plantations. The study also shows that the mapping of mature oil palm trees, without distinction between smallholder and industrial plantations, can be done with high accuracy using only Sentinel-1 data (OA = 93.5% and kappa = 86.9%) because of the characteristic backscatter response of palm-like trees in radar scenes. This means that researchers, certification bodies, and stakeholders can adequately detect mature oil palm stands over large regions without training complex classification models and with Sentinel-1 features as the only predictive variables. The results over Riau province show that smallholders represent 49.9% of total oil palm plantations, which is higher than reported in previous studies. This study is an important step towards a global map of oil palm plantations at different production scales and stand ages that can frequently be updated. Resulting insights would facilitate a more informed debate about optimizing land use for meeting global vegetable oil demands from oil palm and other oil crops.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Validation for Spatial Variability Assessment in Overhead Trellis System Viticulture Versus UAV and Agronomic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several remote sensing technologies have been tested in precision viticulture to characterize vineyard spatial variability, from traditional aircraft and satellite platforms to recent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Imagery processing is still a challenge due to the traditional row-based architecture, where the inter-row soil provides a high to full presence of mixed pixels. In this case, UAV images combined with filtering techniques represent the solution to analyze pure canopy pixels and were used to benchmark the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 (S2) performance in overhead training systems. At harvest time, UAV filtered and unfiltered images and ground sampling data were used to validate the correlation between the S2 normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) with vegetative and productive parameters in two vineyards (V1 and V2). Regarding the UAV vs. S2 NDVI comparison, in both vineyards, satellite data showed a high correlation both with UAV unfiltered and filtered images (V1 R-2 = 0.80 and V2 R-2 = 0.60 mean values). Ground data and remote sensing platform NDVIs correlation were strong for yield and biomass in both vineyards (R-2 from 0.60 to 0.95). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of spatial resolution provided by S2 on overhead trellis system viticulture, promoting precision viticulture also within areas that are currently managed without the support of innovative technologies.

TI  - Leveraging the Openness and Modularity of RISC-V in Space
T2  - JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a roadmap to address present and future needs in space systems with RISC-V processors. RISC-V is an open and modular instruction set architecture, which is rapidly growing in popularity in terrestrial applications. To satisfy different applications with contrasting requirements in satellite data systems, four different types of processors are identified: 1) low-area/low-power microcontrollers, 2) on-board computers, 3) general-purpose processors for payloads, and 4) enhanced payload processors for artificial intelligence. Several solutions based on RISC-V are proposed for each of these types of processors and compared with proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf and space grade solutions. An extensive analysis of the results available from literature is conducted to show that RISC-V has the potential to solve such a wide range of needs. This paper will also show the unprecedented number of open-source implementations and models that were developed in a relative short time on a single instruction set architecture. Future space systems could benefit from many of those developments, and this work identifies and highlights what is still missing to satisfy the specific needs of processors for space, especially in terms of fault tolerance and technology readiness level.

TI  - Analysis of GII.P7 and GII.6 noroviruses circulating in Italy during 2011-2016 reveals a replacement of lineages and complex recombination history
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Noroviruses are important human enteric pathogens and monitoring their genetic diversity is important for epidemiological surveillance, vaccine development, and understanding of RNA viruses evolution. Epidemiological investigations have revealed that genogroup II, genotype 6 noroviruses (GII.6) are common agents of gastroenteritis. Upon sequencing of the ORF2 (encoding the viral capsid), GII.6 viruses have been distinguished into three variants. Sentinel hospital-based surveillance in Italy revealed that GII.6 noroviruses were the second most common capsid genotype in 2015, mostly in association with a GII.P7 ORF1 (encoding the viral polymerase). Upon molecular characterization of the ORF1 and ORF2, the GII.P7_GII.6 epidemic viruses circulating in 2014-2015 (variant GII.6b) were different from those that circulated sporadically in 2011-2013 (variant GII.6a). Analysis of the ORF1 (GII.P7) and ORF2 (GII.6) sequences available in the databases unveiled marked genetic diversity and peculiarities in the phylogenetic segregation patterns, suggesting multiple recombination events. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that recent GII.P7_GII.6b viruses were circulating as early as 2008, and formed a genetically homogenous group that emerged globally.

TI  - Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer by Gene Expression and Clinicopathological Models: Development and Validation within a Population-Based Cohort
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: More than 70% of patients with breast cancer present with node-negative disease, yet all undergo surgical axillary staging. We aimed to define predictors of nodal metastasis using clinicopathological characteristics (CLINICAL), gene expression data (GEX), and mixed features (MIXED) and to identify patients at low risk of metastasis who might be spared sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Experimental Design: Breast tumors (n = 3,023) from the population-based Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network-Breast initiative were profiled by RNA sequencing and linked to clinicopathologic characteristics. Seven machine-learning models present the discriminative ability of N0/N+ in development (n = 2,278) and independent validation cohorts (n = 745) stratified as ER(+)HER2(-), HER2(+), and TNBC. Possible SLNB reduction rates are proposed by applying CLINICAL and MIXED predictors.Results: In the validation cohort, the MIXED predictor showed the highest area under ROC curves to assess nodal metastasis; AUC = 0.72. For the subgroups, the AUCs for MIXED, CLINICAL, and GEX predictors ranged from 0.66 to 0.72, 0.65 to 0.73, and 0.58 to 0.67, respectively. Enriched proliferation metagene and luminal B features were noticed in node-positive ER(+)HER2(-) and HER2(+) tumors, while upregulated basal-like features were observed in node-negative TNBC tumors. The SLNB reduction rates in patients with ER(+)HER2(-) tumors were 6% to 7% higher for the MIXED predictor compared with the CLINICAL predictor accepting false negative rates of 5% to 10%.Conclusions: Although CLINICAL and MIXED predictors of nodal metastasis had comparable accuracy, the MIXED predictor identified more node-negative patients. This translational approach holds promise for development of classifiers to reduce the rates of SLNB for patients at low risk of nodal involvement.

TI  - Improved correction of seasonal tropospheric delay in InSAR observations for landslide deformation monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) provides an effective tool to study slow-moving landslides. However, InSAR observations are often contaminated by tropospheric artefacts due to spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric refractivity. Particularly, the topography-dependent stratified delays may introduce seasonal oscillation biases into InSAR-measured deformation time series under steep terrains, which cannot be removed by conventional spatial and temporal filtering. In this study we proposed two complementary approaches to correct the stratified tropospheric delays for time series InSAR analysis when studying single landslides. One is the Iterative Linear Model (ILM) as an improved version of the traditional Linear Model (LM). The other is to fuse tropospheric delays predicted by several global weather models (FDWM) with different temporal intervals and spatial resolutions. Both methods are integrated into the standard Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) time series analysis procedure. We evaluated the proposed methods in three landslide-prone areas in southwest China using Sentinel-1 datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that the ILM method removed the seasonal stratified delays mixed in deformation time series, unaffected by the deforming points. The FDWM method achieved an optimal combination of tropospheric delay predictions by four weather models, i.e. ERA-Interim, ERAS, HRES ECMWF, and MERRA-2. Validations using in-situ GPS measurements suggested that the original Root Mean Squared (RMS) values of interferometric phases declined by more than 35% after both ILM and FDWM corrections. The ILM had better performances than the FDWM to correct stratified delay for single landslides, whereas the FDWM can be an effective alternative when the ILM is inapplicable in case of limited coherent points.

AB  - Coral reefs are crucial for the maintenance of the marine ecological environment and for the sustainability of local societies and economies. The use of remote sensing methods with the support of field data has been proposed for mapping coral reef habitats and bathymetry. However, the geomorphology of coral reefs over substantial areas is poorly documented, because of the absence of field data, especially in disputed areas where in situ investigation is difficult. In this study, we developed a simple method for mapping the inundation frequency (within the penetration range of optical remote sensing) of coral reefs using time-series Landsat-8 OLI images. The method uses the reef-water reflectance contrast (which varies with bathymetry, bands, and water level) in time-series optical multi -band images in order to derive the inundation frequency and geomorphic zonation of coral reefs. The method was applied to the Spratly Islands-the largest coral reef system in the South China Sea (SCS) using more than 1,100 Landsat-8 OLI images. We established an inventory which comprises 137 reefs/sandbanks/islands, including their spatial extent, inundation frequency, and geomorphic zonation. We also interestingly found that the inundation frequency of reef flats around reclaimed areas has decreased since island construction, which probably reflects the influence of anthropogenic activity on the coral reef ecosystem. Our approach was validated by a study of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which demonstrated that the inundation frequency of coral reefs can serve as an indirect representation of their bathymetry.

TI  - An evidence-based approach to positive sentinel node disease: should we ever do a completion node dissection?
T2  - MELANOMA MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Management of later stage melanoma has undergone significant changes. Sentinel node biopsy has long been an accepted method of staging, but two recent randomized-controlled trials have provided an evidence base for decision making about completion lymphadenectomy. They showed no survival advantage in further surgery for patients with positive sentinel node biopsies. There is now no evidence to support completion lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients, and this is reflected in international practice guidelines.

TI  - Glacier change in the Tanggula Mountains, Tibetan Plateau, in 1969-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve our knowledge of glacier change in the Tanggula Mountains located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, we delineated outlines of the glaciers in 1991 and 2015 using Landsat TM/OLI images and compared them with the reported glacier data in the First Chinese Glacier Inventory in 1969 and the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory in 2007. These comparisons showed that the glacier area and ice volume decreased by 524.8 km(2) and 37 km(3), respectively. The majority of the glacier area loss was concentrated in the area class of 1-5 km(2), between 5300 m and 5500 m in elevation, on north and east facing slopes and in the Dam Qu River basin. These glacier changes exhibited spatial and temporal differences. The glacier retreat rate gradually increased from 1969 to 2015, and the rate in the east was higher than that in the west. From 1969 to 2015, the warming rate in the Tanggula Mountains was 0.38 degrees C/10a, while the annual precipitation only increased by 0.4%. The slight increase in the amount of precipitation made a limited contribution to glacier change, while the change in temperature led to noticeable shrinkage of the glaciers. Contrary to the retreat or stagnation of most glaciers in the study area, there were 10 glaciers that experienced clear advance in 1986-2015 with noticeable increases in both area and length. Whether or not these 10 glaciers are surge glaciers requires further study.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of land-use zoning for the protection of built heritage in the Bagan Archaeological Zone, Myanmar-A satellite remote-sensing approach
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the effectiveness of land-use zoning for heritage protection in the Bagan Archaeological Zone, Myanmar. Sagan is one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world for Buddhist built heritage, and was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2019. Beginning in the 9th or 10th centuries some 2500 religious monuments were built within the 60 square kilometre area of Bagan, a centre of kingship, Buddhist learning, and monasticism. Following a devastating earthquake in 1975 Burmese and international attention began to be paid to the reconstruction and conservation of the monuments at Bagan, but with mixed success. In this paper, publicly available satellite data is analysed to evaluate one of the important, but hitherto un-evaluated, elements of the local conservation regime - land-use zoning to restrict urban development. By measuring the expansion of urban areas within the Began Archaeological Zone from 1987 to 2018, in comparison with control settlements beyond the archaeological area, we conclude that a restrictive zoning regime has controlled urban sprawl, and aided the conservation of the setting of Buddhist monuments.

TI  - Age and Lymphovascular Invasion Accurately Predict Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in T2 Melanoma Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 72nd Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society-of-Surgical-Oncology (SSO)
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Background. The risk of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in melanoma is related directly to tumor thickness and inversely to age. The authors hypothesized that for T2 (thickness 1.1-2.0 mm) melanoma, age, and other factors may be able to identify a cohort of patients with a low risk of SLN metastases.Methods. The authors developed logistic regression models to predict positive SLNs in patients undergoing SLN biopsy for T2 melanoma using the National Cancer Database. Classification and regression-tree analysis were used to identify groups of patients with high and low risk for SLN metastases. The prediction model then was applied to a separate data set from a multicenter randomized clinical trial.Results. The study identified 12,918 patients with T2 melanoma undergoing SLN biopsy with clinically node-negative melanoma. In the multivariable analysis, increasing thickness, younger age, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), mitotic rate of 1/mm(2) or more, axial location, and Clark level of 4 or 5 were independent risk factors for SLN metastases. A cohort based on age (> 56 years) and no LVI was identified with a relatively low risk (7.8%; 95% confidence interval 7.2-8.4%) of SLN metastases. The independent data set of 1531 patients with T2 melanoma confirmed these findings. Among elderly patients (age > 75 years) with melanoma 1.2 mm or smaller and no LVI, the risk of a positive SLN was 4.9% (95% confidence interval 3.3-7.1%).Conclusions. Younger age and LVI are powerful predictors of SLN metastases for patients with T2 melanoma. This prediction model can inform shared decision-making regarding whether to perform SLN biopsy for older patients with otherwise low-risk T2 melanoma.

TI  - Sedimentation mapping in shallow shoreline of arid environments using active remote sensing data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of remote sensing in monitoring land cover features are an essential tool of natural resources management schemes. The sedimentation mapping of shallow shorelines is insufficient using passive remote sensing images because of the image corrections and weather implications that need to be considered, while active remote sensing data can overcome the difficulties of the weather interference and reach to more reliable results. The current research work took place in the shoreline on Umluj city, west of Saudi Arabia, representing one of the most sensitive wetland habitats within the country. Sentinel-1 images were downloaded and analyzed to delineate the sedimentation process from the European Space Agency. The archive image was acquired in August 2018, while the crisis emerged was acquired in March 2019 after an unusual rainfall event that took place in the vicinity of the study area. Remote sensing techniques of sedimentation mapping end change detection were implemented in the study area to estimate the sedimentation process and its influences on the wetlands. The wetland habitats were decreased by nearly 87% throughout the period of flash floods between November 2018 and March 2019. Meanwhile, sediment deposits along the shoreline of the study area increased by nearly 171%. Therefore, monitoring of the shorelines sedimentation and the wetland habitats using temporal remote sensing data are decision-making priorities to conserve the natural resources within similar arid environments.

TI  - Analysis of the severe drought in Ireland in 2018
T2  - WEATHER
M3  - Article
AB  - The summer of 2018 brought a significant meteorological drought to Ireland, with the 25(th) of June marking the first official day of drought after a cold winter/spring. Meteorological data recorded at Met eireann's (the Irish Meteorological Service) network of stations were used to calculate the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Percent of Normal Index (PNI) and the Soil Moisture Deficit (SMD). In addition, MODIS remote sensing data from NASA's TERRA satellite was used to compute the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The progress of the drought in 2018 has been shown by applying an ordinary kriging interpolation to meteorological observations to estimate the national coverage of drought indices at a monthly scale. According to the 2018 SMD analysis, parts of Ireland recorded their worst drought event on record when compared to the long-term average period of 1981-2010. The SPI and PNI illustrate that whilst the months of January and April were very wet, all subsequent months until September had low rainfall amounts. The SMD indicates drier values during May and June, reaching a maximum value of 94.3 mm on the 14(th) of July. The greatest difference between EVI in 2018 and the average EVI over a long-term period (2001-2017) occurred during the months of May and June in the south and east of the country. This analysis of climatological conditions across the country shows that whilst drought may occasionally occur on a national scale in Ireland, the impacts vary locally.

TI  - Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate pollution, sleep disturbance and their interaction effects on suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a lack of literature about the joint effects of PM2.5 exposure and sleep disturbance on suicide attempts. This study aimed to estimate the association of PM2.5 exposure or sleep disturbance with suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents and to test their interaction effects on both additive and multiplicative scales.Methods: Data was drawn from a subsample of the School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey (SCAHS) during 2014-2015 in Guangdong province, including 21,780 eligible participants. The 3-year (2011-2013) annual average concentration of PM2.5 was estimated using satellite data. Multi-level logistic regression models with weights were fitted, and both multiplicative and additive interactions for PM2.5 and sleep disturbance were tested.Results: A total of 608 students (2.8%) reported having suicide attempts. After adjusting for significant demographics and depressive symptoms, PM2.5 exposure (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.25, 95% CI=1.03-1.56) and sleep disturbance (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI=1.41-2.02) were positively associated with suicide attempts, respectively. The adjusted additive interaction effect of PM2.5 and sleep disturbance was 2.42 (95% CI=1.80-3.26) with a synergistic index of 1.31. The multivariable multi-level logistic regression models did not find any significant multiplicative interaction item (P>0.05). Limitation: The school-based cross-sectional study designConclusion: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 may elevate the risks of suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents. Moreover, the significant interaction effects of PM2.5 exposure and sleep disturbance on suicide attempts were found in the additive model, suggesting decreasing long-term exposure to a higher level of PM2.5 may be helpful to reduce the risk of suicide attempts among adolescents with sleep disturbance.

TI  - Improving Impervious Surface Estimation by Using Remote Sensed Imagery Combined With Open Street Map Points-of-Interest (POI) Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key indicator of urban environments, the accurate mapping of impervious surface is essential. With the availability of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery, such as Sentinel-2, it is feasible to produce fine-scale impervious surface maps. For mapping high-resolution impervious surfaces, object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification method demonstrated its efficiency and accuracy by combining spectral information and spatial information. Although with some success, impervious surface estimation remains challenging because different land cover types share similar spectral information. With the emergence of affordable GPS-enabled devices (such as a smartphone) and web 2.0 development, more and more people are getting involved in sharing their locations with others or posting on the Internet. These volunteered geographical information (VGI) data provide a brand-new prospect for mapping urban impervious surfaces. This research proposes an optimized method for impervious surface mapping based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and open street map (OSM) points-of-interest (POI) data. The proposed method was tested in Milwaukee county, US, and the results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed OBIA increases from 82.57 to 87.02 compared with the conventional OBIA. Thus, this study provides an effective means of combining OBIA and the relatively new VGI POIs data to extract impervious surface with higher spatial resolution.

TI  - Validation of global moderate resolution leaf area index (LAI) products over croplands in northeastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, a series of global moderate resolution leaf area index (LAI) products have become available and been widely applied in many disciplines. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for the uncertainties associated with these products, which has to be determined through rigorous validation studies. This study validated seven global LAI products - EPS, GEOV2, GLASS, GLOBMAP, MODIS, PROBA-V, and VIIRS - over typical agricultural croplands in northeastern China. Seasonal continuous LAI measurements were obtained from field campaigns in paddy rice fields in 2012 and 2013, and in maize, soybean, and sorghum fields in 2016. High resolution reference LAI maps were first derived from HJ-1, Landsat 7, and Sentinel-2A images with the look-up table (LUT) inversion method and were evaluated with the field measured LAI (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.66). Subsequently, the moderate resolution LAI products were validated with the upscaled high resolution reference LAI.All LAI products show typical seasonal variation patterns of agricultural crops, but distinct differences exist among the products. The product quality indicators show large deviations during the peak growing season, whereas the relative uncertainties are higher during the green-up and senescent phases. Both EPS and GLASS show some saturation effects at LAI similar to 4.0 and underestimate the reference LAI (> 0.5), whereas GLOBMAP shows the largest overestimation (bias = 0.96). GEOV2 and PROBA-V significantly overestimate the LAI for all crops. In contrast, MODIS and VIIRS underestimate and show high variations (RMSE >1.50, RRMSE >47%) compared with the reference LAI. In general, the global moderate resolution LAI products show moderate agreement with the reference LAI (RMSE: 0.80-2.0 and RRMSE: 25-60%). The product uncertainties are higher over paddy rice fields than those over the other crop fields. The uncertainties are mainly attributed to the lack of regional tuning of the global algorithms for agricultural crops at different growth stages. Further algorithm improvement and validation studies are necessary to improve the global LAI products for regional applications.

TI  - Impacts of the decreased freeze-up period on primary production in Qinghai Lake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although previous research has focused on the inundation changes in Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China, few studies have investigated the variations in primary production and correlated these changes with environmental transitions. In this study, this knowledge gap was filled using multiple ocean color satellite missions between 2003 and 2017. The results indicated a substantial increase in phytoplankton growth over recent years, during which the normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) and algal bloom index (ABI) increased by approximately 45% and 61%, respectively, from the first (2003-2012) to the second period (2013-2017). Such a remarkable increase is likely associated with a rapid decrease in the duration of the freeze-up period, for which the 2014-2017 mean was > 2 standard deviations below that of the previous years. High temperatures and a large number of sunshine hours could possibly explain the elevated nFLH and ABI in 2013. A multiple general linear model revealed that the freeze-up period, number of sunshine hours, and temperature explained 76.1%, 5.6%, and 10.2%, respectively, of the long-term changes in primary production in Qinghai Lake during the observed period. This study not only provides the first comprehensive analysis of the biogeochemical properties of Qinghai Lake but also demonstrates the capability of multiple remote sensing products in addressing environmental problems. Further, the method here is easily extendable to similar water bodies worldwide to study their potential responses to climate variability.

The characterisation of the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of these vegetation masses was carried out through the analysis of biweekly NDVI time series from MODIS over a 16-year period (2000-2015). The NDVI provides information regarding the status of vegetative cover. Different indicators of seasonal dynamics were obtained through the NDVI time series, such as: annual mean (NDVI-I), relative range (RREL), maximum and minimum values (MAX and MIN), and months of MAX and MIN (MMAX and MMIN), which were evaluated as indicators of the seasonal variation of the vegetation and of its response to variations in the rainfall and flooding regimes of the marshland. Results showed a strong dependence on the flooding processes of the marshland, requiring a minimum rainfall threshold (350 mm/year) for proper development. Furthermore, a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.70; p < 0.05) was found between the seasonal nature of the vegetation masses, measured using RREL, and the accumulated rainfall during the flooding period of the marshland. Slightly weaker relationships between rainfall and other indicators such as the minimum and maximum annual NDVI (R-2 = 0.61 and R-2 = 0.43; p < 0.05, respectively) were also found.

TI  - Satellite AOD conversion into ground PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1</sub> over the Po valley (Milan, Italy) exploiting information on aerosol vertical profiles, chemistry, hygroscopicity and meteorology
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are fundamental for air quality monitoring. Despite this, several algorithms are present in literature leaving to the reader a choice on the best approach without considering the physical - spatial - temporal inconsistencies concerning the problem of relating satellite with ground-based data. In order to overcome this dilemma, the present work was carried out developing a general methodological approach to overcome the aforementioned inconsistencies obtaining in any region the best retrieval. In this respect, the particulate matter phenomenology (both at ground and vertically) was considered in order to select the best approach for the AOD to PM conversion starting from the knowledge of PM properties, meteorology and vertical behaviour.In this respect, multiple years of particulate matter vertical profiles, chemical composition, hygroscopicity, meteorology and optical properties were used to define an optimized satellite AOD-ground PM relationship. A hybrid algorithm (physically based and statistical) was developed to be applied over the Milan conurbation (Po Valley) to determine ground-level PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. The developed algorithm (based on aerosol optical depth, mixing height, wind speed and PM concentrations of the previous day) showed high accuracy enabling to predict ground particulate matter concentrations with very low RMSE in prediction (5.48 mu g/m(3), 9.89 mu g/m(3) and 10.64 mu g/m(3) for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) and rather high R-2 (>= 0.83 on the evaluation set of data).

TI  - Productivity and water demand of maize estimated by the modified satellite priestley-taylor algorithm
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water demand of crops, as well as the relation of this variable to productivity and other important factors related to the sustainable management of agriculture, makes it relevant to estimate parameters that help in the most assertive and efficient decision-making in the agricultural environment. In this context, the work aims to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa), biomass (Bio), water productivity (WP) and crop productivity (P), using the Landsat-8 satellite, through the Modified Satellite Priestley-Taylor Algorithm (MS-PT). For this, ETa was estimated for maize culture irrigated by central pivots, using the MS-PT with six images of Landsat-8, which were free of clouds. The ETa estimate was accurate in the first 60 days after emergence (DAE) of the crop. Subsequently, the variables Bio, P, and WP were estimated using the ETa and the assumptions of the Monteith (1972) model. Therefore, we sequentially calculated the dry biomass, crop productivity and water productivity. ETa presented a high correlation with Bio from the second image (06/10/2015), due to the canopy closure of the crop and, consequently, the predominance of transpiration in the evapotranspiration phenomenon. The water productivity was constant throughout the maximum vegetative stage until the reproductive phase R4 of the crop, verifying in this interval the best efficiency in the conversion of water in biomass. From the obtained results, it is verified that the set of algorithms used in the estimation of the parameters demonstrated the potential to increase the capacity to handle agriculture in a more efficient, assertive and sustainable way.

TI  - Climatic Drivers of Greening Trends in the Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1980s, vegetated lands have experienced widespread greening at the global scale. Numerous studies have focused on spatial patterns and mechanisms of this phenomenon, especially in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Greening trends in the European Alps have received less attention, although this region has experienced strong climate and land-use changes during recent decades. We studied the rates and spatial patterns of greening in an inner-alpine region of the Western Alps. We used MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 8-day temporal and 250 m spatial resolution, for the period 2000-2018, and removed areas with disturbances in order to consider the trends of undisturbed vegetation. The objectives of this study were to (i) quantify trends of greening in a representative area of the Western Alps; and (ii) examine mechanisms and causes of spatial patterns of greening across different plant types. We show that 63% of vegetated areas experienced significant trends during the 2000-2018 period, of which only 8% were negative. We identify (i) a climatic control on spring and autumn phenology with contrasting effects depending on plant type and elevation, and (ii) land-use change dynamics, such as shrub encroachment on abandoned pastures and colonization of new surfaces at high elevation. Below 1500 m, warming temperatures promote incremental greening in the transition from spring to summer, but not in fall, suggesting either photoperiod or water limitation. In the alpine and sub-alpine belts (>1800 m asl), snow prevents vegetation development until late spring, despite favorable temperatures. Instead, at high elevation greening acts both in summer and autumn. However, photoperiod limitation likely prevents forested ecosystems from fully exploiting warmer autumn conditions. We furthermore illustrate two emblematic cases of prominent greening: recent colonization of previously glaciated/non vegetated areas, as well as shrub/tree encroachment due to the abandonment of agricultural practices. Our results demonstrate the interplay of climate and land-use change in controlling greening dynamics in the Western Alps.

T2  - VIGILANCIA SANITARIA EM DEBATE-SOCIEDADE CIENCIA & TECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay aims to discuss the challenges and perspectives posed for the post-marketing surveillance in Brazil. Based on a non-systematic literature review, some challenges are pointed out, such as: 1) the need to review the post-marketing/use risk management model; 2) the strengthening of work in the Sentinel Network; 3) the systemic analysis of notifications and integration between the information systems and 4) the effective implementation of the product traceability system. Only a few challenges have been brought into the debate, knowing that many others exist for the expansion and improvement of the post-marketing surveillance, considering the dynamics and globalization of the relations of production and consumption in the risk society.

TI  - Breast cancer and outpatient surgery: State of play of the activity and assessment of patient satisfaction
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. - The objective of this study was to evaluate an outpatient breast cancer surgery activity in our center and to collect the satisfaction of patient having benefited.Method. - Descriptive and retrospective study about patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer scheduled on ambulatory between March 2015 and March 2017. Patients' satisfaction was collected retrospectively by a questionnaire.Results. - Six hundred and thirty-nine breast cancer surgeries were performed during the study period, of which 56.2% were scheduled for outpatient surgery: 33 axillary procedures (9.2%), 289 conservative surgeries (80.5%) and 37 radical surgeries (10.3%). Forty-nine patients initially managed on ambulatory had to be hospitalized on conventional service, representing a conversion rate of 13.6%. The main reason was the establishment of drainage (30.6%). The complication rate was 0.6% with 2 patients rehospitalized for hematoma requiring surgical revision. Of the 359 patients treated on ambulatory, 61% responded to the satisfaction questionnaire. Overall satisfaction was 96.3%. In addition, 68.3% of patients said they had seen a real benefit in this mode of care. After returning home, 59,8% of patients reported feeling no or low pain.Conclusion. - Outpatient management seems to be both safe and satisfying for breast cancer surgery. A better organization of patient going home is in progress in order to reduce rate of conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landfast ice controls on sea-ice production in the Cape Darnley Polynya: A case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic coastal polynyas serve as crucially-important sea-ice "factories" and are (in certain cases) of global significance as sites of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation e.g., the Cape Darnley Polynya (CDP) in East Antarctica. As such, understanding change and variability in their behaviour, and the factors responsible, is a high priority in climate (change) science. One such important factor that is both poorly understood and quantified is their linkage with adjacent landfast sea ice (fast ice). Here, we present a first detailed analysis that identifies and quantifies key linkages between the dynamics/behaviour of the CDP and fast ice. By forming a barrier to the incursion of pack ice at the eastern boundary, fast ice immediately upstream of the CDP (associated with the distribution of grounded icebergs) plays a crucially-important role in the polynya formation, maintenance and variability. This satellite data-based study builds upon earlier conceptual work on polynya-fast ice feedback mechanisms in the Mertz Glacier region by showing that statistical estimation of the rates of sea ice production (and hence AABW formation) in the CDP is significantly improved through inclusion of two key fast-ice metrics, compared to use of atmospheric covariates alone. These two metrics are the meridional extent of fast ice upstream of the polynya and total fast ice area within the region of high sea ice production. The work highlights the importance of accurate representation of the coupled Antarctic coastal polynya-fast ice system in global climate models.

TI  - Observed HIRS and MODIS High-Cloud Frequencies in the 2000s
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper compares the cloud parameter data records derived from High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements from the years 2003 through 2013. Cloud-top pressure (CTP) and effective emissivity (epsilon f; cloud emissivity multiplied by cloud fraction) are derived using the 15-mu m spectral bands in the CO2 absorption band and implementing the CO2-slicing technique; the approach is robust for high semitransparent clouds but weak for low clouds with little thermal contrast from clear-sky radiances. The high-cloud (HiCld; with CTP less than 440 hPa) seasonal cycles of HIRS and MODIS observations are found to be in sync, but the HIRS frequency of detection is about 10% higher than that of MODIS (which is attributed to a lower threshold for cloud detection in the HIRS CO2 bands). Differences are largest during nighttime and at the beginning of the time series (2003-06). Both show Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) seasonal HiClds are out of phase and both agree within 2% on NH-SH HiCld differences. During the summer, maximum HiCld frequency averages 5% more in the NH.

TI  - Long-Term Deceleration of Glaciers in the Eastern Nyainqentanglha Mountains, Southeastern Tibetan Plateau, Revealed from Landsat Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate glaciers are very sensitive to variations in temperature and precipitation, and thus represent a good indicator of climate change. By exploiting complete Landsat archives during periods of 1988-1990, 2000-2002 and 2014-2016, we derived three velocity maps of the temperate glaciers on the eastern Nyainqentanglha Mountains in southeastern Tibetan to reveal the long-term changes of glacier surface velocity. Our results show that all the investigated glaciers experienced deceleration, with rates of deceleration varying from 4.15% to 29.8% per decade during the period from 1988-1990 to 2014-2016, showing heterogeneous deceleration patterns. A significant rise in temperature and an insignificant decrease in precipitation was found from the meteorological data of the nearby meteorological station. The region-wide deceleration of glaciers was, thus, attributed to the negative mass balance induced mainly by the rise in temperature. The averaged rates of deceleration for periods from 1988-1990 to 2000-2002 and from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016 are 20.97% and 22.02% per decade, respectively, indicating a nearly even speed of deceleration in velocities during study periods. The nearly even speed of deceleration in velocities and the accelerating mass loss trend from periods before the 2000s to after the 2000s highlighted the complexity of the relationship between mass balance and glacier velocity.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A woman in her early 60s noticed bilateral breast masses and visited a different hospital. Core needle biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the right breast and invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. After referral to our department, PET-CT was performed. Compared with mild fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in left breast cancer(BC), highly accumulated lesions were found on the right breast, left anterior chest wall, nasopharynx, and tonsil. The right breast lesion was the largest with a diameter of 30mm and was considered the primary lesion of malignant lymphoma(ML). The ML was classified as stage Ⅳ, pathologically proven with erythema of the left breast and nasopharynx. Three courses of R-CHOP were performed. However, due to suspicion of heart failure, chemotherapy was changed to R-CEOP(non-anthracycline-containing regimen)and 3 courses were additionally performed. The therapeutic effect of R-Chemo for ML was CR. Left BC showed a tendency of shrinkage. After intrathecal administration of anticancer drugs to prevent infiltration of ML into the central nervous system and preoperative endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitor, left lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. BC was classified as clinical stage ⅠA and had an estrogen receptor score of 3b. Postoperative whole breast radiotherapy was completed, and the planned internal use of exemestane was more than 5 years. With multidisciplinary therapy, 3.5 years had passed since the initial treatment without recurrence.

TI  - THE NATIONAL-CULTURAL VALUES OF THE TATARS IN PAREMIES WITH LEXEMAS "OY/YORT" (HOUSE)
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - At the present stage of the development of linguistics, many works are concerned with the issues of linguistic research in close connection with ethnic consciousness, ethnic psychology, and ethnic culture. Of particular interest is the paremiological resource of language units, since paremias store information about material and spiritual culture, the worldview of native speakers and allow for reconstructing the most important stereotypes of national consciousness. This article deals with the study of the language representation of the lexemes" / " (house) in Tatar paremiology. The lexico-semantic analysis of words and connected combinations is accompanied in this paper by cultural and ethnological excursions into the field of material and spiritual culture, ritual practice, customs, etc., i.e. a linguistic sign is considered in the context of other semiotic systems. The idea of semantic unity of the culture of the Tatar people was laid down in attracting linguistic, folklore, ethnographic materials, while the analysis of the text remains primarily linguistic. We conclude that.. (house) in the Tatar linguistic culture among other concepts of the material world occupies a special place. This lexeme forms the core of the lexical group "house", and the Tatar people associate it not only with a place for living, but also with a family home, where parents, wife, husband, children, grandmother, grandfather and others are connected with warm family ties.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents an investigation of detection and monitoring of surface motions using Advanced Differential SAR Interferometry (A-DInSAR) with SBAS (Small Baseline Subset) and PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) techniques in the Germano iron mining complex region (Mariana, Brazil), after the collapse of the Fundao tailing dam occurred on November 5th, 2015. The research was carried out aiming to provide useful information about ground movement monitoring, planning and risk assessment in the area after the tragic event. The analysis was performed using 46 TerraSAR-X images and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) obtained by Pleiades data. A-DInSAR processing provided the removal of the atmospheric phase artifacts, baseline related errors, DEM height error estimation and finally the ground displacement determination. The results pointed out that with both techniques it was possible to assess the stability conditions of the Germano mining assets, particularly the main structures of the Germano dam and the detection of small settlements in the mining tailings storage, pointing out that these may be an important components for risk management of open pit mining operations, including tailings dams.

TI  - Spatial interpolation of marine environment data using P-MSN
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - When a marine study area is large, the environmental variables often present spatially stratified non-homogeneity, violating the spatial second-order stationary assumption. The stratified non-homogeneous surface can be divided into several stationary strata with different means or variances, but still with close relationships between neighboring strata. To give the best linear-unbiased estimator for those environmental variables, an interpolated version of the mean of the surface with stratified non-homogeneity (MSN) method called point mean of the surface with stratified non-homogeneity (P-MSN) was derived. P-MSN distinguishes the spatial mean and variogram in different strata and borrows information from neighboring strata to improve the interpolation precision near the strata boundary. This paper also introduces the implementation of this method, and its performance is demonstrated in two case studies, one using ocean color remote sensing data, and the other using marine environment monitoring data. The predictions of P-MSN were compared with ordinary kriging, stratified kriging, kriging with an external drift, and empirical Bayesian kriging, the most frequently used methods that can handle some extent of spatial non-homogeneity. The results illustrated that for spatially stratified non-homogeneous environmental variables, P-MSN outperforms other methods by simultaneously improving interpolation precision and avoiding artificially abrupt changes along the strata boundaries.

TI  - Accurate modelling of canopy traits from seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery based on the vertical distribution of leaf traits
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf traits at canopy level (hereinafter canopy traits) are conventionally expressed as a product of total canopy leaf area index (LAI) and leaf trait content based on samples collected from the exposed upper canopy. This traditional expression is centered on the theory that absorption of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) follow a bell-shaped function skewed to the upper canopy. However, the validity of this theory has remained untested for a suite of canopy traits in a temperate forest ecosystem across multiple seasons using multispectral imagery. In this study, we examined the effect of canopy traits expression in modelling canopy traits using Sentinel-2 multispectral data across the growing season in Bavaria Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. To achieve this, we measured leaf mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll (Cm,), nitrogen (N) and carbon content and LAI from the exposed upper and shaded lower canopy respectively over three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). Subsequently, we estimated canopy traits using two expressions, i.e. the traditional expression-based on the product of LAI and leaf traits content of samples collected from the sunlit upper canopy (hereinafter top-of-canopy expression) and the weighted expression - established on the proportion between the shaded lower and sunlit upper canopy LAI and their respective leaf traits content. Using a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we separately modelled canopy traits estimated from the two expressions using Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices. Our results showed that dry matter related canopy traits (LMA, N and carbon) estimated based on the weighted canopy expression yield stronger correlations and higher prediction accuracy (NRMSEcv < 0.19) compared to the top-of-canopy traits expression across all seasons. In contrast, canopy chlorophyll estimated from the top-of-canopy expression demonstrated strong fidelity with Sentinel-2 bands and vegetation indices (RMSE < 0.48 mu g/cm(2)) compared to weighted canopy chlorophyll (RMSE > 0.48 mu g/cm(2)) across all seasons. We also developed a generalized model that explained 52.57-67.82% variation in canopy traits across the three seasons. Using the most accurate Random Forest model for each season, we demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-2 data to map seasonal dynamics of canopy traits across the park. Results presented in this study revealed that canopy trait expression can have a profound effect on modelling the accuracy of canopy traits using satellite imagery throughout the growing seasons. These findings have implications on model accuracy when monitoring the dynamics of ecosystem functions, processes and services.

TI  - International mass gatherings and travel-associated illness: A GeoSentinel cross-sectional, observational study
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Travelers to international mass gatherings may be exposed to conditions which increase their risk of acquiring infectious diseases. Most existing data come from single clinical sites seeing returning travelers, or relate to single events.Methods: Investigators evaluated ill travelers returning from a mass gathering, and presenting to a GeoSentinel site between August 2015 and April 2019, and collected data on the nature of the event and the relation between final diagnoses and the mass gathering.Results: Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1-88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider.Conclusions: Despite this surveillance being limited to patients presenting to GeoSentinel sites, our findings highlight the importance of respiratory diseases at mass gatherings, the need for pre-travel consultations before mass gatherings, and consideration of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

TI  - Seasonal Crop Water Balance Using Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient water management in agriculture requires a precise estimate of evapotranspiration (ET). Although local measurements can be used to estimate surface energy balance components, these values cannot be extrapolated to large areas due to the heterogeneity and complexity of agriculture environment. This extrapolation can be done using satellite images that provide information in visible and thermal infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum; however, most current satellite sensors do not provide this end, but they do include a set of spectral bands that allow the radiometric behavior of vegetation that is highly correlated with the ET. In this context, our working hypothesis states that it is possible to generate a strategy of integration and harmonization of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) sensors in order to obtain an NDVI time series used to estimate ET through fit equations specific to each crop type during an agricultural season (December 2017-March 2018). Based on the obtained results it was concluded that it is possible to estimate ET using an NDVI time series by integrating data from both sensors L8 and S2, which allowed to carry out an updated seasonal water balance over study site, improving the irrigation water management both at plot and water distribution system scale.

TI  - Historical Trajectory in Vegetation Cover in Northeastern Namibia Based on AVHRR Satellite Imagery (1982-2015)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative impact of the reduction of vegetation cover is already being felt in the Zambezi Region in northeastern Namibia. The region has been undergoing various land cover changes in the past decades. To understand the historical trend of vegetation cover (increase or decrease), we analyzed 8-km resolution Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees (resampled to 8 km) resolution Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC). We used the Time Series Segmented Residual Trends (TSS-RESTREND) method. We found that the general trajectory of vegetation cover was negative. Pixel-wise analysis and visual interpretation of historical images both revealed clear signs of vegetation cover change. We observed a single breakpoint in the vegetation trajectory which correlated to the 1991-1992 drought in southern Central Africa. Potential drivers of land cover change are the (il)legal expansion of subsistence farming, population growth, and wood extraction. These findings will serve as a reference for decision makers and policymakers. To better understand the human-induced land cover change at the micro scale and sub-regional level, we recommend using higher resolution remote sensing datasets and historical documents to assess the effect of demographic change, disease, civil unrest, and war.

TI  - A Multi-Level Semantic Scene Interpretation Strategy for Change Interpretation in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed images represent an important source of information for monitoring land changes that may occur. There is, therefore, a need to analyze and interpret such information in order to extract useful semantic change interpretations. However, extracting such semantics from satellite images is a complex task that requires prior and contextual knowledge. In this paper, we focus on the issue of semantic scene interpretation for change interpretation. Consequently, a strategy for semantic remote-sensing imagery scene interpretation is proposed. This strategy is based on a representative framework that is structured around several levels of interpretation: the pixel level, the visual primitive level, the object level, the scene level, and the change interpretation level. Each level integrates a logical mechanism to extract useful knowledge for interpretation. The proposed model has been evaluated using two Landsat scene images acquired in 2000 [Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM)] and 2017 (Landsat 8) in order to check its relevance for semantic scene and change interpretation. Precision, recall, and F-measure metrics were used in order to show the capacity of the proposed methodology for semantic classification. A visual evaluation was also performed to evaluate the performance of the presented interpretation strategy, and the query results for each level show a promising capability for semantic object classification, spatial and temporal relations extraction, and change interpretation.

TI  - Deep solar radiation forecasting with convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network algorithms
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper designs a hybridized deep learning framework that integrates the Convolutional Neural Network for pattern recognition with the Long Short-Term Memory Network for half-hourly global solar radiation (GSR) forecasting. The Convolution network is applied to robustly extract data input features from predictive variables (i.e., statistically significant antecedent inputs) while Long Short-Term Memory absorbs them for prediction. Half-hourly GSR for Alice Springs (Australia: 01 January 2006 to 31 August 2018) are extracted with stationarity checks applied via unit-root and mutual information test to capture antecedent GSR values required to forecast future GSR. The proposed hybrid model is benchmarked with standalone models as well as other Deep Learning, Single Hidden Layer and Tree based models. The results show that the benchmarked models are not able to generate satisfactory GSR predictions and the proposed hybrid model outperforms all other counterparts. The hybrid model registers superior results with over 70% of predictive errors lying below +/- 10 Wm(-2) and outperforms the benchmark model for 1-Day half-hourly GSR prediction with low Relative Root Mean Square Error (approximate to 1.515%), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (approximate to 4.672%) and Absolute Percentage Bias (approximate to 1.233%). This study ascertains that a proposed hybrid model based on a convolution network framework can accurately predict GSR and enable energy availability to be regularly monitored over multi-step horizons when coupled with a low latency Long Short-Term Memory network. Furthermore, it also concludes that the proposed model can have practical implications in forecasting GSR, capitalizing its versatility as a stratagem in monitoring solar powered systems by integrating freely available solar radiation into a real power grid system.

TI  - Twenty years of satellite and <i>in situ</i> observations of surface chlorophyll-a from the northern Bay of Biscay to the eastern English Channel. Is the water quality improving?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of the phytoplankton biomass derived from daily chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) satellite images was investigated over the period 1998-2017 in the surface waters of the English Channel and the northern Bay of Biscay. Merged satellite (SeaWiFS-MODIS/Aqua-MERIS-VIIRS) Chl-a was calculated using the OC5 Ifremer algorithm which is optimized for moderately-turbid waters. The seasonal cycle in satellite-derived Chl-a was compared with in situ measurements made at seven coastal stations located in the southern side of the English Channel and in the northern Bay of Biscay. The results firstly showed that the satellite Chl-a product, derived from a suite of space-borne marine reflectance data, is in agreement with the coastal observations. For compliance with the directives of the European Union on water quality, time-series of 6-year moving average of Chl-a were assessed over the region. A clear decline was observed in the mean and 90th percentile of Chl-a at stations located in the mixed waters of the English Channel. The time-series at the stations located in the Bay of Biscay showed yearly fluctuations which correlated well with river discharge, but no overall Chl-a trend was observed. In the English Channel, the shape of the seasonal cycle in Chl-a changed over time. Narrower peaks were observed in spring at the end of the studied period, indicating an earlier limitation by nutrients. Monthly averages of satellite Chl-a, over the periods 1998-2003 and 2012-2017, exhibited spatial and temporal patterns in the evolution of the phytoplankton biomass similar to these observed at the seven coastal stations. Both the in situ and satellite Chl-a times-series showed a decrease in Chl-a in the English Channel in May, June and July. This trend in phytoplankton biomass is correlated with lower river discharges at the end of the period and a constant reduction in the riverine input of phosphorus through improvements in the water quality of the surrounding river catchments.

TI  - REPRESENTATION OF THE CONCEPT "SEASONS" IN THE POETRY BY N. M. YAZYKOV
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the analysis of the poetic works by N.M. Yazykov within the framework of cognitive linguistics. N. M. Yazykov is a poet of the epoch of romanticism, whose works remain insufficiently known. The verbalization of the concepts of the seasons in his works is investigated. In the process of investigation, the method of contextual analysis, the method of component analysis, the descriptive method, the method of interpretation of the literary text were used. The paper considers the use of lexemes , , / winter, spring, summer, autumn and the adjectives and adverbs derived from them, analyzes their compatibility. The presence of evaluative components in the structure of concepts has been established. Based on the frequency of use of these lexemes and the presence of emotional coloring, it has been concluded that the concepts "spring" and "winter" are especially important in N. M. Yazykov's works. By means of comparative analysis it has been established that the concepts "spring" and "winter" are perceived by the poet in accordance with the traditions of Russian linguistic culture, the perception of the concept "autumn" corresponds to the traditions only partially, the perception of the concept "summer" has an occasional character. The concepts "spring" and "winter" are personified and symbolized. The analysis of the concepts that are significative for Russian culture contributes to the study of N.M. Yazykov's linguistic worldview and Russian language world image.

AB  - The management of large areas such as the dehesa (a multifunctional agrosilvopastoral system), with approximately 3 million ha in the Iberian Peninsula, requires effective tools to help decision-making on different scales. This work focuses on the monitoring of pasture production using remote sensors. An adaptation of a Light Use Efficiency (LUE) model has been applied using meteorological data and satellite images on two scales: Regional scale - the dehesa area of Andalusia (Southern Spain) with data of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, MODO9Q1 product) during the hydrological years 2013/2104 and 2014/2015; on a field scale - after pasture improvements, using the earth observation satellites SENTINEL-2 during the hydrological years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017.The adaptation of the model proposed in this work pays special attention to: the spatial and temporal interpolation of meteorological variables; the presence of a tree layer as part of the ecosystem that influences spectral data and needs to be taken into account and subtracted accordingly; the estimation of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the pasture (fPAR); and the empirical estimation of the light use efficiency for natural grasslands, using biomass field measurements.The results obtained presented an error of around 13%, considered adequate for the applications addressed in this study, suggesting that this approach can be useful as an indicator for monitoring the net primary production in this ecosystem.

TI  - An Empirical Assessment of Angular Dependency for RedEdge-M in Sloped Terrain Viticulture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For grape canopy pixels captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tilt-mounted RedEdge-M multispectral sensor in a sloped vineyard, an in situ Walthall model can be established with purely image-based methods. This was derived from RedEdge-M directional reflectance and a vineyard 3D surface model generated from the same imagery. The model was used to correct the angular effects in the reflectance images to form normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) orthomosaics of different view angles. The results showed that the effect could be corrected to a certain scope, but not completely. There are three drawbacks that might restrict a successful angular model construction and correction: (1) the observable micro shadow variation on the canopy enabled by the high resolution; (2) the complexity of vine canopies that causes an inconsistency between reflectance and canopy geometry, including effects such as micro shadows and near-infrared (NIR) additive effects; and (3) the resolution limit of a 3D model to represent the accurate real-world optical geometry. The conclusion is that grape canopies might be too inhomogeneous for the tested method to perform the angular correction in high quality.

TI  - Quantification and Conservation Status of Forests Fragments of Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests-A Geospatial Analysis <i>Running Head: Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests</i>
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Tropical dry deciduous forests are the most vulnerable ecosystems for fragmentation. Satellite remote sensing data (of various resolutions and temporal availability) helps to study the forest fragmentation at local, regional and global scale. Spatial distribution of fragments at regional scale would provide insight into restoration and connectivity among the fragments, such that wildlife habitat can be protected. Results. In the present study the forests of Mirzapur district, Uttar Pradesh were studied using LANDSAT- OLI (2017) satellite data and the forest fragmentation was quantified using the fragmentation metrics. The forest cover of the district (17.27% of the total geographic area) was delineated into four classes, very dense forest, dense forest, medium dense forest and open forest. Various fragments of size class were also defined in each forest cover. Fragments of size <2, 2-10, 10-50, 50-100, 100-500, and >600 ha were analysed. Presence of Sloth Bear and wildlife was noted in the fragmented forest based on pieces of evidence like scats, termite mounds, and dens. Conclusion. In this study, it was observed that the number of fragments in category <2 ha are more in each forest cover class. The suitable wildlife habitat was found to be very dense and dense forest. Thus the need of the hour is to protect these fragmented forests and connect these fragments to allow better movement of large mammals such that their population can thrive. The study also acts as a bench mark in using geospatial technology to define fragmentation. The focus should be on medium dense and open forests. Very dense and dense forests act as refugia which should be protected from further destruction.

TI  - Smog and Smoke Haze over the North China Plain in June 2007
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - According to satellite monitoring data (MODIS/Terra), the spatial distribution of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at a wavelength of 550 nm for the summer smog of 2007 over the North China Plain (NCP) and adjacent areas has been obtained. Areas over which the AOD is higher due to regional anthropogenic contamination sources near Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the smoke haze forming due to agricultural burning (the southwest part of the NCP), have been revealed. The similarity of optical and microphysical characteristics of aerosol in the smoke haze over the NCP and in the Russian territory has been found: (i) the decisive contribution to the optical characteristics of smoke aerosol is made by the fine mode and (ii) the attenuation spectra in the wavelength region 340-1020 nm are approximated (in logarithmic coordinates) by parabolas or fourth degree polynomials. The monitoring data at the AERONET Beijing site show that the single scattering albedo in the summer smog over the NCP is on average less (0.91) than in the smoke haze in the Russian territory (0.95-0.96). The radiative regimes of the atmosphere are significantly different: in the smog, the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency is lower approximately by 30% at the top of the atmosphere and higher by 30% at the bottom of the atmosphere than in the smoke haze.

TI  - Transformational adaptation on the farm: Processes of change and persistence in transitions to 'climate-smart' regenerative agriculture
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerative agriculture, an alternative form of food and fiber production, concerns itself with enhancing and restoring resilient systems supported by functional ecosystem processes and healthy, organic soils capable of producing a full suite of ecosystem services, among them soil carbon sequestration and improved soil water retention. As such, climate change mitigation and adaptation are incidental to a larger enterprise that employs a systems approach to managing landscapes and communities. The transformative potential of regenerative agriculture has seen growing attention in the popular press, but few empirical studies have explored the processes by which farmers enter into, navigate, and, importantly, sustain the required paradigm shift in their approach to managing their properties, farm businesses, and personal lives. We draw on theories and insights associated with relational thinking to analyze the experiences of farmers in Australia who have undertaken and sustained transitions from conventional to regenerative agriculture. We present a conceptual framework of "zones of friction and traction" occurring in personal, practical, and political spheres of transformation that both challenge and facilitate the transition process. Our findings illustrate the ways in which deeply held values and emotions influence and interact with mental models, worldviews, and cultural norms as a result of regular monitoring; and how behavioral change is sustained through the establishment of self-amplifying positive feedbacks involving biophilic emotions, a sense of well-being, and an ever-expanding worldview. We conclude that transitioning to regenerative agriculture involves more than a suite of 'climate-smart' mitigation and adaptation practices supported by technical innovation, policy, education, and outreach. Rather, it involves subjective, nonmaterial factors associated with culture, values, ethics, identity, and emotion that operate at individual, household, and community scales and interact with regional, national and global processes. Findings have implications for strategies aimed at facilitating a large-scale transition to climate-smart regenerative agriculture.

TI  - Evaluation of carboxyl beads based latex agglutination test for rapid serodiagnosis of Japanese encephalitis
T2  - BIOLOGICALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a major public health problem in the South Asian countries including India. Pigs serve as a relevant sentinel model, the surveillance of which could predict a potential JE outbreak in human population nearby. However, existing serological detection methods like Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA), virus neutralization test (VNT) and Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) require elaborative laboratory facilities which are invariably not available in field conditions. Recognizing the lacunae, attempts were made to develop recombinant antigen (rNS1) based latex agglutination test (LAT) as a rapid on-site test using covalent coupling method. Four different formats were evaluated using different coupling buffers, blocking buffers and reaction conditions. The format in which borate buffer at alkaline pH (8.5) was used for coupling of antigen with carboxylated beads followed by blocking with skimmed milk powder was found to be the best amongst all. Developed latex based test was used for screening of 207 pig serum samples for JE which revealed relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 80.2% and 95.2%, respectively in comparison with indirect IgG ELISA. Hence, the present study demonstrated that covalently coupled recombinant antigen based LAT could be used as a reliable screening test for surveillance of JE in pigs under field conditions.

TI  - Integrating TimeSync Disturbance Detection and Repeat Forest Inventory to Predict Carbon Flux
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding change in forest carbon (C) is important for devising strategies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. National forest inventories (NFIs) are important to meet international accounting goals, but data are often incomplete going back in time, and the amount of time between remeasurements can make attribution of C flux to specific events difficult. The long time series of Landsat imagery provides spatially comprehensive, consistent information that can be used to fill the gaps in ground measurements with predictive models. To evaluate such models, we relate Landsat spectral changes and disturbance interpretations directly to C flux measured on NFI plots and compare the performance of models with and without ground-measured predictor variables. The study was conducted in the forests of southwest Oregon State, USA, a region of diverse forest types, disturbances, and landowner management objectives. Plot data consisted of 676 NFI plots with remeasured individual tree data over a mean interval (time 1 to time 2) of 10.0 years. We calculated change in live aboveground woody carbon (AWC), including separate components of growth, mortality, and harvest. We interpreted radiometrically corrected annual Landsat images with the TimeSync (TS) tool for a 90 m x 90 m area over each plot. Spectral time series were divided into segments of similar trajectories and classified as disturbance, recovery, or stability segments, with type of disturbance identified. We calculated a variety of values and segment changes from tasseled cap angle and distance (TCA and TCD) as potential predictor variables of C flux. Multiple linear regression was used to model AWC and net change in AWC from the TS change metrics. The TS attribution of disturbance matched the plot measurements 89% of the time regarding whether fire or harvest had occurred or not. The primary disagreement was due to plots that had been partially cut, mostly in vigorous stands where the net change in AWC over the measurement was positive in spite of cutting. The plot-measured AWC at time 2 was 86.0 +/- 78.7 Mg C ha(-1) (mean and standard deviation), and the change in AWC across all plots was 3.5 +/- 33 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The best model for AWC based solely on TS and other mapped variables had an R-2 = 0.52 (RMSE = 54.6 Mg C ha(-1)); applying this model at two time periods to estimate net change in AWC resulted in an R-2 = 0.25 (RMSE = 28.3 Mg ha(-1)) and a mean error of -5.4 Mg ha(-1). The best model for AWC at time 2 using plot measurements at time 1 and TS variables had an R-2 = 0.95 (RSME = 17.0 Mg ha(-1)). The model for net change in AWC using the same data was identical except that, because the variable being estimated was smaller in magnitude, the R-2 = 0.73. All models performed better at estimating net change in AWC on TS-disturbed plots than on TS-undisturbed plots. The TS discrimination of disturbance between fire and harvest was an important variable in the models because the magnitude of spectral change from fire was greater for a given change in AWC. Regional models without plot-level predictors produced erroneous predictions of net change in AWC for some of the forest types. Our study suggests that, in spite of the simplicity of applying a single carbon model to multiple image dates, the approach can produce inaccurate estimates of C flux.Although models built with plot-level predictors are necessarily constrained to making predictions at plot locations, they show promise for providing accurate updates or back-calculations of C flux assessments.

TI  - Establishing post-outbreak freedom from African horse sickness virus in South Africa's surveillance zone
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - An African horse sickness (AHS) outbreak occurred in South Africa's AHS controlled area in autumn 2016. A freedom from disease survey was performed to establish the likelihood of ongoing circulation of the associated virus during the same period the following year. A single-stage surveillance strategy was employed with a population-level design prevalence of 1% to establish a survey population sensitivity of 95% (probability that one or more positive horses would be detected if AHS was present at a prevalence greater than or equal to the design prevalence). In March 2017, a total of 262 randomly selected horses from 51 herds were sampled from the 2016 outbreak containment zone. Three within-herd and herd-level design prevalence scenarios were used in evaluating the post-survey probability of freedom. Depending on the underlying design prevalence scenarios, effectively ranging between 0.8% and 6.4%, and the use of informed or uninformed priors, the probability of freedom derived from this surveillance ranged between 73.1% and 99.9% (uninformed prior) and between 96.6% and 100% (informed prior). Based on the results, the authors conclude that it is unlikely that the 2016 AHS virus was still circulating in the autumn of 2017 in the 2016 outbreak containment zone. The ability to perform freedom from disease surveys, and also to include risk-based methods, in the AHS controlled area of South Africa is influenced by the changing underlying population at risk and the high level of vaccination coverage in the horse population. Ongoing census post-outbreak must be undertaken to maintain a valid sampling frame for future surveillance activity. The seasonality of AHS, the restricted AHS vaccination period and the inability to easily differentiate infected from vaccinated animals by laboratory testing impact the ability to perform a freedom from disease survey for AHS in the 12 months following an outbreak in the controlled area.

TI  - Determining the Organ at Risk for Lymphedema After Regional Nodal Irradiation in Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Lymphedema after regional nodal irradiation is a severe complication that could be minimized without significantly compromising nodal coverage if the anatomic region(s) associated with lymphedema were better defined. This study sought to correlate dose-volume relationships within subregions of the axilla with lymphedema outcomes to generate treatment planning guidelines for reducing lymphedema risk.Methods and Materials: Women with stage II-III breast cancer who underwent breast surgery with axillary assessment and regional nodal irradiation were identified. Nodal targets were prospectively contoured per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines for field design. The axilla was divided into 8 distinct subregions that were retrospectively contoured. Lymphedema outcomes were assessed by arm circumferences. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression assessed patient, surgical, and dosimetric predictors of lymphedema outcomes.Results: Treatment planning computed tomography scans for 265 women treated between 2013 and 2017 were identified. Median posteradiation therapy follow-up was 3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.9-3.6). Dose to the axillary-lateral thoracic vessel juncture (ALTJ; superior to level I) was most associated with lymphedema risk (maximally selected rank statistic = 6.3, P <.001). The optimal metric was ALTJ minimum dose (D-min) < 38.6 Gy (3-year lymphedema rate 5.7% vs 37.4%, P <. 001), although multiple parameters relating to sparing of the ALTJ were highly correlated. Multivariate analysis confirmed ALTJ D-min < 38.6 Gy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.13; P <.001), body mass index (HR, 1.06/unit; P = .002), and number of lymph nodes removed (HR, 1.08/node; P <.001) as significant predictors. Women with ALTJ D-min < 38.6 Gy maintained median V-45Gy of 99% in the supraclavicular (IQR, 94-100%), 100% in level III (IQR, 97%-100%), 98% in level II (IQR, 86%-100%), and 91% in level I (IQR, 75%-98%) nodal basins.Conclusions: Anatomic studies suggest the ALTJ region is typically traversed by arm lymphatics and appears to be an organ at risk in breast radiation therapy. Ideally, avoidance of the ALTJ may be feasible while simultaneously encompassing breastdraining nodal basins. Confirmation of this finding in future prospective studies is needed.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in remote sensing products has been increasingly used in terrestrial mapping, making it easier to obtain spatial information. The objective of this work was to evaluate different digital classification techniques for the land use mapping of the municipality of Frederico Westphalen - RS. For this purpose, the software Quantum Gis 2.18.13 (QGis) was used to first perform band composition, contrast enhancement and cut-off of the Sentinel-2A satellite image (10m spatial resolution) at the boundaries of the studied municipality. Different digital classification techniques were applied: 1) Minimum Distance (supervised) and 2) ISODATA (unsupervised); 1 being done in QGis and 2 in ArcGIS 10.5 software. We obtained maps with different information, of which the accuracy was evaluated by the Kappa Index, Global Accuracy, Errors of Omission and Commission. The best results were obtained for the supervised classification, which presented more agreement with the visual map considered the truth of the field, by analyzing the values of the thematic classes in km(2). For the validation, the same classification stood out with higher values of Global Accuracy and Kappa Index, (63.41% and 45%) than that found for the ISODATA classification (48.17% and 31%). However, the thematic classification should be adjusted as well as changing the RGB band composition to improve the statistical parameters.

TI  - Assessment of mining impacts on environment in Mula-Aydn (SW Turkey) using Landsat and Google Earth imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activities are important for the country's economy, but they cause serious threats to the environment. The geology of SW Turkey comprises Southern (Cine) Submassif of Menderes Metamorphic Massif and the Lycian Nappes. These geological units are unconformably overlain by lignite-bearing Miocene deposits, Upper Miocene-Pliocene conglomerates and Quaternary alluvial deposits. The aim of this study is to determine the geospatial change of mining activities in the Mula-Aydn provinces, SW Turkey. For this purpose, Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM, Landsat-8 OLI and Google Earth satellite image data for 1984, 1994, 2004, 2014 and 2018 have been used for change detection analysis. In 1984, only a Miocene lignite quarry was excavated. Then, in 1994, operations for the excavation of feldspar-quartz and marble quarries were started, and from 2004 to 2014, mining activities significantly accelerated. An aerial image of 2018 shows that an area of about 3800 ha has been exploited by mining at 149 quarries. Considering access roads to quarries, plants and dam reservoirs, the human impact extends over 3800 ha. The study area is home to several archaeological sites and endemic biota. Thus, there is an urgent need for the relocation and protection of archaeological heritages and endemic biota by creating special zones. Additionally, the rich geomorphologic features in the study area that require millions of years to form are at risk of totally disappearing.

TI  - Spatial estimates of surface deformation and topsoil moisture in operating CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR project: Pilot environmental monitoring using SAR technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental sustainability is a mandatory consideration for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project, thereby making environmental monitoring more essential. This paper aims at demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique for environmental monitoring of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project. Surface deformation and topsoil moisture are considered as the monitoring factors due to their importance to the public security and sustainability. Taking Jingbian CO2-EOR project as a case study, Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) were used for spatial estimates of surface deformation and topsoil moisture from Sentinel-1A images. The results showed that the distribution of surface deformation and topsoil moisture both manifested as spatial heterogeneity. No significantly regular uplift or subsidence trend was observed within the storage fields. The average deformation velocity of 5.63 mm yr(-1) from 537 measuring points was probably determined by the trade-off between soil erosion and eolian dust deposit. Topsoil moisture was observed to associate with natural conditions, and its spatial distribution was mainly ruled by topographic factors. Areas with soil moisture below 20% covered about 3.98 km(2), totally accounting for 77.14%. Areas with soil moisture over 20% were mostly distributed in the gully regions. In conclusion, currently, there was no large deformation trend or abnormal topsoil moisture distribution as public concerns, but long-term monitoring program is still needed for ensuring environmental sustainability. This study demonstrates that SAR technique can improve the spatial knowledge of surface deformation and topsoil moisture, which is useful for sustainability assessment of operating CO2-EOR project.

TI  - Mapping the maximum inundation extent of lowland intermittent riverine wetland depressions using LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate high-resolution maps of maximum wetland inundation extents are valuable inventorial resources, but mapping such boundaries can be difficult, time consuming and involve a level of subjectivity from the surveyor. A novel, objective and efficient method is presented for delineating the maximum inundation extents of lowland intermittent riverine wetland depressions using a high resolution LiDAR-derived digital terrain model (DTM). The method was specifically developed for wetland depressions associated with the lower reaches of the Murrumbidgee River in the southern Murray Darling Basin, Australia, but is suitable for any similar intermittent wetland depressions where the natural inundation extent is otherwise unclear. The method is based on the premise that immediately after rising water reaches a threshold level, much larger volumes of water are required to inundate not just the discrete wetland depression but also its surrounding local area; that threshold level can be considered the wetland fill level. Using a series of water levels and a corresponding series of the volume between each water level and a DTM of a wetland area, the maximum rate of increasing acceleration in volume with respect to water level, i.e. the wetland fill level, can be identified. The fill levels of eight wetland areas, ranging in size from 44 to 384 ha, were produced by this method and subsequently used to map their maximum inundation extents. Corresponding maps of the inundation frequency gradient were independently determined from a time series of Landsat derived inundation maps. The level of separation in inundation frequency of map cells inside the maximum inundation extents compared to those outside, determined by the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic, validated the technique, while identifying that a minimum level of variation in the elevation of the wetland area may be necessary for it to be successfully applied. The technique has potential to be applied more widely as an objective and relatively inexpensive procedure to identify the potential maximum inundation extent of intermittent floodplain wetlands when a good quality high resolution DTM, acquired during a dry phase, is available.

TI  - Validation of GOES-16 ABI and MSG SEVIRI active fire products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent deployment of the next generation of geostationary weather satellites provides an opportunity for the establishment of a robust global network of geostationary fire data that can greatly complement existing polar-orbiting satellite fire products. Among other benefits, geostationary satellites provide frequent sampling of diurnal variations in fire activity. Building on established satellite active fire data validation protocols, we used Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) as reference fire data to validate the fire products derived from two geostationary satellite sensors: the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) GOES-16 satellite (launched November 2016); and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI), on board the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite series (multiple launch dates). The two primary algorithms associated with these geostationary active fire data sets are the Fire Detection and Characterization (FDC) product based on the heritage Wildfire Automated Biomass-Burning Algorithm (WF-ABBA) for the GOES-series, and the Fire Radiative Power (FRP-PIXEL) product based on the Fire Thermal Anomaly algorithm (FTA) for the MSG series. Our standardized validation method allowed for a direct inter-comparison between the complementary active fire datasets. Specifically, we present an error assessment of the detection probability (omission error) and false alarm rate (commission error) for two periods in 2017 and 2018 that include extensive fire activity in the respective full-disk sectors covered by each product. The results highlight (i) the restrictiveness of the FRP-PIXEL product (98% omission error) compared to the FDC product (84% omission error), and (ii) the elevated false alarm rate of FDC (88% commission error) compared to FRP-PIXEL (8% commission error). These validation results will be used to help support the development of a harmonized global multi-sensor active fire dataset to be integrated into the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS).

TI  - Utility of hyperspectral compared to multispectral remote sensing data in estimating forest biomass and structure variables in Finnish boreal forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-quarters of Finland's land surface area is filled with forests, which compose a great part of the country's biomass, carbon pools and carbon sinks. In order to acquire up-to-date information on the forests, optical remote sensing techniques are commonly used. Moreover, in the future hyperspectral satellite missions will start providing data to support the needs of natural resource management practices,.such as forestry.It is, however, unclear what would be the additional value from using hyperspectral data compared to multispectral in quantifying forest variables of Finnish boreal forest. In this study, we used the remote sensing data by hyperspectral AISA imager (128 bands, 400-1000 nm, resolution 0.7 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 bands, resolution 10 m) to assess the possible benefits of higher spectral resolution. As reference data, we used a new nationwide forest resource dataset (stand-level data), which has a high potential in further remote sensing applications. In addition, we used a set of independent in situ measurements (plot-level data) for validation. We applied two kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms (Gaussian process and support vector regression) to relate boreal forest variables with the remote sensing data. The variables of interest were mean height, basal area, leaf area index (LAI), stem biomass and main tree species. The regression algorithms were trained with stand-level data and estimations were evaluated with stand- and plot-level holdout sets. The estimation accuracies were examined with absolute and relative root-mean-square errors. Successful variable estimations showed that kernel-based regression algorithms are suitable tools for forest structure estimation. Based on the results, the additional value of hyperspectral remote sensing data in forest variable estimation in Finnish boreal forest is mainly related to variables with species-specific information, such as main tree species and LAI. The more interesting variables for forestry industry, such as mean height, basal area and stem biomass, can also be estimated accurately with more traditional multispectral remote sensing data.

TI  - The Impact of Genetic Variants on <i>PTEN</i> Molecular Functions and Cellular Phenotypes
T2  - COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor that directly regulates a diverse array of cellular phenotypes, including growth, migration, morphology, and genome stability. How a single protein impacts so many important cellular processes remains a fascinating question. This question has been partially resolved by the characterization of a slew of missense variants that alter or eliminate PTEN's various molecular functions, including its enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, and posttranslational modifications. Here, we review what is known about how PTEN variants impact molecular function and, consequently, cellular phenotype. In particular, we highlight eight informative "sentinel variants" that abrogate distinct molecular functions of PTEN. We consider two published massively parallel assays of variant effect that measured the effect of thousands of PTEN variants on protein abundance and enzymatic activity. Finally, we discuss how characterization of clinically ascertained variants, establishment of clinical sequencing databases, and massively parallel assays of variant effect yield complementary datasets for dissecting PTEN's role in disease.

TI  - Spectral signs of aeolian activity around a sand-dune belt in northern Algeria
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dune color has been used to investigate the provenance, stabilization, and age of the sand. Here, we look for signs of aeolian activity in the colors of a sand-dune belt in northern Algeria. On the one hand, visible and near infrared spectral analyses of satellite images and laboratory samples showed reddish, yellowish, and whitish sands, depending on the amount of gypsum particles and Fe oxides coating quartz grains. Specifically, the dithionite-extractable Fe content was related to a redness index calculated from remote-sensing data and the abundance of hematite, estimated in the second derivative of the Kubelka-Munk function, paralleled the CIELAB hue-angle of sand samples. On the other hand, a spatiotemporal analysis showed that the reddish sand had undergone a continuous remobilization and dispersion throughout the area, reaching two large salt flats (sabkhas) with seasonal water. Yellowish and whitish sands appeared as patches on the periphery of these sabkhas and along the dune belt, exhibiting percussion marks and dissolution pits on the surface of quartz grains. Taken together, the results suggest that the reddish sand partially loses its Fe-oxide coatings by mechanical abrasion in the entrainment and reductive dissolution in the sabkhas during waterlogging, becoming yellowish. The periodic reactivation by wind of reddish and yellowish grains, together with whitish gypsum particles formed by evaporation as the sabkhas dry up, may explain the sorting of grains according to their mineralogy and size along the sand-dune belt, resulting in striking color changes. Accordingly, color reflects sand movements and chemical processes taking place in this dune system.

TI  - A Climatological Satellite Assessment of Absorbing Carbonaceous Aerosols on a Global Scale
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A global climatology of absorbing carbonaceous aerosols (ACA) for the period 2005-2015 is obtained by using satellite MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-Aqua and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument)-Aura aerosol optical properties and by applying an algorithm. The algorithm determines the frequency of presence of ACA (black and brown carbon) over the globe at 1 degrees x 1 degrees pixel level and on a daily basis. The results of the algorithm indicate high frequencies of ACA (up to 19 days/month) over world regions with extended biomass burning, such as the tropical forests of southern and central Africa, South America and equatorial Asia, over savannas, cropland areas or boreal forests, as well as over urban and rural areas with intense anthropogenic activities, such as the eastern coast of China or the Indo-Gangetic plain. A clear seasonality of the frequency of occurrence of ACA is evident, with increased values during June-October over southern Africa, during July-November over South America, August-November over Indonesia, November-March over central Africa and November-April over southeastern Asia. The estimated seasonality of ACA is in line with the known annual patterns of worldwide biomass-burning emissions, while other features such as the export of carbonaceous aerosols from southern Africa to the southeastern Atlantic Ocean are also successfully reproduced by the algorithm. The results indicate a noticeable interannual variability and tendencies of ACA over specific world regions during 2005-2015, such as statistically significant increasing frequency of occurrence over southern Africa and eastern Asia.

TI  - Testing quality indicators and proposing benchmarks for physician-staffed emergency medical services: a prospective Nordic multicentre study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives A consensus study from 2017 developed 15 response-specific quality indicators (QIs) for physician-staffed emergency medical services (P-EMS). The aim of this study was to test these OIs for important characteristics in a real clinical setting. These characteristics were feasibility, rankability, variability, actionability and documentation. We further aimed to propose benchmarks for future quality measurements in P-EMS.Design In this prospective observational study, physician-staffed helicopter emergency services registered data for the 15 QIs. The feasibility of the QIs was assessed based on the comments of the recording physicians. The other four OI characteristics were assessed by the authors. Benchmarks were proposed based on the quartiles in the dataset.Setting Nordic physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical services.Participants 16 physician-staffed helicopter emergency services in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.Results The dataset consists of 5638 requests to the participating P-EMSs. There were 2814 requests resulting in completed responses with patient contact. All OIs were feasible to obtain. The variability of 14 out of 15 OIs was adequate. Rankability was adequate for all Us. Actionability was assessed as being adequate for 10 OIs. Documentation was adequate for 14 OIs. Benchmarks for all OIs were proposed.Conclusions All 15 OIs seem possible to use in everyday quality measurement and improvement. However, it seems reasonable to not analyse the QI 'Adverse Events' with a strictly quantitative approach because of a low rate of adverse events. Rather, this QI should be used to identify adverse events so that they can be analysed as sentinel events. The actionability of the QIs 'Able to respond immediately when alarmed', 'Time to arrival of P-EMS', 'Time to preferred destination', 'Provision of advanced treatment' and 'Significant logistical contribution' was assessed as being poor. Benchmarks for the OIs and a total quality score are proposed for future quality measurements.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Superresolution Using Deep Residual Channel Attention
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current trend in remote sensing image superresolution (SR) is to use supervised deep learning models to effectively enhance the spatial resolution of airborne and satellite-based optical imagery. Nonetheless, the inherent complexity of these architectures/data often makes these methods very difficult to train. Despite these recent advances, the huge amount of network parameters that must be fine-tuned and the lack of suitable high-resolution remotely sensed imagery in actual operational scenarios still raise some important challenges that may become relevant limitations in the existent earth observation data production environments. To address these problems, we propose a new remote sensing SR approach that integrates a visual attention mechanism within a residual-based network design in order to allow the SR process to focus on those features extracted from land-cover components that require more computations to be superresolved. As a result, the network training process is significantly improved because it aims at learning the most relevant high-frequency information while the proposed architecture allows neglecting the low-frequency features extracted from spatially uninformative earth surface areas by means of several levels of skip connections. Our experimental assessment, conducted using the University of California at Merced and GaoFen-2 remote sensing image collections, three scaling factors, and eight different SR methods, demonstrates that our newly proposed approach exhibits competitive performance in the task of superresolving remotely sensed imagery.

TI  - Local climate zone classification with different source data in Xi'an, China
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The city's local climate zone (LCZ) has been considered as a useful guiding tool for urban climate mapping and classification of urban canopy in cities. However, the LCZ classification methods and results are different in different cities in different countries and regions. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a targeted research that would take into account local urban morphology and canopy characteristics. In the current work, a LCZ classification method is proposed. This would provide a useful guide for city planning and operation. In the newly proposed method, the LCZ types were first adjusted, according to the characteristics and urban morphology of Chinese cities, in relation to existence of high- and low-rise buildings and high density residential population and land cover of greeneries. Based on investigations of two LCZ classifications of the City of Xi'an, a coupling method was proposed. This method couples the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools method based on remote sensing data with the classification method based on road network divided by land parcels. The proposed method was validated in this study against the actual land use and construction data that were surveyed in Xi'an, which showed acceptable accuracy. Our results have illustrated the feasibility of our proposed classification for urban LCZ mapping in China.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Reconstruction Using Tensor Ring Completion and Total Variation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series remote sensing (RS) images are often corrupted by various types of missing information such as dead pixels, clouds, and cloud shadows that significantly influence the subsequent applications. In this paper, we introduce a new low-rank tensor decomposition model, termed tensor ring (TR) decomposition, to the analysis of RS data sets and propose a TR completion method for the missing information reconstruction. The proposed TR completion model has the ability to utilize the low-rank property of time-series RS images from different dimensions. To further explore the smoothness of the RS image spatial information, total-variation regularization is also incorporated into the TR completion model. The proposed model is efficiently solved using two algorithms, the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) and the alternating least square (ALS) methods. The simulated and real-data experiments show superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art low-rank related algorithms.

TI  - Clinical value of postoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study analyzed the clinical data and general information of breast cancer patients who were admitted by the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University and underwent lumpectomy, followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to investigate the effect of tumor location on the sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate, obtain a clear understanding of the SLNB procedure and further promote the use of this procedure in the local area.Methods: This study involved a total of 118 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer and admitted by the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University for lumpectomy and SLNB between July 2015 and June 2019. An analysis was conducted to explore the role of tumor location in the detection of SLNs.Results: Tumor location was associated with the success rate of post-lumpectomy SLNB. In the case of tumor location in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of the breast near the axilla, the SLN detection rate was relatively low. In contrast, when a tumor occurred in any of the other quadrants or the UOQ next to the areola, the tumor location had no significant impact on the SLN detection rate. SLNB indicated that 102 out of the 118 patients had SLNs, with the detection rate of 86.4%. Particularly, for patients whose tumors were located in the UOQ near their axillae, the SLN detection rate was 30% (3/10). As to tumor location in other quadrants or the UOQ next to the areola, the SLN detection rate was up to 90.8% (99/109).Conclusions: The performance of post-lumpectomy SLNB is associated with tumor location. SLNB is recommended when the tumor site lies in the upper inner/lower outer/lower inner quadrants (UIQ/LOQ/ LIQ) of the breast or the UOQ next to the areola. If the SLNB result turns out to be negative, there is no need to perform axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). For tumor location in the UOQ of the breast, especially when it is near the axilla, SLNB is not a favorable option after lumpectomy. It is recommended that the patient receive a core needle biopsy (CNB) before SLNB.

TI  - Greenhouse-gas emissions of beef finishing systems in the Southern High PLAINS
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gases (GHG) have been implicated in global warming and climate change. While life cycle assessments (LCA) and GHG studies have been conducted for numerous agricultural commodities, there has been little effort to estimate GHG (CO2, N2O, and CH4) from beef finishing systems of the Southern High Plains (SHP) region, which produces approximately 30% of the United States beef. The objective of this research was to quantify the carbon footprint of five beef-finishing systems using a dynamic, systems-based model that calculated CO(2)e emissions attributable to both animal gain and manure management. The systems consisted of native grass pasture (NGP, System 1); native grass pasture with feedyard finishing (NGP-FY, System 2); wheat pasture with feedyard finishing (WP-FY, System 3); feedyard-only (FY, System 4); and native grass pasture, wheat pasture, and feedyard finishing (NGP-WP-FY, System 5). Although rarely used, the NGP was included as a baseline. Variables in the model and associated management decisions were based on feed type, nutritional content, feed source, and hauling distance. The starting point of the model was a weaned steer (250 kg) and the endpoint was a steer which would grade "choice" (28% body fat) or 30 months in age, whichever came first. Overall CO(2)e kg(-1) gain decreased when cattle were fed high-quality diets and were intensively managed for production in the shortest time possible. The FY produced the desired carcass in the shortest time with the lowest cumulative emissions. The FY also had the highest average daily gain, lowest dry matter and water intake, as well as manure production. Net GHG emissions from FY were 4.84 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) gain (1799 kg CO(2)e animal(-1)). Net GHG emissions from NGP-FY, WP-FY, NGP-WP-FY, and NGP were 1.62, 1.81, 2.08, and 3.69 times that of FY, respectively. These results suggest that intensive feeding and management of beef cattle in the FY system result in the lowest overall CO(2)e emissions to produce a mature steer. Consequently, feeding systems that include native grass and wheat pasture have proportionately larger amounts of CO(2)e emissions.

TI  - Mapping of arthropod alpha and beta diversity in heterogeneous arctic-alpine ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing biodiversity in arctic-alpine ecosystems is a costly task. We test in the current study whether we can map the spatial patterns of spider alpha and beta diversity using remotely-sensed surface reflectance and topography in a heterogeneous alpine environment in Central Norway. This proof-of-concept study may provide a tool for an assessment of arthropod communities in remote study areas. Data on arthropod species distribution and richness were collected through pitfall trapping and subjected to a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to extract the main species composition gradients. The DCA axis scores as indicators of species composition as well as trap species richness were regressed against a combined data set of surface reflectance as measured by the Sentinel-2 satellite and topographical parameters extracted from a digital elevation model. The models were subsequently applied to the spatial data set to achieve a pixel-wise prediction of both species richness and position in the DCA space. The spatial variation in the modelled DCA scores was used to draw conclusions regarding spider beta-diversity. The species composition was described with two DCA axes that were characterized by post hoc-defined indicator species, which showed a typical annidation in the arctic-alpine environment under study. The fits of the regression models for the DCA axes and species richness ranged from R-2 = 0.25 up to R-2 = 0.62. The resulting maps show strong gradients in alpha and beta diversity across the study area. Our results indicate that the diversity patterns of spiders can at least partially be explained by means of remotely sensed data. Our approach would likely benefit from the additional use of high resolution aerial photography and LiDAR data and may help to improve conservation strategies in arctic-alpine ecosystems.

TI  - Changes of Wiang Nong Lom and Nong Luang Wetlands in Chiang Saen Valley (Chiang Rai Province, Thailand) During the Period 1988-2017
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pressure on the Wiang Nong Lom and Nong Luang wetland resources in the Chiang Saen Valley of Chiang Rai Province (Thailand) has increased in recent years with the expansion of farmlands and other major sources of wetland conflict related to public land encroachment. Both of these wetlands have been designated as strategic ecosystems. Yet, there is a limited understanding of the way different wetlands respond to change drivers (agriculture, climate, population, etc.), and currently no scientifically valid protocols exist for local wetland mapping and monitoring. Distinguishing between small wetlands and land use and land cover (LULC) components is a challenging affair due to the highly heterogeneous landscape and spectral similarity of compositionally different types of tropical regions. The goals of this article are both technological and substantive, i.e., it aims to (A) propose a synthesis of quantitative techniques that can improve LULC mapping using remotely sensed data (Landsat TM, ETM, OLI), and (B) assess the wetland changes during the last three decades and better understand the interaction between wetland changes, human population, and the environment. In regards to goal (A), the proposed classification approach employed a synthesis of techniques of decision tree classification (DTC), maximum likelihood classification (MLC), and Mahalanobis distance classification (MDC), with different bands and ancillary data inputs. The results demonstrated that the implementation of the DTC algorithms to address LULC mapping problems exhibited an overall mapping accuracy of 83.9, which is significantly higher than that of MLC and MDC. It was found that the DTC technique performs well when combined with visible, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave-infrared bands, a digital elevation model and normalized difference vegetation index layers. Subsequently, the postclassification analysis using DTC showed a notable improvement of approximately 88.0 classification accuracy. Regarding goal (B), our results showed that during the last 30 years, wetland areas in the Chiang Saen Valley have experienced a dramatic decrease of 30.5, whereas forest landscape surrounding the wetlands has decreased by an astonishing 50.9. Contrarily, we found that agricultural land size has increased by 24.3. We suggest that ground data can be linked to the etiology of these results, including the gradual conversion of wetlands to rice cultivation fields as a result of the government rice pledging scheme. Large areas in the study region have been cultivated by para-rubber, palm oil, and pineapple agribusiness production since 2003. In addition, short-term subsidizing government policies promote intensive production for commercial agriculture prompting farmers to transition from subsistence to commercial farming, further impacting wetland conversion. As a result, and in further view of the fact that rapidly expanding agricultural areas have contributed significantly to the decrease of wetland areas during the last three decades, the Chiang Saen Valley wetlands have been designated as wetlands of international importance. The overall recommendation of the present work is that special land-use policy and relevant regulation andor legislation are critical components of any effort to achieve wetland sustainability.

TI  - Prevalence of multiple forest disturbances and impact on vegetation regrowth from interannual Landsat time series (1985-2015)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Given long time series of satellite imagery, multiple disturbances can be detected for a particular location at different points in time. We assessed multiple disturbances for the 650 Mha of Canada's forested ecosystems using annual change information derived from Landsat time series imagery (1985-2015). Changes were typed by agent (fire, harvest, and non-stand replacing). Spectral change rate and time between successive disturbances were used to characterize disturbance-type combination differences. Short-term spectral recovery following the last disturbance was compared to a reference sample of pixels disturbed only once. Results indicated that of the 97.6 Mha disturbed, 13.5 Mha have had two or more disturbances, with low magnitude non-stand replacing disturbances involved in the majority of occurrences (77.2%). The total area disturbed represents 18.27% of forest ecosystems, with 2.53% having multiple disturbances and 0.54% having multiple stand-replacing disturbances. Systematic time series-based investigation of multiple disturbance events and agents provides insights on forest disturbance dynamics and recovery processes.

TI  - Cooperative monitoring, assessment, and management of fish spawning aggregations and associated fisheries in the US Gulf of Mexico
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many species of inshore, coastal, and reef fishes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) aggregate to spawn at specific sites and times. These fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) can be highly vulnerable to concentrated fishing pressure, which can have detrimental effects on entire stocks and ecosystems. There has been only limited research and management attention on FSAs in the U.S. GOM. We synthesized available information on FSA locations, spawning seasonality, and fisheries management for 28 regionally important species known or likely to form FSAs in the U.S. GOM. We identified and mapped 22 multi-species FSA sites which all fall within areas predicted from recently published FSA distribution models. But the number of known sites is probably far less than the number that actually exist. Only three of the 22 (13%) FSA sites were located within no-take marine protected areas and none were in state waters. Management measures (e.g., seasonal closures or gear restrictions) to protect spawning fishes are also limited, particularly in state waters. We recommend expanded cooperative research efforts to characterize FSAs in the U.S. GOM in order to assist managers in prioritizing sites and seasons for additional protection. Important multi-species FSAs can be incorporated in a network of monitored and managed "sentinel" sites. These efforts should build stakeholder engagement in the management process, generate data that can be used to improve fisheries stock assessments, contribute to developing ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches, and confer resilience to important fisheries stocks and ecosystems of the U.S. GOM.

TI  - Dust Storm Event of February 2019 in Central and East Coast of Australia and Evidence of Long-Range Transport to New Zealand and Antarctica
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 11 and 15 February 2019, a dust storm originating in Central Australia with persistent westerly and south westerly winds caused high particle concentrations at many sites in the state of New South Wales (NSW); both inland and along the coast. The dust continued to be transported to New Zealand and to Antarctica in the south east. This study uses observed data and the WRF-Chem Weather Research Forecast model based on GOCART-AFWA (Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport-Air Force and Weather Agency) dust scheme and GOCART aerosol and gas-phase MOZART (Model for Ozone And Related chemical Tracers) chemistry model to study the long-range transport of aerosols for the period 11 to 15 February 2019 across eastern Australia and onto New Zealand and Antarctica. Wildfires also happened in northern NSW at the same time, and their emissions are taken into account in the WRF-Chem model by using the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) as the emission input. Modelling results using the WRF-Chem model show that for the Canterbury region of the South Island of New Zealand, peak concentration of PM10 (and PM2.5) as measured on 14 February 2019 at 05:00 UTC at the monitoring stations of Geraldine, Ashburton, Timaru and Woolston (Christchurch), and about 2 h later at Rangiora and Kaiapoi, correspond to the prediction of high PM10 due to the intrusion of dust to ground level from the transported dust layer above. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observation data from MODIS 3 km Terra/Aqua and CALIOP LiDAR measurements on board CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite also indicate that high-altitude dust ranging from 2 km to 6 km, originating from this dust storm event in Australia, was located above Antarctica. This study suggests that the present dust storms in Australia can transport dust from sources in Central Australia to the Tasman sea, New Zealand and Antarctica.

TI  - Improving Hydrologic Modeling Using Cloud-Free MODIS Flood Maps
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood mapping from satellites provides large-scale observations of flood events, but cloud obstruction in satellite optical sensors limits its practical usability. In this study, we implemented the Variational Interpolation (VI) algorithm to remove clouds from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow-Covered Area (SCA) products. The VI algorithm estimated states of cloud-hindered pixels by constructing three-dimensional space-time surfaces based on assumptions of snow persistence. The resulting cloud-free flood maps, while maintaining the temporal resolution of the original MODIS product, showed an improvement of nearly 70% in average probability of detection (POD) (from 0.29 to 0.49) when validated with flood maps derived from Landsat-8 imagery. The second part of this study utilized the cloud-free flood maps for calibration of a hydrologic model to improve simulation of flood inundation maps. The results demonstrated the utility of the cloud-free maps, as simulated inundation maps had average POD, false alarm ratio (FAR), and Hanssen-Kuipers (HK) skill score of 0.87, 0.49, and 0.84, respectively, compared to POD, FAR, and HK of 0.70, 0.61, and 0.67 when original maps were used for calibration.

TI  - Mapping remote rural settlements at 30 m spatial resolution using geospatial data-fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely population distribution maps are critical to addressing health epidemics, coordinating natural disaster response, tracking global changes for environmental conservation, confronting human rights issues, and more. Satellite imagery has opened numerous ways for mapping population distribution - previously unattainable without conducting a resource intensive census. While great advances have been made in urban population mapping, large gaps still exist for rural and remote populations which tend to be the most vulnerable to environmental, economic, and socio-political change. Moderate resolution remote sensing data, such as Landsat, has generally been viewed as insufficient for rural mapping given its coarseness relative to the size of a rural dwelling. This paper presents an approach for detecting small rural settlements within Ann Township of Rakhine State, a remote region of Myanmar with a highly mobile population, by combining Landsat data with publicly available auxiliary geospatial data. The key to the success of detecting small settlements at the Landsat resolution was the inclusion of multi-temporal auxiliary data sensitive to human activity patterns in the regions, such as distance to water, change in seasonal vegetation signals, and distance to a recent active fire. The use of active fire in this context is novel and provided a key metric that increased the accuracy of the resultant map. The final dataset has a classification accuracy of 86.5% on a per-pixel basis and 93.1% on a location identification basis. Numerous small settlements (on the order of 2-3 structures in some cases) not previously mapped by other datasets are identified, revealing that the population of Ann Township is far more dispersed and isolated than previously mapped. This study concludes that by incorporating regionally specific characteristics, moderate resolution remotely sensed data can be used to successfully map geographically marginalized communities so that services and aid are better able to reach them.

TI  - Synthetic aperture radar and optical satellite data for estimating the biomass of corn
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Above ground biomass is an important crop biophysical parameter for monitoring crop condition and determining crop productivity, in particular if linked with phenological growth stage. Optical reflectance and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter have been used to model above ground biomass for some crops. However, to date, direct comparisons of biomass retrievals from these two data sources, and more importantly an integration of biophysical products from optical and SAR satellite data, has not been fully explored. In this study, SAR and optical satellite data are assessed and compared for estimating the wet and dry biomass of corn. Wet and dry biomass are estimated from RADARSAT-2 using a calibrated Water Cloud Model (WCM) and from RapidEye using vegetation indices which include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Red-Edge Triangular Vegetation Index (RTVI), Simple Ratio (SR) and Red-Edge Simple Ratio (SRre). Data collected during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) are used for testing the model accuracies. The results show high accuracies for both SAR and optical sensors for dry biomass with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.83, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.16 kg m(-2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.15 kg m(-2) from RADARSAT-2 and R of 0.92, RMSE of 0.11 kg m(-2) and MAE of 0.07 kg m(-2) from RapidEye. For wet biomass, the accuracies are 0.78 (R), 1.25 kg m(-2) (RMSE) and 1.00 kg m(-2) (MAE) from RADARSAT-2 and for RapidEye, 0.92 (R), 0.71 kg m(-2) (RMSE) and 0.49 kg m(-2) (MAE). For dry biomass, the accuracies from RapidEye are slightly higher but the results from these two sensors are comparable. For wet biomass, the accuracies from RADARSAT-2 decreased, likely due to the effect of Vegetation Water Content (VWC) on backscatter intensity. This study also developed a neural network transfer function between the biomass derived from SAR and from optical data. The purpose of this function is to facilitate the integration of optical and SAR derived biomass in order to monitor corn throughout the growing season, regardless of source of satellite data. Integration of data from multiple sources is an important strategy to improve temporal coverage, in particular when clouds obscure optical observations. With this approach in mind, biomass estimates from RADARSAT-2 were cross-calibrated against those from RapidEye and their time-series biomass maps were generated.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Target detection is an important research topic in hyperspectral image processing, and has been the focus of research of many scholars. Compared with many target detection methods, the subspace target detection method is superior. This paper proposes a hyperspectral subspace target detection method LBSE-AMUSE based on the Local Background Subspace Estimation (LBSE) method and the AMUSE algorithm (Algorithm for Multiple Signals Extraction). HyMap airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data is used as the data source, and the performance between the LBSE and LBSE-AMUSE methods is compared by using quantitative indicators such as false alarm rate, detection rate and ROC curve. The experimental results show that the LBSE-AMUSE method has a simple structure, short running time and low false alarm rate compared with the LBSE method, which can suppress the background highlighting target to some extent.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Variations of Land Surface Temperature Based on Local Climate Zones: A Case Study in Nanjing, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of local climate zone (LCZ) has standardized the calculation of urban heat island (UHI) intensity (UHII) and established the connection among urban morphology, surface property, and UHI. In addition, LCZ has provided a new insight into the studies on urban thermal environment. This study selected Nanjing, China, as the study area and utilized a combined method that comprised remote sensing based and geographic information system based methods based on random forest classifier for LCZ classification. Overall accuracy reached 92, and kappa coefficient was 0.911. In addition, the seasonal and diurnal differences of land surface temperature (LST) were analyzed via LST retrieval from Landsat data and computational fluid dynamics model simulation, respectively. Results confirmed the warmest and coldest zones in four seasons. The LST distribution characteristics of land cover and built types were basically the same during the four seasons. Moreover, the UHII difference of an LCZ class in various seasons and the UHII difference of a season in various LCZs were investigated. The daily LSTs of the simulated LCZs (1 to 6) within 24h showed the same variation law but different variation extents in a day. The LST variations of built types were related to building elements, such as building height, building density, building layout, and green ratio. This study identified an existing relation between LST and LCZ and analyzed LST on the basis of LCZs from seasonal and diurnal scales, which provides guidance for future researchers.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Landslide Detection in "Off-site" Area by Machine Learning Model Portability Comparison: A Case Study of Jiuzhaigou Earthquake, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising machine learning (ML) models have become the preferred way for landslide detection based on remote sensing images, but the performance of these models in a sample-free area are rarely concerned in many studies. In this study, we used a cross-validation method (training model in one area and validation in another) to compare the model portability of trained ML models applied in an "off-site" area, as a consideration of the landslide detection ability of these models in sample-free areas. We integrate nighttime light imagery, multi-seasonal optical Landsat time-series and digital elevation data, and we employed support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) models to classify the satellite imagery and identify landslides. Samples of two scenarios generated from two subareas of the Jiuzhaigou disaster-stricken region are used for the cross-application and accuracy evaluation of three ML models. The results revealed that when the trained models are applied in areas outside those in which they were developed, the landslide identification accuracy of these three models has declined. Especially for the SVM and ANN models, the accuracy is greatly reduced and there appears a seriously imbalanced user's and producer's accuracy. However, although the performance of the RF model is lower than that of SVM and ANN models in their local area, the RF model exhibits stable portability, and retains the original performance and achieves a satisfactory balance between overestimation and underestimation in "off-site" areas. An additional validation from a new area proved that the landslide detection performance of the RF model with stable portability is higher than that of the SVM and ANN models in "off-site" areas. The results suggest that evaluating the model portability through cross-application can be a useful way to determine the most suitable model for landslide detection in "off-site" areas with a similar geographic environment to model development areas, so as to maximize the accuracy of landslide detection based on limited samples.

TI  - Integrating Water Observation from Space Product and Time-Series Flow Data for Modeling Spatio-Temporal Flood Inundation Dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodic inundation of floodplains and wetlands is critical for the well being of ecosystems. This study proposes a simple but efficient model that integrates time series daily flow data and the Landsat-derived Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product to model the spatio-temporal flood inundation dynamics of the Murray-Darling Basin. A zone-gauge framework is adopted in order to reduce the hydrologic complexity of the large river basin. Under this framework, flood frequency analysis was conducted at each gauge station to identify historical peak flows and their annual exceedance probabilities. The results were then linked with the WOfS dataset through date to model the inundation probability in each zone. Inundation frequency was derived by simply overlaying the yearly inundation extent from 1988 to 2015 and counting the inundation times. Both the resultant inundation frequency map and inundation probability map are of ecological significance for the survival and prosperity of riparian ecosystems. The assumptions of the model were validated carefully to enhance its theoretical basis. The WOfS dataset was also compared with another independent water observation dataset to cross-validate its reliability. It is hoped that with the development of more and more global high-resolution surface water datasets, this study could inspire more studies that integrate surface water datasets with hydrological observations for flood inundation modeling.

TI  - Identification of wheat powdery mildew using in-situ hyperspectral data and linear regression and support vector machines
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To fully understand the spectral response characteristics of powdery mildew (PM) on winter wheat, in-situ hyperspectral data were collected and comparatively analyzed. The center distance method was first used to remove the abnormal spectral response bands using the red-edge position. Subsequently, the Relief-F algorithm and correlation analysis were jointly introduced to identify the best bands sensitive to the PM. The 636 nm in the visible region and the 784 nm in the near-infrared region were finally assured to develop a new vegetation index (NDVI1) according to the generation mechanism of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Besides, a total of ten other vegetation indices commonly used in previous studies were calculated for comparatively evaluating the performance of NDVI1. Two types of sample data (only diseased samples, and both diseased and healthy samples) and three classifiers were comparatively used to estimate the disease, including a linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. The results show that the linear regression model based on the NDVI1 except for the Modified Simple Ratio (MSR) is generally the best for the two sample types, giving a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.75 and 0.49, respectively. Conversely, the SVM and LS-SVM models provide the best estimation accuracy using the K-fold cross-validation. In general, the overall classification accuracy of the SVM is higher than that of the LS-SVM, but the LS-SVM is more efficient regarding running time. The results of this study can provide a useful guideline for wheat PM estimation using the ground-based hyperspectral data.

TI  - Home range associated with water surface variations for wintering Cygnus columbianus in Dongting Lake.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake is an important wintering habitat of Cygnus columbianus in China. To explore the effect of water level changes in Dongting Lake on the activities of wintering Cygnus columbianus, satellite tracking was carried out for 18 C. columbianus individuals in the Dongting Lake between 2014 and 2015. The home range of C. columbianus at different water levels during the wintering period were estimated via the Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) methods. The MODIS remote sensing data were used to extract the surface water of Dongting Lake during the wintering period and calculate the Submergence Time Index (STI), followed by correlation analysis and spatial superposition analysis of the home range, water level, and STI. The water level restricts the home range size of C. columbianus, which is then significantly reduced with an increase in the water level. During the wintering period, the favorite habitat of C. columbianus is the integrative area of shallow water and grasslands, and the distribution and availability of food resources are the primary reasons for the changes in the home range.

TI  - Performance Evaluation and Comparison of Modified Spectral Mixture Analysis Method for Different Images of Landsat Series Satellites
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surface is considered one of main factors affecting urban heat island and urban waterlogging. It is commonly extracted utilizing the original linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) model. However, due to the deficiencies of this method, many improvements and modifications have been proposed. In this paper, a modified dynamic endmember linear spectral mixture analysis (DELSMA) model was introduced and tested in Zhengzhou, China, using different images of Landsat series satellites. The accuracy and performance of DELSMA model was evaluated in terms ofRMSE,r andR2. Results show that (1) the DELSMA model performed equally well for Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images, and obtained better accuracy by using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) than Landsat TM/ETM+; (2) the DELSMA model achieved a better performance than the original LSMA model consistently, using images of Landsat from different sensors. Based exclusively on the overall accuracy reports, the DELSMA model proved to be a more efficient method for extracting impervious surface. Our study will provide a reliable method of impervious surface estimation for the urban planner and management in monitoring urban expansion, revealing urban heat island, and estimating urban surface runoff, using time-series Landsat imagery.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between Urbanization and the Eco-Environment: A Case Study of Beijing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing is one of the most developed cities in China and has experienced a series of environmental problems. In accordance with the Major Function Zone planning, Beijing is divided into four zones in an attempt to coordinate development between urban areas and the eco-environment. Classic coupling model uses statistical data to evaluate the interactions of these two subsystems; however, it lacks the capability to express dynamic changes to land cover. Thus, we extracted land cover data from Landsat images and examined the urbanization and eco-environment level as well as the coupling coordination in Beijing and its functional zones. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Between 2001 and 2011, both urbanization and the eco-environment level in Beijing and its functional zones grew steadily. Different zones coordinated together according to their own characteristics, and the overall coupling coordination of the city transformed from the "basically balanced" to the "superiorly balanced" stage of development. (2) After 2011, the condition of the eco-environment worsened in Beijing and in most of the function zones, while the coordination between increased urbanization and the worsened eco-environment may be a result of environmental lag. This study integrated land cover data into the coupling mode and fully utilized the advantages of spatiotemporal analysis and the coupling model. In other words, the spatiotemporal analysis explains the land cover changes visually over the research period, while the coupling model explores the interaction mechanisms between urbanization and the eco-environment. The land cover data enriches the coupling theory and provides a reference for evaluating the effectiveness of local development policy.

TI  - Co-Seismic Deformation and Fault Slip Model of the 2017 Mw 7.3 Darbandikhan, Iran-Iraq Earthquake Inferred from D-InSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 12 November 2017 Darbandikhan earthquake (Mw 7.3) occurred along the converence zone. Despite the extensive research on this earthquake, none of this work explained whether this earthquake rupture was limited to the thick sedimentary cover or it extends to the underlying crystalline basement rock (or both). Besides, whether this region will generate devastating earthquakes again and whether there is a one-to-one correlation between these anticlines and blind-reverse faults need further investigation. In this study, we derived the co-seismic interferograms from the Sentinel-1A/B data and successfully described the surface deformation of the main seismic zone. The fringe patterns of both the ascending and descending interferograms show that the co-seismic deformation is dominated by horizontal movements. Then, using the along- and across-track deformation fields of different orbits, we retrieved the three-dimensional deformation field, which suggests that the Darbandikhan earthquake may be a blind thrust fault close to the north-south direction. Finally, we inverted the geometrical parameters of the seismogenic fault and the slip distribution of the fault plane. The results show that the source fault has an average strike of 355.5 degrees and a northeast dip angle of -17.5 degrees. In addition, the Darbandikhan earthquake has an average rake of 135.5 degrees, with the maximum slip of 4.5 m at 14.5 km depth. On the basis of the derived depth and the aftershock information provided by the Iranian Seismological Center, we inferred that this event primarily ruptured within the crystalline basement and the seismogenic fault is the Zagros Mountain Front Fault (MFF). The seismogenic region has both relatively low historical seismicity and convergent strain rate, which suggests that the vicinity of the epicenter may have absorbed the majority of the energy released by the convergence between the Arabian and the Eurasian plates and may generate Mw > 7 earthquakes again. Moreover, the Zagros front fold between the Lurestan Arc and the Kirkuk Embayment may be generated by the long-distance slippage of the uppermost sedimentary cover in response to the sudden shortening of the MFF basement. We thus conclude that the master blind thrust may control the generation of the Zagros front folding.

TI  - High-Quality Cloud Masking of Landsat 8 Imagery Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat record represents an amazing resource for discovering land-cover changes and monitoring the Earth's surface. However, making the most use of the available data, especially for automated applications ingesting thousands of images without human intervention, requires a robust screening of cloud and cloud-shadow, which contaminate clear views of the land surface. We constructed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to semantically segment Landsat 8 images into regions labeled clear-sky, clouds, cloud-shadow, water, and snow/ice. For training, we constructed a global, hand-labeled dataset of Landsat 8 imagery; this labor-intensive process resulted in the uniquely high-quality dataset needed for the creation of a high-quality model. The CNN model achieves results on par with the ability of human interpreters, with a total accuracy of 97.1%, omitting only 3.5% of cloud pixels and 4.8% of cloud shadow pixels, which is seven to eight times fewer missed pixels than the masks distributed with the imagery. By harnessing the power of advanced tensor processing units, the classification of full images is I/O bound, making this approach a feasible method to generate masks for the entire Landsat 8 archive.

TI  - High resolution wheat yield mapping using Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop yield estimates are important for governments, farmers, scientists and agribusiness. This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66 t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61 t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale. Applying this method gives us a range of crop yield across the landscape of 4.09 to 12.22 t/ha, with a total crop production of approx. 289,000 t.

TI  - Auxiliary datasets improve accuracy of object-based land use/land cover classification in heterogeneous savanna landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying land use/land cover (LULC) with sufficient accuracy in heterogeneous landscapes is challenging using only satellite imagery. To improve classification accuracy inclusion of features from auxiliary geospatial datasets in classification models is applied since 1980s. However, the method is mostly limited to pixel-based classifications, and the coverage, accuracy and resolution of free and open-access auxiliary datasets have been poor until recent years.We evaluated how recent global coverage open-access geospatial datasets improve object-based LULC classification accuracy compared to using only spectral and texture features from satellite images. We applied feature sets topography, population, soil, canopy cover, distance to watercourses and spectral-temporal metrics from Landsat-8 time series on the southern foothills and savanna of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, where the landscape is characterized by heterogeneous and fragmented mosaic of disturbed savanna vegetation, croplands, and settlements.The classification was based on image objects (groups of spectrally similar pixels) derived from segmentation of four Formosat-2 scenes with 8 m spatial resolution using 1370 ground reference points for training, validation, and for defining 17 LULC classes. We built six Random Forest classification models with different sets of object features in each. The baseline model having only spectral and texture features was compared with five other models supplemented with auxiliary features.Inclusion of auxiliary features significantly improved classification overall accuracy (OA). The baseline model gave a median OA of 60.7%, but auxiliary features in other models increased median OA between 6.1 and 16.5 percentage points. The best OA was achieved with a model including all features of which elevation was the most important auxiliary feature followed by Enhanced Vegetation Index temporal range and slope degree.Applying object-based classification to geospatial information on topography, soil, settlement patterns and vegetation phenology, the discriminatory potential of challenging LULC classes can be significantly improved. We demonstrated this for the first time, and the technique shows good potential for improving LULC mapping across a multitude of fragmented landscapes worldwide.

TI  - Using remote sensing data for predicting potential areas to flash flood hazards and water resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discussed the utilizing of active microwave and visible/Near-IR (VNIR) remote sensing data for flash flood prediction and proposing solutions to monito such event and protect people and infrastructures. The radar and VNIR data provided the excellent approaches for presenting hydrological and drainage system information. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data provided quantitative evidence on hydrologic features of catchment, such as relief, geometry and drainage characteristics. Meteorological TRMM satellite provided precipitation data on catchment areas. The results of data integration allowed delineating the probable regions of flash flood hazards that represented by sub-basins (7, 8, and 9). Moreover, based on land use data that estimated by applying VNIR data, the most of southern Quseir city is prone to serious hazards. Several dams and reservoirs should be erected to minimize the predicted hazards. Such strategies would provide plausible water resources that can help in sustainability and future developments as the area received plausible quantities of precipitation during rainstorms.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We conducted this project to develop a feasible method for mapping tropical peat lands of Bengkalis Island-as a test site-in Indonesia. Materials and methods The method based on limited availability of field measurements and a wide range of remotely sensed spatial datasets like radar elevation product, MODIS, and Landsat imageries. We applied land use category based sampling to extend existing field data of peat thickness. New peat thickness data was collected by boring and simultaneous electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Based on remotely sensed and field data sets, peat maps were compiled by simulated spatial annealing. Peat map statistics were derived after 500 runs including mean, median, minimum, maximum, and percentile values. Results and discussion The resulted maps represent the limiting values of expected peat thickness using 90% confidence level. Results showed that ERT is suitable for determining peat layer thickness. Using independent samples, we found that peat thickness predictions tend to overestimate peat thickness by ca. 2 m in general. Conclusions According to predictions, the peat volume of Bengkalis Island is estimated to be in the range of 3.28-3.58 km(3).

TI  - God is Greater: Believing in the Unseen and the Expansion of Management Responsibility
T2  - PHILOSOPHY OF MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main thesis of this essay is that contemporary management problems are results of the inherent reductionism in classical science and modernist worldview. Reductionism is inherent in modernist worldview since it limits its scope of cognition and considerations to the seen and sensible aspects of reality. It ignores the unseen divine aspect of it. To overcome reductionism and expand management ethical responsibility, I build on the contemporary Moroccan philosopher Taha Abderrahmane work to argue that the unseen divine dimension of reality should be restored to guide man's continuous spiritual and ethical development. The restoration of this dimension requires emphasizing Man-God relationship rather than being concerned with conceptualizing God himself. I argue that understanding God as beyond man's realization while conceptualizing Man-God relationship as a dimension of continuous spiritual exaltation for man can overcome reductionism. This view expands man's existence and cognition. It restores the excluded divine aspect without reducing it to certain values or specific practices since the ultimate reality (God) is always above and ahead. Consequently, it expands man's responsibility when dealing with (managing) things in the world, including himself.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of eight machine learning models in land use/land cover mapping using Landsat 8 OLI: a case study of the northern region of Iran
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover change mapping has been used for monitoring environmental changes as an essential factor to study on the earth's surface land cover in the field of climate change phenomena such as floods and droughts. Remote sensing images have been suggested to present inexpensive and fine-scale data offering multi-temporal coverage. This tool is useful in the field of environmental monitoring, land-cover mapping, and urban planning. This study aims to evaluate eight machine learning algorithms for image classification implemented in WEKA and R programming language. Firstly, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Level-2 images based on eight machine learning techniques including Random Forest, Decision Table, DTNB, J48, Lazy IBK, Multilayer Perceptron, Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NN ge), and Simple Logistic are classified. Then, obtained results are compared in term of Overall Accuracy (OA), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for land use land cover mapping. Among the eight machine learning algorithms used for image classification based on the training and test dataset, NN ge classifier is ranked first with values of 100, 0, and 0 for Overall Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error respectively. All machine learning algorithms had an Overall Accuracy of more than 99% for the training dataset. On the other hand, for the test dataset, J48 and DTNB algorithms had the worst performance with values of 88.1188 and 76.9802 respectively for the Overall Accuracy.

TI  - Investigation of monthly and seasonal changes of methane gas with respect to climate change using satellite data
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and global warming are the biggest challenges in the current century. Methane gas is one of the most important greenhouse gases which can contribute to creating warming weather (about 19%). In this research, satellite data from GOSAT and MODIS and also climatic data of precipitation, temperature and humidity are used to analyze monthly and seasonal methane changes in 2012 to 2018 in North America. The results show that the methane gas has increased during this period and it increases from 1789 to 1824 ppb. The gas has monthly fluctuation and in October and September has the maximum concentration and in March and April has the minimum value. The relationship between the methane gas and temperature and LST is positive, and the relationship between the methane gas and NDVI, precipitation and humidity is negative. This verifies that the increase in methane concentration has significant relationship with low vegetation cover and high temperature. Therefore, conservation of vegetation cover can help to reduce the methane concentration.

TI  - Why perceived political bias on TV does not inevitably lead to a polarized audience. The case of NRK and TV2 in Norway
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates whether political polarization of the TV audience is emerging also in a typical democratic corporatist system. The study is motivated by the claim put forward by several US scholars, who argue that in today's high choice information environments, partisans tend to see mainstream media as 'hostile' and therefore seek out and select broadcasters who confirm and deepen their worldview (Arceneaux and Johnson, 2013; Iyengar and Hahn, 2009; Tewksbury and Riles, 2015). This demand, they argue, expands the market for partisan TV and contributes to growing political polarization. We ask if there is evidence of a politically polarized Norwegian TV audience, by exploring the relationship between partisan preferences, perceived political bias and selective exposure to TV news. We find that many Norwegians believe that both the public broadcaster and the leading commercial broadcasters are politically biased. Consistent with the "hostile media hypothesis", people on the right accuse the broadcasters of favoring the parties on the left, whereas people of the left tend to see the broadcasters as favoring the parties on the right, albeit not to the same degree. By using a survey experiment, our study also demonstrates that given the opportunity, the audience does select news stories consistent with their political beliefs from a politically 'friendly' broadcaster. However, they also choose news stories consistent with their political beliefs from a perceived hostile news source over politically inconsistent stories from a friendly source. This suggests that 'friendly' content triumphs perception of broadcaster bias. Despite widespread perceptions of partisan favoritism in the Norwegian TV market, we find few traces of a politically polarized audience. The main reason for this is that the public broadcaster still draws a wide audience across the political spectrum, as even critics consider this news source as too important and relevant to be ignored.

AB  - An ultrawideband radiometer was used to measure microwave brightness temperature spectra over Arctic sea ice in the Lincoln Sea near the north coast of Greenland. Spectra over the range of 0.52 GHz were compared to thermal infrared images collected during the airborne campaign and also compared to nearly concurrent Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Based on those comparisons, spectral signatures were associated with thick multiyear ice and thin ice. A radiative transfer (RT) model consisting of a homogeneous slab of sea ice bounded by sea water and air was then used to invert the spectra for sea ice thickness and salinity. Inferred thicknesses were consistent with ice thickness climatology for ice floes in the Lincoln Sea. Salinities are higher than expected which may be a consequence of neglecting surface and volume scattering contributions in the models.

TI  - Improved Faster R-CNN With Multiscale Feature Fusion and Homography Augmentation for Vehicle Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicle detection in remote sensing images has attracted remarkable attention for its important role in a variety of applications in traffic, security, and military fields. Motivated by the stunning success of region convolutional neural network (R-CNN) techniques, which have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in object detection task on benchmark data sets, we propose to improve the Faster R-CNN method with better feature extraction, multiscale feature fusion, and homography data augmentation to realize vehicle detection in remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on representative remote sensing data sets related to vehicle detection demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be made available (after the review process).

TI  - Interannual linkage between wintertime sea-ice cover variability over the Barents Sea and springtime vegetation over Eurasia
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid loss of Arctic sea-ice could cause climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the middle and high latitudes. In this study, the interannual linkage between winter (December-January-February) sea-ice cover over the Barents Sea (SICBS) and spring (April-May-June) vegetation greenness over Eurasia, as well as the possible mechanisms of this teleconnection are investigated. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer is used as the proxy of vegetation greenness. During 1982-2015, the winter SICBS is significantly correlated with the spring NDVI over Eurasia (NDVIEA). The positive (negative) winter SICBS anomalies tend to increase (decrease) the spring NDVIEA. The results show that the increased winter SICBS corresponds to higher winter surface air temperature and soil temperature over most parts of Eurasia, and in turn, corresponds to less winter snow cover and less snow water equivalent. The persistent less and thinner snow cover from winter to spring over Eurasia, especially over Western and Central Siberia, tends to induce increased surface air temperature through decreased surface albedo and less snowmelt latent heat. Subsequently, the increased surface air temperature corresponding to increased SICBS contributes to higher vegetation greenness over Eurasia in spring and vice versa. The ensemble simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 further confirm the associated possible physical mechanism. Meanwhile, the variability of the SICBS shows good seasonal persistence from winter to spring. The increased spring SICBS also leads to the changes in climate conditions that are favorable for increased NDVI near Lake Baikal.

TI  - Risk Assessment and Regionalization of Fire Disaster Based on Analytic Hierarchy Process and MODIS Data: A Case Study of Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia, as a fragile ecological zone in northern China, is prone to severe fires due to natural forces and intensive human disturbances. The development of a fire risk assessment system at the finer spatial scale is not sufficient in this region. In this study, we obtained the data of burned areas and fire hotspots numbers for Inner Mongolia from the Terra/Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data (MCD45A1 and MOD14A1/MYD14A1, 2002 similar to 2016). These fire maps were used to determine the fire spatial and temporal variability, as well as the interactions with environmental controls (climatic, vegetation, topography, and anthropic characteristics) derived in geographic information system (GIS) layers. Based on this, the fire-causing variables were selected as the dependent variables for model building, whereas data on burned area and number of fire hotspots were used for model validation. The fire risk assessment map was then generated in a 500 x 500 m grid cell using an analytic hierarchy process approach and a GIS technique. This work could be easily used for the ultimate aim of supporting fire management.

TI  - Paddy rice multiple cropping index changes in Southern China: Impacts on national grain production capacity and policy implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in rice production in Southern China are crucial to national food security. This study employed Landsat images to map the distributions of paddy rice-cropping systems in Southern China in 1990 and 2015. The impact of rice multiple cropping index changes on grain production capacity was then evaluated. Three important results were obtained for the 1990 to 2015 study period. First, the multiple cropping index for rice decreased from 148.3% to 129.3%, and 253.16x10(4) ha of land area was converted from double-cropping to single-cropping rice, termed "double to single". The area with the most dramatic changes is in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain. The rice-cropping system distribution in Southern China showed a change from north to south with double-cropping rice shrinking and single-cropping rice expanding. Second, the "double to single" conversion led to a reduction of 6.1% and 2.6% in rice and grain production, respectively. Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces, located in the main rice producing areas, and Zhejiang, which has shown better economic development, exhibited large reductions in rice production due to the "double to single" conversion, all exceeding 13%. Third, the grain production capacity of converted "double to single" paddy fields is equivalent to that of 223.3 x 10(4) ha of newly reclaimed cultivated land, which is 54% of the total newly cultivated land reclaimed through the 2001-2015 land consolidation project. It is also 1.7 times the target goal for newly cultivated land in the national land consolidation plan for 2016-2020. Making full use of the converted "double to single" paddy fields can save 167.44 billion yuan in newly reclaimed cultivated land costs. Therefore, instead of pursuing low-quality new arable land, it is better to make full use of the existing high-quality arable land. Based on these results, the government should change the assessment method for cultivated land balance, and incorporate the sown area increased by improving the multiple cropping index into the cultivated land compensation indicator.

TI  - Conceptual Basis for William Wordsworth's Rejection to Science. Lexical Analysis of <i>The Prelude</i>
T2  - EIKASIA-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the literary criticism devoted to interpreting the work of W. Wordsworth tries, on the one hand, to overcome and moderate, or, on the other hand, to directly accept the manifest opposition against science and scientific practices that the poet maintains, mainly throughout his work The Prelude. I will examine the conceptual basis of such hostile attitude by analyzing the lexicon used in this work. The results obtained permit confirming Wordsworth's hostility towards science, and more precisely, the prejudice that modern science would not allow a humanized perception of nature. But I argue that this attitude is due to a latent enchanted worldview, in a Weberian sense, more suitable for the sentimental description than for the perception and description of the natural landscape based on the explanatory knowledge of nature.

TI  - Simulation of snowmelt runoff and sensitivity analysis in the Nyang River Basin, southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water-runoff in the plateau mountainous areas is mainly contributed by precipitation, snowmelt and glacial meltwater; the different runoff components result from different mechanism of runoff generation. Plateau mountainous areas have not only a unique hydrological cycle mechanism but also are sensitive to climate change. Glacier and snow meltwater in the plateau mountainous areas have a large proportion in runoff and are a main water resources for industrial, agricultural and domestic water use in the basin. Two commonly used model, HBV and SRM, were selected for the quantitative analysis of snowmelt runoff contribution and the hydrological response to climate change scenarios in the Nyang River Basin in the southeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Based on the characteristics of the models, the HBV model was used to analyze the runoff composition, while the SRM model was used to analyze the runoff in climate change scenarios. The results showed that both models have a good performance in modeling the hydrological processes in the basin. The snow melts mainly concentrate in May, in the average annual precipitation, rainfall and snowfall accounted for 85% and 15%, respectively. From the results of sensitivity analysis, the increase in temperature would accelerate the melting of snow in April and May and turns the snowfall into rainfall in October. However, the change in precipitation mainly affects the runoff in July, August and September, when precipitation is dominated by rain. The results indicate that the timing of the effects of temperature and precipitation on the runoff process is different.

TI  - Spatially and Temporally Continuous Leaf Area Index Mapping for Crops through Assimilation of Multi-resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key parameter that represents the structural characteristics and biophysical changes of crop canopy, the leaf area index (LAI) plays a significant role in monitoring crop growth and mapping yield. A considerable amount of farmland is dispersed with strong spatial heterogeneity. The existing time series satellite LAI products fail to capture spatial distributions and growth changes of crops due to coarse spatial resolutions and spatio-temporal discontinuities. Therefore, it becomes crucial for fine resolution LAI mapping in time series over crop areas. A two-stage data assimilation scheme was developed for dense time series LAI mapping in this study. A LAI dynamic model was first constructed using multi-year MODIS LAI data. This model coupled with the PROSAIL radiative transfer model, and MOD09A1 reflectance data were used to retrieve temporal LAI profiles at the 500 m resolution with the assistance of the very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) algorithm. Then, the LAI dynamics at the 500 m scale were incorporated as prior information into the Landsat 8 OLI reflectance data for time series LAI mapping at the 30 m resolution. Finally, the spatio-temporal continuities and retrieval accuracies of assimilated LAI values were assessed at the 500 m and 30 m resolutions respectively, using the MODIS LAI product, fine resolution LAI reference map and field measurements. The results indicated that the assimilated the LAI estimations at the 500 m scale effectively eliminated the spatio-temporal discontinuities of the MODIS LAI product and displayed reasonable temporal profiles and spatial integrity of LAI. Moreover, the 30 m resolution LAI retrievals showed more abundant spatial details and reasonable temporal profiles than the counterparts at the 500 m scale. The determination coefficient R-2 between the estimated and field LAI values was 0.76 with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.71 at the 30 m scale. The developed method not only improves the spatio-temporal continuities of the LAI at the 500 m scale, but also obtains 30 m resolution LAI maps with fine spatial and temporal consistencies, which can be expected to meet the needs of analysis on crop dynamic changes and yield mapping in fragmented and highly heterogeneous areas.

TI  - Lifetime Absolute Calibration of the EO-1 Hyperion Sensor and its Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth-Observing One Hyperion sensor was decommissioned on March 20, 2017. Analysis of Libya 4 Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICSs) image data acquired from 2004 to final decommissioning indicated statistically significant drifts in sensor response in the bands 8 to 16 (426.82, 436.99, 447.17, 457.34, 467.52, 477.69, 487.87, 498.04, and 508.22 nm) and bands 206 (2213.93 nm), 209 (2244.22 nm), and 210 (2254.22 nm). The estimated yearly drift in these bands ranges between 0.136 and 0.049. After correction accounting for the estimated drift, the absolute radiometric calibration of the sensor was evaluated through vicarious reflectance-based calibrations performed at the South Dakota State University (SDSU) test site and the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) Railroad Valley site using data from 2002 to 2015. Calibration correction coefficients including gain as much as 1.40 and bias as large as 0.132 were found except absorption bands (890980, 10901180, 13051520, and 17502050 nm). Finally, the yearly drift and calibration correction coefficients were validated by comparison of the banded multispectral Hyperion data after any significant drift and calibration coefficient correction with Landsat 7 data. The validation showed that after drift and calibration coefficient correction, there is no significant gain and bias using different test sites at different signal levels. The drift and calibration correction coefficients of each band are provided in this paper.

TI  - MODIS-Satellite-Based Analysis of Long-Term Temporal-Spatial Dynamics and Drivers of Algal Blooms in a Plateau Lake Dianchi, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms in eutrophic lakes have been a global issue to environmental ecology. Although great progress on prevention and control of algae have been made in many lakes, systematic research on long-term temporal-spatial dynamics and drivers of algal blooms in a plateau Lake Dianchi is so far insufficient. Therefore, the algae pixel-growing algorithm (APA) was used to accurately identify algal bloom areas at the sub-pixel level on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that algal blooms were observed all year round, with a reduced frequency in winter-spring and an increased frequency in summer-autumn, which lasted a long time for about 310-350 days. The outbreak areas were concentrated in 20-80 km(2) and the top three largest areas were observed in 2002, 2008, and 2017, reaching 168.80 km(2), 126.51 km(2), and 156.34 km(2), respectively. After deriving the temporal-spatial distribution of algal blooms, principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied to explore the effects of meteorological, water quality and human activities. Of the variables analyzed, mean temperature (T-mean) and wind speed (WS) were the main drivers of daily algal bloom areas and spatial distribution. The precipitation (P), pH, and water temperature (WT) had a strong positive correlation, while WS and sunshine hours (SH) had a negative correlation with monthly maximum algal bloom areas and frequency. Total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the main influencing factors of annual frequency, initiation, and duration of algal blooms. Also, the discharge of wastewater and the southwest and southeast monsoons may contribute to the distribution of algal blooms mainly in the north of the lake. However, different regions of the lake show substantial variations, so further zoning and quantitative joint studies of influencing factors are required to more accurately understand the true mechanisms of algae in Lake Dianchi.

TI  - Sylvatic dengue virus type 4 in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes in an urban setting in Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue fever is endemic in Malaysia, contributing to significant economic and health burden in the country. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the main vectors of the dengue virus (DENV), which circulates in sylvatic and human transmission cycles and has been present in Malaysia for decades. The study investigated the presence and distribution of DENV in urban localities in the Klang Valley, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 364 Ae. aegypti and 1,025 Ae. albopictus larvae, and 10 Ae. aegypti and 42 Ae. albopictus adult mosquitoes were screened for the presence of DENV. In total, 31 (2.2%) samples were positive, of which 2 Ae. albopictus larvae were co-infected with two serotypes, one with DENV-2 and DENV-3 and the other with DENV-3 and DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the isolates belonged to DENV-1 genotype I (1 Ae. aegypti adult), DENV-2 (1 Ae. albopictus larva), DENV-3 genotype V (3 Ae. aegypti larvae and 10 Ae. albopictus larvae) and DENV-4 genotype IV (6 Ae. aegypti larvae and 12 Ae. albopictus larvae), a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 which was most closely related with sylvatic strains isolated from arboreal mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys in Peninsular Malaysia in the 1970s. All four DENV serotypes were co-circulating throughout the study period. The detection of a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia highlights the susceptibility of these vectors to infection with sylvatic DENV. The infectivity and vector competence of these urban mosquitoes to this strain of the virus needs further investigation, as well as the possibility of the emergence of sylvatic virus into the human transmission cycle.Author summary Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has re-emerged as a major public health problem in the 21(st) Century. The four serotypes of dengue virus are capable of infecting humans with a range of symptoms and clinical outcomes, with the change in predominating serotypes often responsible for new dengue outbreaks. In this study, we surveyed urban sites in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito vectors and confirmed the presence of all four serotypes of the virus. We detected the presence of genotype V of dengue serotype 3, which has previously not been reported in the country, as well as a sylvatic strain of dengue serotype 4 that was closely related to strains obtained from forest-dwelling mosquito vectors and sentinel monkeys in Malaysia. The detection of a sylvatic strain of dengue virus in urban vectors raises questions over the risk of virus transmission to humans, especially with recent reports of severe clinical cases as a result of infection with sylvatic dengue virus serotypes. Further studies will be needed to determine the source and origins of these strains as well as the severity of dengue disease upon infection, especially with the development of new dengue vaccines.

TI  - Improving Site-Specific Maize Yield Estimation by Integrating Satellite Multispectral Data into a Crop Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating remote sensing data into crop models offers opportunities for improved crop yield estimation. To compare site-specific yield estimation accuracy of a stand-alone crop model with a data-integration approach, a study was conducted in 2016-2017 with nitrogen (N)-fertilized and unfertilized treatments across a heterogeneous 7-ha maize field. For each treatment, yield data were grouped into five classes resulting in 109 spatial zones. In each zone, the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Maize model was run using the GeoSim plugin within Quantum GIS. In the data integration approach, maize biomass values estimated using satellite imagery at the five (V5) and ten (V10) leaf collar stages were used to optimize the total soil nitrogen concentration (SLNI) and soil fertility factor (SLPF) in CERES-Maize. Without integration, maize yield was simulated with root mean square error (RMSE) of 1264 kg ha(-1). Optimization of SLNI improved yield simulations at both V5 and V10. However, better simulations were obtained from optimization at V10 (RMSE 1026 kg ha(-1)) as compared to V5 (RMSE 1158 kg ha(-1)). Optimization of SLPF together with SLNI did not further improve the yield simulations. This study shows that integrating remote sensing data into a crop model can improve site-specific maize yield estimations as compared to the stand-alone crop modeling approach.

TI  - Identification of Host Blood Meals of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) Collected at the Aripo Savannas Scientific Reserve in Trinidad, West Indies
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance for blood-fed female mosquitoes was performed between August 2015 and February 2016 at sites along the periphery of the Aripo Savannas Environmentally Reserve (ASSR) located in northeastern Trinidad, West Indies. We collected engorged female mosquitoes representing 13 species. DNA extractions from dissected abdomens were subjected to PCR amplification with three primer pairs targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b gene sequences. High-quality sequence information and host identification were obtained for 42 specimens representing eight mosquito species with at least one primer combination. A broad range of vertebrates including humans were identified, but the majority were nonhuman mammals, both domestic and wild. Domestic dogs were the most common host and may represent potential sentinel species for monitoring local enzootic arbovirus activity in Trinidad. Culex declarator Dyer and Knab and Culex nigripalpus Theobald were the most common blood-fed mosquito species comprising 79.1% of the total number identified. These species obtained blood meals from birds, nonhuman mammals, and human hosts, and therefore pose significant risks as potential bridge vectors for epizootic arbovirus transmission in the ASSR area as well as other sylvan areas in Trinidad. These data represent the first such results for Trinidad.

TI  - The Impact of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Changes on Land Surface Temperature in Sivas City Center and Its Surroundings and Assessment of Urban Heat Island
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of LULC (land use/land cover) changes in urban planning studies is very important. However, LST (land surface temperature) and UHI (urban heat island) directly associated with LU changes are the parameters that should be considered in similar studies. Therefore, Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are commonly used for obtaining this kind of information. In this study, the relationship between LULC, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LST in Sivas city center and its surroundings was studied by using Landsat satellite images from 1989 to 2015 and UHI intensity was also demonstrated. The results clearly show that the urban built-up areas and agricultural lands increased while barren land decreased over the study period. The changes in LST can be monitored depending on the construction materials such as the presence of green areas, the city's unique geographical location and topography. Urban built-up and bare lands have the highest LST and the urban built-up surface temperature showed a fluctuating trend while the rural area temperature showed a tendency to decrease. The urban built-up areas increased, a positive UHI intensity was observed and also an urban heat island formation was determined.

TI  - Statistical Stability and Spatial Instability in Mapping Forest Tree Species by Comparing 9 Years of Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest composition using multiseasonal optical time series remains a challenge. Highly contrasted results are reported from one study to another suggesting that drivers of classification errors are still under-explored. We evaluated the performances of single-year Formosat-2 time series to discriminate tree species in temperate forests in France and investigated how predictions vary statistically and spatially across multiple years. Our objective was to better estimate the impact of spatial autocorrelation in the validation data on measurement accuracy and to understand which drivers in the time series are responsible for classification errors. The experiments were based on 10 Formosat-2 image time series irregularly acquired during the seasonal vegetation cycle from 2006 to 2014. Due to lot of clouds in the year 2006, an alternative 2006 time series using only cloud-free images has been added. Thirteen tree species were classified in each single-year dataset based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The performances were assessed using a spatial leave-one-out cross validation (SLOO-CV) strategy, thereby guaranteeing full independence of the validation samples, and compared with standard non-spatial leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). The results show relatively close statistical performances from one year to the next despite the differences between the annual time series. Good agreements between years were observed in monospecific tree plantations of broadleaf species versus high disparity in other forests composed of different species. A strong positive bias in the accuracy assessment (up to 0.4 of Overall Accuracy (OA)) was also found when spatial dependence in the validation data was not removed. Using the SLOO-CV approach, the average OA values per year ranged from 0.48 for 2006 to 0.60 for 2013, which satisfactorily represents the spatial instability of species prediction between years.

TI  - Numerical simulation of extreme dust storms in east of Iran by the WRF-Chem model
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran, located in the desert belt, is characterized by frequently increasing sand and dust storms, especially in the eastern and southern areas and creating adverse environmental effects. Efficient management of these devastating events requires an understanding of their features. One way to understand the dust phenomenon is to simulate and predict. The general purpose of the article is to simulate severe storms in the southeast of the country (120-day-old winds) due to the weather conditions of the region and the display of their source and range inside Iran. Aim of this study: Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry coupled model (WRF-Chem.3.6.1) is used to simulate, forecast, and design an alert system for sand and dust storm events (east of Iran). Dust concentration data were collected by Environmental Protection Organization, wind speed and direction data were gathered from the Meteorological Organization, MODIS images, and HYSPLIT model forecast was also used to investigate the path of storms and more accurately forecast and time alerting. Results showed that the main dust emission source in Sistan is the dry bed of the Hamoon wetland. Also during the storms that investigated in this study, transport of dust clouds were observed in the southern part of Iran up to Oman sea because of converging currents (north-south winds in the eastern part of Iran, especially in spring and summer) that create strong winds in lower levels of the atmosphere. The WRF-Chem model had reasonable estimations related to spatial and temporal scales in the study area. Using the global forecasted data as model input data, it was expected to observe bias in concentration estimation versus reality. The model was run for 10 and 30 km spatial resolutions, and results revealed storm formation in Sistan was affected by local geographical properties especially topography features. Based on the results obtained and the experience gained, it can be concluded that most dust storms in the Sistan region began in the late spring and will continue until early autumn season.

TI  - Potential of dust emission resources using small wind tunnel and GIS: case study of Bakhtegan playa, Iran
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of the high potential of dust emission is a requisite affair in the management of dusts emission and as well as avoiding its risks. Wind tunnel is among the most important approaches in the study of areas having high potential in emitting dusts. Extensive dried playas and desert areas require the making of low-cost, simple, and car-portable tunnels capable of presenting comparable data of various areas even supposing not having enough precision in the model of real wind motion. In this study, we first engaged in making a car-portable tunnel with a primarily semicircle section of 38 cm height, 50 cm diameter, and 110 cm length. A fan and key appliance with the ability to change speed were used along with a simple transformer launched with car battery. Then, concentration of the pm10 dusts was measured in the various wind speeds of 1, 2.5, 4, 5.5, and 7 m/s by the help of anemometer and digital equipments. The study of Bakhtegan playa was done, as the methodology of handling with this tunnel, in 35 positions, and zoning of the results was performed via ArcGIS software. Depending on the destructibility of the shell by wind, the areas under study were categorized as low potential (34%), medium potential (37%), and high potential (29%) in emitting dusts. The results of zoning spotted the high-potential areas on the map. The usage of small tunnels, as in the present model, may be applied in order for the low-cost and fast studies of vast areas to the purpose of playas management.

TI  - Rapid assessment of juniper distribution in prairie landscapes of the northern Great Plains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody plant species including eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum) are expanding throughout the prairie ecosystems of the Great Plains because of fire suppression, land management practices, and climate change. Juniper encroachment threatens native grasslands by altering soil characteristics, limiting herbaceous biomass, hindering native plant regeneration, and reducing rangeland productivity. Existing land cover products do not effectively characterize the distribution of juniper over a range of densities, making it difficult to assess the scale of the problem. We evaluated a method for rapid classification and mapping of juniper using matched filtering with Landsat 8 snow-covered and snow-free winter imagery (January-March), and snow-free spring imagery (April-June) for 2015-2016. We used data from two path/rows (29/30 and 30/30) in southeastern South Dakota and northeastern Nebraska (approximately 23,000 km(2)). In both path/rows, we found that snow-covered winter images increased contrast between juniper and the image background and resulted in the highest overall classification accuracies of 94.5% and 88.9% for juniper densities above 15%, compared to 91.4% and 85.7% for snow-free winter imagery and 57.8% and 74.1% for growing season imagery. Using winter imagery, we successfully captured pixels containing juniper density above 50% with >= 90% detection probability. However, the true positive rate dropped to less than 50% once juniper density fell below 20%. We identified 84 791 ha within the study area occupied by juniper (3.6% of the total area), including 27 504 ha in deciduous forests (33% of deciduous forest area) and 38 738 ha in grasslands (6% of grassland area).

TI  - Monitoring Harvesting by Time Series of Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algorithm for determining crop harvesting dates based on time series of coherence and backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) derived from Sentinel-1 single look complex (SLC) synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images is proposed. The algorithm allows the ability to monitor harvesting over large areas without having to install additional sensors on agricultural machinery. Coherence between SAR images allows the ability to track changes in field-scatterers configuration resulting from agricultural work. The proposed algorithm finds a step-like increase in coherence that occurs after the harvesting and is related to the conversion of a field into a bare soil area. An additional check of potential harvest dates is carried out by threshold values of sigma(0) depending on vegetation height. The algorithm is adapted for the monitoring of non-homogeneous fields with traces of erosion and insertions of fallow land. The algorithm was tested on agricultural fields located in the north of Kazakhstan. The obtained accuracy (mean absolute error = 6.5 days) of determining the dates of harvesting can be deemed satisfactory. This accuracy can be increased by shortening the interval between observations from 12 to 6 days when using data from both Sentinel-1 satellites.

TI  - Forest health assessment for geo-environmental planning and management in hilltop mining areas using Hyperion and Landsat data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on assessing the health condition of the forest using Hyperspectral and Multispectral satellite imagery and validating it with field spectra data. The field-based spectroradiometer and PCE instrument were used for collection of forest health spectra and measurement of dust accumulation on leaves respectively. In the study area, mining activities have very high potential to induce forestry health and environmental problem which necessitated a proper forest health assessment and its monitoring. The result of the Discrimination analysis (21 spectral wavebands) were used for forest health classification. The result shows that healthy forest parts are found in the upper as well as the lower hilly side of Kiriburu and Meghahatuburu mines. Some healthy pixels are located within 1.5 km from mines because it was situated off the hillside. Furthermore, it also exhibits positive relation amongst different forest health class, distance from mines and foliar dust concentration. Hyperspectral (narrow-bands) Hyperion data used with Vegetation Indices (VIs) model shows better accuracy for forest health assessment (overall accuracy 81.52%, kappa statistic 0.79) than Spectral Angle Mapper (overall accuracy 79.99%, kappa statistic 0.75) as well as Support Vector Machine (overall accuracy 76.53%, kappa statistic 0.71). It was observed that the health assessment accuracy (using SVM algorithm) achieved with Hyperion bands was significantly higher than multispectral (broad-bands) Landsat-OLI data (overall accuracy 67.27%, kappa statistic 0.62). Finally, the forest health assessment results were validated by 60 field sampled spectra data obtained from spectroradiometer. The forest health map obtained provides a guideline for geo-environmental planning and management in mining proximity forest area.

TI  - Impact assessment of land use change on surface temperature and agricultural productivity in Peshawar-Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The profound appreciation of urban expansion and land use change (LUC) considerably influences the ecosystem functions, services, and biodiversity along with the local and regional climate. Land use has undergone an awful transformation due to rapid urbanization and population growth, which in turn increased land surface temperature (LST) in district Peshawar, Pakistan. The current study tends to capture the influence of land use on LST and agricultural productivity by employing multi-temporal, multispectral satellite data and agricultural production data during the selected years, i.e., 1996, 2003, and 2016. The results demonstrated that barren land considerably decreased while the urban area increased over time in all three phases. Furthermore, significant LST difference was found in different land cover units; e.g., barren land and urban area have the maximum, while water bodies followed by vegetation retain minimum LST in all three phases, i.e., 1996, 2003, and 2016. Similarly, the results from agricultural production revealed that except for wheat crops, which decreased by 7.54% during 1999-2003, the production of all major food crops increased during the selected years. However, the production of sugar cane and barley experienced considerable reduction during the selected years, except for barley, which increased by 22.86% during 2003-2016. The finding of this study provides guidance, policy recommendations, and reference for future researchers.

TI  - Forest beta-diversity analysis by remote sensing: How scale and sensors affect the Rao's Q index
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne remote sensing missions provide robust, timely and continuous data to assess biodiversity in remote or protected areas, where direct field observations can be prohibited by difficult accessibility. The objective of this study was to extend the concept of remote sensing based assessment of beta-diversity to multi-scale domain by multi-resolution optical satellite data. This study was conducted in a reserved forest of western Himalaya, India; a region affected by the invasive Lantana camara L (lantana). We calculated and compared Rao's Q and Shannon indices at different spatial resolutions (0.5, 5, and 30 m) and scales (window sizes) by using imageries from Pleiades 1A, RapidEye, and Landsat-8 acquired in April 2013, the pre-monsoon season. Rao's Q index explained diversity more accurately than Shannon index for the three analyzed stand densities. Diversity was better approximated by Rao's Q index calculated by Pleiades 1A at a resolution of 0.5 m at low stand density. We observed higher correlations of the average coefficient of variation (CV) with Rao's Q and Shannon indices for areas associated with mixed spectral reflectance caused by overstory and understory vegetation. Furthermore, CV was lower in open areas dominated by lantana. These results indicated a strong scale and spatial resolution dependence of Rao's Q index on remote sensing-derived spectral heterogeneity information. When applied in heterogeneous forest environments, Rao's Q index could represent a better remote sensing proxy to estimate beta-diversity than the conventional Shannon index.

TI  - Clinical and Serological Evaluation of LINDA Virus Infections in Post-Weaning Piglets
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel pestivirus species known as lateral-shaking inducing neuro-degenerative agent (LINDA) virus emerged in 2015 in a piglet-producing farm in Austria. Affected piglets showed strong congenital tremor as a result of severe lesions in the central nervous system. Here, we report the results of a controlled animal infection experiment. Post-weaning piglets were infected with LINDA to determine the susceptibility of pigs, the clinical consequences of infection and the humoral immune response against LINDA. No clinically overt disease signs were observed in the piglets. Viremia was hardly detectable, but LINDA was present in the spleen and several lymphatic organs until the end of the experiment on day 28 post-infection. Oronasal virus shedding together with the infection of one sentinel animal provided additional evidence for the successful replication and spread of LINDA in the piglets. Starting on day 14 post-infection, all infected animals showed a strong humoral immune response with high titers of neutralizing antibodies against LINDA. No cross-neutralizing activity of these sera with other pestiviral species was observed. According to these data, following postnatal infection, LINDA is a rather benign virus that can be controlled by the pig's immune system. However, further studies are needed to investigate the effects of LINDA on the fetus after intrauterine infection.

TI  - Improvement of the accuracy of XBT based underwater sound speed using the unmanned maritime system and satellite remote sensing data in the Yellow Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA
M3  - Article
AB  - A logical measure is suggested to estimate an accurate Sound Speed Profile (SSP) for the unusual variation of salinity in the Yellow Sea. Based on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Aqua and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite data, this measure identifies the area of temperature inversion effect and expansion of low salinity (<30.5 psu) water. Subsequently, on the area, the Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) mounted unmanned maritime system estimates accurate SSP. In order to carry out this measure conveniently, a flow chart is demonstrated in this research. By using this measure which finds the high variational salinity area, the inaccuracy issue for calculating SSP from Expandable Bathy Thermograph (XBT) is expected to be solved.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of Chlorophyll-a and its correlation with climate and hydrological variations in Mindu Dam, Morogoro, Tanzania
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of Chlorophyll-a in aquatic systems has usually correlated to harmful algae in water bodies. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are as a result of massive proliferation of blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria). Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose threats to both the environment as well as human health, and despite this well-known fact, their monitoring and management are still challenging. Climate change, extreme weather events, and hydrological changes are the main drivers and predicted to benefits HABs dynamics in most parts of the world. In Tanzania, studies of HABs proliferation and their possible correlation with variability in climate and hydrology still lag behind despite high demand for developing predicting tools and prevention of HABs proliferation. The present study reports on the retrospective analysis of HABs variation in Mindu Dam located in Morogoro, Tanzania using remote sensing techniques. In the present study comparison between in situ measurement and ocean color (OC2) Chlorophyll-a with the surface reflectance's (band and band combinations) of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), was performed. Another approach involved searching for patterns and trends, and teleconnection between Chlorophyll-a index (best band ration) and the climate and hydrological variations in the catchment. The findings demonstrated that minimum and maximum temperatures, solar radiation, Chlorophyll-a concentration registered significant increasing trends. Wind speed and directions, water levels for Mindu Dam showed a significant decreasing trend. On the other hand, rainfall showed no trend. The patterns suggest that there are link and causality between the HABs variations and meteorological parameters such as temperatures, solar radiations, and water levels. The study, therefore, contributes to the application of recent advances in remote sensing and retrospectively analysis of bloom dynamics and search for their link with climate and hydrological changes.

TI  - Transient Deformation in California From Two Decades of GPS Displacements: Implications for a Three-Dimensional Kinematic Reference Frame
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our understanding of plate boundary deformation has been enhanced by transient signals observed against the backdrop of time-independent secular motions. We make use of a new analysis of displacement time series from about 1,000 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations in California from 1999 to 2018 to distinguish tectonic and nontectonic transients from secular motion. A primary objective is to define a high-resolution three-dimensional reference frame (datum) for California that can be rapidly maintained with geodetic data to accommodate both secular and time-dependent motions. To this end, we compare the displacements to those predicted by a horizontal secular fault slip model for the region and construct displacement and strain rate fields. Over the past 19 years, California has experienced 19 geodetically detectable earthquakes and widespread postseismic deformation. We observe postseismic strain rate variations as large as 1,000 nstrain/year with moment releases equivalent up to an Mw6.8 earthquake. We find significant secular differences up to 10 mm/year with the fault slip model, from the Mendocino Triple Junction to the southern Cascadia subduction zone, the northern Basin and Range, and the Santa Barbara channel. Secular vertical uplift is observed across the Transverse Ranges, Coastal Ranges, Sierra Nevada, as well as large-scale postseismic uplift after the 1999 Mw7.1 Hector Mine and 2010 Mw7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquakes. We also identify areas of vertical land motions due to anthropogenic, natural, and magmatic processes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the kinematic datum by improving the accuracy of high-spatial-resolution 12-day repeat-cycle Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar displacement and velocity maps.

TI  - The principles of duality in the light of the system economic theory
T2  - VOPROSY EKONOMIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper shows the diversity and significance of relations of duality among different economic systems. The composition of the principles underlying the system economic theory used for the analysis of duality in the economy is investigated. The concept of the economic system is clarified and the equivalence of three basic concepts of the economic system is shown: a) as a space-time volume ("black box"); b) as a complex of elements and connections among them; c) as a tetrad, including object, project, process and environment components. In a new way, the concept of the tetrad is revealed. The actual interpretation of the interrelationships of its components, based on the mechanisms of intersystem circulation of spatial and temporal resources and the transmission of abilities from one economic system to another, is proposed. On the basis of the obtained results, the most essential aspects of duality in the theory of economic systems are considered. It is shown that the interaction of internal content and the nearest external environment of economic systems lies in the nature of the relations of duality. A new approach to modeling the structure and to functioning of the economic system, based on the description of its activities in the form of two interconnected tetrads (the first tetrad reflects the intrasystem production cycle and the second one - the external realization-reproduction cycle) is put forward. It is shown that the concept of duality in a system economy creates prerequisites for adapting the functioning of local economic systems (objects, projects, etc.) in a market, administrative and functional environments and, as a result, harmonizing the economy as a whole.

TI  - Whither Neurotheology?
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Human culture has modernized at a much faster pace than has theology and religion. We are at the point where many moderns apparently think that religion is losing relevance. Satisfying the need for relevance and ecumenical harmony requires more reasoned and mature approaches to religion. Science is one of those secular activities that seems to undermine religious faith for many people. Unlike the sciences that give us the Big Bang, relativity, quantum mechanics, and theories of evolution, neuroscience is the one science that applies in everyday life toward developing a faith that promotes nurturing of self and others. Modern neuroscience and the mental health understanding that it creates can contribute to satisfying this need. Neuroscience and religion have numerous shared areas of concern, and each worldview can and should inform and enrich the other. Neuroscience may help us understand why we believe certain religious ideas and not others. It helps to explain our behavior and might even help us live more righteous and fulfilled lives. Religion can show neuroscientists areas of religious debate that scientific research might help resolve. New educational initiatives at all levels (secondary, seminary, and secular college) can provide a way to integrate neuroscience and religion and lead to religious perspectives that are more reasoned, mature, satisfying, and beneficial at both individual and social levels. Neurotheology is an emerging academic discipline that seems to focus on integrating neuroscience and theology. About only 10 years old, neurotheology has not yet consolidated its definition, ideology, purpose, or scholarly or applied strategies. Acceptance by the scholarly community is problematic. This manuscript raises the question of whether neurotheology will survive as a viable discipline and, if so, what form that could take.

TI  - Detection of First-Year and Multi-Year Sea Ice from Dual-Polarization SAR Images Under Cold Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new technique for automated detection of multi-year (MY) and first-year (FY) sea ice from RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization HHHV ScanSAR Wide images under cold environmental conditions. The approach is applied to 2.05 km $\times2.05$ km ($41 \times 41$ pixels) spatial window in the situation where the area is labeled as ice by our recently introduced ice and open water detection approach. The probability of the presence of MY ice is modeled as a function of the two selected predictor parameters computed over each spatial window: the HV/HH polarization ratio and the standard deviation of the HV signal. The proposed MY ice probability model was built based on thousands of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and corresponding Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis products covering the 20102016 time period, not including 2013. Our verification results for the independent testing subset for the year 2013 against the CIS Image Analysis products suggest that approximately 50 of pure MY and FY ice samples were classified with an accuracy of 98.2. The incidence angle correction of HH and HV backscatter does not improve MY and FY ice detection results in the space of the selected predictor parameters. The proposed technique will be used as part of the Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System in support of assimilation of ice thickness retrievals from Cryosat-2 and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission data.

TI  - Water Quality in Inland Water Bodies: Hostage to the Intensification of Anthropogenic Land Uses
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing stress due to diminishing freshwater resources around the world has put the world on the brink of extreme water scarcity. Moreover, the declining water quality in the available inland water resources can be attributed to various contaminations of these bodies. In recent decades, nutrient contamination has emerged as a major threat to water quality, and hence, there is need to assess and identify its potential causes. Hence, there is a need to understand the source of these nutrient contaminations in water bodies. This study addresses the extent of such contamination, through Chl-a detection on the water body using Sentinel 2A/B data, and relates it with the land use/land cover in its contributing watershed. It is hypothesized that the intensification of land use patterns-primarily agricultural and urban land uses around the inland water bodies-is potential contributors to this increasing nutrient contamination. To assess this, the paper observes the prevalent land use patterns around four inland water bodies with varied nutrient concentration-from very high to almost negligible values, across South and Southeast Asia. The study concludes that water bodies surrounded by natural land uses are almost free of contamination in comparison with those surrounded by anthropogenic land uses. It also highlights that with increased runoff from anthropogenic land uses, there is an increase in nutrient flow, thereby exponentially causing a drop in water quality in proportion to the size of the water body.

TI  - Mapping the spatial-temporal variability of tropical forests by ALOS-2 L-band SAR big data analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Insufficient knowledge about spatial-temporal forest heterogeneities in the tropics is a major impediment to better estimation of carbon storage and prevention of forest loss by remote sensing. Seasonality induced fluctuations can severely impede the reliability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications like forest classification, deforestation detection and biomass estimation. In the past, the seasonality effects on SAR data acquired over tropical forests have been largely ignored due to the lack of consistent time-series data for the entire region. To overcome this knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive statistical assessment of L-band SAR backscatter variability in tropical forests by means of a homogeneous big data analysis on multitemporal ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 dual-polarization ScanSAR data. Virtually the entire tropical forest region was monitored from 2016 to 2018 with 42 days intervals. Approximately 250 TB of ScanSAR data were computed on a 0.05 decimal degrees grid to produce forest maps which provide more detailed and reliable information about the spatial and temporal behavior of tropical forests. The first, easy to understand global forest variability maps provide unseen insights into forest structures for the entire tropical belt from local to continental scale. While the differences between the evergreen rainforest and the (semi-) deciduous dry forest is obviously large in the spatial domain, in the temporal domain seasonal changes can easily cause variations in the same order of magnitude within the same forest class. Depending on the area, natural environmental factors like flooding or leaf shedding can result in seasonal gamma naught ranges exceeding 3 dB in both HH and HV polarization. The findings of this study should have important implications for all future remote sensing research efforts on tropical forests. With drastically increasing availability of more frequent high-resolution L-band observations in the coming decade, these characteristic forest variabilities must be considered in the development of active and passive microwave remote sensing algorithms. The better understanding of the underlying dynamics and processes is expected to improve forest remote sensing applications for the upcoming L-band SAR satellite generation including ALOS-4, NISAR, and Tandem-L.

TI  - Features of the ideological mechanism of the modern Russian state
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the study is to determine the range of ideological apparatuses used by the Russian state, the applied set of methods of ideological influence, as well as the features and causes of the ideological orientation of the ruling elite. The work analyses such ideological apparatus of the state as the mass media (newspapers, magazines, TV and radio channels); educational institutions (schools, state educational institutions of higher and secondary vocational education); political parties, public associations, trade unions; film industry (producing and distributing television and film), as well as people of art (filmmakers, writers, artists); church; press and PR services. The features of their relationship with the ruling establishment and the type and content of the used ideological influence are determined. For example, the majority of the media belongs to the media holdings, which in turn are controlled by the economic and political establishment (the state). In addition, there are examples of ideological influence in textbooks, films, public actions. It also briefly describes the "trolling" organizations ("troll factories"), whose activities are aimed at the consciousness of the Internet users. The ruling establishment actively and effectively uses all the possibilities of the ideological apparatus in their class interests. The reason for the lack of a clear and non-vague ideology (like the Soviet one) is, first, the social heterogeneity of the ruling establishment, which also gives rise to different ideological positions, and, second, the opposite situation would only aggravate the legitimacy crisis of the existing political regime. None of the worldview models of the modern ideological spectrum is able to ensure the legitimacy of the ruling establishment, on the one hand, and to eliminate the discrepancies between the declared and social practices, on the other hand.

TI  - On the Addressee as a Key Category of Courtroom Discourse
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the role of the addressee as a category determining courtroom discursive practices of legal professionals. The material for this study was texts of closing arguments of Russian and American lawyers available on Internet websites as well as transcripts of closing arguments written by the author in court sessions. It is emphasized that the idea about taking into account the addressee's role runs through the works of many Russian and foreign researchers (W. Chafe, G.G. Clark and T.B. Carlson, R. Stolnayker, N.D. Arutyunova, T.V. Chernyshova, et al.). However, the problem of the addressee in courtroom discourses has not been studied yet. The important role of this factor makes it necessary to take into account effects of the addressee on the discursive construction of the world, to identify the main linguistic and cognitive mechanisms optimizing the communicative interaction of the speaker and the addressee in the courtroom. The focus on the Other, taking into account peculiarities of its phenomenological experience and knowledge makes legal discursive practices dialogical, intensifies their interactive characteristics. Special attention is paid to the linguistic cognitive mechanism "transition from the term to the notion", which allows the formation of the common interpretation context in the process of communication of professional and non-professional participants of courtroom proceedings. Clarity of judicial speeches is determined by the ability of the speaker to take into account the addressee and switch from the language of the expert community to the language of lay people, define legal terms through lay concepts. The scientific novelty of the research is due to the choice of the research trajectory which is based on the issue of the addressee's role for producing courtroom discourses. The issue of discursive interaction and methods of its optimization is significant for sociolinguistics and communication theory. The article concludes that the perlocutionary effect of speech is determined by the degree of orientation of the speaker towards the addressee, the adequacy of the addressee's hypothetical image. Mutual understanding is the result of joint efforts of interlocutors aimed at harmonizing individual points of view. In order to establish contact, the speaker must have a correct image of the addressee using information about their social and cognitive status, worldview and emotional attitudes.

AB  - Multistatic or distributed satellite systems offer new and unique capabilities necessary for Earth observation with high spatial and temporal resolution. This letter describes a multistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) experiment employing the satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. In order to demonstrate distributed SAR imaging from space, special data acquisitions with a dedicated geometry were performed. The data evaluation approach is outlined and azimuth profiles over a region with high-contrast backscatter are used to evaluate the azimuth signal reconstruction performance. The results are verified with simulations performed with a flexible SAR simulator reproducing the acquired scene. Finally, the effect of target motion on the reconstruction is analyzed and discussed based on the experimental data.

TI  - Studying the Present-Day Dynamics of Lena Delta by Space Images
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of Lena delta coastline since the late XX century up to the present time have been studied using Landsat satellite data. The comparison of different-time images of morphologically different segments of the delta coastline has shown the major portion of the delta to be stable. Minimal changes have been recorded near the mouths of the branches carrying a minor portion of the Lena runoff-the Olenekskaya and Tumatskie. In the eastern part of the delta, near the mouths of copious branches Trofimovskaya and Bykovskaya, no changes have taken place, as well as in its western part, which is represented by a part of abrasion marine terrace embraced by the delta. In the southwestern part, in the Olenek delta, the delta coastline has been eroded with the erosion material transported eastward by along-shore current. Near the mouths of the Tumatskaya branch, the forms of marine accumulation are unstable, and the marine terrace in the northeastern part of the delta shows a minor local erosion. The periods of erosion in different delta areas are not synchronous and the eroded zones are not large in size. No increment in the land, nor shore progradation have been seen.

TI  - Religious features of the ethnic tradition of the Ossetians in the conditions of social modernization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, according to the folklore legend "The Tale of the Lonely"
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes transformation processes in the Ossetian ethnic tradition that resulted from the modernization of the Great Reforms era. While the article covers the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the changes in question stretched beyond these limits, being complex in nature and increasing gradually. As mountainous Ossetia was drawn into the orbit of Russian influence the ethnic isolation was ended, and certain aspects of the tradition changed. The period of Great Reforms contributed to the strengthening of capitalist development in the Russian Empire. This period provided significant changes not only in the economic but also in the socio-cultural life of the Ossetian highlanders. We observe a gradual modernization of the archaic tradition of the ethnos at that time. This transformation of the traditional ethnic worldview of the Ossetian highlanders is reflected in various narrative sources. In particular the folk legends recorded by representatives of the educated part of Ossetian society carry significant information. The bearers of oral folklore - the inhabitants of mountainous Ossetia - often introduced new realities into the narratives, elements that were atypical for the archaic consciousness. Folk legends therefore constitute an important source for studying the processes of modernization of the traditional consciousness. The present article studies these processes with the folklore legend The Tale of the Lonely recorded in the nineteenth century, which reflects ideological transformations characteristic of the ethnic consciousness in this period.

TI  - Summer and winter coccolithophore blooms in the Black Sea and their impact on production of dissolved organic matter from Bio-Argo data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bio-Argo measurements of the backscattering coefficient (bbp) were used to investigate the time-depth evolution of coccolithophore blooms in the Black Sea. Five years of Bio-Argo data obtained in 2014-2018 revealed two distinct peaks of bbp corresponding to the winter and early summer coccolithophore blooms. The latter started in the upper mixed layer (UML) in April-May and was characterized by the highest coccolithophore concentrations. During the most extensive summer bloom in 2017, its estimates reach 10 x 10(6) cells l(-1). The summer blooms occupied the UML (0-10 m) and a seasonal thermocline (10-30 m). The lower boundary of the bloom was related to the position of isopycnal 1014 kg m(-3), which deepens in May-July due to summer heating. Consequently, the coccolithophore bloom deepened to 20-30 m and terminated rapidly in July. Bloom termination was accompanied by a significant rise in light attenuation (kd) in the sea basin. This peak was attributed to the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which was possibly related to viral lysis and the exudation of lipids from coccolithophore cells. Data on the kd was used to estimate the seasonal variability in DOC in the Black Sea. Maximal estimated values of DOC were observed at 15-35 m depth in June-August and coincided with the early summer coccolithophore bloom termination.The winter coccolithophore bloom started in October-November in the UML. The maximum bbp was observed in January. High values of bbp were observed down to a depth of 60 m during the maximal deepening of the mixed layer. The winter blooms were distinctly observed in MODIS satellite images, where they were characterized by high reflectance and relatively low chlorophyll concentrations. The estimated coccolithophore concentration in winter was lower than that in summer, but column-averaged bbp values were comparable. The winter coccolithophore bloom reached a peak within one month after the autumn peak of chlorophyll A, indicating the possible importance of the nutrients recycled after the diatom autumn bloom. In contrast to summer, the maximum DOC observed at the surface preceded the winter coccolithophore bloom, and the mass DOC production was probably attributed to the excretion and lysis of the non-calcified phytoplankton cells.

TI  - On Quad-Polarized SAR Measurements of the Ocean Surface
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides improved quantitative estimates of the wind-ruffled roughness contributions to dual co- and cross-polarized radar signals. Expanding previous approaches, 1696 RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements, co-located with 65 in situ National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy observations, are analyzed. Considering all wind conditions, the impact of breaking and near-breaking waves on dual co- and cross-polarized radar signals is robustly documented. For VV polarized measurements, the contribution of breaking waves decreased from 60% to 20% with increasing incidence angle, whereas for HH polarization and cross-polarization measurements, it can amount to about 60%-70% for all incidence angles. Building on the large analyzed data set, robust empirical dependencies between breaking waves and their impact on co- and cross-pol signals are then derived, as functions of wind speeds, incidence angles, and azimuth directions.

AB  - Background Nodal observation is safe for patients with microscopic melanoma metastasis in a sentinel lymph node (LN). Complete LN dissection (CLND) remains the standard of care for patients with clinically evident LN (cLN) metastases, even though about 40% have only one pathologic LN (pLN). We sought to identify clinical features associated with having one pLN among patients with cLNs. Methods Patients at three melanoma centers who underwent CLND for cLNs were identified. Clinicopathologic and imaging characteristics associated with one pLN were determined by multivariable logistic regression and classification tree analysis. Results Of 190 patients, 90 (47.4%) had one pLN and 100 (52.6%) had more than one pLN. By multivariable logistic regression, extremity versus truncal primary (odds ratio [OR] 2.15, p = 0.012), axillary versus superficial inguinal location (OR 3.89, p = 0.009), and preoperative cross-sectional imaging demonstrating more than one versus one cLN (OR 17.1, p < 0.001) were associated with more than one pLN. The negative predictive value for additional pathologic nodal disease of preoperative imaging was 70.9%, increasing to 74.4% for positron emission tomography/computed tomography. In the subgroup of patients with one cLN, the classification tree identified two groups with < 10% risk of additional pLNs: (1) Breslow thickness > 6.55 mm (n = 17); and (2) if unknown primary or Breslow thickness <= 6.55 mm, then LN diameter > 1.8 cm in the inguinal location (n = 22). Conclusion The majority of patients with one cLN from melanoma by preoperative imaging will harbor no additional pathologic nodes on CLND. Safety of nodal observation after clinical nodal excision in these patients, particularly in an era of effective adjuvant therapies, deserves prospective evaluation.

TI  - Methods and Challenges Using Multispectral and Hyperspectral Images for Practical Change Detection Applications
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) images have been successfully and widely used in remote sensing applications such as target detection, change detection, and anomaly detection. In this paper, we aim at reviewing recent change detection papers and raising some challenges and opportunities in the field from a practitioner's viewpoint using MS and HS images. For example, can we perform change detection using synthetic hyperspectral images? Can we use temporally-fused images to perform change detection? Some of these areas are ongoing and will require more research attention in the coming years. Moreover, in order to understand the context of our paper, some recent and representative algorithms in change detection using MS and HS images are included, and their advantages and disadvantages will be highlighted.

TI  - Working towards confident spaceborne monitoring of carbon emissions from cities using Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are responsible for 70% of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (FFCO2), and these emissions are poorly monitored. As a result, the use of spaceborne observation as a tool for addressing urban FFCO2 emissions has intensified. This work aims to understand the suitability of modern spaceborne remote sensing for capturing CO2 urban enhancement and for monitoring FFCO2 emissions from cities. We have used the first four years of observations from NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) to collect CO2 urban anomalies (XCO2ano) from large cities (> 500 km(2) area) by combining urban-to-rural gradient and statistical filtering approaches. Approximately half of all XCO2ano (44%) were significant and noise-free to meet the accuracy requirements for city-scale applications. We captured positive CO2 enhancement over urban areas compared to background at a global scale. Median XCO2ano estimates were positive at 1.07 +/- 0.80 ppm (worldwide), 1.05 +/- 0.80 ppm (Northern Hemisphere), and 0.96 +/- 0.80 ppm (Southern Hemisphere). Most monthly XCO2ano (similar to 83%) emerged in four regions of the Northern Hemisphere (East Asia, Europe, North America, and South Asia), where most cities with strong emissions are located. We report that the XCO2ano from numerous cities have a moderate linear relationship with city size (r = 0.54-0.65) and FFCO2 strength (r = 0.64). As expected, five out of the six strongest XCO2ano were found over the megacities ( > 10 million population) of Los Angeles (2.04 +/- 0.91 ppm), Tehran (1.94 +/- 1.54 ppm), Rhine-Main Metropolitan Area (1.51 +/- 0.59 ppm), Pearl River Delta (1.48 +/- 1.11 ppm), and Seoul (1.47 +/- 1.72 ppm), with Houston (1.50 +/- 0.72 ppm) as the only non-megacity. Overall, we have shown that spaceborne remote sensing of XCO2 is suitable for capturing CO2 enhancement over a wide range of cities (especially in the Northern Hemisphere). Though we registered the global-scale urban footprint in CO2 signal and demonstrated the sensitivity of XCO2ano to city size and FFCO2, spaceborne remote sensing is still limited in its provision of columnar CO2 enhancement which is fundamentally linked with underlying urban emissions. This linkage may be more effectively addressed when spaceborne remote sensing becomes increasingly optimized for city-scale applications.

TI  - Analysis of Tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide Using Satellite and Ground Based Data over Northern Thailand
T2  - ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric NO2 columns over northern Thailand were analyzed using monthly satellite products of the SCIMACHY, OMI, GOME-2A, and GOME-2B sensors for the 14-year period 2003-2016. The comparative results of the four pairs of different satellite datasets within overlapped years showed that they were well correlated with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.85-0.90 when the analysis was considered only during the dry period. Ground measurements of NO2 concentrations were also obtained for comparative analysis with the satellite NO2 columns. The results revealed relatively good agreement between these two parameters for a seasonal pattern. High levels of NO2 were detected during January April. Overall, the r-values of the satellite and ground datasets during the dry period were in the range 0.54-0.81. Moreover, most satellite and ground datasets recorded greater levels of NO2 in the afternoon than in the morning corresponding with the number of fire hotspots. Satellite and ground measurements showed slightly increasing trends of NO2 levels during dry months for 2010-2016 with values of 7.23% and 0.48%, respectively, over the 6-year period. The results in this study suggest that integrating satellite and ground data would provide valuable information for air quality managers to better understand the spatiotemporal distribution of NO2 which is essential for setting air quality policy and mitigation plan in Thailand.

TI  - Constrained Distance-Based Clustering for Satellite Image Time-Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of high-resolution instruments for time-series sampling poses added complexity for the formal definition of thematic classes in the remote sensing domain-required by supervised methods-while unsupervised methods ignore expert knowledge and intuition. Constrained clustering is becoming an increasingly popular approach in data mining because it offers a solution to these problems; however, its application in remote sensing is relatively unknown. This article addresses this divide by adapting publicly available constrained clustering implementations to use the dynamic time warping (DTW) dissimilarity measure, which is sometimes used for time-series analysis. A comparative study is presented, in which their performance is evaluated (using both DTW and Euclidean distances). It is found that adding constraints to the clustering problem results in an increase in accuracy when compared to unconstrained clustering. The output of such algorithms are homogeneous in spatially defined regions. Declarative approaches and k-means-based algorithms are simple to apply, requiring little or no choice of parameter values. Spectral methods, however, require careful tuning, which is unrealistic in a semisupervised setting, although they offer the highest accuracy. These conclusions were drawn from two applications: crop clustering using 11 multispectral Landsat images nonuniformly sampled over a period of eight months in 2007; and tree-cut detection using 10 NDVI Sentinel-2 images nonuniformly sampled between 2016 and 2018.

TI  - An inter-comparison exercise of Sentinel-2 radiometric validations assessed by independent expert groups
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation and Monitoring programme, delivering free access to operational and historical environmental data to support applications in a wide range of societal benefit areas. To allow meaningful long-term environmental monitoring and robust decision-making, it is essential to ensure that satellite-retrieved products are of high quality and consistency. This paper describes the outputs of an international workshop on the radiometric calibration validation of the Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B Multi-Spectral Instrument. A wide range of vicarious methodologies have been applied independently and then compared per type of target. All methods agree on the good radiometric performance of both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B with respect to the mission requirements as well as on evidence of a slight bias between the two instruments. Comparisons of all these results are discussed to highlight the benefits and advantages of the methods as well as to propose potential improvements either for the methods themselves and/or for the comparison exercise.

TI  - Country-wide high-resolution vegetation height mapping with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images collected over periods of several months were used to estimate vegetation height for Gabon and Switzerland. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to extract suitable spectral and textural features from reflectance images and to regress per-pixel vegetation height. In Gabon, reference heights for training and validation were derived from airborne LiDAR measurements. In Switzerland, reference heights were taken from an existing canopy height model derived via photogrammetric surface reconstruction. The resulting maps have a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.7 m in Switzerland and 4.3 m in Gabon (a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.4 m and 5.6 m, respectively), and correctly estimate vegetation heights up to >50 m. They also show good qualitative agreement with existing vegetation height maps. Our work demonstrates that, given a moderate amount of reference data (i.e., 2000 km(2) in Gabon and approximate to 5800 km(2) in Switzerland), high-resolution vegetation height maps with 10 m ground sampling distance (GSD) can be derived at country scale from Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Impact of Residual Nodal Disease Burden on Technical Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Node-Positive (cN1) Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Recent trials have demonstrated the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cN1 breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This study evaluated the technical outcomes of SLNB by residual nodal disease volume.Methods. From a prospective database, cT1-3 cN1 patients receiving NAC and surgery from 2016 to 2017 were identified. Performance measures of post-NAC physical exam and imaging-based axillary assessment were compared. For the patients who converted to cN0 and underwent SLNB, adequate mapping (defined as >= 3 SLN) and the false-negative rate (FNR) of intraoperative SLN evaluation were assessed by residual nodal disease volume (ypN1-3 vs ypN0[i+]/ypN1mi vs ypN0).Results. Of 156 cT1-3 cN1 patients, 96 converted to cN0 and underwent SLNB. Adequate mapping was achieved for 64 patients (66.7%) and was not associated with nodal volume (p = 0.12). The FNR of the intraoperative SLN evaluation was 37.8%, and smaller nodal volume was associated with FNR (p < 0.01). Of 36 patients (37.5%) who achieved an axillary pathologic complete response, 24 (66.7%) had three or more negative SLNs and were safely spared axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The positive predictive values of physical exam versus imaging-based post-NAC nodal assessment were respectively 88% and 69.8%.Conclusions. This study showed SLNB to be an effective tool for minimizing axillary surgery in cN1 patients treated with NAC. However, important technical limitations exist, such as inability to identify three SLNs in more than two-thirds of patients and high-false negative rates for intraoperative SLN evaluation, particularly for patients with small residual nodal volumes. Preoperative counseling should include realistic assessment of the potential need for ALND in this population.

TI  - Correcting Position Error in Precipitation Data Using Image Morphing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall estimates based on satellite data are subject to errors in the position of the rainfall events in addition to errors in their intensity. This is especially true for localized rainfall events such as the convective rainstorms that occur during the monsoon season in sub-Saharan Africa. Many satellite-based estimates use gauge information for bias correction. However, bias adjustment methods do not correct the position errors explicitly. We propose to gauge-adjust satellite-based estimates with respect to the position using a morphing method. Image morphing transforms an image, in our case a rainfall field, into another one, by applying a spatial transformation. A benefit of this approach is that it can take both the position and the intensity of a rain event into account. Its potential is investigated with two case studies. In the first case, the rain events are synthetic, represented by elliptic shapes, while the second case uses real data from a rainfall event occurring during the monsoon season in southern Ghana. In the second case, the satellite-based estimate IMERG-Late (Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM ) is adjusted to gauge data from the Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory (TAHMO) network. The results show that the position errors can be corrected, while preserving the higher spatial variability of the satellite-based estimate.

TI  - Marginality in the socio-philosophical and juridical dimensions: the experience of an interdisciplinary approach
T2  - REVISTA SAN GREGORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the problem of social marginality, considered in the research key of social philosophy and the general theory of law. In recent decades, the socio-cultural reality has been significantly transformed: in the life of modern society penetrated the latest information technologies that have arisen due to the rapid development of electronics, in addition, there was the formation and spread of a new type of attitude and worldview, which was conceptualized in the philosophical, cultural, religious and other practices of globalizing space today. The epistemic field that exists between the two disciplinary practices (theory of law and social philosophy) allows us to see marginalization as an epiphenomenon of transformations of modern society.The authors begin their theoretical and applied study of marginality with a comprehensive study of its generic property, i.e. with a study of marginality as such. In this paper, we analyze the semantic and etymological meanings of marginality, consider a wide range of philosophical, sociological and historiographic issues, legal aspects that explain the generic properties of marginality, which allows, in the authors' opinion, to identify the essential and cognitive aspects of this phenomenon, to establish a causal complex of mutual influence marginality on the state of social order as well as offense, and vice versa

TI  - Detection of <i>Myocoptes musculinus</i> in Fur Swab and Fecal Samples by Using PCR Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Current methods for detecting mites in mouse colonies have limitations in terms of cost, accuracy, and throughput. To address these limitations, we developed PCR assays to detect Myocoptes musculinus in fecal samples. Using a newly generated ribosomal RNA sequence of M. musculinus (MC28S), we developed PCR and qPCR assays capable of detecting M. musculinus mites or eggs ingested during grooming. To determine our ability to detect mites, we tested fur swabs and feces from mouse colonies experimentally infested with M. musculinus and Demodex musculi, 2) Myobia musculi and Radfordia affinis, 3) M. musculinus and M. musculi, and 4) no mites (negative control). The MC28S PCR and qPCR assays positively identified M. musculinus in groups 1 and 3. The MC28S PCR assay detected M. musculinus in 9 of 10 fecal samples from known-positive animals, whereas the qPCR assay correctly identified M. musculinus in all 10 fecal samples. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of PCR-based detection of murine mites in feces. By eliminating the need for pelt examinations, mite detection from fecal samples can facilitate mite detection in sentinel or quarantine programs.

TI  - Improved Dust Emission Reduction Factor in the ADAM2 Model Using Real-Time MODIS NDVI
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korea Meteorological Administration has employed the Asian Dust Aerosol Model 2 (ADAM2) to forecast Asian dust events since 2010, where the dust emission flux is proportional to the fourth power of the friction velocity. Currently, the dust emission reduction factor (RF) is determined by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study aims to improve the forecasting capability of ADAM2 by developing a daily dust RF using both monthly (January 2007 to December 2016) and real-time moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data. We also developed a look-up table to transform the RF using NDVI and a system to update the RF by producing MODIS NDVI data for the last 30 days. Using these data, new RFs can be produced every day. To examine the impact of RF modification, the current (CTL) and new (EXP) RFs are compared during the period from March to May 2017. The simulations are verified by ground-based PM10 observations from China and Korea. Accordingly, root mean square errors (RMSEs) are reduced by 11.58% when RF is updated using real-time NDVI data. The results suggest that recent daily NDVI data contribute positively to the forecasting ability of ADAM2, in the dust source and downwind regions.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of PSD Slope Under the Influence of Sand Dredging Activities in Lake Hongze Based on Landsat-8/OLI Data and VIIRS/DNB Night-Time Light Composite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle size distribution (PSD) is an important characterization parameter of the particle size structure of suspended particles, which is vulnerable to human activities such as sand dredging. In this study, sand dredging numbers were evaluated by the accumulated radiance algorithm using the night-time light composite data of the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite, and the PSD slope was derived by band ratio algorithm of Landsat-8/operational land imager (OLI) imagery. Then, the influence of sand mining on PSD slope was analyzed. We draw several crucial findings. First, the ratio of R-rs(Red) to R-rs(Green) based on OLI imagery was capable of retrieving PSD slope with good robustness (R-2 - 0.71, p < 0.01, n = 41) and verified acceptance (mean absolute percentage error = 4.29%, root mean square error = 0.19, n = 20), and the PSD slope in HZL was lower in summer than in the other seasons from 2014 to 2017. Second, The night active vessels extracted from the night-time images show that sand dredging activities began at the outlet of Chengzi Lake (CZL) in April 2012, spread to the whole lake between 2014 and 2016, and then stopped in the northeast region in March 2017 due to the strict control of the local government. Third, the PSD slope is strongly influenced by sand mining, which is positively correlated with the number of sand dredgers (R-2 = 0.92), i.e., the PSD slope increases 0.21 per 100 working sand dredgers in CZL.

TI  - Has Dongying developed to a ghost city? - Evidence from multi-temporal population estimation based on VHR remote sensing and census counts
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With ongoing growth and continuous development of cities, the world is turning into an urban society. In this context, urbanization, population growth and migration towards urban areas are global trends. These processes are highly dynamic especially in China, with highest rates of urbanization worldwide. In contrast to these well-known trends, a recently emerging and rarely studied side effect is "ghost cities", which became a notable phenomenon in China recently. A ghost city is commonly defined as a new urban development that is running at severe undercapacity with respect to population and businesses and where the availability of housing and public infrastructure significantly exceeds the practical demand. Against this background, this study presents a framework based on remote sensing for the assessment of the presence or absence of the ghost city phenomenon in a typical highly dynamic Chinese city. For this purpose, remote sensing data with very-high resolution (VHR) are employed for establishment of a 4d functional city model. Subsequently population capacity estimates are based on a statistical approach. The components of the functional 4d city model, i.e. the multi-temporal building model and the classification of building types associated with residential and non-residential function returned very high accuracies with kappa of 0.73 and 0.89, respectively. The number of floors was estimated with coefficient of determination of 0.91. Compared to the numbers of official census counts, the multi-temporal population capacity estimation revealed a considerable mismatch of available living space based on VHR remote sensing data and actual population counts. According to the conceptual framework of this study, this disagreement indicates a high likelihood and significant evidence for the emergence and presence of the ghost city phenomenon for the city of Dongying. In addition, a detailed spatial assessment was conducted in terms of an index comparing the dynamics of residential developments and population numbers to provide an impression of specific regions of the urban area which are most likely to suffer from the ghost city phenomenon.

TI  - Lymph node identification in skin malignancy using indocyanine green transcutaneously study Study protocol for a diagnostic accuracy study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The incidence of malignant melanoma has been rising steadily over the past decades and Merkel cell carcinoma is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumor with a high mortality rate. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a recommended prognostic tool in primary cutaneous malignant melanomas of intermediate thickness and in all clinically node-negative Merkel cell carcinomas. The gold standard method for identification of SLNs is lymphoscintigraphy, which involves radioactive tracers. Indocyanine green-based near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) has been also used for intraoperative SLN identification. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of the VisionSense VS3 NIRFI device for SNL identification. This device uses stereoscopic 3D high definition for both fluorescence and visible light imaging. Our hypothesis is that SLNs may be identified transcutaneously using fluorescent dye injections and NIRFI; therefore, obviating the need for lymphoscintigraphy in the future.Methods and analysis: lymph node identification in skin malignancy using indocyanine green transcutaneously is a prospective diagnostic sensitivity study conducted at the Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery at the University Hospital Berne, Inselspital, Switzerland. The study aims at recruiting 93 patients (start date September 2017) to compare the accuracy of VisionSense VS3 camera at identifying SLNs transcutaneously with the current gold standard, lymphoscintigraphy. Moreover, a secondary objective is to determine if anatomical location of the SLN and patient factors (eg, body mass index, age) have an impact on the ability of VisionSense to detect SLNs when compared with the same gold standard.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations of Carbon Use Efficiency in Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems and the Relationship with Climatic Factors in the Songnen Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Songnen Plain (SNP) is an important grain production base, and is designated as an ecological red-line as a protected area in China. Natural ecosystems such as the ecological protection barrier play an important role in maintaining the productivity and sustainability of farmland. Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to gross primary productivity (GPP), represents the ecosystem capacity of transferring carbon from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass. The understanding of the CUE of natural ecosystems in protected farmland areas is vital to predicting the impact of global change and human disturbances on carbon budgets and evaluating ecosystem functions. To date, the changes in CUE at different time scales and their relationships with climatic factors have yet to be fully understood. CUE and the response to land surface phenology are also deserving attention. In this study, variations in ecosystem CUE in the SNP during 2001-2015 were investigated using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP and NPP data products estimated using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model. The relationships between CUE and phenological and climate factors were explored. The results showed that ecosystem CUE fluctuated over time in the SNP. The lowest and highest CUE values mainly occurred in May and October, respectively. At seasonal scale, average CUE followed a descending order of Autumn > Summer > Spring. The CUE of mixed forest was greater than that of other ecosystems at both monthly and seasonal scales. Land surface phenology plays an important role in the regulation of CUE. The earlier start (SOS), the later end (EOS) and longer length (LOS) of the growing season would contribute increasing of CUE. Precipitation and temperature affected CUE positively in most areas of the SNP. These findings help explain the CUE of natural ecosystems in the protected farmland areas and improve our understanding of ecosystem carbon allocation dynamics in temperate semi-humid to semi-arid transitional region under climate and phenological fluctuations.

TI  - Extending the Ability of Near-Infrared Images to Monitor Small River Discharge on the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge gauging is scarce in high mountainous regions, especially on the Tibetan Plateau, where rivers are widely distributed. Although remote sensing is an important mean of monitoring river discharge, previous methods are most suitable for large rivers, and the ability to monitor small rivers (with widths less than 100 m) is limited. To resolve this issue, a multiple pixel ratio (MPR) method is presented for monitoring the discharge of small rivers based on the relationship between river discharge and the near-infrared reflectivity. Utilizing 281 Landsat images (1990-2015), we monitored river discharges in two subbasins in the upstream region of the Heihe River located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that the performance of the MPR method is more stable than the previous calibration/measurement method. The monitoring accuracy was correlated with the length and location of the selected inundated river channel. Using selected inundated river channel lengths between 300 and 600m can provide better monitoring accuracy. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of monitoring results (2013-2014) of Qilian station was 0.82; the Zhamashike station (2015) was 0.45; the two stations multiyears (1990-2013) monitoring results were 0.32 and 0.41; the ungauged basin was 0.45. Our results suggest that the MPR method can expand the ability of remote sensing to monitor discharge in small rivers with widths greater than 30 m on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the new method also has the potential to monitor the discharge of ungauged small rivers (with widths greater than 30 m).

TI  - Filtering algorithms of HJ-1 A / B NDVI time series data and phenology of typical tree species in Xiamen
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series analysis can reveal the phenological changes of vegetation cover. With the characteristics of high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, HJ-1 A/B satellite can provide abundant time series optical data for the application and analysis of phenological characteristics of tree species at the medium and small scales. In this study, we used Savizky.Glolay (S.G) filtering method and Harmonic Analysis of NDVI Time-Series (Hants) to reconstruct 58 HJ-1 NDVI time series data curves of eight typical tree species in Xiamen City. Mean value, mean absolute error and correlation coefficient were selected to quantitatively evaluate the filtered results. Phenological characteristics of the eight tree species were analyzed using NDVI ratio. We further examined the effects of meteorological factors including temperature and precipitation on NDVI time series fluctuation of the eight tree species. The results showed that both S.G and Hants filtering methods can restore the NDVI fluctuation shape of the vegetation characteristic of obvious phenological changes, with Hants filter being the best choice due to its ideal smoothness effect. The filtered NDVI curves showed that NDVI values of all the tree species except Eucalyptus urophylla were at a high level. The intra-annual fluctua. tion of NDVI time series was not intense, with obvious double peaks. Moreover, the NDVI values peaked firstly in May and June, and then declined in July and August. The second peak occurred in October, which was lower than the first peak. The growth period of all the species lasted for 7-8 months. Except that E. urophylla entered growth period at the end of February, the other tree species entered growth period at the end of April, ended in November, and reached the growth peak in July. In addition, tree growth was sensitive to the abrupt drop of precipitation in July. The lag period of such responses differed among tree species, with differences in the speed of growth reduction, but most of the species had low values of NDVI ratio in August. Our results provide reference for the selection of filtering methods for HJ-1 A/B NDVI time series data, characteri. zing the phenology of typical tree species, and fine classification of tree species in subtropical regions.

TI  - Incorporating the Plant Phenological Trajectory into Mangrove Species Mapping with Dense Time Series Sentinel-2 Imagery and the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on mangrove species composition and distribution is key to studying functions of mangrove ecosystems and securing sustainable mangrove conservation. Even though remote sensing technology is developing rapidly currently, mapping mangrove forests at the species level based on freely accessible images is still a great challenge. This study built a Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (from 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31) to represent phenological trajectories of mangrove species and then demonstrated the feasibility of phenology-based mangrove species classification using the random forest algorithm in the Google Earth Engine platform. It was found that (i) in Zhangjiang estuary, the phenological trajectories (NDVI time series) of different mangrove species have great differences; (ii) the overall accuracy and Kappa confidence of the classification map is 84% and 0.84, respectively; and (iii) Months in late winter and early spring play critical roles in mangrove species mapping. This is the first study to use phonological signatures in discriminating mangrove species. The methodology presented can be used as a practical guideline for the mapping of mangrove or other vegetation species in other regions. However, future work should pay attention to various phenological trajectories of mangrove species in different locations.

TI  - Impacts of Rapid Socioeconomic Development on Cropping Intensity Dynamics in China during 2001-2016
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in cropping intensity reflect not only changes in land use but also the transformation of land functions. Although both natural conditions and socioeconomic factors can influence the spatial distribution of the cropping intensity and its changes, socioeconomic developments related to human activities can exert great impacts on short term cropping intensity changes. The driving force of this change has a high level of uncertainty; and few researchers have implemented comprehensive studies on the underlying driving forces and mechanisms of these changes. This study produced cropping intensity maps in China from 2001 to 2016 using remote sensing data and analyzed the impacts of socioeconomic drivers on cropping intensity and its changes in nine major agricultural zones in China. We found that the average annual cropping intensity in all nine agricultural zones increased from 2001 to 2016 under rapid socioeconomic development, and the trends in the seven major agricultural zones were significantly increased (p < 0.05), based on a Mann-Kendall test, except for the Northeast China Plain (NE Plain) and Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QT Plateau). Based on the results from the Geo-Detector, a widely used geospatial analysis tool, the dominant factors that affected cropping intensity distribution were related to the arable land output in the plain regions and topography in the mountainous regions. The factors that affected cropping intensity changes were mainly related to the arable land area and crop yields in northern China, and regional economic developments, such as machinery power input and farmers' income in southern China. These findings provide useful cropping intensity data and profound insights for policymaking on how to use cultivated land resources efficiently and sustainably.

TI  - Dynamic Waterline Mapping of Inland Great Lakes Using Time-Series SAR Data From GF-3 and S-1A Satellites: A Case Study of DJK Reservoir, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Great inland freshwater lakes play an important role in regulating inland water resources, and the usage of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for the accurate waterline mapping is an effective technical means to study the dynamic changes of great inland lakes. In this article, the Danjiangkou (DJK) reservoir is selected as a study case, and a novel waterline mapping method with four main parts is proposed to monitor the water area dynamically. First, a coarse segmentation method is implemented to extract the initial waterline. Second, a strategy of division in local regions is given to speed up the subsequent processes. Third, a combination of a speckle filter and an improved geometric active contour model is used for refined segmentation. Finally, a change detection method is used to study the changing lake. Furthermore, six SAR images obtained by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Sentinel-1A (S-1A) satellites in the DJK reservoir, Hongze lake and Poyang lake are tested to verify the universality of the proposed water area extraction method. The results demonstrate excellent performances with an accuracy of over 97 and an average contour offset under 0.7 pixels. Besides, the time-series analysis of the DJK reservoir is applied based on the mapped waterlines of 37 SAR images collected from January to December in 2017. Comparing with the changing tendency of the water level surveyed in the DJK reservoir, the waterline mapping results and the filed survey data have great consistency, which further proves the validity of the proposed method, also presents the significant potential of the GF-3 and S-1A SAR images for managing the water resource.

TI  - Response of surface air temperature to the change of leaf area index in the source region of the Yellow River by the WRF model
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial land-atmosphere exchange parameter. LAI change can cause a variation of other land surface parameter. In this research, three experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of LAI and albedo change on surface air temperature in the source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Three experiments used the same settings, initial and boundary conditions except for the LAI and albedo data. The control simulation (CTL) used the WRF model climatological LAI data, the second simulation (LAI) used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data, and the third simulation (LAIALB) used the MODIS LAI and MODIS albedo. The results show MODIS LAI is greater by 34.5% than WRF climatological LAI, and the MODIS albedo is lower by 24.3% than WRF climatological albedo over the whole growing season of 2006 in SRYR. All the experiments can simulate the surface air temperature (Ta) spatial distribution characteristics, but underestimate the values of 1.3 degrees C in CTL experiment and 0.6 degrees C in LAIALB experiment in SRYR. The simulated Ta by LAI experiment is lower 0.1 degrees C than by the CTL experiment, but the simulated Ta by the LAIALB experiment is obviously higher 0.6 degrees C than the CTL experiment. The LAI experiment shows a cooling effect because the higher MODIS LAI decreases the canopy resistance, which induces a positive average 2.1 Wm(-2) latent heat flux (LH) and a negative average - 2.1 Wm(-2) sensible heat flux (Hs). The LAIALB experiment presents a warming effect because of low MODIS albedo comparing WRF albedo, which changes the radiation components and results in an obvious negative - 14.0 Wm(-2) upward short wave radiation, a positive 11.7 Wm(-2) net radiation, and a positive 10.9 Wm(-2) heat flux. In fact, more precipitation produces more snow and high surface albedo in the WRF model, which results in a cold temperature bias in SRYR.

TI  - Anisotropic characteristic of artificial light at night - Systematic investigation with VIIRS DNB multi-temporal observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The released VIIRS DNB nightly images, also known as VIIRS DNB daily nighttime images, provide rich information for time series analysis of global socioeconomic dynamics. Anisotropic characteristic is a possible factor that influences the VIIRS DNB radiance at night and its time series analysis. This study aims to investigate the relationship between viewing angles and VIIRS DNB radiance of Suomi NPP satellite in urban areas. First, twenty-nine points were selected globally to explore the angle variation of Suomi NPP satellite views at night. We found that the variation of the satellite viewing zenith angle (VZA) is consistent (e.g. between 0 degrees and 70 degrees) since the range of VZA is fixed depending on the sensor design, and the range of viewing azimuth angle (VAA) increases with the increase of latitude. Second, thirty points in cities of Beijing, Houston, Los Angeles, Moscow, Quito and Sydney, were used to investigate the angle-radiance relationship. We proposed a zenith-radiance quadratic (ZRQ) model and a zenith-azimuth-radiance binary quadratic (ZARBQ) model to quantify the relationship between satellite viewing angles and artificial light radiance, which has been corrected by removing the moonlight and atmospheric impact from VIIRS DNB radiance products. For all the thirty points, the ZRQ and ZARBQ analysis have averaged R2 of 0.50 and 0.53, respectively, which indicates that the viewing angles are important factors influencing the variation of the artificial light radiance, but extending zenith to zenith-azimuth does not much better explain the variation of the observed artificial light. Importantly, based on the data analysis, we can make the hypothesis that building height may affect the relationship between VZA and artificial light, and cold and hot spot effects are clearly found in tall building areas. These findings are potentially useful to reconstruct more stable time series VIIRS DNB images for socioeconomic applications by removing the angular effects.

TI  - Mapping Photosynthesis Solely from Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence: A Global, Fine-Resolution Dataset of Gross Primary Production Derived from OCO-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying gross primary production (GPP) globally is critical for assessing plant productivity, carbon balance, and carbon-climate feedbacks, while current GPP estimates exhibit substantial uncertainty. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has offered unprecedented opportunities for monitoring land photosynthesis, while its sparse coverage remains a bottleneck for mapping finer-resolution GPP globally. Here, we used the global, OCO-2-based SIF product (GOSIF) and linear relationships between SIF and GPP to map GPP globally at a 0.05 degrees spatial resolution and 8-day time step for the period from 2000 to 2017. To account for the uncertainty of GPP estimates resulting from the SIF-GPP relationship, we used a total of eight SIF-GPP relationships with different forms (universal and biome-specific, with and without intercept) at both site and grid cell levels to estimate GPP. Our results showed that all of the eight SIF-GPP relationships performed well in estimating GPP globally. The ensemble mean 8-day GPP was generally highly correlated with flux tower GPP for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe (R-2 = 0.74, Root Mean Square Error = 1.92 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Our fine-resolution GPP estimates showed reasonable spatial and seasonal variations across the globe and fully captured both seasonal cycles and spatial patterns present in our coarse-resolution (1 degrees) GPP estimates based on coarse-resolution SIF data directly aggregated from discrete OCO-2 soundings. SIF-GPP relationships with different forms could lead to significant differences in annual GPP particularly in the tropics. Our ensemble global annual GPP estimate (135.5 +/- 8.8 Pg C yr(-1)) is between the median estimate of non-process based methods and the median estimate of process-based models. Our GPP estimates showed interannual variability in many regions and exhibited increasing trends in many parts of the globe particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. With the availability of high-quality, gridded SIF observations from space (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX), our novel approach does not rely on any other input data (e.g., climate data, soil properties) and therefore can map GPP solely based on satellite SIF observations and potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates at regional to global scales. The use of a universal SIF-GPP relationship versus biome-specific relationships can also avoid the uncertainty associated with land cover maps. Our novel, independent GPP product (GOSIF GPP), freely available at our data repository, will be valuable for studying photosynthesis, carbon cycle, agricultural production, and ecosystem responses to climate change and disturbances, informing ecosystem management, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.

TI  - An Improved Single-Channel Polar Region Ice Surface Temperature Retrieval Algorithm Using Landsat-8 Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice surface temperature (IST) is a key parameter for the study of polar ice sheets and ice shelves. In this study, an improved single-channel (ISC) algorithm based on the radiative transfer equation is proposed for IST retrieval from Landsat-8 band 10 data. The main steps in the proposed ISC algorithm include: 1) simulation of atmospheric radiative parameters by regression against the atmospheric water vapor content and the effective mean atmospheric temperature; 2) calculation of IST using Plancks equation, instead of using Taylors approximation; and 3) implementation of an iterative scheme for IST calculation. The errors from using Taylors approximation and the atmospheric radiative parameter simulation were quantitatively estimated. A sensitivity analysis of ISC to possible errors in atmospheric water vapor content, brightness temperature, and satellite observations was also conducted. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the proposed algorithm is robust to the atmospheric water vapor content, but is sensitive to the calibration precision of the thermal infrared sensor. Verification using a simulated approach showed better IST variability from ISC than the original SC algorithm [the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) were 0.3252 and 0.7176 K, respectively]. When compared with near-surface air temperatures from 68 automatic weather stations data in Greenland and 25 data in the Antarctic, the bias and RMSE from the ISC algorithm were again better than those from the SC algorithm. The IST from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was found to be underestimated with respect to the results of both the SC and ISC algorithms. Maps of the spatial distributions of IST derived from samples of Landsat-8 images are presented. The rationale of each step in the proposed ISC algorithm is also presented so that this can provide further support to the authenticity of the results.

TI  - Early Calibration and Performance Assessments of NOAA-20 VIIRS Thermal Emissive Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the NOAA-20 (previously JPSS-1) spacecraft has successfully operated since its launch in November, 2017. Similar to the first VIIRS instrument on the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) spacecraft, the data are collected in 22 spectral bands that are calibrated by a set of onboard calibrators. This paper provides an overview of the NOAA-20 VIIRS on-orbit operation and calibration, with a particular focus on the thermal emissive bands (TEBs). The results presented in this paper include the on-orbit changes in the TEB spectral band responses, detector noise characterization, and key calibration parameters, such as the nonlinear coefficients derived from the blackbody warm-up cool-down cycles. Other issues, such as the early mission long-wave infrared (LWIR) response degradation due to icing on the dewar window, and their impact on sensor calibration are also discussed. Since launch, the VIIRS instrument temperature has been stable to within 0.8 K and the cold focal plane temperatures are well controlled with variations less than 40 mK. With the exception of the early degradation observed in the LWIR bands, the TEB gains have been stable to within 0.04 (except I5 at 0.07). Based on the current performance, VIIRS is expected to meet its calibration requirements throughout its design lifetime.

TI  - Interleaved group convolutions for multitemporal multisensor crop classification
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The multitemporal observation capability of remote sensing satellites is of increasing importance in crop monitoring. Nowadays we can obtain dense multitemporal data more easily because more and more Earth observation satellites are put into use. Multiband images derived from different satellite sensors usually have different spatial resolutions, and how to utilize different spatial resolution information of multisensors in multitemporal sequence is of great significance. In this paper, we propose a crop classification network based on interleaved group convolution for multitemporal multisensor data. Firstly, we selected the Central Valley of California as research area with rich crop categories. And multitemporal sequence of length 65 in this region was obtained from satellites Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8. Then, to coordinate the sensors with different spatialspectral acquisition parameters, we convolve different bands of sensors to perform multiresolution fusion, and then further align the spectral dimensions. The interleaved group convolution, which has comparable model performance and fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than regular convolution, is introduced to reduce network parameters and reduce the computational complexity of multitemporal classification. Experimental results on our proposed multitemporal multisensor dataset have proved that our method has better performance in crop classification compared with traditional methods. And compared with regular convolution, our method can achieve roughly equivalent classification accuracy.

TI  - A Contextual and Multitemporal Active-Fire Detection Algorithm Based on FengYun-2G S-VISSR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are one of the most destructive disasters on the planet. They also significantly impact the land surface. Satellite data have been widely used to detect the outbreak and monitor the expansion of fire incidents for damage assessment and disaster management. Polar-orbiting satellite data have been used for several decades but data from geostationary satellites, which can provide observations with a high temporal resolution, have received much less attention. This paper utilizes data from FengYun-2G, a Chinese geostationary satellite, to detect wildfires in two selected research regions in January 2016. The detection algorithm systemizes image-based analysis to filter out obvious nonfire pixels and temporal analysis to confirm the true detections. Fire detection is based on comparisons between predicted and observed values. The results show that the proposed method has some advantages compared with the use of polar-orbiting satellite data, including early detection and continuous observation. The validation work is conducted based on the collection 6.1 Global Monthly Fire Location Product generated from fire detections by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. The average accuracy within the target time is 56, while the omission error rate is over 78. In detail, the algorithm has a lower omission error rate in Australia while it fails in detecting most of the fire pixels in India. The dominance of small fire incidents, as well as low spatial resolution greatly limit the detection ability. Many small fires were beyond the ability of Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR) data when no significant fire characteristics could be captured. Future development of the algorithm will focus on improving the results by enhancing the adaption to different regions, as well as, including multisource data sets.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in South Korea: A report from the Korean global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (Kor-GLASS) for 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - At the end of 2015, a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was proposed by the World Health Organization, and the Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS) was subsequently initiated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of South Korea established a customized AMR surveillance system for South Korea, called Kor-GLASS, in early 2016. A pilot phase of Kor-GLASS was operated from May to December 2016 with six sentinel hospitals, and phase I of Kor-GLASS started in January 2017 with eight sentinel hospitals. Previous surveillance data for overestimated AMR due to duplicate isolation of drug-resistant pathogens were corrected and error-free AMR data were compared with those from other countries. One-half (53.2%, 377/708) of Staphylococcus aureus blood strains exhibited resistance to cefoxitin, indicating methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Resistance to ampicillin in Enterococcus faecalis blood strains was rare (0.6%, 1/175), while the resistance rate to penicillin was 26.3% (46/175). Resistance to vancomycin (34.0%, 98/288) and teicoplanin (18.8%, 98/288) was frequently observed in Enterococcus faecium strains. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli strains to cefotaxime was 32.4% (574/1772), and that of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was 26.1% (181/693). The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to imipenem and meropenem were 19.5% (29/149) and 18.1% (27/149), respectively. And 92.1% (187/203) of Acinetobacter baumannii strains were resistant to both imipenem and meropenem. The high incidence of bacteremia caused by major AMR pathogens among hospitalized patients especially in intensive care units emphasized the importance of hospital infection control and the need to improve the crowded hospitalization system in South Korea. The isolation rate of the Salmonella spp. is decreasing, reflecting the current socio-economic status of South Korea. The proportions of bacterial species in the blood strains were similar to those in other Asian countries with similar lifestyles.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Comparison and Validation of Three Global-Scale Fractional Vegetation Cover Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important parameter for many environmental and ecological models. Large-scale and long-term FVC products are critical for various applications. Currently, several global-scale FVC products have been generated with remote sensing data, such as VGT bioGEOphysical product Version 2 (GEOV2), PROBA-V bioGEOphysical product Version 3 (GEOV3) and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC products. However, studies comparing and validating these global-scale FVC products are rare. Therefore, in this study, the performances of three global-scale time series FVC products, including the GEOV2, GEOV3, and GLASS FVC products, are investigated to assess their spatial and temporal consistencies. Furthermore, reference FVC data generated from high-spatial-resolution data are used to directly evaluate the accuracy of these FVC products. The results show that these three FVC products achieve general agreements in terms of spatiotemporal consistencies over most regions. In addition, the GLASS and GEOV2 FVC products have reliable spatial and temporal completeness, whereas the GEOV3 FVC product contains much missing data over high-latitude regions, especially during wintertime. Furthermore, the GEOV3 FVC product presents higher FVC values than GEOV2 and GLASS FVC products over the equator. The main differences between the GEOV2 and GLASS FVC products occur over deciduous forests, for which the GLASS product presents slightly higher FVC values than the GEOV2 product during wintertime. Finally, temporal profiles of the GEOV2 and GLASS FVC products show better consistency than the GEOV3 FVC product, and the GLASS FVC product presents more reliable accuracy (R-2 = 0.7878, RMSE = 0.1212) compared with the GEOV2 (R-2 = 0.5798, RMSE = 0.1921) and GEOV3 (R-2 = 0.7744, RMSE = 0.2224) FVC products over these reference FVC data.

TI  - Evaluation of Red-Peak Algorithms for Chlorophyll Measurement in the Pearl River Estuary
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm of the red-peak envelop area (PEA) near 700 nm was evaluated using in situ data during nine cruises in the Pearl River estuary and compared with other algorithms using the reflectance peak (RP) near 700 nm, including the fluorescence line height (FLH), maximum chlorophyll index (MCI), and MCI2 algorithms. Of all algorithms, the PEA algorithm presented the most accurate performance [ R-2 = 0.74, root-meansquare error (RMSE) = 0.12] and provided a more rational spatial distribution of phytoplankton blooms when both Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and Hyperion data were used because the PEA integrates information from both the moving peak and the asymmetric curve on each side of the peak due to the high correlation relationship ( R-2 = 0.7) of chlorophyll and the ratio of the peak area between the left and right halves. Moreover, compared with other algorithms, the PEA algorithm developed using the Hyperion (higher spectral resolution) and OLCI band settings presented similar retrieval accuracies. These results demonstrated that the PEA algorithm is less dependent on the band settings, and the spectral band settings of OLCI from 650 to 750 nm are reasonable and can be used to detect phytoplankton blooms if the PEA algorithm is applied. The OLCI PEA algorithm was applied to determine the variations in phytoplankton blooms under the influences of strong precipitation events. The most obvious increases in chlorophyll concentration (from 20 to 30 mg m(-3)) were observed in the middle river channel upstream of the Pearl River estuary after strong precipitation events.

TI  - Rock crevices determine woody and herbaceous plant cover in the karst critical zone
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the critical zones (CZs) of the Earth link the composition and function of aboveground vegetation with the characteristics of the rock layers, providing a new way to study how the unique rock and soil conditions in karst regions affect the aboveground vegetation. Based on survey results of the rocks, soils and vegetation in the dolomite and limestone distribution areas in the karst area of central Guizhou, it was found that woody plant cover increases linearly with the number of cracks with a width of more than 1 mm, while the cover of herbaceous plants shows the opposite trend (p<0.01). The dolomite distribution area is characterized by undeveloped crevices, and the thickness of the soil layer is generally less than 20 cm, which is suitable for the distribution of herbaceous plants with shallow roots. Due to the development of crevices in the limestone distribution area, the soil is deeply distributed through the crevices for the deep roots of trees, which leads to a diversified species composition and a complicated structure in the aboveground vegetation. Based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data from 2001 to 2010, the normalized differentiated vegetation index (NDVI) and annual net primary productivity (NPP) results for each phase of a 16-day interval further indicate that the NDVI of the limestone distribution area is significantly higher than that in the dolomite distribution area, but the average annual NPP is the opposite. The results of this paper indicate that in karst CZs, the lithology determines the structure and distribution of the soil, which further determines the cover of woody and herbaceous plants in the aboveground vegetation. Although the amount of soil in the limestone area may be less than that in the dolomite area, the developed crevice structure is more suitable for the growth of trees with deep roots, and the vegetation activity is strong. At present, the treatment of rocky desertification in karst regions needs to fully consider the rock-soilvegetation- air interactions in karst CZs and propose vegetation restoration measures suitable for different lithologies.

TI  - Urban Greening Tree Species Classification Based on HSV Colour Space of WorldView-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature mining and effective combination of remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of tree species classification; however, the application of some common features in tree species classification needs to be further analysed. In this study, we transformed WorldView-2 RGB bands to hue, saturation and value (HSV) colour space, constructed 56 HSV features, used maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and support vector machine (SVM) to classify tree species based on these data sets and feature combinations to explore which combinations can effectively improve the recognition accuracy. The results show that among the 56 HSV features, the highest classification accuracy (64.2893%) was generated by the HSV feature transformed by the 368 band combination (CBC368). A single HSV feature set could not improve the classification accuracy compared with the spectral band used which produced the HSV. Among the feature sets of all H, all S and all V, the highest classification accuracy (71.7063%) was generated by feature sets all S; it is close but not higher than the classification results obtained using eight bands. Among the combination of two feature sets, the highest classification accuracy (77.5384%) was generated by all S + all V, and the classification accuracy is much higher than that obtained using the eight bands of WorldView-2 (74.0713%, MLC based). When all H, S and V were combined, the classification accuracy reached 77.6251%. Comparative experiments showed that combining all HSV colour spaces transformed by the eight spectral bands of WorldView-2 can effectively improve tree species recognition accuracy.

TI  - Multicomponent Driven Consistency Priors for Simultaneous Decomposition and Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is also known as the fusion of a low-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image and a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (Pan) image of the same scene, which is an effective way to improve the spatial resolution of the LR MS image so as to obtain an HR MS image (i.e., pansharpened MS image). In this article, we propose a novel multicomponent consistency priors driven variational model for simultaneous decomposition and pansharpening (SDP) in a unified optimization framework. Specifically, the proposed SDP model particularly decomposes the Pan and MS images into cartoon, structure and texture components, and fully exploits the multicomponent consistency priors on these cartoon, structure and texture components of the Pan and MS images. Thus, the proposed SDP model can suitably characterize the different properties of these multicomponents so that these multicomponents can be well preserved. Moreover, the proposed SDP model is actually a band-coupled model, which can fully preserve the intrinsic structural correlation among the MS bands, because the MS image is actually a spatial-spectral strongly correlated cube. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm based on the forward-backward splitting technique is designed to solve the proposed SDP model. Finally, we compare the proposed SDP method with some state-of-the-art methods on various satellite datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can perform higher spectral and spatial qualities than the other methods.

TI  - Ecological Environment Assessment in World Natural Heritage Site Based on Remote-Sensing Data. A Case Study from the Bayinbuluke
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological environment assessment would be helpful for a rapid and systematic understanding of ecological status and would contribute to formulate appropriate strategies for the sustainability of heritage sites. A procedure based on spatial principle component analysis was employed to measure the ecological status in Bayinbuluke; exploratory spatial data analysis and geo-detector model were introduced to assess the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics and detect the driving factors of the ecological environment. Five results are presented: (1) During 2007-2018, the average values of moisture, greenness, and heat increased by 51.72%, 23.10%, and 4.99% respectively, and the average values of dryness decreased by 56.70%. However, the fluctuation of each indicator increased. (2) The ecological environment of Bayinbuluke was improved from 2007 to 2018, and presented a distribution pattern that the heritage site was better than the buffer zone, and the southeast area was better than the northwest area. (3) The ecological environment presented a significant spatial clustering characteristic, and four types of spatial associations were proposed for assessing spatial dependence among the samples. (4) Elevation, protection partition, temperature, river, road, tourism, precipitation, community resident, and slope were statistically significant with respect to the changes in ecological status, and the interaction of any two factors was higher than the effect of one factor alone. (5) The remote-sensing ecological index (RSEI) could reflect the vegetation growth to a certain extent, but has limited ability to respond to species structure. Overall, the framework presented in this paper realized a visual and measurable approach for a detailed monitoring of the ecological environment and provided valuable information for the protection and management of heritage sites.

TI  - The spatial local accuracy of land cover datasets over the Qiangtang Plateau, High Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the spatial local accuracy of land cover (LC) datasets for the Qiang-tang Plateau, High Asia, incorporating 923 field sampling points and seven LC compilations including the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme Data and Information System (IGBPDIS), Global Land cover mapping at 30 m resolution (GlobeLand30), MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1), Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), University of Maryland (UMD), and GlobCover 2009 (Glob-Cover). We initially compared resultant similarities and differences in both area and spatial patterns and analyzed inherent relationships with data sources. We then applied a geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to predict local accuracy variation. The results of this study reveal that distinct differences, even inverse time series trends, in LC data between CCI-LC and MCD12Q1 were present between 2001 and 2015, with the exception of category areal discordance between the seven datasets. We also show a series of evident discrepancies amongst the LC datasets sampled here in terms of spatial patterns, that is, high spatial congruence is mainly seen in the homogeneous southeastern region of the study area while a low degree of spatial congruence is widely distributed across heterogeneous northwestern and northeastern regions. The overall combined spatial accuracy of the seven LC datasets considered here is less than 70%, and the GlobeLand30 and CCI-LC datasets exhibit higher local accuracy than their counterparts, yielding maximum overall accuracy (OA) values of 77.39% and 61.43%, respectively. Finally, 5.63% of this area is characterized by both high assessment and accuracy (HH) values, mainly located in central and eastern regions of the Qiangtang Plateau, while most low accuracy regions are found in northern, northeastern, and western regions.

TI  - Landscape functional zoning at a county level based on ecosystem services bundle: Methods comparison and management indication
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The perspective of ecosystem services bundle is virtually a spatial clustering on landscape to mapping the relationship between ecosystem services and support the spatial strategy of landscape management. However, the efficiency of various clustering algorithms for geographically different regions are still in obscurity. In this study, we provided landscape functional zoning as a planning tool based on the ecosystem services bundles formed by carbon sequestration, soil retention and water yield. Then we used four landscape pattern indices to evaluate the performance of six clustering algorithms on landscape functional zoning. The case counties include Lankao, Jinggangshan and Luquan in China. The results showed the Natural Breaks (Jenks) scheme should be the most reasonable zone because of its high aggregated distribution and low diversity. This scheme was adjusted using some other schemes and has been employed as the final 7 kinds of zoning types. There were 5 types appeared in Lankao and Jinggangshan, and 6 types appeared in Luquan. We discussed that landscape functional zone can be a nexus connecting landscape planning and social policy. Rural reconstructing process on landscape was depicted, and landscape functional zone was proposed a practical planning tool bridged human wellbeing. The task of landscape functional zoning with the management indications may provide interdisciplinary support to decision-makers and natural resource users on landscape management.

TI  - Estimating biomass of winter oilseed rape using vegetation indices and texture metrics derived from UAV multispectral images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the above ground biomass (AGB) in winter oilseed rape is important for improving the agronomic management efficiency and predicting yield to ensure edible oil and biofuel supplies. The Yangtze River Basin in China accounts for one-fifth of the rapeseed yield in the world. However, the fragmented farming lands in the Yangtze River Basin make it difficult to accurately monitor winter oilseed rape growth at large scale using the medium-resolution satellite data. The low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides a feasible way to accurately and non-destructively estimate AGB in winter oilseed rape at the plot level. In this study, we evaluated the contributions of vegetation indices (VIs) and texture metrics, derived from multispectral images captured by the camera mounted on a UAV, to predict the AGB in winter oilseed rape. The AGB was estimated with (1) multiple VIs and (2) multiple VIs and texture metrics. The partial least square regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models were trained with datasets of the experiment in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, and then applied to predict AGB of the 2018-2019 growth season. Results demonstrated that the incorporation of texture metrics to both PLSR and RE models provided more accurate estimations of AGB in winter oilseed rape than the models based solely on VIs. The accuracy of the AGB predicted by the RF regression model using VIs and texture metrics (RMSE = 274.18 kg/ha for the validation dataset) was slightly higher than the results of the PLSR model (RMSE = 284.09 kg/ha for the validation dataset). According to the evaluation of the important variables, the red edge chlorophyll index (CTred (edge)) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) were selected as the most important input features by PLSR and RF regression models. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) contrast was selected as an important texture metrics for the AGB prediction, indicating that NDVI contrast could be a sensitive indicator of the spatial distribution of shadow caused by the different amount of biomass. This study suggested the great potential of UAV in estimating the plot-level AGB by combining VIs and texture metrics.

TI  - Deriving Bias and Uncertainty in MERRA-2 Snowfall Precipitation Over High Mountain Asia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Bayesian approach to estimate bias and uncertainty in snowfall precipitation from MERRA-2 and other precipitation products was applied over High Mountain Asia (HMA), using a newly developed snow reanalysis method. Starting from an "uninformed" prior probability distribution, a posterior scaling factor applied to MERRA-2 snowfall was derived by constraining model-based estimates of seasonal snow accumulation and ablation over the water year (WY) with fractional snow covered area (fSCA) measurements derived from Landsat and MODIS (MODSCAG). Several sub-domains (nine representative 1 degrees by 1 degrees tiles) across HMA were examined over the period WYs 2001-2015 and compiled into an uncertainty parameterization where a lognormal distribution was fitted to the empirical posterior distribution with a mean of 1.54 (median of 1.19) and coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.83, indicating that MERRA-2 underestimates snowfall on average by similar to 54% with sizeable uncertainty. For reference, the uncertainties in snowfall precipitation from the ERA5 and APHRODITE-2 precipitation products were also evaluated, and these products were found to underestimate snowfall, on average by a factor around 1.78 and 3.34 (with median scaling factors of 1.42 and 2.51), respectively. The results indicate that snowfall precipitation at high-elevations dominated by snowfall is underestimated in most existing products, especially in the gauge-based APHRODITE-2 product, where the biases were also found to exhibit geographical variations with the largest underestimation in monsoon-influenced high-elevation tiles. The derived MERRA-2 uncertainty model is being used to develop a full domain-wide HMA snow reanalysis, which will shed further light onto the space-time variations in snowfall biases in these products.

TI  - Generation of spatially complete and daily continuous surface soil moisture of high spatial resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM), as a vital variable for water and heat exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere, is essential for agricultural production and drought monitoring, and serves as an important boundary condition for atmospheric models. The spatial resolution of soil moisture products from microwave remote sensing is relatively coarse (e.g., similar to 40 km x 40 km), whereas SSM of higher spatiotemporal resolutions (e.g., 1 km x 1 km and daily continuous) is more useful in water resources management. In this study, first, to improve the spatiotemporal completeness of SSM estimates, we downscaled land surface temperature (LST) output from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) using a data fusion approach and MODIS LST acquired on clear-sky days to generate spatially complete and temporally continuous LST maps across the North China Plain. Second, spatially complete and daily continuous 1 km x 1 km SSM was generated based on random forest models combined with quality LST maps, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface albedo, precipitation, soil texture, SSM background fields from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative (CCI, 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and CLDAS land surface model (LSM) SSM output (0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) to be downscaled, and in situ SSM measurements. Third, the importance of different input variables to the downscaled SSM was quantified. Compared with the original CCI and CLDAS SSM, both the accuracy and spatial resolution of the downscaled SSM were largely improved, in terms of a bias (root mean square error) of -0.001 cm(3)/cm(3) (0.041 cm(3)/cm(3)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.72. These results are generally comparable and even better than those in published studies, with our SSM maps featuring spatiotemporal completeness and relatively high spatial resolution. The downscaled SSM maps are valuable for monitoring agricultural drought and optimizing irrigation scheduling, bridging the gaps between microwave-based and LSM-based SSM estimates of coarse spatial resolution and thermal infrared-based LST at a 1 km x 1 km resolution.

TI  - Mangrove Mapping and Above-Ground Biomass Change Detection using Satellite Images in Coastal Areas of Thai Binh Province, Vietnam
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are recognized as a highly valuable resource due to their provision of multiple ecosystem services. Therefore, mangrove ecosystems mapping and monitoring is a crucial objective, especially for tropical regions. Thai Binh province is one of the most important mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam. The mangrove ecosystem in this province has faced threats of deforestation from urban development, land reclamation, tourism activities, and natural disasters. Recently, to maintain the fundamental functions of the ecosystems, a large mangrove area was planted in Thai Binh. The aim of this research is to detect the change in the mangrove areas and to create an aboveground biomass map for mangrove forests in Thai Binh province. Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images from 1998 to 2018 were analysed using the supervised classification method to detect mangrove area change. Mangrove Aboveground Biomass (AGB) was estimated using linear regression between vegetation indices and field AGB survey. The accuracy assessment for the classified images of 1998, 2003 and 2007, 2013 and 2018 are 93%, 86%, 96%, 94% and 91% respectively with kappa of 0.8881, 0.7953, 0.9357, 0.9114 and 0.8761. The mangrove cover in the study area was estimated at 5874.93 ha in 1998. This figure decreased significantly to 4433.85 ha in 2007, before recovery began to take place in the study area, which was estimated at 6587.88 ha in 2018. In 1998, the average AGB in this study area was 22.57 ton/ha, and in 2018 it was 37.74 ton/ha with a standard error of 12.41 ton/ha and the root mean square error (RMSE) was +/- 12.08 ton/ha.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study applied multi-temporal optical remote sensing and spatial analytical techniques to assess the status of the eight (8) forest reserves in the tropical high forests of Ghana under the management of the Goaso Forest District. Landsat data of 1990 (Thematic mapper [TM]), 2013 (Enhanced Thematic Mapper [ETM+]) and 2017 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI_TIRS) were classified into closed canopy forest, open canopy forest, bare land/built-up, farmland, and degraded land using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Post classification change detection techniques were then used to analyse the changes that had occurred over the study period. It was observed that about 37.63% of the closed canopy forests have been converted to the other covers types. The findings showed that the forest estates in the District, which was one of the richest in the High forests in terms of species diversity and richness, had been severely degraded. This could have dire implications on biodiversity, carbon sequestration and livelihood of fringe communities. Concurrent restoration of degraded forest cover and integration of remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques into routine forestry management practices at both District and National levels would provide an effective mechanism to curb the high rate of forests depletion in Ghana.

TI  - Evaluation of Surgical Disparities Between African American and European American Women Treated for Breast Cancer Within an Equal-Access Military Hospital
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Survival disparities between African American women (AAW) and European American women (EAW) with invasive breast cancer may be attributable, in part, to access to or quality of medical care. In this study, we evaluated surgical disparities between AAW and EAW treated within an equal-access military treatment facility (MTF).Methods. All AAW (N = 271) and EAW (N = 628) with Stage I-III breast cancer who had their initial diagnosis performed at Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center were identified. Differences in surgical interval (time between diagnosis and definitive breast surgery) and surgical procedures were evaluated using chi(2) and Student t-tests while survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests. A P value < 0.05 was used to define significance.Results. Surgical intervals did not differ significantly between populations with an average of 36.3 days in AAW and 33.9 days in EAW. Frequency of the percentage of women undergoing reexcision, mastectomy, and prophylactic removal of the contralateral breast did not differ significantly between populations. Likewise, frequency of sentinel lymph node biopsy and 5-year survival were not significantly different between AAW compared to EAW.Discussion. Surgical intervals and procedures were similar between AAW and EAW treated within an equal-access MTF. These data demonstrate that the availability of quality surgical care to all patients with stage I-III breast cancer may eliminate survival disparities between AAW and EAW, emphasizing the importance of equalizing access to breast care.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessment of Wetland Loss and Fragmentation in the Cross-Boundary Protected Area: A Case Study of Wusuli River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative evaluation of cross-boundary wetland protected areas is essential to underpin knowledge-based bilateral conservation policies and funding decisions by governments and managers. In this paper, wetland change monitoring for the Wusuli River Basin in the cross-boundary zone of China and Russia from 1990 to 2015 was quantitatively analyzed using Landsat images. The spatial-temporal distribution of wetlands was identified using a rule-based object-oriented classification method. Wetland dynamics were determined by combining annual land change area (ALCA), annual land change rate (ALCR), landscape metrics and spatial analysis in a geographic information system (GIS). A Mann-Kendall test was used to evaluate changing climate trends. Results showed that natural wetlands in the Wusuli River Basin have declined by 5625.76 km(2) in the past 25 years, especially swamp/marsh, which decreased by 26.88%. Specifically, natural wetlands declined by 49.93% in the Chinese section but increased with an ALCA of 16.62 km(2)/y in the Russian section during 1990-2015. Agricultural encroachment was the most important reason for the loss and degradation of natural wetlands in the Wusuli River Basin, especially in China. Different population change trends and conservation policies in China and Russia affected natural wetland dynamics. The research offers an efficient and effective method to evaluate cross-boundary wetland change. This study provides important scientific information necessary for developing future ecological conservation and management of cross-boundary wetlands.

TI  - Targeted axillary dissection in breast cancer by marking lymph node metastasis with a magnetic seed before starting neoadjuvant treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first documented clinical case of the use of magnetic seeds to mark axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, the patient showed a complete radiological response. One single sentinel lymph node was detected using a radiotracer, while the marked node was intraoperative magnetometer-guided identified. The analysis of the nodes showed negative sentinel lymph node and positive marked node, and the subsequent targeted axillary dissection was performed. Marking axillary positive lymph nodes with a magnetic seed is a simple and effective procedure for the intraoperative localisation of the node after neoadjuvant treatment.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Land Cover Change at the Bento Rodrigues Dam Disaster Area Using Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disasters are an unpredictable way to change land use and land cover. Improving the accuracy of mapping a disaster area at different time is an essential step to analyze the relationship between human activity and environment. The goals of this study were to test the performance of different processing procedures and examine the effect of adding normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as an additional classification feature for mapping land cover changes due to a disaster. Using Landsat ETM+ and OLI images of the Bento Rodrigues mine tailing disaster area, we created two datasets, one with six bands, and the other one with six bands plus the NDVI. We used support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) algorithms to build classifier models and validated models performance using 10-fold cross-validation, resulting in accuracies higher than 90%. The processed results indicated that the accuracy could reach or exceed 80%, and the support vector machine had a better performance than the decision tree. We also calculated each land cover type's sensitivity (true positive rate) and found that Agriculture, Forest and Mine sites had higher values but Bareland and Water had lower values. Then, we visualized land cover maps in 2000 and 2017 and found out the Mine sites areas have been expanded about twice of the size, but Forest decreased 12.43%. Our findings showed that it is feasible to create a training data pool and use machine learning algorithms to classify a different year's Landsat products and NDVI can improve the vegetation covered land classification. Furthermore, this approach can provide a venue to analyze land pattern change in a disaster area over time.

TI  - Attention Graph Convolution Network for Image Segmentation in Big SAR Imagery Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent emergence of high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images leads to massive amounts of data. In order to segment these big remotely sensed data in an acceptable time frame, more and more segmentation algorithms based on deep learning attempt to take superpixels as processing units. However, the over-segmented images become non-Euclidean structure data that traditional deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) cannot directly process. Here, we propose a novel Attention Graph Convolution Network (AGCN) to perform superpixel-wise segmentation in big SAR imagery data. AGCN consists of an attention mechanism layer and Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). GCN can operate on graph-structure data by generalizing convolutions to the graph domain and have been successfully applied in tasks such as node classification. The attention mechanism layer is introduced to guide the graph convolution layers to focus on the most relevant nodes in order to make decisions by specifying different coefficients to different nodes in a neighbourhood. The attention layer is located before the convolution layers, and noisy information from the neighbouring nodes has less negative influence on the attention coefficients. Quantified experiments on two airborne SAR image datasets prove that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. Its computation time is also far less than the current mainstream pixel-level semantic segmentation networks.

TI  - Maritime targets classification based on CNN using Gaofen-3 SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification and detection of maritime targets are widely used in shipping navigation and military fields. With the development of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, more and more very high-resolution SAR images can be acquired for maritime targets recognition. However, due to the different imaging mechanisms between SAR images and optical images, it is difficult and laborious to interpret SAR images manually. This study uses a modified Alexnet structure to realise maritime targets classification on the Gaofen-3 spaceborne SAR images. The maritime targets dataset (MTD), including boats, cargo ships, container ships, windmills, oil tankers, and iron towers, is conducted. Moreover, the proposed convolution neural networks (CNNs) structure is trained and tested on the MTD. Experimental results show that the model can get an accuracy of 92.10% in classifying the six kinds of targets, and the performance is superior compared with other CNNs and traditional supportive vector machine algorithms.

TI  - Snow-Cover Area and Runoff Variation under Climate Change in the West Kunlun Mountains
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the climate in the arid region of Northwest China has become warmer and wetter; however, glaciers in the north slope of the West Kunlun Mountains (NSWKM) show no obvious recession, and river flow is decreasing or stable. This contrasts with the prevalent response of glaciers to climate change, which is recession and initial increase in glacier discharge followed by decline as retreat continues. We comparatively analyzed multi-timescale variation in temperature-precipitation-snow cover-runoff in the Yarkant River Basin (YRK), Karakax River Basin (KRK), Yurungkax River Basin (YUK), and Keriya River Basin (KRY) in the NSWKM. The Mann-Kendall trend and the mutation-detection method were applied to data obtained from an observation station over the last 60 years (1957-2017) and MODIS snow data (2001-2016). NSWKM temperature and precipitation have continued to increase for nearly 60 years at a mean rate of 0.26 degrees C/decade and 5.50 mm/decade, respectively, with the most obvious trend (R-2 > 0.82) attributed to the KRK and YUK. Regarding changes in the average snow-cover fraction (SCF): YUK (SCF = 44.14%) > YRK (SCF = 38.73%) > KRY (SCF = 33.42%) > KRK (SCF = 33.40%). Between them, the YRK and YUK had decreasing SCA values (slope < -15.39), while the KRK and KRY had increasing SCA values (slope > 1.87). In seasonal variation, the SCF of the three of the basins reaches the maximum value in spring, with the most significant performance in YUK (SCF = 26.4%), except for YRK where SCF in spring was lower than that in winter (-2.6%). The runoff depth of all river basins presented an increasing trend, with the greatest value appearing in the YRK (5.78 mm/decade), and the least value in the YUK (1.58 mm/decade). With the runoff response to climate change, temperature was the main influencing factor of annual and monthly (summer) runoff variations in the YRK, which is consistent with the runoff-generation rule of rivers in arid areas, which mainly rely on ice and snow melt for water supply. However, this rule was not consistent for the YUK and KRK, as it was disturbed by other factors (e.g., slope and slope direction) during runoff generation, resulting in disruptions of their relationship with runoff. This research promotes the study of the response of cold and arid alpine regions to global change and thus better serve regional water resources management.

TI  - A New Fusion Approach for Extracting Urban Built-up Areas from Multisource Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in the fusion technology of remotely sensed data have led to an increased availability of extracted urban information from multiple spatial resolutions and multi-temporal acquisitions. Despite the existing extraction methods, there remains the challenging task of fully exploiting the characteristics of multisource remote sensing data, each of which has its own advantages. In this paper, a new fusion approach for accurately extracting urban built-up areas based on the use of multisource remotely sensed data, i.e., the DMSP-OLS nighttime light data, the MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1) and Landsat 7 ETM+ images, was proposed. The proposed method mainly consists of two components: (1) the multi-level data fusion, including the initial sample selection, unified pixel resolution and feature weighted calculation at the feature level, as well as pixel attribution determination at decision level; and (2) the optimized sample selection with multi-factor constraints, which indicates that an iterative optimization with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and the bare soil index (BSI), along with the sample training of the support vector machine (SVM) and the extraction of urban built-up areas, produces results with high credibility. Nine Chinese provincial capitals along the Silk Road Economic Belt, such as Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Xining, and Nanning, were selected to test the proposed method with data from 2001 to 2010. Compared with the results obtained by the traditional threshold dichotomy and the improved neighborhood focal statistics (NFS) method, the following could be concluded. (1) The proposed approach achieved high accuracy and eliminated natural elements to a great extent while obtaining extraction results very consistent to those of the more precise improved NFS approach at a fine scale. The average overall accuracy (OA) and average Kappa values of the extracted urban built-up areas were 95% and 0.83, respectively. (2) The proposed method not only identified the characteristics of the urban built-up area from the nighttime light data and other daylight images at the feature level but also optimized the samples of the urban built-up area category at the decision level, making it possible to provide valuable information for urban planning, construction, and management with high accuracy.

TI  - Inferring plant functional diversity from space: the potential of Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that characterizes the variability of functional traits within a community, landscape, or even large spatial scales. It can influence ecosystem processes and stability. Hence, it is important to understand how and why FD varies within and between ecosystems, along resources availability gradients and climate gradients, and across vegetation successional stages. Usually, FD is assessed through labor-intensive field measurements, while assessing FD from space may provide a way to monitor global FD changes in a consistent, time and resource efficient way. The potential of operational satellites for inferring FD, however, remains to be demonstrated. Here we studied the relationships between FD and spectral reflectance measurements taken by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite over 117 field plots located in 6 European countries, with 46 plots having in-situ sampled leaf traits and the other 71 using traits from the TRY database. These field plots represent major European forest types, from boreal forests in Finland to Mediterranean mixed forests in Spain. Based on in-situ data collected in 2013 we computed functional dispersion (FDis), a measure of FD, using foliar and whole-plant traits of known ecological significance. These included five foliar traits: leaf nitrogen concentration (N%), leaf carbon concentration (%C), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA). In addition they included three whole-plant traits: tree height (H), crown cross-sectional area (CCSA), and diameter-at-breast-height (DBH). We applied partial least squares regression using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance measured in 2015 as predictive variables to model in-situ FDis measurements. We predicted, in cross-validation, 55% of the variation in the observed FDis. We also showed that the rededge, near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of Sentinel-2 are more important than the visible region for predicting FDis. An initial 30-m resolution mapping of FDis revealed large local FDis variation within each forest type. The novelty of this study is the effective integration of spaceborne and in-situ measurements at a continental scale, and hence represents a key step towards achieving rapid global biodiversity monitoring schemes.

TI  - Impact of environmental pollution on the retrieval of AOD products from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) over wuhan
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a next-generation polar-orbiting operational environmental sensor, and its aerosol optical depth (AOD) data has been widely applied to ground-level PM2.5 prediction and air pollution research. However, VIIRS performance affects the accuracy of prediction. In this study, three types of VIIRS AOD products were collected from January 2014 to December 2016 to evaluate their performance under different air quality conditions. Near-surface PM2.5 concentrations were determined for the same period to categorize air quality as clean, moderate, or heavily polluted. The performance of three VIIRS AOD products was evaluated from the successful retrieval rate and AOD accuracy aspects. For clean weather days, the AOD5 obtained from VIIRS intermediate products (IP) had the lowest average absolute bias (0.15 +/- 0.15). For the moderate and heavy pollution days, the average absolute deviations of VIIRS environmental data record (EDR) AOD (Quality Flags = 3 and > 1) products were lowest at 0.14 +/- 0.14 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 respectively. These results suggest that the EDR AOD, Quality Flags > 1 and = 3, products were more suitable for heavy and moderate air pollution, respectively. During clean weather, performance of _IP AOD5 was found to be best. Moreover, seasonal analysis indicated that the EDR AOD (Quality Flags = 3) products were more suitable for spring and autumn and the IP AOD for summer. However, the performance of the EDR AOD products (Quality flags > 1) were best during winter. To ensure accuracy of PM2.5 predictions over central China, researchers should carefully balance the needs for successful retrieval rate and accuracy of VIIRS AOD products.

TI  - Impacts of Large-Area Impervious Surfaces on Regional Land Surface Temperature in the Great Pearl River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to an increase in urban land surface temperature (LST). In contrast to individual cities or megacity scale, urban agglomeration can increase LST in a continuous area due to decreasing or disappearing distance between cities. Thus, the impact of ISA on LST needs further understanding in the large scale of urban agglomerations. This study investigated the impacts of impervious surface area (ISA) on LST in urban agglomeration region. The distribution of ISA and LST of the Greater Pearl River Delta in 2015 was extracted using the Landsat 8 OLI and Aqua MODIS images. Next, the standard deviational ellipse methods were used to systematically analyze the spatial correlation of ISA and LST. Subsequently, the influences of ISA density and landscape pattern of ISA on LST were analyzed by various methods. The results showed that when the ISA density increased 10%, the daytime LST increased 0.46 degrees C at the density level lower than 70% and 0.55 degrees C at the density level higher than 70%, respectively. Likewise, when the ISA density increased 10%, the nighttime LST increased 0.285 degrees C at the density level lower than 70% and 0.39 degrees C at the density level higher than 70%, respectively. In addition, the results of correlation analysis indicated that landscape metrics of ISA and the density of ISA had significant correlation with the LST. However, the correlation was higher at daytime than at nighttime, due to the large terrain, complex environment and diverse surface cover types in the study area.

TI  - Variation in actual evapotranspiration following changes in climate and vegetation cover during an ecological restoration period (2000-2015) in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of water resources largely influences Earth ecosystems and human civilization. Being a major component of the global water cycle, evapotranspiration (ET) serves as an indicator of the availability of water resources. Understanding the actual ET (ETa) variation mechanism at different spatial and temporal scales can improve management of water use within the sustainable development limits. In this study, remote sensing derived ETa data were used to study water resource fluctuations in the Loess Plateau, China. This region covers diverse climate types from humid to arid and experienced large changes in vegetation cover during a revegetation project between 2000 and 2015. The relations between spatiotemporal variation of ETa, climate factors and vegetation change were explored using statistical methods. The results show that cropland, forestland and grassland lake the largest percentage of total ETa. Total ETa exhibited a marginally increasing trend (p <0.1) during 2000-2010 and no trend during 2011-2015. Windspeed and vegetation cover index highly influenced ETa, followed by atmospheric pressure, air humidity, precipitation, bright sunshine duration and temperature. Temperature has little effect on ETa throughout the Loess Plateau. The monitoring of water resources based upon water balance between precipitation, ETa and river flow changes shows that water consumption deficit is consistent with vegetation changes: it was large during 2000-2010 when vegetation increased rapidly and decreased after 2010. These results could help to develop different water saving strategies across the Loess Plateau and build a better monitoring system of water resources.

TI  - A label noise tolerant random forest for the classification of remote sensing data based on outdated maps for training
T2  - COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised classification of remotely sensed images is a classical method for change detection. The task requires training data containing images with known class labels. If these labels are acquired from an outdated map, the classifier must cope with errors in the training labels. Several papers state that the random forest classifier is robust with respect to these errors (label noise) by design, but for a large amount of label noise or for noise affecting different classes differently this assumption does not necessarily hold. In this paper we suggest an adaptation of the random forest classifier by integrating a model for label noise based on the idea that a training sample should not be assigned to one class only, but to all classes, each with a certain probability. The adapted random forest is embedded in an iterative scheme for the context-based classification of remote sensing data using the outdated map not only to provide the labels of the training samples, but also to support the classification process in unchanged areas. Our experiments are based on five test areas and the results show a higher accuracy using the suggested new method than using the standard random forest.

TI  - A dynamic classification scheme for mapping spectrally similar classes: Application to wetland classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Applying numerous features is common for complex land cover classification which makes feature selection necessary. Although the selected feature subsets may yield high overall accuracies in the case of spectrally similar classes such as wetlands, several individual accuracies are often low. A reason is that one set of features used to separate one specific class from the rest might not be appropriate for delineating another class. An additional reason is that while the overall accuracy is applied to evaluate the potential of a feature subset, it may be influenced by a few high-accuracy classes that are spectrally distinct and for which collecting enough training data is feasible. In this article, rather than simultaneously mapping all classes, they were individually classified using a different feature selection. Spectral analysis was applied to determine both the order of the classes to be mapped and a merging scheme that was applied to the remaining classes to increase the accuracy of the target class. The proposed approach was applied to wetland mapping using five pilot sites throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The dataset available for each pilot site differed in quality and quantity. However, the proposed method accurately classified wetlands in all pilot sites, even those with limited satellite and/or field data, and outperformed the classic method by increasing the average producer and user accuracies of wetlands by up to 22% and 25%, respectively, and yielding overall accuracies up to 93%. Among wetland classes, Shallow Water was easier to be distinguished, as a result of being spectrally less similar to the rest of the wetland classes. Based on the obtained results, the proposed method can be effectively applied for classifications involving spectrally similar classes, including sea ice and crop mapping.

TI  - Inherent Reflectance Variability of Vegetation
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the inception of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), remotely sensed images have been captured much closer to the ground, which has meant better resolution and smaller ground sample distances (GSDs). This has provided the precision agriculture community with the ability to analyze individual plants, and in certain cases, individual leaves on those plants. This has also allowed for a dramatic increase in data acquisition for agricultural analysis. Because satellite and manned aircraft remote sensing data collections had larger GSDs, self-shadowing was not seen as an issue for agricultural remote sensing. However, sUAS are able to image these shadows which can cause issues in data analysis. This paper investigates the inherent reflectance variability of vegetation by analyzing six Coneflower plants, as a surrogate for other cash crops, across different variables. These plants were measured under different forecasts (cloudy and sunny), at different times (08:00 a.m., 09:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.), and at different GSDs (2, 4 and 8 cm) using a field portable spectroradiometer (ASD Field Spec). In addition, a leafclip spectrometer was utilized to measure individual leaves on each plant in a controlled lab environment. These spectra were analyzed to determine if there was any significant difference in the health of the various plants measured. Finally, a MicaSense RedEdge-3 multispectral camera was utilized to capture images of the plants every hour to analyze the variability produced by a sensor designed for agricultural remote sensing. The RedEdge-3 was held stationary at 1.5 m above the plants while collecting all images, which produced a GSD of 0.1 cm/pixel. To produce 2, 4, and 8 cm GSD, the MicaSense RedEdge-3 would need to be at an altitude of 30.5 m, 61 m and 122 m respectively. This study did not take background effects into consideration for either the ASD or MicaSense. Results showed that GSD produced a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, a commonly used metric to determine vegetation health), R2 values demonstrated a low correlation between time of day and NDVI, and a one-way ANOVA test showed no statistically significant difference in the NDVI computed from the leafclip probe (p-value of 0.018). Ultimately, it was determined that the best condition for measuring vegetation reflectance was on cloudy days near noon. Sunny days produced self-shadowing on the plants which increased the variability of the measured reflectance values (higher standard deviations in all five RedEdge-3 channels), and the shadowing of the plants decreased as time approached noon. This high reflectance variability in the coneflower plants made it difficult to accurately measure the NDVI.

TI  - Species Richness and Taxonomic Distinctness of Zooplankton in Ponds and Small Lakes from Albania and North Macedonia: The Role of Bioclimatic Factors
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Resolving the contribution to biodiversity patterns of regional-scale environmental drivers is, to date, essential in the implementation of effective conservation strategies. Here, we assessed the species richness S and taxonomic distinctness Delta+ (used a proxy of phylogenetic diversity) of crustacean zooplankton assemblages from 40 ponds and small lakes located in Albania and North Macedonia and tested whether they could be predicted by waterbodies' landscape characteristics (area, perimeter, and altitude), together with local bioclimatic conditions that were derived from Wordclim and MODIS databases. The results showed that a minimum adequate model, including the positive effects of non-arboreal vegetation cover and temperature seasonality, together with the negative influence of the mean temperature of the wettest quarter, effectively predicted assemblages' variation in species richness. In contrast, taxonomic distinctness did not predictably respond to landscape or bioclimatic factors. Noticeably, waterbodies' area showed a generally low prediction power for both S and Delta+. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of assemblages' species composition indicated the occurrence of two distinct groups of waterbodies characterized by different species and different precipitation and temperature regimes. Our findings indicated that the classical species-area relationship hypothesis is inadequate in explaining the diversity of crustacean zooplankton assemblages characterizing the waterbodies under analysis. In contrast, local bioclimatic factors might affect the species richness and composition, but not their phylogenetic diversity, the latter likely to be influenced by long-term adaptation mechanisms.

TI  - Satellite-based assessment of direct aerosol radiative forcing using a look-up table established through AERONET observations
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) plays an important role in atmospheric radiation budget and climate condition, which can be calculated by ground-based data with high-precision and satellite data with high spatial coverage. For this paper, a novel satellite-based DARF assessment method was developed to calculate DARF at shortwave (0.25-4 mu m) using satellite data, and the Look-up table of single scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry factor (ASY). Accuracy was validated for results obtained in Beijing using this method with results calculated from high-precision Aerosol Robotic NET-work (AERONET) data, and their correlation coefficients at the top of atmosphere (TOA), bottom of atmosphere (BOT) and with atmosphere (ATM) were 0.88, 0.93 and 0.74, respectively. The performance of DARF calculation results was analyzed at annual and monthly scales, and it is reasonable compared with previous study. In addition, the method was applied under diverse conditions, i.e., aerosol types conditions, atmospheric pollution conditions and season conditions, and works well. The results in this study suggest that the satellite-based DARF assessment method can be used for studying shortwave DARF and support the research about regional aerosol radiative forcing using satellite data.

TI  - Assessing beach and island habitat loss in the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva coastal bay region, USA, through processing of Landsat imagery: A case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Beaches and islands provide economic and social value to humans and contribute critical habitat for breeding and foraging wildlife. These ecosystems, however, are being severely impacted by global climate change and sea level rise through increased erosion and frequency of inundation. The case study presented here aimed to document island loss in the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva coastal bay region of the United States using image processing techniques within a GIS from 1986 to 2016. Satellite imagery from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors were processed within ArcMap 10.5 to determine spatial and temporal trends in island and beach habitat. Calculation of unweighted Cohen's Kappa showed that classified scenes were, on average, within the range of moderate agreement between the classified Landsat scenes and the validation imagery within Google Earth Pro (0.539). From 1986 to 2016, island area declined by over 1200 hectare (ha) with agriculture/open field (all open vegetated spaces) declining by nearly 82% and beach, surprisingly, increasing nearly 2%. This study was the first to document Chesapeake Bay region-wide island loss beyond the mid-2000s. The accuracy of this study was limited slightly by the 30 m spatial resolution of the imagery. Therefore, this technique may be best suited for documenting trends on large islands and along the mainland coastline.

TI  - Mapping Chestnut Stands Using Bi-Temporal VHR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the potential of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images and extended morphological profiles for mapping Chestnut stands on Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain). Regarding their relevance for ecosystem services in the region (cultural and provisioning services) the public sector demand up-to-date information on chestnut and a simple straight-forward approach is presented in this study. We used two VHR WorldView images (March and May 2015) to cover different phenological phases. Moreover, we included spatial information in the classification process by extended morphological profiles (EMPs). Random forest is used for the classification process and we analyzed the impact of the bi-temporal information as well as of the spatial information on the classification accuracies. The detailed accuracy assessment clearly reveals the benefit of bi-temporal VHR WorldView images and spatial information, derived by EMPs, in terms of the mapping accuracy. The bi-temporal classification outperforms or at least performs equally well when compared to the classification accuracies achieved by the mono-temporal data. The inclusion of spatial information by EMPs further increases the classification accuracy by 5% and reduces the quantity and allocation disagreements on the final map. Overall the new proposed classification strategy proves useful for mapping chestnut stands in a heterogeneous and complex landscape, such as the municipality of La Orotava, Tenerife.

TI  - Young children, adolescent girls and women with type 1 diabetes are more overweight and obese than reference populations, and this is associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors
T2  - DIABETIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Overweight and obesity are frequently reported in young persons with type 1 diabetes, however its relative magnitude in comparison to the general population is not well understood. This study compared the prevalence of overweight and obesity in young persons with type 1 diabetes to a reference population and explored possible associated factors, including gender, age, HbA(1c), insulin regimen, age at diagnosis, diabetes duration, socio-economic status and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional review was undertaken of data collected from youth (3-17 years) in 2016 and young adults (18-30 years) in 2015 with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for > 3 months attending diabetes centres in Newcastle, Australia. Rates of overweight and obesity were compared with matched population survey results. Results Data from 308 youth and 283 young adults were included. In girls, significantly higher prevalence of overweight and obesity were seen in the 5-8 (43% vs. 18%), 13-16 (41% vs. 27%), 18-24 (46% vs. 34%) and 25-30 (60% vs. 43%) years age groups; whereas in boys increased prevalence was observed in the 5-8 years age group only (41% vs. 18%). Rates of overweight and obesity increased with age across sexes. In youth, BMI standard deviation score was correlated with socio-economic status, insulin regimen, blood pressure and blood lipids (P < 0.05). In adults, BMI was positively associated with blood pressure, and longer diabetes duration (P < 0.02). Conclusions Overweight and obesity are over-represented in young persons with type 1 diabetes, particularly girls. As overweight is associated with other cardiovascular disease markers early intervention is paramount.

TI  - Mapping soil salinity using spectral mixture analysis of landsat 8 OLI images to identify factors influencing salinization in an arid region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most serious environmental issues degrading land resources globally, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, regional and precise monitoring of soil salinity is required to prevent and mitigate salinization. This study aimed to specify an effective monitoring method with remote sensing techniques using the Dakhla Oasis, central Western Desert of Egypt as a case study area. For ground-truthing, electrical conductivity, pH, reflectance spectra, and mineral compositions were measured for top soil samples from 31 points. Spectral data from a Landsat8 OLI image of one scene acquired close to the ground sampling time was used to estimate soil salinity using a variety of methods, including single band, band ratio and combination, spectral index, linear spectral unmixing (LSU), and mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF). After estimating the salinity over the study area through the best regression model between the spectral data and measured salinity data, the image was classified into five salinity classes. The classified salinized zones were verified by the resistivity and thickness of the near-surface layers and depth to the groundwater table, using vertical electrical sounding (VES) at 46 profiles. The most salinized zones in the southern area were congruent with the lowest VES resistivity. The surface layer thickness and day content were specified as the main cause of the salinity difference between the southern and northern areas. The land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from the thermal band data of the OLI image and another Landsat ETM + image in 2001 was identified as increasing salinization. Finally, urban and vegetation land covers along with the five soil salinity classes were characterized by the influencing factors of elevation, slope, LST, soil pH, top layer resistivity and thickness, and depth to the groundwater table. LSU proved to predict salinity more accurately with 76% correctness than the MTMF model (67%) and the band combination and spectral indices (55% at most). The proposed methods will be useful for soil salinity mapping from satellite imagery in similar environments to this study.

TI  - <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Kelch Propeller Polymorphisms in Clinical Isolates from Ghana from 2007 to 2016
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous surveillance of polymorphisms in the kelch propeller domain of Plasmodium falciparum from Africa is important for the discovery of the actual markers of artemisinin resistance in the region. The information on the markers is crucial for control strategies involving chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis for residents and nonimmune travelers to the country. Polymorphisms in the kelch propeller domain of Ghanaian malaria parasites from three different ecological zones at several time periods were assessed. A total of 854 archived samples (2007 to 2016) collected from uncomplicated malaria patients aged <= 9 years old from 10 sentinel sites were used. Eighty-four percent had wild-type sequences (PF3D7_1343700), while many of the mutants had mostly nonsynonymous mutations clustered around codons 404 to 650. Variants with different amino acid changes of the codons associated with artemisinin (ART) resistance validated markers were observed in Ghanaian isolates: frequencies for I543I, I543S, I543V, R561P, R561R, and C580V were 0.12% each and 0.6% for R539I. Mutations reported from African parasites, A578S (0.23%) and Q613L (0.23%), were also observed. Three persisting nonsynonymous (NS) mutations, N599Y (0.005%), K607E (0.004%), and V637G (0.004%), were observed in 3 of the 5 time periods nationally. The presence of variants of the validated markers of artemisinin resistance as well as persisting polymorphisms after 14 years of artemisinin-based combination therapy use argues for continuous surveillance of the markers. The molecular markers of artemisinin resistance and the observed variants will be monitored subsequently as part of ongoing surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy/resistance studies in the country.

TI  - An Improved Estimate of the Coupled Arctic Energy Budget
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combines state-of-the-art reanalyses such as the fifth-generation European Re-Analysis (ERA5) and the Ocean Reanalysis System 5 (ORAS5) with novel observational products to present an updated estimate of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice Arctic energy budget, including flux and storage terms covering 2001-17. Observational products provide independent estimates of crucial budget terms, including oceanic heat transport from unique mooring-derived data, radiative fluxes from satellites, and sea ice volume from merged satellite data. Results show that the time averages of independent estimates of radiative, atmospheric, and oceanic energy fluxes into the Arctic Ocean domain are remarkably consistent in the sense that their sum closely matches the observed rate of regional long-term oceanic heat accumulation of similar to 1 W m(-2). Atmospheric and oceanic heat transports are found to be stronger compared to earlier assessments (similar to 100 and similar to 16 W m(-2), respectively). Data inconsistencies are larger when considering the mean annual cycle of the coupled energy budget, with RMS values of the monthly budget residual between 7 and 15 W m(-2), depending on the employed datasets. This nevertheless represents an average reduction of similar to 72% of the residual compared to earlier work and demonstrates the progress made in data quality and diagnostic techniques. Finally, the budget residual is eliminated using a variational approach to provide a best estimate of the mean annual cycle. The largest remaining sources of uncertainty are ocean heat content and latent heat associated with sea ice melt and freeze, which both suffer from the lack of observational constraints. More ocean in situ observations and reliable sea ice thickness observations and their routinely assimilation into reanalyses are needed to further reduce uncertainty.

TI  - African dust deposition in Puerto Rico: Analysis of a 20-year rainfall chemistry record and comparison with models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust deposition represents an important flux of rock-derived nutrients such as phosphorus to ecosystems on highly weathered soils. Direct measurements of terrestrial dust deposition and its spatial variability are rare, yet they are essential for testing models of dust deposition processes and understanding the biogeochemical effects of dust. Long-term records of precipitation chemistry are available in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico, which are downwind of the world's largest dust source in Africa. We analyzed 20-year datasets of openfall, throughfall, and wet-only precipitation chemistry with weekly resolution at two different locations in the Luquillo Mountains to evaluate spatial and temporal variability of dust inputs and compare the observational records with models. Based on rainwater dissolved silica and total suspended solids content, the measured dust flux varied by a factor of 2 over a distance of 10 km despite similarities between sites in elevation and rainfall amount. In comparison with simulated dust deposition from ten models in the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project, the empirical rainfall chemistry agrees well with the mean of the models on the seasonal distribution of wet dust distribution. Both the data and the models show a summer maximum in wet dust deposition that is consistent with variation in transport pathways and the dust source area emission strength based on environmental conditions in the Sahel region. The rainfall chemistry record and AeroCom models also agree in terms of attributing similar to 70% of the total dust deposition overall to dry deposition, although the range of uncertainty in the models is large. The results indicate value in combining long-term analysis of rainfall chemistry with data from satellites and models, and highlight the need for accurate ground-based metrics for dry deposition to improve understanding and modeling of dust deposition processes. The dataset complements earlier studies that characterize the dust plume originating from Northern Africa and its impact on ecosystems in South America and the Caribbean.

TI  - Spatially Extensive Ground-Penetrating Radar Snow Depth Observations During NASA's 2017 SnowEx Campaign: Comparison With In Situ, Airborne, and Satellite Observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow is an important component of Earth's hydrologic cycle and climate system, yet it remains challenging to consistently and accurately measure snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) across the range of diverse snowpack conditions that exist on Earth. The NASA SnowEx campaign is focused on addressing the primary gaps in snow remote sensing in order to gain an improved spatiotemporal understanding of this important resource and to further efforts toward a future satellitebased snow remote sensing mission. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is an efficient and mature approach for measuring snow depth and SWE. We collected similar to 1.3 million GPR snow depth observations during the NASA SnowEx 2017 campaign, yielding a spatially extensive (similar to 133-km total length) and high-resolution (similar to 10-cm lateral spacing) validation data set to assess various remote sensing and modeling approaches. We found high correlation between the GPR and manual snow probe derived snow depths (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 18 cm), but a median difference of -10 cm, which we attribute, in part, to probe penetration into the unfrozen subsurface. We also compared GPR-derived snow depths to two other independent estimates of snow depth, as an example of how this data set can be used for validation of remote sensing techniques: Airborne Snow Observatory lidar-derived snow depths (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001, median difference = -1 cm, RMSE = 14 cm) and preliminary DigitalGlobe WorldView-3 satellite-derived snow depths (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001, median difference = -3 cm, RMSE = 24 cm).

M3  - Article
AB  - Rising temperatures and more frequent droughts are posing new challenges to range livestock producers in the southwestern United States and many other parts of the world. We analyzed a 52-yr time series (1967-2018) of precipitation, ambient temperature, and perennial grass production (PGP), as well as 14 yr (2001-2014) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-derived vegetation phenometrics at a site in the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico. PGP was positively associated with December through September precipitation (r = 0.69; P < 0.01) but negatively associated with spring and summer (May-September) maximum average ambient temperature (r = -0.47; P < 0.01). PGP decreased by 43% in the second (1993-2018) compared with the first half (1967-1992) of our study (165 vs. 94 kg dry matter . ha(-1); P < 0.01). Precipitation was lower and more erratic in the second half of the time series, decreasing by 18.6% (265.2 +/- 15.0 vs. 215.8 +/- 15.8 mm; P = 0.01). Conversely, mean maximum and mean ambient temperatures were higher during the 1993-2018 period (max T: 24.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 25.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C; P < 0.01; mean T:14.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 15.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C; P < 0.01). MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis showed that growing seasons began and ended later and became shorter (P < 0.05) over the 14 yr analyzed. During this period, increasing maximum spring and summer (May-September) ambient temperatures were associated with decreasing growing season NDVI values (P < 0.01). Over the 52-yr study period, Chihuahuan Desert rangelands at our research site lost 43% of grazing capacity based on PGP. Nine drought yr occurred in the second half of our study compared with 2 yr in the first half. Our research supports predictions by climate scientists that higher temperatures, more frequent droughts, and lower, as well as more erratic, precipitation will adversely impact grazing capacity of rangelands in the southwestern United States.

TI  - Impact of local and regional emission sources on air quality in foothills of the Himalaya during spring 2016: An observation, satellite and modeling perspective
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chitwan National Park in south-central Nepal is one of the few remaining protected forest ecosystems in South Asia with rich flora and fauna. However, in recent years, southern Nepal including the region of the National park area have experienced deteriorating air quality, which has raised concerns about its impact on ecosystem and public health. The region experiences forest fires during pre-monsoon season and thus, provide an ideal opportunity not only to study its impact on air quality but also to provide source specific diagnostic ratios. In this study, we report measurements of black carbon (BC), trace gases as well as particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) from Chitwan Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAQMS) during pre-monsoon season (February-May 2016). Average concentrations of BC, PM10, PM2.5, PM1 were found to be 10.9 +/- 6.9 mu g m(-3), 156.4 +/- 68.2 mu g m(-3), 95.9 +/- 49.0 mu g m(-3), 80.1 +/- 45.5 mu g m(-3) which are much higher than the prescribed 24 h limits of World Health Organization (25 mu g m(-3) for PM10 and 10 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5). Furthermore, average concentrations of trace gases, CO, CO2 and CH4 were 713.4 +/- 476.6 ppbv, 446.0 +/- 15.3 ppm and 2.182 +/- 0.117 ppm respectively which are also higher than those in the surrounding regions. We identified two pollution events (Event #1 from 16 to 28 March 2016 and Event #2 from 6 to 17 April 2016) and found that surface concentrations of all measured species increased by a factor of 2-3 during these events. The BC/CO ratio of 16.3 +/- 2.0, 11.1 +/- 3.7 and 9.9 +/- 4.2 ng m(-3) ppbv(-1) was observed during Event#1, Event#2 and during non-event period. Based on MODIS active fire counts and Angstr.m absorption exponent (AAE values of 1.8 and 1.9 during Event #1 and #2 respectively), we found that biomass burning (BB) activities were an important source during these events. This is further substantiated by relatively higher contribution of BB to observed BC concentration during both the events (73% and 75% during Event#1 and #2 respectively). Furthermore, a Langrangian modeling framework was used to quantify the contribution of local and regional fires to BC concentration. The contribution of local fires to modelled BC at CAQMS during Event #1 and #2 is estimated to be similar to 70% and similar to 78%, respectively. The satellite retrievals of AOD, NO2 and CO also exhibit a significant increase in columnar concentration during these pollution events. The CALIOP retrieved vertical profile of extinction coefficient further confirmed that these pollutants are not only confined near the surface but are lifted up to 2 km altitude, which can subsequently be transported to high-altitude pristine sites and can impose serious implications on the cryosphere.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Displacement Fields from InSAR through Tikhonov Regularization and Least-Squares Variance Component Estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) measures the projection of three-dimensional (3D) ground displacement in the range direction and in the azimuth direction through image processing. The incapability of InSAR in measuring the 3D displacements restricts its capability for assessing real Earth surface deformation. The near-polar orbiting characteristics of InSAR missions reduce the sensitivity of line-of-sight (LOS) displacements significantly to the north-south components of the real 3D displacement fields and weaken the geometric strength of a given configuration. Applying range measurements from various missions to address 3D displacement leads to an ill-posed inverse problem that needs to be regularized. Moreover, it needs appropriate weighting of the observations to give proper estimates of the parameters. In this study, we propose Tikhonov regularization (TR) and least-squares variance component estimation (LS-VCE) methods for retrieving 3D displacement vectors from range and azimuth displacements. Depending on the functional degree of freedom (DoF) of the inverse problem, the TR and LS-VCE methods are applied in determined and overdetermined equation systems, respectively, to stabilize the ill-conditioned models and estimate the variance components of observations. These methods were evaluated by two synthetic data sets and a real data set from the Sentinel-1 terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS) and ALOS-2 phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR-2) missions in 2015 of the MW = 8.3 Illapel earthquake in Chile. Results indicate more than 40% improvement in both the precision and accuracy of retrieving 3D deformation fields when the regularized LS-VCE (RLS-VCE) is adopted instead of the conventional method (CM) that considers primary weighting for observations. Applying the range and azimuth InSAR displacements together with adopting the LS-VCE method reveal a north-south convergent borderline near 31.2 degrees S in the 2015 Illapel earthquake.

TI  - Understanding MODIS dark-target collection 5 and 6 aerosol data over China: Effect of surface type, aerosol loading and aerosol absorption
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For regions where limited in-situ observations are available for use as a reference, such as in China, the understanding of how changes in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol retrieval algorithm impact the data quality is limited. In this paper, the MODIS-Aqua Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) Collection 5 (C5) and 6 (C6) Dark-Target (DT) products are evaluated by comparison with similar products from the China Aerosol Remote Sensing NETwork (CARSNET) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in China for the year 2008. The validation data are analyzed for key factors affecting the results of the MODIS-DT aerosol retrieval algorithm, including surface type, aerosol loading and aerosol absorption. The impacts of the change from the C5 to the C6 versions of the MODIS AOT retrieval algorithm are discussed in detail. The main findings are: (1) The agreement from retrieval aspects between both MODIS C5/C6 and CARSNET-AERONET for most AOT values over distinct regions indicates that the conclusions obtained from C5 hold for C6; (2) MODIS-DT has an extended coverage (more retrievals) with good quality due to the change of upstream data (calibration, cloud masking, etc); (3) About 64% of the MODISDT C6 AOT data over China fall within the (+/- 0.15 AOT +/- 0.05) error envelope; (4) positive AOT differences between C6 and C5 over relatively dark surfaces and negative differences over relatively bright surfaces due to the change of surface parameterization have been observed; (5) the AOT difference between MODIS and CARSNET-AERONET relating to AOT loading is not significant, especially for large AOT; (6) MODIS-DT performs well for absorbing aerosol over relatively bright surfaces.

TI  - Variation in quality of acute stroke care by day and time of admission: prospective cohort study of weekday and weekend centralised hyperacute stroke unit care and non-centralised services
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To investigate variations in quality of acute stroke care and outcomes by day and time of admission in London hyperacute stroke units compared with the rest of England.Design Prospective cohort study using anonymised patient-level data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme.Setting Acute stroke services in London hyperacute stroke units and the rest of England.Participants 68 239 patients with a primary diagnosis of stroke admitted between January and December 2014.Interventions Hub-and-spoke model for care of suspected acute stroke patients in London with performance standards designed to deliver uniform access to high-quality hyperacute stroke unit care across the week.Main outcome measures 16 indicators of quality of acute stroke care, mortality at 3 days after admission to the hospital, disability at the end of the inpatient spell, length of stay.Results There was no variation in quality of care by day and time of admission to the hospital across the week in terms of stroke nursing assessment, brain scanning and thrombolysis in London hyperacute stroke units, nor was there variation in 3-day mortality or disability at hospital discharge (all p values>0.05). Other quality of care measures significantly varied by day and time of admission across the week in London (all p values<0.01). In the rest of England there was variation in all measures by day and time of admission across the week (all p values<0.01), except for mortality at 3days (p value>0.05).Conclusions The London hyperacute stroke unit model achieved performance standards for 'front door' stroke care across the week. The same benefits were not achieved by other models of care in the rest of England. There was no weekend effect for mortality in London or the rest of the England. Other aspects of care were not constant across the week in London hyperacute stroke units, indicating some performance standards were perceived to be more important than others.

TI  - Methodology for classification of land use and vegetation cover using MODIS-EVI data
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to verify the applicability of using MODIS-EVI sensor time series for land use and vegetation cover mapping in the Pampa biome, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. The study period comprised the months from June 2013 to June 2014. The procedures included the use of MODIS Sensor images, altimetric data and nighttime images, associated with a hierarchical decision tree classifier, constructed using the C4.5 algorithm. The proposed approach stems from the consideration that the study area has varying characteristics and, therefore, should be treated simultaneously by different and intuitive classifiers, which justifies the choice of decision tree. To evaluate the results, reference data acquired from Landsat 8-OLI satellite images and IBGE data were used. The classification using the MODIS time series showed a global accuracy of 90.09% and Kappa index of 0.8885. When compared to the IBGE reference data, the Soybean class obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.94, the rice class obtained 0.97 and the silviculture class obtained the lowest value, 0.78. The highest spectral similarities were found in the vegetation cover classes, such as grassland, forest and silviculture. Therefore, with the use of multitemporal data from the MODIS sensor, combined with the use of altimetric data and nighttime images, it is possible to generate a land use and vegetation cover map for the Pampa biome with an acceptable accuracy, considering the MODIS sensor resolution limitations.

TI  - Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration using Landsat 8 in the Cassaffousth reservoir
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The physico-chemical and biological composition of a reservoir's effluents directly influences water quality. The values of variables such as high values of concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) are indicators of pollution. The objective of this work was to monitor the trophic status and water quality of the Cassaffousth reservoir (Cordoba, Argentina) through the development of statistical models based on field data and satellite information. During 2016 and 2017, samples were taken bimonthly. Seven sampling sites were selected and physico-chemical and biological parameters were assessed. By using regression techniques, Landsat 8 information was related with field data to construct and validate a statistical model to determine the distribution of Chl-a in the reservoir (R-2 = 0.87). The generated algorithm was used to generate maps which contained information about the dynamics of Chl-a in the entire reservoir. Remote sensing techniques can be used to expand the knowledge of the dynamics of the Cassaffousth reservoir. Moreover, these techniques can be used as baselines for the development of an early warning system for this and other reservoirs in the region.

TI  - Mapping Surface Flow Velocity of Glaciers at Regional Scale Using a Multiple Sensors Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore and compare the capabilities and limitations of different optical sensors (Sentinel-2/ESA, Landsat 7/8/USGS, Ven mu s/CNES-ISA, Pleiades/AirbusD&S and Planet Labs images) for mapping the surface speeds of mountain glaciers on a regional scale. We present here our automated workflow designed to download data from institutional or commercial servers, prepare images, launch the feature tracking algorithm, calibrate glacier surface speeds, and our post-processing treatment to obtain filtered and time-averaged velocity maps. We applied our methodology to three regions: (1) the European alps; (2) the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca; and (3) the Southern Alps of New Zealand for years 2017 and 2018 and quantified ice velocity for every possible repeat cycle from few days up to 400 days. For these regions, we demonstrate the ability of our processing chain to derive precise time-averaged ice flow maps. The statistical analysis of the results provided by each individual repeat cycles shows that velocity mapping from Sentinel-2 is about twice more precise than that from Landsat 7/8. If Sentinel-2 captures more details than Landsat, some of the smallest glaciers (<250 m wide) remain challenging. Given the estimated precision for Sentinel-2, we also conclude that velocity fluctuations of the order of 10 m/yr can only be captured with repeat cycles longer than 60 days. Comparing Sentinel-2 with Pleiades, Planet and Ven mu s imagery, we finally highlight the advantages of high-resolution sensors to map glacier surface speed with finer details in space and time.

T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To investigate the feasibility of hookwire-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) followed by a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay. Patients and Methods: Clinical T1-2N0M0 breast cancer patients scheduled to undergo SLNB participated in this study. Both Sonazoid (R) and dye were used as tracers, and the most upstream sentinel lymph node (SLN) at each lymphatic flow detected by CEUS (First-SLN) was sampled under hookwire guidance, a procedure called "Sona-Hook". Results: In each of the 50 cases, at least one First-SLN was extracted by "Sona-Hook". All contrast-enhanced SLNs (CE-SLNs) were dye-positive, and the mean number of CE-SLNs sampled per patient was lower than that of dye-positive SLNs (1.48 vs. 1.88, p<0.01). Through OSNA, qualitative assessment of tumor metastasis between First-SLNs and all SLNs completely matched together. Conclusion: "Sona-Hook" for First-SLN followed by an OSNA assay may be a feasible minimally invasive SLNB strategy.

TI  - Field Margin Vegetation in Tropical African Bean Systems Harbours Diverse Natural Enemies for Biological Pest Control in Adjacent Crops
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-crop vegetation around farmland can be valuable habitats for enhancing ecosystem services but little is known of the importance of field margins in supporting natural enemies of insect pests in tropical agriculture. This study was conducted in smallholder bean fields in three elevation zones to assess the importance of field margin vegetation to natural enemy populations and movement to the bean crop for biological pest control. The pests and natural enemies were assessed using different coloured water pan traps (to ensure the capture of insects with different colour preferences) and the interactions of the two arthropod groups with the margin vegetation and their movement to the bean crop were monitored using fluorescent dye. Sentinel plants were used to assess predation and parasitism levels. A total of 5003 natural enemies were captured, more in the field margin than within the bean field for low and mid elevation zones, while in the high elevation zone, they were more abundant within the bean field. Pests were more abundant in the crop than margins for all the elevation zones. The use of a dye applied to margin vegetation demonstrated that common natural enemy taxa moved to the crop during the days after dye application. The proportion of dye-marked natural enemies (showing their origin to be margin vegetation) sampled from the crop suggest high levels of spatial flux in the arthropod assemblage. Aphid mortality rates (measured by prey removal and parasitism levels on sentinel plants) did not differ between the field edges and field centre in any of the three elevation zones, suggesting that for this pest taxon, the centre of the fields still receive comparable pest control service as in the field edges. This study found that field margins around smallholder bean fields are useful habitats to large numbers of natural enemy taxa that move to adjacent crops providing biological pest control service.

TI  - Slope Stability Monitoring Using Novel Remote Sensing Based Fuzzy Logic
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - By the assist of remotely sensed data, this study examines the viability of slope stability monitoring using two novel conventional models. The proposed models are considered to be the combination of neuro-fuzzy (NF) system along with invasive weed optimization (IWO) and elephant herding optimization (EHO) evolutionary techniques. Considering the conditioning factors of land use, lithology, soil type, rainfall, distance to the road, distance to the river, slope degree, elevation, slope aspect, profile curvature, plan curvature, stream power index (SPI), and topographic wetness index (TWI), it is aimed to achieve a reliable approximation of landslide occurrence likelihood for unseen environmental conditions. To this end, after training the proposed EHO-NF and IWO-NF ensembles using training landslide events, their generalization power is evaluated by receiving operating characteristic curves. The results demonstrated around 75% accuracy of prediction for both models; however, the IWO-NF achieved a better understanding of landslide distribution pattern. Due to the successful performance of the implemented models, they could be promising alternatives to mathematical and analytical approaches being used for discerning the relationship between the slope failure and environmental parameters.

TI  - Persistent albedo reduction on southern Icelandic glaciers due to ashfall from the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In April and May 2010 the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull experienced an explosive eruption that led to substantial ashfall across the central-southern parts of the island. The resulting ash deposits covered Eyjafjallajokull, Myrdalsjokull and parts of Vatnajokull ice caps. In order to quantify the influence of these deposits on albedo, we analyzed albedo evolution across Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull ice caps over the period 2001-2016 using the MOD10A1 and MCD43A3 data products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. A geostatistical model with a daily temporal resolution was used to delineate areas on the ice caps that show distinct ash cover-related albedo reductions over the post-eruption period. Results suggest that despite an overall decrease of the ash cover-related albedo reductions with time, noticeable albedo reductions persist on both, Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull over the entire post-eruption period. These reductions show means of 0.19 +/- 0.11 and 0.17 +/- 0.10, respectively, and occur most prominently during the summer seasons. Persistent albedo reductions are in agreement with and limited to areas of higher ash deposition during the volcanic eruption such as the southern parts of Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull ice caps. In addition, redistribution of Eyjafjallajokull ash deposited on the lowlands in southern Iceland contributed to dust storm events in the years after the eruption and caused additional albedo reductions.

TI  - Assessment of land subsidence susceptibility in Semnan plain (Iran): a comparison of support vector machine and weights of evidence data mining algorithms
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a geo-hazard that leads to slow or rapid decrease in ground level. This can result in geological, environmental, hydrogeological, and economic impacts. Land subsidence has already occurred in more than 300 plains in Iran. Semnan plain is one of the most important areas undergoing this phenomenon. In general, miscellaneous methods have been employed around the world to assess land subsidence susceptibility. In this study, support vector machine and weights of evidence Bayesian theory were applied to assess land subsidence susceptibility. In the first step, the required information on the history of subsidence in the study area was provided. Locations of the land subsidence were specified by Landsat 8 satellite images and field surveys. Twelve conditioning factors from different basic layers including topography, geology, land use, and groundwater table were considered for modeling. Spatial correlation between land subsidence locations and effective factors was calculated using weights of evidence Bayesian theory. Land subsidence susceptibility maps were created using support vector machine and weights of evidence models. ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's Kappa index, and fourfold cross-validation were employed to validate the obtained land subsidence susceptibility maps. In Semnan plain, AUC for the support vector machine and weights of evidence models was 0.748 and 0.726, respectively, demonstrating that the given models hold an acceptable accuracy for land subsidence susceptibility mapping; however, the accuracy of the support vector machine is higher than that of weights of evidence model. Results of this research can help policy makers as well as environmental and urban planners.

TI  - Peridomestic and community-wide landscape risk factors for Lyme disease across a range of community contexts in Pennsylvania
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and forest fragmentation are thought to be major drivers of Lyme disease incidence and its geographic distribution. We examined the association between landscape composition and configuration and Lyme disease in a population-based case control study in the Geisinger health system in Pennsylvania. Lyme disease cases (n = 9657) were identified using a combination of diagnosis codes, laboratory codes, and antibiotic orders from electronic health records (EHRs). Controls (5:1) were randomly selected and frequency matched on year, age, and sex. We measured six landscape variables based on prior literature, derived from the National Land Cover Database and MODIS satellite imagery: greenness (normalized difference vegetation index), percent forest, percent herbaceous, forest edge density, percent forest-herbaceous edge, and mean forest patch size. We assigned landscape variables within two spatial contexts (community and 1/2-mile [805 m] Euclidian residential buffer). In models stratified by community type, landscape variables were modeled as tertiles and flexible splines and associations were adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. In general, we observed positive associations between landscape metrics and Lyme disease, except for percent herbaceous, where associations differed by community type. For example, compared to the lowest tertile, individuals with highest tertile of greenness in residential buffers had higher odds of Lyme disease (odds ratio: 95% confidence interval [CI]) in townships (1.73: 1.55, 1.93), boroughs (1.70: 1.40, 2.07), and cities (3.71: 1.74, 7.92). Similarly, corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) for forest edge density were 1.34 (1.22, 1.47), 1.56 (1.33, 1.82), and 1.90 (1.13, 3.18). Associations were generally higher in residential buffers, compared to community, and in cities, compared to boroughs or townships. Our results reinforce the importance of peridomestic landscape in Lyme disease risk, particularly measures that reflect human interaction with tick habitat. Linkage of EHR data to public data on residential and community context may lead to new health system-based approaches for improving Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

AB  - The combination of smaller, screen-detected cancers, improved efficacy of systemic therapy, and increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy with rising rates of pathologic complete response has prompted interest in studying elimination of surgery for some women with breast cancer. In order to determine whether this is a high priority area for research, knowledge of the proportion of cancers cured by surgery, the morbidity of current surgical approaches to breast cancer, and patient treatment preferences must be considered. This article reviews these topics and addresses some of the concerns about elimination of surgery in the settings of patients with small amounts of non-high-grade DCIS and in those who appear to have a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) levels in rat livers collected from a malaria vector control region
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an organochlorine insecticide that has been used for indoor residual spraying for the control of mosquito-borne diseases including malaria. However, due to its toxicity and environmental persistence, there are concerns about its potential deleterious effects in humans and wildlife. Therefore, the current study aimed to monitor and estimate the level of DDTs in human communities. The accumulation of DDT and its metabolites was evaluated in house rat (as sentinel) livers collected in an area where DDT was sprayed. DDTs were measured using a gas chromatography / Electron Capture Detector. The results revealed high concentrations of DDTs in the rat livers and the levels of DDTs were similar to findings reported from the same area in 2014.

TI  - Increased radiation toxicity with germline ATM variant of uncertain clinical significance
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: While patients with ataxia telangiectasia are known to have increased radiation sensitivity, patients with germline heterozygous ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) mutations can have widely varying functional and clinical effects, which can make management decisions difficult. With an increased prevalence of gene panel-based testing for breast cancer patients, radiation oncologists are increasingly confronted with patients who carry germline ATM variants of uncertain clinical significance. This study describes the clinical courses and outcomes of 5 breast cancer patients with varying germline heterozygous ATM mutations undergoing radiation therapy at our institution in order to provide additional knowledge of the varying clinical effects to aid future decision making.Case Series: We identified 5 patients with breast cancer and varying germline heterozygous ATM mutations treated at the University of North Carolina Hospitals between 2015 and 2017. The median age at breast cancer diagnosis for the patient series was 46. Clinical effects of radiation treatment varied amongst the 5 patients. The one patient with a pathogenic ATM mutation had no increased radiation related toxicity. Of the 4 patients with ATM variants of uncertain significance, one patient had increased radiation sensitivity with Grade 3 dermatitis. All patients have remained recurrence free with a median duration of 18 months.Conclusion: Our data illustrates that patients with germline heterozygous ATM mutations can have widely varying clinical effects with radiation therapy. Given the possibility of unpredictable deleterious effects, our study highlights the importance of caution and careful consideration when devising the multi-modality management strategy in these patients.

TI  - Role of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer with nonbulky lymph node metastasis: Comparison of comprehensive surgical staging and sentinel lymph node algorithm
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To compare survival and progression outcomes between 2 nodal assessment approaches in patients with nonbulky stage IIIC endometrial cancer (EC).Methods: Patients with stage IIIC EC treated at 2 institutions were retrospectively identified. At 1 institution, a historical series (2004-2008) was treated with systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (LND cohort). At the other institution, more contemporary patients (2006-2013) were treated using a sentinel lymph node algorithm (SLN cohort). Outcomes (hazard ratios [HRs]) within the first 5 years after surgery were compared between cohorts using Cox models adjusted for type of adjuvant therapy.Results: The study included 104 patients (48 LND, 56 SLN). The use of chemoradiotherapy was similar in the 2 cohorts (46% LND vs 50% SLN), but the use of chemotherapy alone (19% vs 36%) or radiotherapy alone (15% vs 2%) differed. Although there was evidence of higher risk of cause-specific death (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 0.79-5.58; P= 0.14) and lower risk of para-aortic progression (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.05-1.42; P= 0.12) for the LND group, the associations did not meet statistical significance. The risk of progression was not significantly different between the groups (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.60-2.67; P=0.53). In parsimonious multivariable models, high-risk tumor characteristics and nonendometrioid type were independently associated with lower cause-specific survival and progression-free survival.Conclusions: In EC patients with nonbulky positive lymph nodes, use of the SLN algorithm with limited nodal dissection does not compromise survival compared with LND. Aggressive pathologic features of the primary tumor are the strongest determinants of prognosis. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study focuses on evaluating the capability and contribution of using backscatter intensity image and textural bands from Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for reducing the limitation of optical image classification and improving the classification accuracy. The study was carried out at Theni district of Tamil Nadu, India, which is characterized by very heterogeneous features. The optical multispectral images such as Linear imaging self scanning sensor-IV (LISS-IV), Sentinel-2A and Landsat8 were used. Support vector machine classifier performed on the different combination of SAR, optical image and texture features. Results showed that the optimal window size was 11 x 11, and mean and variance are optimal textural bands of gray-level co-occurrence matrix techniques. The best classification result was achieved with the combination of LISS-IV and Sentinel-1A-derived features (backscatter intensity and texture features) with an overall accuracy up to 78.49% and a kappa coefficient of up to 0.68, respectively. The combination of optical image and Sentinel-1A data decreased the spectral confusions between the classes, provided better classification results, and reasonably improved the accuracy.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Satellite Revisit Rate on Estimation of Corn Phenological Transition Timing through Shape Model Fitting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural monitoring is an important application of earth-observing satellite systems. In particular, image time-series data are often fit to functions called shape models that are used to derive phenological transition dates or predict yield. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of imaging frequency on model fitting and estimation of corn phenological transition timing. Images (PlanetScope 4-band surface reflectance) and in situ measurements (Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) and leaf area index (LAI)) were collected over a corn field in the mid-Atlantic during the 2018 growing season. Correlation was performed between candidate vegetation indices and SPAD and LAI measurements. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was chosen for shape model fitting based on the ground truth correlation and initial fitting results. Plot-average NDVI time-series were cleaned and fit to an asymmetric double sigmoid function, from which the day of year (DOY) of six different function parameters were extracted. These points were related to ground-measured phenological stages. New time-series were then created by removing images from the original time-series, so that average temporal spacing between images ranged from 3 to 24 days. Fitting was performed on the resampled time-series, and phenological transition dates were recalculated. Average range of estimated dates increased by 1 day and average absolute deviation between dates estimated from original and resampled time-series data increased by 1/3 of a day for every day of increase in average revisit interval. In the context of this study, higher imaging frequency led to greater precision in estimates of shape model fitting parameters used to estimate corn phenological transition timing.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in the Aeolian desertification of Hulunbuir Grassland and its driving factors in China during 1980-2015
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian desertification is one of the most serious environmental issues negatively impacting society. Assessing the spatiotemporal changes in desertification and determining its driving factors are crucial to preventing and controlling desertification. In this study, Landsat remote sensing images from 1980 to 2015 are used to extract the information of aeolian desertified land (ADL) in the Hulunbuir Grassland. We analyse the spatiotemporal dynamic changes in desertification using an intensity analysis, the gravity centre change model, and GIS spatial analysis and discuss the driving factors of these changes. The results show that the ADL area in the Hulunbuir Grassland increased during both 1980-2000 and 2000-2015. The ADL is mainly distributed in the central and western Hulunbuir Grassland. The gravity centres were distributed from west to east in the order of light, moderate, extremely severe, and severe ADL. ADL area and intensity changes were the highest during 1990-2000. The gain intensity of all ADL levels was active during 1980-2015. Excluding the severe ADL from 1980 to 1990 and the extremely severe ADL from 1990 to 2000, the loss intensity of other ADL levels was active. All ADL levels transformed to one level lower after 2000. The increasing annual average temperature, population, farmland area, and number of livestock promoted aeolian desertification during 1980-2000. Environmental protection policies and climate change contributed to the reversal of ADL during 2000-2015. In summary, Hulunbuir Grassland desertification has been controlled to a certain degree and has improved. The development and reversal of ADL were affected by the combined effects of climate change and human activities in the Hulunbuir Grassland. The results can provide meaningful information for the prevention and control of aeolian desertification in the Hulunbuir Grassland.

TI  - A Regularized Raking Estimator for Small-Area Mapping from Forest Inventory Surveys
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new estimator for creating expansion factors for survey plots in the US Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis program. This estimator was previously used in the GIS literature, where it was called Penalized Maximum Entropy Dasymetric Modeling. We show here that the method is a regularized version of the raking estimator widely used in sample surveys. The regularized raking method differs from other predictive modeling methods for integrating survey and ancillary data, in that it produces a single set of expansion factors that can have a general purpose which can be used to produce small-area estimates and wall-to-wall maps of any plot characteristic. This method also differs from other more widely used survey techniques, such as GREG estimation, in that it is guaranteed to produce positive expansion factors. Here, we extend the previous method to include cross-validation, and provide a comparison to expansion factors between the regularized raking and ridge GREG survey calibration.

TI  - Fuzzy Object-Based Image Analysis Methods Using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 Data to Map and Characterize Soil Surface Residue
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil degradation, defined as the lowering and loss of soil functions, is becoming a serious problem worldwide and threatens agricultural production and terrestrial ecosystems. The surface residue of crops is one of the most effective erosion control measures and it increases the soil moisture content. In some areas of the world, the management of soil surface residue (SSR) is crucial for increasing soil fertility, maintaining high soil carbon levels, and reducing the degradation of soil due to rain and wind erosion. Standard methods of measuring the residue cover are time and labor intensive, but remote sensing can support the monitoring of conservation tillage practices applied to large fields. We investigated the potential of per-pixel and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for detecting and estimating the coverage of SSRs after tillage and planting practices for agricultural research fields in Iran using tillage indices for Landsat-8 and novel indices for Sentinel-2A. For validation, SSR was measured in the field through line transects at the beginning of the agricultural season (prior to autumn crop planting). Per-pixel approaches for Landsat-8 satellite images using normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and simple tillage index (STI) yielded coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.727 and 0.722, respectively. We developed comparable novel indices for Sentinel-2A satellite data that yielded R-2 values of 0.760 and 0.759 for NDTI and STI, respectively, which means that the Sentinel data better matched the ground truth data. We tested several OBIA methods and achieved very high overall accuracies of up to 0.948 for Sentinel-2A and 0.891 for Landsat-8 with a membership function method. The OBIA methods clearly outperformed per-pixel approaches in estimating SSR and bear the potential to substitute or complement ground-based techniques.

TI  - Assessing the Use of Sentinel-2 Time Series Data for Monitoring Cork Oak Decline in Portugal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Portugal, cork oak (Quercus suber L.) stands cover 737 Mha, being the most predominant species of the montado agroforestry system, contributing to the economic, social and environmental development of the country. Cork oak decline is a known problem since the late years of the 19th century that has recently worsened. The causes of oak decline seem to be a result of slow and cumulative processes, although the role of each environmental factor is not yet established. The availability of Sentinel-2 high spatial and temporal resolution dense time series enables monitoring of gradual processes. These processes can be monitored using spectral vegetation indices (VI) as their temporal dynamics are expected to be related with green biomass and photosynthetic efficiency. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is sensitive to structural canopy changes, however it tends to saturate at moderate-to-dense canopies. Modified VI have been proposed to incorporate the reflectance in the red-edge spectral region, which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll content while largely unaffected by structural properties. In this research, in situ data on the location and vitality status of cork oak trees are used to assess the correlation between chlorophyll indices (CI) and NDVI time series trends and cork oak vitality at the tree level. Preliminary results seem to be promising since differences between healthy and unhealthy (diseased/dead) trees were observed.

TI  - Integration of WorldView-2 and airborne laser scanning data to classify defoliation levels in <i>Quercus ilex</i> L. <i>Dehesas</i> affected by root rot mortality: Management implications
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dehesa ecosystem is severely affected by root rot decline caused by the soilborne pathogenic oomycetes of the genus Phytophthora. Defoliation mapping is particularly challenging in low density ecosystems with high spectral variability due to environmental heterogeneity within relatively short distances. In this study, holm oak defoliation was assessed by classifying two different levels (low and high defoliation trees, with a 30% crown-defoliation threshold) using a combination of multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data in an automated Random Forest (RF) modeling approach. Besides the original remote sensing data, a set of vegetation indices (VI) and ALS-derived structural parameters were derived. Seven predictors of defoliation were selected from the ALS metrics, WV-2 bands, and indices datasets: the height percentile of the tree in which occurs the maximum number of returns, mean values in the tree crown of the Chlorophyll index green, Plant Senescence Reflectance Index, Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Double Peak Index, band 3 of the WV-2 image, and bincentil 70 values. The confusion matrix of the external evaluation achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (86.7%) and the highest Kappa index (0.73). Finally, we produced a predicted tree-defoliation map which was used to establish the relationship between Quercus ilex damage levels and soil variables and management practices. High defoliated trees were more abundant in zones of shallow and compacted soil, with lower silt proportion and Ca concentration. Our results offer to forest managers a tool for the rapid and effective assessment of large areas affected by root rot defoliation in their planning of control and restoration measures aimed at reducing the holm oak mortality of holm oaks in management units.

TI  - An assessment of the vegetation cover change impact on rainfall and land surface temperature using remote sensing in a subtropical climate, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the impact of vegetation cover change (VCC) on climatic variables is a gap that the fields of conservation and rehabilitation must address. This study aims to assess VCC and its impacts on rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) in a highly deforested and populated area of Ethiopia. We used (i) Landsat images to analyze VCC using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and threshold method and (ii) Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRPS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to evaluate rainfall and LST in the area using Mann-Kendall trend (MKT) test. Results show that 4.7% (210,177 ha) and 2.6% (116,387 ha) of the area was covered by vegetation in 1985 and in 2017 respectively, which implied that 2.1% (93,790 ha) of vegetation cover loss over the last 32 years. Although the mean annual rainfall increased from 1981 to 2017 and mean dry season LST increased from 2000 to 2017, the MKT test shows no significant trend with p-values of 0.09 and 0.35 rainfall and LST, respectively. Mean annual rainfall decreased with declining vegetation cover and mean LST increased as vegetation cover declined in central, northern and southeastern parts of the study area.The outputs from this study would provide information to maintain the agro-climatic condition, assure sustainability in resource utilization and proper land use planning and decision making for the concerned stack holders.

TI  - High-Order Generalized Orderless Pooling Networks for Synthetic-Aperture Radar Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fixed coding style in bag of visual words (BOVW) model and strong spatial information in convolutional neural network (CNN) feature representation make the feature vector less adaptable for scene classification. With the purpose of extracting the learnable orderless feature for SAR scene classification, the high-order generalized orderless pooling network trained by backpropagation is proposed for learning the high-order vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLADs) and locality constrained affine subspace coding (LASC), compared with the first-order feature coding style, the proposed network could learn high-order coding features by outer product automatically. Subsequently, for making the feature representation more powerful, the matrix normalization (square root) whose gradients are computed via singular value decomposition (SVD) and elementwise normalization are introduced into the proposed network. Finally, experiments on the SAR scene classification data set from TerraSAR-X image show the proposed networks achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Agroecology environment quality quotient (AEQ), an indicator of both, the beehive fitness and the contamination level of the environment by pesticides
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three years pesticide residues monitoring data in pollen, wax, bees and honey from sentinel apiaries in different agroecosystems in Uruguay were used for meta analysis. Support vector machines (SVM) algorithm was used previously to classify environments and is the basis of the present work. An useful indicator was developed to classify the contamination status of both beehives and associated environment. The index is a quotient between hive simple demographic parameters and the sum of toxic units for each pesticide found in it. The Agroecology Environment Quality quotient (AEQ) can be scaled in three different levels. When it is below 1, the hive will hardly develop in such environment. AEQ values between 1 and 2 indicate that the hive could have some restrictions to develop in such environment due to pesticide contamination but probably it will be productive. In the cases where the index is above 2, the hive will develop well in the environment where it is located. AEQ permits simultaneously to obtain different information. These are: the surveillance of good agricultural practices accomplishment in agroecosystems, the selection of the best environment to perform apicultural activities as well as to monitor the productivity and development of the beehives.

TI  - Combination of Aerial, Satellite, and UAV Photogrammetry for Mapping the Diachronic Coastline Evolution: The Case of Lefkada Island
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline evolution is a proxy of coastal erosion, defined as the wasting of land along the shoreline due to a combination of natural and/or human causes. For countries with a sea border, where a significant proportion of the population lives in coastal areas, shoreline retreat has become a very serious global problem. Remote sensing data and photogrammetry have been used in coastal erosion mapping for many decades. In the current study, multi-date analogue aerial photos, digital aerial photos, and declassified satellite imagery provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Pleiades satellite data, and unmanned aerial vehicle images were combined for accurate mapping of the southwestern Lefkada (Ionian Sea, Greece) coastline over the last 73 years. Different photogrammetric techniques were used for the orthorectifation of the remote sensing data, and geographical information systems were used in order to calculate the rates of shoreline change. The results indicated that the southwest shoreline of Lefkada Island is under dynamic equilibrium. This equilibrium is strongly controlled by geological parameters, such as subsidence of the studied shoreline during co-seismic deformation and mass wasting. The maximum accretion rate was calculated at 0.55 m per year, while the respective erosion rate reached -1.53 m per year.

TI  - Analysis of Suspended Sediment Variability in a Large Highly Turbid Estuary Using a 5-Year-Long Remotely Sensed Data Archive at High Resolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variability of surface suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in the Gironde estuary and their relationships with environmental forcing are investigated through high spatial resolution multispectral data collected from July 2013 to August 2018 by the Operational Land Imager (Landsat-8/OLI) and MultiSpectral Instrument (Sentinel-2/MSI). A principal component analysis using the T-mode orientation is applied to the discontinuous multiannual time series composed of 41 remotely sensed images. The three first principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) explain 65.7% of the total variance. The SPM distribution associated with PC1 and PC2 exhibits a privileged along-estuary direction of the oscillation modes, while the spatial patterns of PC3 are clearly dominated by lateral oscillations opposing channels and shoals. The main environmental factors affecting the SPM distribution are identified by the analysis of their temporal patterns. The tidal range and the daily river discharge control the spatial patterns of PC1 and PC2, while the tidal cycles and the wind speed are significantly correlated with PC3. Furthermore, the analysis in the along-estuary and lateral directions shows marked longitudinal and transverse SPM gradients and a strong control of bathymetry on the SPM spatial distribution. For the first time, we highlight that the maxima of surface residual turbidity are located on the shoals regardless of the environmental (tidal and hydrological) conditions. Compared to previous studies, usually based on single-point in-water column measurements, these results provide a novel and complementary description of the spatial variability of SPM. They are useful to validate sediment transport numerical models, but also may improve our understanding of suspended sediment dynamics in estuarine systems governed by an estuarine turbidity maximum.

TI  - SPECT-CT localization of axillary sentinel lymph nodes for radiotherapy of early breast cancer
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the opportunities of single photon emission tomography/computerized tomography (SPECT-CT) for localization of axillary sentinel lymph nodes (ASLNs) and subsequent radiotherapy planning in women with early breast cancer.Material and methods: Individual topography of ASLN was determined in 151 women with clinical T1-2N0M0 breast cancer. SPECT-CT visualization of ASLNs was initiated 120 min after intra-peritumoral injection of 99mTc-radiocolloids. Doses absorbed by virtual ASLNs after the whole breast irradiation with standard and extended tangential fields were calculated on a treatment planning station.Results: SPECT-CT demonstrated a large variability of ASLN localization. They were detected in the central subgroup in 94 (61%) patients, in pectoral - in 77 (51%), and in interpectoral in 4 (3%) patients. Sentinel lymph nodes "lying on the chest" were revealed in 35 (23%) cases. We found that with standard tangential fields coverage of ASLNs was obtained only in 20% of evaluated women. Extended tangential fields can effectively irradiate ASLNs localized in all axillary sub-regions with the exception of ASLNs "lying on the chest".Conclusion: SPECT-CT mapping of ASLNs in women with cT1-2N0M0 breast cancer reveals their variable localization. This information can be important for planning of radiation treatment in women that underwent breast conserving surgery without an axillary surgery. (C) 2019 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.

TI  - Assessment of land use/land cover change and its environmental impacts using remote sensing and GIS techniques, Yarmouk River Basin, north Jordan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use/land cover (LULC) changes in Yarmouk River Basin (YRB) over a period of 22 years (1987-2009) have been analyzed, using remotely sensed data and geographic information system. Methods of LULC changes involved thematic change, image difference, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Patch Analyst 5 for ArcGIS was used for the spatial analysis of landscape patches. The results revealed drastic changes in the LULC, with an overall change of more than 79%. Agricultural expansion has occurred at the expense of rangeland (16%) and forest (14%), whereas urban areas have taken over 2.65% of the agricultural areas, 2.11% of the forest, and 1.3% of the rangeland. The values of image difference were in agreement with the increase of urbanization and deforestation activities, besides the increased cultivation activities. The decrease in NDVI values indicates a degradation of vegetation cover. Class area (CA), mean patch size (MPS), and number of patches (NumP) for rangeland have decreased from 39,386 ha, 5.62 ha, and 7010 in 1987 to 17,729 ha, 4.62 ha, and 3838 in 2009, respectively. Similarly, CA, MPS, and NumP for forest land have decreased from 31,551 ha, 0.74 ha, and 42,548 in 1987 to 9558 ha, 0.65 ha, and 14,745 in 2009, respectively. Similar changes were shown to barelands. These results points to fragmentation of the natural land and habitat loss. On the other hand, CA and MPS of agriculture have increased from 35,306 ha and 0.72 ha in 1987 to 78,991 ha and 8 ha in 2009, respectively, indicating agricultural expansion. In addition, CA and NumP of urban have increased from 5513 ha and 89 in 1987 to 16,393 ha and 1536 ha in 2009. At the landscape level, the MPS has increased from approximate to 1 ha in 1987 to 3.7 ha in 2009, whereas NumP has decreased from 146,463 in 1987 to 38,006 in 2009, which means that the landscape became more clumped and continuous. The Shannon diversity index and Shannon evenness index have decreased, indicating that the landscape became more homogenous and more even over the 22 years of the study. It is believed that the major driver of LULC changes in the study area is urban growth, which usually leads to habitat disturbances.

TI  - River network delineation from Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In many regions of the world, especially in developing countries, river network data are outdated or completely absent, yet such information is critical for supporting important functions such as flood mitigation efforts, land use and transportation planning, and the management of water resources. In this study a new method was developed for delineating river networks using Sentinel-1 imagery. Unsupervised classification was applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to discriminate water bodies from other land cover types then the outputs were combined to generate a single persistent water bodies product. A thinning algorithm was then used to delineate river centre lines which were converted into vector features and built into a topologically structured geometric network. The complex river system of the Niger Delta was used to compare the performance of the Sentinel-based method against alternative freely available waterbody products from USGS, ESA and OpenStreetMap and a river network derived from a SRTM DEM. From both raster-based and vector-based accuracy assessments it was found that the Sentinel-based river network products were superior to the comparator data sets by a substantial margin. The resulting geometric river network was used to perform flow routing analysis which is important for a variety of environmental management and planning applications. The approach developed in this study holds considerable potential for generating up to date, detailed river network data for the many countries globally where such data are deficient.

TI  - Improvement of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry to Detect Large Non-Linear Displacements with the 2π Ambiguity by a Non-Parametric Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is commonly applied to monitor surface displacements with millimetric precision. However, this technique still has trouble estimating non-linear displacements because the algorithm is designed for the slow and linear displacements. Additionally, there is a variety of non-linear displacement types, and finding an appropriate displacement model for PSI is still assumed to be a fairly large task. In this paper, the conventional PSI technique is extended using a non-parametric non-linear approach (NN-PSI), and the performance of the extended method is investigated by simulations and actual observation data processing with TerraSAR-X. In the simulation, non-linear displacements are modeled by the magnitudes and periods of the displacement, and the evaluation of NN-PSI is conducted. According to the simulation results, the maximum magnitude of the displacement that can be estimated by NN-PSI is two and a half times the magnitude of the SAR sensor's wavelength (2.5 lambda that is roughly equivalent to 8 cm for X-band, 14 cm for C-band, and 60 cm for L-band), and the period of the displacement is about three months. However, this displacement cannot be reconstructed by the conventional PSI due to the limitation, known as the 2 pi displacement ambiguity. The result of the observation data processing shows that a large displacement with the 2 pi ambiguity can be estimated by NN-PSI as the simulation results show, but the conventional PSI cannot reconstruct it. In addition, a different approach, Small BAseline Subset (SBAS), is applied to the same data to ensure the accuracy of results, and the correlation between NN-PSI and SBAS is 0.95, while that between the conventional PSI and SBAS is -0.66. It is concluded that NN-PSI enables the reconstruction of non-linear displacements by the non-parametric approach and the expansion of applications to measure surface displacements that could not be measured due to the limitations of the traditional PSI methods.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Uterine clear cell cancer (UCCC) is a rare but aggressive disease. Due to its rarity, large, prospective studies focused on UCCC are exceedingly difficult therefore available data are generally from small, retrospective studies. There is also pertinent information from subsection analysis of larger studies that include UCCC and other histotypes. In 2009, the clinical practice committee of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published a review on UCCC aimed at guiding management. Since that publication, there have been developments which are relevant to UCCC, these include availability of data from landmark trials regarding adjuvant therapy, increasing utilization of sentinel lymph node approach and availability of immunotherapy as a treatment option.This SGO review is updated with all relevant, published information since 2009 considered clinically important for management of UCCC. In addition, it follows the new SGO's style for this type of publication which includes utilization of the question and answer format, (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - New century, neorealism & world
T2  - EIKASIA-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Our century moves on, and a certain perspective of it, or at least of its beginning, is beginning to take shape. In the panorama of reflection, neorealism, a movement that could be taken as the emblematic philosophy of the twenty-first century, has gained ground. The present paper offers an approach to that movement as practiced by one of its well-known representatives, Markus Gabriel; we can use an examination of some theses by this German author to get a glimpse of the ways taken by our deep thinking, in this case in the framework of the longstanding debate Realism vs. Idealism (or, alternately, Metaphysics vs. Constructivism). Such a struggle could be understood as rooted in ontology, but we have become aware of the fundamental coimplication between being and knowing. In this sense, starting from Gabriel's analytics on the existing and the world, consequences will be inferred (the direction might, however, be just the opposite) on the ways, the means, the elements and the conditions of such knowledge, highlighting the possibility, and the opportunity, to make use of worldviews, a matter already raised by such authors as Dilthey, Heidegger, Foucault or Kuhn. All this leads the way to thinking about thinking itself, recalling that the philosophical standpoint, at least in our Western civilization, has summoned the dialogue from different points of view, emphasizing the commitment and practicality of philosophy itself as capable to contributing to the preservation of that treasure of our culture which is its multiplicity and polyhedrism.

TI  - Single-step genome-wide association for longitudinal traits of Canadian Ayrshire, Holstein, and Jersey dairy cattle
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects over time is essential to identify and validate candidate genes (or quantitative trait loci) associated with time-dependent variation of economically important traits and to better understand the underlying mechanisms of lactation biology. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to estimate time-dependent effects of SNP and identifying candidate genes associated with milk (MY), fat (FY), and protein (PY) yields, and somatic cell score (SCS) in the first 3 lactations of Canadian Ayrshire, Holstein, and Jersey breeds, as well as suggest their potential pattern of phenotypic effect over time. Random regres.sion coefficients for the additive direct genetic effect were estimated for each animal using single-step genornic BLUP, based on 2 random regression models: one considering MY, FY, and PY in the first 3 lactations and the other considering SCS in the first 3 lactations. Thereafter, SNP solutions were obtained for random regression coefficients, which were used to estimate the SNP effects over time (from 5 to 305 d in lactation). The top 1% of SNP that showed a high magnitude of SNP effect in at least 1 d in lactation were selected as relevant SNP for further analyses of candidate genes, and clustered according to the trajectory of their SNP effects over time. The majority of SNP selected for MY, FY, and PY increased the magnitude of their effects over time, for all breeds. In contrast, for SCS, most selected SNP decreased the magnitude of their effects over time, especially for the Holstein and Jersey breeds. In general, we identified a different set of candidate genes for each breed, and similar genes were found across different lactations for the same trait in the same breed. For some of the candidate genes, the suggested pattern of phenotypic effect changed among lactations. Among the lactations, candidate genes (and their suggested phenotypic effect over time) identified for the second and third lactations were more similar to each other than for the first lactation. Well-known candidate genes with major effects on milk production traits presented different suggested patterns of phenotypic effect across breeds, traits, and lactations in which they were identified. The candidate genes identified in this study can be used as target genes in studies of gene expression.

T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently the Ministry of Construction is responsible for planning and construction of bridges across the country but remote sensing and satellite data are not widely used in the Ministry's routine process. Although the inspection and monitoring are carried out by the conventional methods, the remote sensing and GIS techniques are available as an alternative way with time and cost saving. From this study, the channel migration in the locations of Ayeyarwady bridges will be analyzed and mapped by identifying temporal changes of channels. Google Earth Engine is used as the primary application in this study and surface water extraction from historical Landsat satellite imagery is done by GEE. River centerline processing and erosion-deposition area identifications are carried out by GIS technique. Study period of each bridge is between 1987 and 2017. Bo Myat Tun Bridge and Ayeyarwady Bridge (Pakokku) are toped in the list with highest migration and erosion-deposition rate according to the study. The goal of this study is to assist the bridge inspections and channel monitoring works by means of remote sensing and GIS techniques which are currently undertaking by Ministry of Construction with conventional techniques.

TI  - The annual surface temperature patterns across the Dead Sea as retrieved from thermal images
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images capture a large scene instantaneously, enabling direct comparisons of surface-atmosphere interactions in a static time domain. The annual course of surface temperature of the Dead Sea is investigated using thermal images obtained from Band 10 onboard Landsat 8. Retrieved sea surface temperature varied from around 20 degrees C in February to 35 degrees C in July. Retrieved sea surface temperature is commensurate with extensive field measurements, with a root mean square error of 1.25 degrees C. Satellite images reveal three distinct thermal patterns. The first one is the presence of temperature variations across the open sea which may reflect differences in local meteorology and/or differential mixing with the deeper layers. The second feature is the different temperature skewness patterns between winter and summer months. A slight negative temperature skewness is observed during the period November through February, and a steep positive one during the rest of the year, with large values occurring during summer. These skewness patterns reflect the variations in the annual course of heating and cooling mechanisms occurring in the open sea and along the shallow shorelines. The third distinct feature is the presence of cold finger plumes during the cold months, extending around 4 km inside the open sea and covering an area in excess of 3 km(2). The influence of freshwater flux on evaporation from large hypersaline water bodies is investigated using a theoretical formulation derived in this paper. Results show that the effect of freshwater flux on evaporation from hypersaline lakes is a complex process determined by activity and temperature departures. Satellite images provide an excellent surrogate to field observations which are money and labor intensive, time consuming, and very limited in their spatial coverage.

TI  - Improvement of leaf nitrogen content inference in Valencia-orange trees applying spectral analysis algorithms in UAV mounted-sensor images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is one of the main required nutrients for the production of citrus plants. Farmers have used the chemical analysis of leaf tissue to determine the amount of nitrogen needed in a crop. However, its possible to directly classify the leaf nitrogen content (LNC) using remote sensing data. But, the accuracy of this methodology is yet low and is unknown how to enhance it. We propose a new approach to estimate the LNC in Valencia orange trees applying spectral analysis algorithms in multispectral images of high spatial resolution. Here we show an accuracy upper than 87% in determining the LNC in Valencia orange tree. Previous research, that also used multispectral images of high spatial resolution, obtained an accuracy lower than 65%. A total of 320 spectral measurements were obtained with a field spectroradiometer and the multispectral images were acquired with a Parrot Sequoia camera mounted in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We calculated the mean values of 10 spectral measurements and created 32 spectral signatures with different nitrogen content. Each spectral signature was assigned for three LNC classes; low ( <= 27 g.kg(-1)), medium ( > 27 and <= 29 g.kg(-1)) and high ( > 29 g.kg(-1)). A band simulation was performed to Parrot Sequoia images for each spectral signature. We adopted 7 spectral analysis algorithms to determine the LNC: Constrained Energy Minimization; Linear Spectral Unmixing; Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering; Minimum Distance; Orthogonal Subspace Projection; Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and; Spectral Information Divergence. All these algorithms were trained using the simulated spectral signatures as input data. We used the 32 spectral signatures as training data and approximately 30,000 pixels as testing data, corresponding to the identified nitrogen content in orange-trees. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated with a confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. The SAM algorithm presented the highest accuracy (overall of 87.6% with a kappa coefficient of 0.75) to determine LNC in orange trees. The proposed methodology may reduce the number of leaf tissue analysis and also optimize the monitoring process of orange orchards.

TI  - Estimation of Climatologies of Average Monthly Air Temperature over Mongolia Using MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) Time Series and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a robust statistical model to estimate climatologies (2002-2017) of monthly average near-surface air temperature (Ta) over Mongolia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) time series products and terrain parameters. Two regression models were analyzed in this study linking automatic weather station data (Ta) with Earth observation (EO) images: Partial least squares (PLS) and random forest (RF). Both models were trained to predict Ta climatologies for each of the twelve months, using up to 17 variables as predictors. The models were applied to the entire land surface of Mongolia, the eighteenth largest but most sparsely populated country in the world. Twelve of the predictor variables were derived from the LST time series products of the Terra MODIS satellite. The LST MOD11A2 (collection 6) products provided thermal information at a spatial resolution of 1 km and with 8-day temporal resolution from 2002 to 2017. Three terrain variables, namely, elevation, slope, and aspect, were extracted using a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), and two variables describing the geographical location of weather stations were extracted from vector data. For training, a total of 8544 meteorological data points from 63 automatic weather stations were used covering the same period as MODIS LST products. The PLS regression resulted in a coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.74 and 0.87 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 1.20 degrees C to 2.19 degrees C between measured and estimated monthly Ta. The non-linear RF regression yielded even more accurate results with R-2 in the range from 0.82 to 0.95 and RMSE from 0.84 degrees C to 1.93 degrees C. Using RF, the two best modeled months were July and August and the two worst months were January and February. The four most predictive variables were day/nighttime LST, elevation, and latitude. Using the developed RF models, spatial maps of the monthly average Ta at a spatial resolution of 1 km were generated for Mongolia (similar to 1566 x 10(6) km(2)). This spatial dataset might be useful for various environmental applications. The method is transparent and relatively easy to implement.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration and its parameters for pine, switchgrass, and intercropping with remotely-sensed images based geospatial modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) with pine can increase bioenergy feedstock production without land opportunity costs but can potentially alter water budgets. Measuring evapotranspiration (ET) and its parameters (stomatal conductance (g(s)), leaf area index (LAI), canopy temperature (T-c), and soil moisture (SM)) across cropping systems is costly and time-consuming. However, interpretation of remotely-sensed data can facilitate the effective assessment of relative ET demands among competing forest landuses. This study develops and tests geospatial models informed by a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), vegetation vigor index (VVI), and other spectral information to estimate ET and its parameters, which are measured on experimental watersheds with young pines and natural understory (YP), switchgrass only (SG), and young pine intercropped with switchgrass (IC). The treatment watersheds were replicated on three sites located across the Southeastern U.S. in Carteret, NC; Calhoun, MS; and Greene, AL. Despite the growth inconsistency for the SG only treatment, remote modeling estimation of ET parameters yielded an acceptable R-2 > 0.70, and the ET model yielded R-2 of 0.50 and a standard error of prediction of 0.94. However, ET and ET parameter model estimation for the IC performed somewhat less satisfactorily, with an R-2 of 0.47, 0.59, 0.56, 0.81, and 0.57 for ET, LAI, g(s), T-c, and SM, respectively, potentially due to inconsistencies in Landsat image pixel size and landuse homogeneity. Moreover, ET parameter models for the YP site performed rather poorly, with R-2 = 0.28, 0.63, and 0.76 for LAI, g(s), and T-c, respectively. Additionally, image analysis automation was created with Python scripting and geospatial models. The findings from this study suggest that inclusion of more spatial variability, sound data mining, ultra-high resolution imagery and advanced image processing approaches to account for potential modeling uncertainties can enhance the predictive capability of models to remotely estimate environmental parameters including ET. Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) based models provided promising results for estimating ET and ET parameters using remotely-sensed digital information when they are prepared with advanced data mining, but it is likely that laypersons may find these models difficult to use. However, forest managers with access to neural network software can use our devised RBFN training models for estimating those forest hydrologic parameters with better accuracy.

TI  - Fault models for the Bodrum-Kos tsunamigenic earthquake (M<sub>w</sub>6.6) of 20 July 2017 in the east Aegean Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate a fault model for the shallow, strong (M(w)6.6) tsunamigenic earthquake of 20 July 2017 with source area in the east Aegean Sea between Bodrum peninsula (Turkey) and Kos Isl. (Greece). Fault plane solutions are consistent with the regional active tectonics indicating normal faulting striking about E-W. A relocated hypocenter of the main shock was obtained and the rupture time-space history for two alternative fault solutions dipping either to the south or to north was approached by inverting P-waves recorded at teleseismic (30*-90) distances. In both fault solutions the seismic moment calculated corresponds to magnitude M-w = 6.6 while the earthquake had total rupture duration of less than 10 s. The maximum co-seismic slip was close to the hypocenter similar to 1.6 m and similar to 2.2 m for the south and north dipping faults, respectively. Close to the surface coseismic slip of similar to 0.3 m was calculated. Our analysis of Sentinel satellite InSAR images showed ground deformation fringes indicating similar to 13 cm vertical displacement change between the North and South coasts of the Karaada islet. This result is in line with our preference of the south dipping fault, supported primarily by GPS displacements, regional tectonics, aftershock activity and tsunami observations, although results of InSAR inversion fit equally well both solutions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of informal settlements: <i>Ger</i> districts in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, has experienced unprecedented urbanization following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Lack in housing supply has led to an expansion of informal settlements, mostly in the form of Gers - portable tents used by nomads in Mongolian Plateau. These settlements now host approximately 45% of Ulaanbaatar's total population, resulting in some serious urban challenges (i.e., limited public services, water-borne diseases, and air pollution). However, there is a limited understanding on how these informal settlements have evolved because they have been constantly growing and changing over the past few decades. We conducted semi-structured interviews and applied remote sensing imagery to generate a comprehensive picture of informal settlements in Ulaanbaatar over the past three decades. Throughout the semi-structured interviews, we identified informal settlements as evolving objects with infancy, consolidation, and maturity stages. Through QuickBird and Landsat satellite imagery, we developed spatial distributions of informal settlements from 1990 to 2013 and found the total area of informal settlements increased from 32.15 km(2) to 221.15 km(2). We identified distinct spatial patterns of informal settlements (i.e., spillover, linear aggregation, leap-frogging, and infill development). Particularly, we verified that the emergence of informal settlements in the infancy stage occurred in the periphery of the city and along major roads, with informal settlements rapidly evolving over time (i.e., about 40% of infancy-stage in 1990 had segued into the consolidation and maturity stages in 2013). These results are credited to the accessibility of economic opportunities and public services, as well as the availability of vacant land and associated unique Mongolian land tenure law.

TI  - Monitoring Water-Soil Dynamics and Tree Survival Using Soil Sensors under a Big Data Approach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high importance of green urban planning to ensure access to green areas requires modern and multi-source decision-support tools. The integration of remote sensing data and sensor developments can contribute to the improvement of decision-making in urban forestry. This study proposes a novel big data-based methodology that combines real-time information from soil sensors and climate data to monitor the establishment of a new urban forest in semi-arid conditions. Water-soil dynamics and their implication in tree survival were analyzed considering the application of different treatment restoration techniques oriented to facilitate the recovery of tree and shrub vegetation in the degraded area. The synchronized data-capturing scheme made it possible to evaluate hourly, daily, and seasonal changes in soil-water dynamics. The spatial variation of soil-water dynamics was captured by the sensors and it highly contributed to the explanation of the observed ground measurements on tree survival. The methodology showed how the efficiency of treatments varied depending on species selection and across the experimental design. The use of retainers for improving soil moisture content and adjusting tree-watering needs was, on average, the most successful restoration technique. The results and the applied calibration of the sensor technology highlighted the random behavior of water-soil dynamics despite the small-scale scope of the experiment. The results showed the potential of this methodology to assess watering needs and adjust watering resources to the vegetation status using real-time atmospheric and soil data.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma of the head and neck: a multicentre study to examine safety, efficacy, and prognostic value
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an accurate staging procedure for malignant melanoma but its use in patients with melanoma of the head and neck has been questioned in the past because of a perceived record of poor safety and accuracy. Technical improvements have sought to redress this. Vital structures and variable lymphatic pathways can make its use in the head and neck challenging. In our study we have examined the data and the experiences of clinicians from University Hospital Southampton and the Royal Surrey County Hospital. We retrospectively analysed the data and case notes of 143 patients who had SLNB to establish its safety, efficacy, and prognostic value. The detection rate of at least one sentinel lymph node was 100%. Nodes positive for metastatic melanoma were found in 20% of patients. Of them, 76% went on to have completion lymphadenectomy. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that positive SLNB was a strong predictor of reduced overall survival for all Breslow-thickness melanomas (HR = 3.9, p = 0.019) and intermediate melanomas (HR = 6.3, p = 0.007). It predicted reduced recurrence-free survival for all melanomas (HR = 7.4, p < 0.001) and was a strong predictor for those of intermediate thickness (HR = 8.3, p <0.001). The false negative rate was 9.4% and false omission rate 2.6%. Temporary and permanent morbidity rates were 2.1% and 0%, respectively. SLNB for melanoma in the head and neck is a safe, accurate staging procedure that offers prognostically useful information. The upstaging of disease allows access to trial-based targeted treatments.

TI  - Short-Term Shoreline Trend Detection Patterns Using SPOT-5 Image Fusion in the Northwest of Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change is an important morphological feature used to identify impacts on coastal processes caused by coastal infrastructure or natural conditions (e.g., storms or sea level rise), providing insightful information for coastal and shoreline management. While shoreline measurements are not always available, remote sensing data can provide shoreline position in scarce data areas, as well as in large and inaccessible regions. Nevertheless, few studies have used multi-temporal remote sensing data to study gradual changes for time frames of less than 10 years due to the low spatial resolution for detecting small changes. In this study, we explore the use of image data fusion from the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre - 5 (SPOT-5), taking into account the accuracy of shoreline mapping to detect changes in both disturbed and undisturbed coasts during 10 years in the northwestern Yucatan coast. Our results show that using image data fusion in SPOT-5 images is a feasible method to detect shoreline change trends in a relatively short time frame. Based on the proposed method, we were able to identify the factors leading to shoreline trends. This methodology proves useful for shoreline management and is appropriate for the planning of future developments in areas for which data are scarce.

TI  - UKRAINIAN-POLISH CONFLICT AND THE ISSUES OF LVIV'S POST-WAR AFFILIATION IN THE LIGHT OF THE OUN(b) UNDERGROUND REPORTS (September 1943 - April 1945)
T2  - UKRAINSKYI ISTORYCHNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research. The article is devoted to highlighting the specifics of the Ukrainian-Polish conflict in Lviv and the problem of the post-war Ukrainian-Polish border through the prism of OUN(b) underground documentation. The research methodology is based on the principles of historicism, systemicity, multifactority, concreteness, scientific and comprehensiveness. The following general-historical methods have been used: historical-comparative, retrospective, problem, textual and microhistorical analysis. The scientific novelty. Having introduced into the scientific circulation a number of new archival materials stored in the Sectoral State Archives of the Security Service of Ukraine, it was possible to fully demonstrate how the participants of the Ukrainian nationalist underground saw the Ukrainian-Polish confrontation in Lviv in 1943-1944, as their changes changed, how they reflected the reaction of the Ukrainian community of Lviv to the interethnic conflict. Conclusions. The analyzed reports of the OUN underground provide an extremely rich and interesting material for studying the history of the Ukrainian-Polish interethnic conflict during the World War II. Lviv was similar to a "laboratory" in which a "historical experiment" was staged - modeling the Ukrainian-Polish conflict on a smaller scale and with a lower degree of bloodshed. It is quite obvious that such a large city as Lviv was sufficiently well controlled by both the German and Soviet sides, which did not allow the confrontation between Ukrainians and Poles to grow to the extent it had "in the province". However, the case of Lviv, described in the reports of the Ukrainian nationalist underground, allows us to understand many mechanisms that worked equally in different conflict zones: balancing and unequal support by the Germans on one side or the other; gossip; provocations; application of collective responsibility; belief in the "payback" of one's own actions, etc. Also, reports from the Bandera underground from Lviv provide valuable information about the mood of the population, its reaction to the movement of the front, to the actions and orders of the authorities, to international visits and agreements. They reveal the gigantic role played by informational "fakes" that are capable of immersing large communities of people in a state of mass psychosis, depriving them of their freedom to resist, or even escape. Of course, we should keep in mind the specifics of our sources, created by people with a well-defined worldview, which addressed certain specific problems while ignoring or silencing others. However, on the other hand, the analyzed materials, which were unambiguously prepared for propaganda purposes, appear to be quite frank, which enhances their scientific value.

TI  - Monitoring Glyphosate-Based Herbicide Treatment Using Sentinel-2 Time Series-A Proof-of-Principle
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we aim to show a proof-of-principle approach to detect and monitor weed management using glyphosate-based herbicides in agricultural practices. In a case study in Germany, we demonstrate the application of Sentinel-2 multispectral time-series data. Spectral broadband vegetation indices were analysed to observe vegetation traits and weed damage arising from herbicide-based management. The approach has been validated with stakeholder information about herbicide treatment using commercial products. As a result, broadband NDVI calculated from Sentinel-2 data showed explicit feedback after the glyphosate-based herbicide treatment. Vegetation damage could be detected after just two days following of glyphosate-based herbicide treatment. This trend was observed in three different application scenarios, i.e., during growing stage, before harvest and after harvest. The findings of the study demonstrate the feasibility of satellite based broadband NDVI data for the detection of glyphosate-based herbicide treatment and, e.g., the monitoring of latency to harvesting. The presented results can be used to implement monitoring concepts to provide the necessary transparency about weed treatment in agricultural practices and to support environmental monitoring.

TI  - The artistic worldview in the context of sociocultural realia
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article looks at specific features of the development and transformation of the artistic worldview in the context of changes taking place in art and sociocultural environment. The article focuses on the following issues: the interconnection between the core and periphery as the stable and variable spheres of art, the principles of relations between the subjective and objective, the general and individual, the rational and irrational. These contradictions are actively reflected in modern art and changing its expressive means. Therefore, in the general structure of the artistic worldview, the authors highlight the potential level (the flexible sphere of art) and conceptual level as the level where the integrity of the whole system is centered.

TI  - Analysis of Damage to Buildings in Urban Centers on Unstable Slopes via TerraSAR-X PSI Data: The Case Study of El Papiol Town (Spain)
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data, deriving from the processing of SAR images acquired by high-resolution sensors such as TerraSAR-X, provide accurate measurements of displacements affecting structures (e.g., buildings) and linear infrastructure networks (e.g., roads, bridges, embankments, and pipelines). Such widespread displacements, when available on buildings on unstable slopes, offer new perspectives for their integration in procedures pursuing the analysis and the prediction of the physical vulnerability of exposed buildings. In this letter, both deterministic and probabilistic cause (differential settlements)-effects (damage) relationships are generated by using PSI-derived building settlements and the results of building damage surveys. The procedure is applied to El Papiol town (Spain), whose urban area has been suffering diffuse damage of different severity to buildings and roads due to extremely slow-moving landslide phenomena.

TI  - Land use optimization tool for sustainable intensification of high-latitude agricultural systems
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies assessing agricultural policies, including the EU's Agri-Environment Scheme, have shown that these have been successful in attaining some environmental goals. In Finland, however, the economic situation of farms has dramatically fallen and hence, the actions do not result in social acceptability. Sustainable intensification is a means to combine the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. Here we introduce a novel land use optimization and planning tool for the sustainable intensification of high-latitude agricultural systems. The main rationale for the development of the tool was to achieve a systematic and comprehensive conception for land allocation across Finland, where field parcels vary substantially in their conditions. The developed tool has a three-step scoring system based on seven physical characteristics (parcel size, shape, slope, distance to the farm center and waterways, soil type and logistic advantages) and the productivity of field parcels. The productivity estimates are based on vegetation indices derived from optical satellite data. The tool allocates virtually all > 1 million field parcels in Finland either to sustainable intensification, extensification or afforestation. The tool is dynamic in the sense that its boundary values for land allocation can be fixed according to changes in social targets and supporting policies. Additionally, it can be applied year after year by acknowledging new available data, e.g., on vegetation indices and field parcel re-arrangements between farms. Furthermore, it can be applied to all farm types and across Finland. It is a tool for land use planning, implementation and monitoring, but its thorough implementation calls for further development of policy instruments, which are currently more supportive towards land sharing than land sparing activities.

TI  - Patch Similarity Convolutional Neural Network for Urban Flood Extent Mapping Using Bi-Temporal Satellite Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding is a major natural disaster that poses a serious threat to the urban environment. It is highly demanded that the flood extent can be mapped in near real-time for disaster rescue and relief missions, reconstruction efforts, and financial loss evaluation. Many efforts have been taken to identify the flooding zones with remote sensing data and image processing techniques. Unfortunately, the near real-time production of accurate flood maps over impacted urban areas has not been well investigated due to three major issues. (1) Satellite imagery with high spatial resolution over urban areas usually has nonhomogeneous background due to different types of objects such as buildings, moving vehicles, and road networks. As such, classical machine learning approaches hardly can model the spatial relationship between sample pixels in the flooding area. (2) Handcrafted features associated with the data are usually required as input for conventional flood mapping models, which may not be able to fully utilize the underlying patterns of a large number of available data. (3) High-resolution optical imagery often has varied pixel digital numbers (DNs) for the same ground objects as a result of highly inconsistent illumination conditions during a flood. Accordingly, traditional methods of flood mapping have major limitations in generalization based on testing data. To address the aforementioned issues in urban flood mapping, we developed a patch similarity convolutional neural network (PSNet) using satellite multispectral surface reflectance imagery before and after flooding with a spatial resolution of 3 meters. We used spectral reflectance instead of raw pixel DNs so that the influence of inconsistent illumination caused by varied weather conditions at the time of data collection can be greatly reduced. Such consistent spectral reflectance data also enhance the generalization capability of the proposed model. Experiments on the high resolution imagery before and after the urban flooding events (i.e., the 2017 Hurricane Harvey and the 2018 Hurricane Florence) showed that the developed PSNet can produce urban flood maps with consistently high precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy compared with baseline classification models including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost, which were often poor in either precision or recall. The study paves the way to fuse bi-temporal remote sensing images for near real-time precision damage mapping associated with other types of natural hazards (e.g., wildfires and earthquakes).

TI  - Gross Primary Production Estimation in Crops Using Solely Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is a measure for crop productivity, indicating yield and expressing C exchange of agro-ecosystems. A multitude of satellite sensors at varying spatial and spectral resolution brings a possibility to use remotely sensed data for regional and global GPP estimation. More work is still needed to develop algorithms for GPP estimation applicable to multiple, if not all, vegetation types, phenological phases, and environmental conditions. This study employed neural networks (NN), multiple linear regressions (MLR), and vegetation indices (VI) to develop algorithms for GPP estimation based solely on remotely sensed data in two crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], with contrasting canopy architectures, leaf structures, and photosynthetic pathways. The focus of the study was to devise algorithms not requiring re-parameterization for different crop species. Data used in the models included in situ hyperspectral reflectance and satellite surface reflectance products. For the tested NN, MLR, and VI algorithms, the bands selected to obtain minimal errors in maize and soybean combined were mainly located in red edge and near infrared (NIR) spectral regions. For both in situ reflectance and satellite surface reflectance, a NN estimated GPP with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) below 14 and 18.7%, respectively, and VI using bands in red edge and NIR with NRMSE 15.6 and 20.4%, respectively. The results showed that the models based on the red edge and NIR bands may facilitate accurate assessments of crop GPP at multiple scales, from close range to satellite platforms.

TI  - Combining MAP-1:CD35 or MAP-1:CD55 fusion proteins with pattern-recognition molecules as novel targeted modulators of the complement cascade
T2  - FASEB JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dysregulation of the complement system is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, and its inhibition has been shown to be a feasible therapeutic option. Therefore, there is an interest in the development of complement modulators to treat complement activation-related inflammatory pathologies. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL)/ficolin/collectin-associated protein-1 (MAP-1) is a regulatory molecule of the lectin pathway (LP), whereas complement receptor 1 (CD35) and decay-accelerating factor (CD55) are membrane-anchored regulators with effects on the central effector molecule C3. In this study, we developed 2 novel soluble chimeric inhibitors by fusing MAP-1 to the 3 first domains of CD35 (CD35(1-3)) or the 4 domains of CD55 (CD55(1-4)) to modulate the complement cascade at 2 different stages. The constructs showed biologic properties similar to those of the parent molecules. In functional complement activation assays, the constructs were very efficient in inhibiting LP activation at the level of C3 and in the formation of terminal complement complex. This activity was enhanced when coincubated with recombinant LP recognition molecules MBL and ficolin-3. Recombinant MAP-1 fusion proteins, combined with recombinant LP recognition molecules to target sites of inflammation, represent a novel and effective therapeutic approach involving the initiation and the central and terminal effector functions of the complement cascade.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a remote sensing-based method of mapping and predicting fish spatial distribution in inland waters is developed. A combination of Earth Observation data, in-situ measurements, and hydroacoustics is used to relate fish biomass distribution and water-quality parameters along the longitudinal transect of the Rimov Reservoir (Czech Republic) using statistical and machine learning techniques. Parameter variations and biomass distribution are estimated and validated, and apparent trends are explored and discussed, together with potential limitations and weaknesses. Water-quality parameters exhibit longitudinal gradients along the reservoir, while calculations reveal a distinct fish assemblage pattern observed as a patchy overall biomass distribution. Although the proposed methodology has a great potential for sustainable water management, careful planning is needed to ensure the simultaneous acquisition of remote sensing and in-situ data to maximize calibration accuracy.

TI  - Ductal Carcinoma In Situ with Microinvasion on Core Biopsy: Evaluating Tumor Upstaging Rate, Lymph Node Metastasis Rate, and Associated Predictive Variables
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) when ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM) is identified on core biopsy is unclear.Objective. Our aim was to assess the upstage rate to invasive cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis in patients diagnosed with DCISM, and whether predictive variables could be identified that may help inform who would most likely benefit from a surgical axillary evaluation.Methods. We performed a retrospective review of 70 patients diagnosed with DCISM on core biopsy. Patients with concomitant or prior invasive cancer were excluded. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, histologic, and treatment data were collected. Fisher's exact test and univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify variables that may be associated with tumor upstaging and nodal metastasis. Time-to-event distributions were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results. On final surgical pathology, 49 patients (70%) had a final diagnosis of DCISM or T1mi cancer, whereas 21 patients (30%) were upstaged to measurable invasive cancer (> 1 mm). One of 49 patients (2%) with DCISM on final pathology and 4 of 21 patients (19%) with measurable invasive cancer showed sentinel lymph node metastases.Conclusion. Although the upstage rate to measurable invasive cancer in our cohort of patients with DCISM on core biopsy was 30%, findings of a positive SLNB remain low at 7%. No predictive variables were identified to inform whether the routine practice of SLNB may be omitted in some patients with DCISM.

TI  - Murine Leukemia Virus Exploits Innate Sensing by Toll-Like Receptor 7 in B-1 Cells To Establish Infection and Locally Spread in Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph-borne Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV) exploits the sentinel macrophages in the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN) to infect highly permissive innate-like B-1 cells and establish infection in mice. The reason for FrMLV sensitivity of B-1 cells and their impact on viral spread is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) sensing and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in B-1 cells contribute to FrMLV susceptibility. FrMLV infection in B-1 cell-deficient mice (bumble; I kappa BNIS dysfunctional) was significantly lower than that in the wild-type mice and was rescued by adoptive transfer of wild-type B-1 cells. This rescue of FrMLV infection in bumble mice was dependent on intact TLR7 sensing and IFN-I signaling within B-1 cells. Analyses of infected cell types revealed that the reduced infection in bumble mice was due predominantly to compromised virus spread to the B-2 cell population. Our data reveal how FrMLV exploits innate immune sensing and activation in the B-1 cell population for infection and subsequent spread to other lymphocytes.IMPORTANCE Viruses establish infection in hosts by targeting highly permissive cell types. The retrovirus Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV) infects a subtype of B cells called B-1 cells that permit robust virus replication. The reason for their susceptibility had remained unknown. We found that innate sensing of incoming virus and the ensuing type I interferon response within B-1 cells are responsible for their observed susceptibility. Our data provide insights into how retroviruses coevolved with the host to co-opt innate immune sensing pathways designed to fight virus infections for establishing infection. Understanding early events in viral spread can inform antiviral intervention strategies that prevent the colonization of a host.

TI  - Fluorescence-guided detection of lymph node metastases of gastrointestinal tumors
T2  - CHIRURG
M3  - Article
AB  - A correct lymph node (LN) staging is essential in oncological surgery. Indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) navigation is a relatively novel technique. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of ICG-NIRF on identification of LN metastases of gastrointestinal tumors. The Scopus and PubMed/MEDLINE literature databases were searched and 20 studies were included. The ICG-NIRF navigation of LN has been shown to enable and improve LN detection in gastrointestinal tumors; however, the mean detection, sensitivity, accuracy and false negative rates show substantial variation. This could be due to both the heterogeneous techniques applied and to the low retention of ICG by lymph nodes. Fluorescence imaging to identify LN drainage is a promising tool to improve oncological outcomes. Nonetheless, the technique requires further development in terms of hardware, software and fluorophores, which are currently being investigated.

TI  - Event-Based Integrated Assessment of Environmental Variables and Wildfire Severity through Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To optimize suppression, restoration, and prevention plans against wildfire, postfire assessment is a key input. Since little research has been carried out on applying Sentinel-2 imagery through an integrated approach to evaluate how environmental parameters affect fire severity, this work aims to fill this gap. A set of large forest fires that occurred in northwest Spain during extreme weather conditions were adopted as a case study. Sentinel-2 information was used to build the fire severity map and to evaluate the relation between it and a set of its driving factors: land cover, aspect, slope, proximity to the nearest stream, and fire recurrence. The cover types most affected by fire were scrubland, rocky areas, and Eucalyptus. The presence of streams was identified as a major cause of the reduced severity of fires in broadleaves. The occurrence of fires in the past is linked to the severity of fires, depending on the land cover. This research aims to help fire researchers, authority managers, and policy makers distinguish the conditions under which the damage by fire is minimized and optimize the resources allocated to restoration and future fire suppression.

TI  - Religious and moral discourse of F.M. Dostoevsky and the tale of our time by M.M. Prishvin
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at analyzing the historical and cultural contexts of the Russian and Soviet writer Mikhail Mikhailovich Prishvin's (1873-1954) views on the possibility of realizing the ideal of charity as a theological virtue in Soviet society even in the conditions of militant atheism and the cruelties of the ongoing Great Patriotic War. The study is relevant for modern-day Russia due to the historical circumstances, that from 1917 to the early 1990s, almost the entire cu ltural life of the country came under the pressure of communist ideology. Historical and philosophical reconstruction serves as the main study approaches to this problem. Comparing Dostoevsky's and Prishvin's ideological and aesthetic assessments of the revolutionary movement, we establish the metatext, whose analysis allows us to better understand how Prishvin comprehended the basic laws and trends of the development of social existence and consciousness in his time. The paper shows that the main reason for Prishvin's attraction to Dostoevsky is the closeness of their views on life and recognition of the supremacy of the moral laws in the structure of human existence. The novelty of this study lies in the analysis of the philosophical and ideological context of Prishvin's thoughts on ways to overcome the spiritual discord in Russian society as the Orthodox Christian worldview held by a significant segment of the population came into conflict with the ideology of Bolshevism. Through his fictional heroes, the writer shows that in the year of the fascist invasion, life itself demonstrated the triumph of the Orthodox faith, to which the Russian people remained faithful despite the pressure of the menacing atheistic state. The story seems to sum up Prishvin's life journey as the writer's religious views became increasingly important to his worldview.

TI  - Localization of impalpable breast lesions and detection of sentinel lymph nodes through magnetic methods
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The most commonly used technique for guiding the surgical removal of impalpable breast lesions is wire-guided localization (WGL). Potential complications of WGL include wire migration, wire transection, patient discomfort, and pneumothorax. Recently, another possibility for preoperative localization of breast lesions trough small steel seeds was developed. A magnetic handheld probe can be used both for localization of breast lesions and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) detection.Methods: In this study, we used a new technology for localizing breast lesions in conjunction with sentinel nodes (SLNs) detection through SPIO nanoparticles; both detected using a magnetic probe. The technique uses small steel markers (Magseed (R)) with magnetic properties, which are placed in breasts under ultrasonographic or mammographic guidance. 41 localization seeds were placed in 38 patients. In 27 patients with malignant tumors, simultaneous use of magnetic method for SLNs detection was used.Results: In all 38 patients, breast lesions were accurately localized using this method. No interference between Magseed signals and SPIO tracer signals were observed during magnetic probe measurements. All tumors were exscised with tumor-free surgical margins. The SLN biopsy was successful in all patients undergoing this procedure. The SLN median detection rate was 3 nodes.Conclusions: The new magnetic methods are reliable alternatives for localizing breast lesions and SLN detection. They are well tolerated by patients and they can avoid the disadvantages of WGL. They have the potential to make tumor localization and SLN biopsy procedures possible in facilities without a nuclear medicine department or where radioisotope availability is limited.

TI  - Land suitability assessments for yield prediction of cassava using geospatial fuzzy expert systems and remote sensing
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cassava has the potential to be a promising crop that can adapt to changing climatic conditions in Indonesia due to its low water requirement and drought tolerance. However, inappropriate land selection decisions limit cassava yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. As a root crop, yield prediction using vegetation indices and biophysical properties is essential to maximize the yield of cassava before harvesting. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a yield prediction model based on suitable areas that assess with land suitability analysis (ISA). For LSA, the priority indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system combined with a multicriteria decision method including ecological categories. Furthermore, the yield prediction method was developed using satellite remote sensing datasets. In this analysis, Sentinel-2 datasets were collected and analyzed in SNAP (R) and ArcGIS (R) environments. The multisource database of ecological criteria for cassava production was built using the fuzzy membership function. The results showed that 42.17% of the land area was highly suitable for cassava production. Then, in the highly suitable area, the yield prediction model was developed using the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 datasets with 10 m resolution for the accuracy assessment. The vegetation indices were used to predict cassava growth, biophysical condition, and phenology over the growing seasons. The NDVI, SAW, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR were used to develop the model for predicting cassava growth. The generated models were validated using regression analysis between observed and predicted yield. As the vegetation indices, NDVI showed higher accuracy in the yield prediction model (R-2 = 0.62) compared to SAVI and IRECI. Meanwhile, LAI had a higher prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.70) than other biophysical properties, fAPAR. The combined model using NDVI, SAW, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR reported the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.77). The ground truth data were used for the evaluation of satellite remote sensing data in the comparison between the observed and predicted yields. This developed integrated model could be implemented for the management of land allocation and yield assessment in cassava production to ensure regional food security in Indonesia.

TI  - A convolutional neural network regression for quantifying cyanobacteria using hyperspectral imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is useful for detecting and quantifying cyanobacteria blooms for managing water systems. In particular, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing has an advantage in precise cyanobacteria detection with high spatial and spectral resolution. Many bio-optical algorithms have been developed and utilized to estimate algal concentration. However, achieving the optimal conventional optical model accuracy is still challenging in freshwater owing to the biophysical complexity of the inland water and the seasonal reflection of site-specific optical properties. Thus, this study applied convolutional neural network (CNN) with various input windows to estimate the concentrations of phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and generated a phytoplankton pigment map. We proposed that the Point-centered regression CNN (PRCNN) showed accurate PC and Chl-a simulations, with R-2 > 0.86 and 0.73, respectively, and root mean square errors of <10 mg.m(-3), which were smaller than the conventional optical algorithm in our study area. In addition, the generated PC and Chl-a map from PRCNN closely followed the spatial distribution of the pigment and showed reasonable concentration levels. Through testing we found that a small input size and deep spectral bands contributed to the CNN model to achieve strong capacity to reflect the dynamic spatial feature of phytoplankton pigments. Therefore, this study demonstrated that CNN regression has the potential to detect and quantify cyanobacteria with high accuracy and can be an alternative to bio-optical algorithms.

TI  - Target recognition in synthetic aperture radar image based on PCANet
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic targets recognition (ATR) for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is very important. ATR can be used in traffic management, national frontier safety, and so on. Traditional algorithms for SAR ATR is composed of extraction features and training classifier. The features are essential for the classification accuracy. However, choosing good features by hand is a hard task. The deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which can learn features automatically have got a great performance in natural images. However, the CNNs have many parameters and need a lot of data to train such networks. The remote-sensing data of SAR is limited. Then, the authors need a simple network which needs not much data and easy to train. The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a shallow network that performs well in the recognition task and needs no hand features choosing. Though this network has produced a wide application in the natural images, it is rarely used in the SAR images. The experimental result of the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) dataset shows that the PCANet can achieve over 99% accuracy on ten-class targets. This result is better than traditional algorithms and is very close to the results of deep-learning methods.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban and regional research is crucial for many applications such as public participation, land use, disaster management, and environmental monitoring, but it is a time-consuming and expensive procedure to collect necessary data. Remote sensing is an effective technology for urban observation, however, the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of observation sensors limits many situations in which remote sensing data cannot be fully utilized, especially in the field of urban observation. Recently, with the popularity of internet and smart mobile devices, social media containing spatial information is evolving rapidly, such as tweets, Flickr photos, and geolocated posts. These location-based social media data are leading new research areas, new technologies and methods, and new insights into urban observation. In this paper, we provide an overview on the integration and joint analysis of remote sensing and social media data in urban observation applications. We describe four opportunities in exploiting social media data: to investigate the relationship among humans, environment and urban, to help urban planning, to manage urban disaster, and to monitor urban environment. Although significant possibilities for a combination of remote sensing and social media data can be seen, our survey suggests that the fusion of these data sources will continue to profoundly change these technologies.

TI  - Impacts of Age and Expansion Direction of Invasive <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> on Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics in Coastal Salt Marshes Along Eastern China
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora has been reported to modify carbon (C) cycling processes and pools of the native salt marsh ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the invasion age and expansion direction of S. alterniflora impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. In this study, by considering the continuous invasion of S. alterniflora into mudflat (seaward) and native species Suaeda salsa (landward) salt marshes over a period of 20 years chronosequence, we quantify their impacts on SOC dynamics along the coastal salt marshes of Yancheng National Nature Reserve of China, based on the extensive field sampling and remote sensing data. The results showed that (1) S. alterniflora invasion increased SOC concentration and density, which averaged 8.39 g C kg(-1) and 0.0085 g C cm(-3) seaward and 6.26 g C kg(-1) and 0.0065 g C cm(-3) landward, respectively; (2) soil organic carbon showed a significantly positive relationship with total nitrogen (TN), salinity, and water content and a negative relationship with pH and bulk density for S. alterniflora landward expansion. For seaward expansion, it showed a similar relationship, but there are higher correlations with soil properties except an insignificant relationship with pH; and (3) soil organic carbon and carbon accumulation rate are significantly higher in seaward than in landward. However, for landward expansion, soil organic carbon concentration keeps increasing linearly with invasion time, while for seaward expansion, it increased to a maximum in 11 years of invasion and then decreased. Our results showed that it is very important to assess the effects of invasion on SOC dynamics in salt marsh ecosystems by considering both the expansion direction and invasion age.

TI  - Scattering-Mechanism-Based Investigation of Optimal Combinations of Polarimetric SAR Frequency Bands for Land Cover Classification
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at steering the selection of optimal combinations of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) frequency bands for different land cover classification schemes, this study investigates the land cover classification capabilities of all the possible combinations of L-band ALOS PALSAR fully PolSAR data, C-band RADARSAT-2 fully PolSAR data, and X-band TerraSAR-X HH SAR data. A method that integrates polarimetric decomposition, object-based image analysis, decision tree algorithms, and support vector machines is used for the classification. Polarimetric decomposition theorems are used to interpret the scattering mechanisms at the different frequency bands to reveal the effect mechanisms of PolSAR frequency variation on the classification capability. This study finds that (1) X-band HH SAR is not necessary for classifying the land cover types involved in this study when C- or L-band fully PolSAR are used; (2) C-band fully PolSAR alone is adequate for classifying primitive land cover types, namely, water, bare land, vegetation, and built-up areas; and (3) L-band fully PolSAR alone is adequate for distinguishing between various vegetation types, such as crops, banana trees, and forests.

TI  - Estimation of lake water storage and changes based on bathymetric data and altimetry data and the association with climate change in the central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water storage is an important factor in analyses of lake water balance. However, it is difficult to calculate the water storage of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau due to the lack of bathymetric data. Lake water storage and changes in Chibuzhang Co (CC) and Duoersuodong Co (DC), which are located in an endorheic system and have been connected since 2006, were estimated based on in situ bathymetric data, satellite altimetry data and Landsat images of the central Tibetan Plateau. In 2016, the maximum depth and water storage of DC were 68.7 m and 12.2 +/- 1.72 km(3), respectively, with an area of 490.2 km(2), and those of CC were 116.3 m and 16.2 +/- 2.27 km(3), respectively, with an area of 575.4 km(2). The total lake water storage in DC and CC increased by 24.5% (2.4 km(3)) and 14.1% (2 km(3)) from 2003 to 2014, respectively, based on satellite altimetry data and Landsat images using an empirical equation. The relationship between lake changes and meteorological factors indicated that both increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important drivers of each lake's expansion and that a small increase in evaporation (2.5 mm/y) had little negative impact on lake expansion (0.41 m/y). Heterogeneous changes in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 were mainly due to water from CC supplying DC through a channel, and the lake level of DC was always lower than that of CC until 2006, indicating that the geological conditions around both lakes were also an important factor in the lake changes. The assumption was that all glacial meltwater from the Puruogangri and Geladandong glaciers was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation, and glacial meltwater made an approximately 19.3 +/- 4.5% contribution to the lake expansions (0.4 km(3)/y) of DC and CC from 2003 to 2014 based on the results of the glacier mass balance.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Coastal Urbanization Dynamics: Case Study of Algiers' Bay, Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last three decades, the Mediterranean coasts have been under strong anthropogenic pressure inducing ecological and biological degradations such as pollution, destruction of marine ecosystems, and loss of coastal dunes. In Algeria, the same findings have been observed in the bay of Algiers due to the massive urbanization as well as the absence of the quantitative analysis tools of this phenomenon. In this context, the assigned objective of this study is the monitoring of the urban growth in Algiers' bay between 1985 and 2015 and the prediction of the urban growth by 2030 using remote sensing data, cellular automata modeling, and the landscape metrics analysis. Concerning the prediction step, two scenarios are considered: the "tendencial" which presents the unmanaged urban growth of Algiers City and the active implementation of the Algiers Plan by 2029. To achieve this goal, a retrospective map representing land cover has been produced at different times; this later has allowed us to quantify the urban regions and to implement the urbanization growth model. On the other hand, this study has highlighted the contribution of the spatial metrics on multi-scale level (patch/core, class level and the landscape level) to monitor coastal urbanization in a geometric/fractal view through its multi-temporal evolution, as well as in the two predictive landscapes. This allowed through the spatial metrics indicator and predictive modeling to observe a tendency to massive urbanization of the bay at the expense of remaining natural areas, but also to provide and exhibit some geographical aspects such as the layout of urban cores and the linearity of urbanization parallel to the coast, in order to propose some significant measures for policy-makers to avoid the alarmist environmental degradation of the bay.

TI  - Assessment of absorbing aerosols on austral spring snow albedo reduction by several basins in the Central Andes of Chile from daily satellite observations (2000-2016) and a case study with the WRF-Chem model
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in snow albedo (SA) on the Limari, Choapa, Aconcagua and Maipo basins of the Central Andes of Chile (CAC) are associated with the possible deposition of light-absorbing particles in the austral spring. We correlate SA with daily data of snow cover, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) available from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the NASA Terra satellite between 2000 and 2016, and other derived parameters such as days after albedo (DAS) and snow precipitation (SP). We used satellite pixels with 100% snow cover to obtain monthly average value of SA, LST, AOD, DAS and SP from September to November performing multiple regression analysis. We show that in Maipo, after considering LST, AOD represents an important role in changes induced to SA. The multiple regression model illustrates that AOD increases can reduce the SA during spring months by 13.59, 0.01, 0.77 and 3.8% in Limari, Choapa, Aconcagua and Maipo, respectively. In addition, we used a numerical prediction Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), showing that the black carbon distribution and average daily AOD are associated with the SA decrease of 0.15 in the Maipo basin between September 29 and 30, 2016. The WRF-Chem output showed aerosols are transported mainly with dominating westerly winds to the Limari and Maipo basins. Our results further suggest that SA decrease due to AOD may be originated in the largest industrial and urban areas in Chile, producing a negative impact on the hydrological resource, generated in the CAC.

TI  - Surgical treatment of vulvar cancer: Impact of tumor-free margin distance on recurrence and survival. A multicentre cohort analysis from the francogyn study group
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In vulvar cancer, it is admitted that tumor-free margin distance is one of the most important element for locoregional control. It is currently recommended to surgically remove the tumor with at least an 8 mm tumor-free margin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of tumor-free margin distance on recurrence and survival in vulvar cancer.Material and methods: From 2005 to 2016, 112 patients surgically treated for a vulvar squamous cell cancer were included in a retrospective multicenter study. Overall, disease-free and metastasis-free survivals were analyzed according to tumor-free margin distance.Results: Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (margin <3 mm, n = 47); group 2 (margin >= 3 mm to < 8 mm, n = 48) and group 3 (margin >= 8 mm, n = 17). During the study, 26,8% patients developed recurrence (n = 30) after a median of 8 months (1-69). Analysis of 5-year overall survival, as well as disease-free and metastasis-free survivals, did not reveal a difference between groups. We performed a subgroup analysis in patients with a tumor-free margin <8 mm (group 1 and 2). It showed that histological lesions observed closest to the edge of the specimen were more often invasive or in situ carcinoma lesions in group 1 than in group 2, in which VIN lesions were mainly observed at this location. After re-excision, no patients in group 1 and 50% (n = 2) patients in group 2 developed recurrence.Conclusion: This study did not reveal a significant impact of tumor-free margin distance on recurrence and survival in vulvar cancer. Moreover, the benefit of re-excision seems stronger when tumor-free margins are positive or very close (<3 mm), cases in which invasive or in situ lesions are often present closest to the edge of the specimen.

TI  - Urban surface reconstruction in SAR tomography by graph-cuts
T2  - COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) tomography reconstructs 3-D volumes from stacks of SAR images. High resolution satellites such as TerraSAR-X provide images that can be combined to produce 3-D models. In urban areas, sparsity priors are generally enforced during the tomographic inversion process in order to retrieve the location of scatterers seen within a given radar resolution cell. However, such priors often miss parts of the urban surfaces. Those missing parts are typically regions of flat areas such as ground or rooftops. This paper introduces a surface segmentation algorithm based on the computation of the optimal cut in a flow network. This segmentation process can be included within the 3-D reconstruction framework in order to improve the recovery of urban surfaces. Illustrations on a TerraSAR-X tomographic dataset demonstrate the potential of the approach to produce a 3-D model of urban surfaces such as ground, facades and rooftops.

TI  - Introducing Spatial Regularization in SAR Tomography Reconstruction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The resolution achieved by current synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provides a detailed visualization of urban areas. Spaceborne sensors such as TerraSAR-X can be used to analyze large areas at a very high resolution. In addition, repeated passes of the satellite give access to temporal and interferometric information on the scene. Because of the complex 3-D structure of urban surfaces, scatterers located at different heights (ground, building facade, and roof) produce radar echoes that often get mixed within the same radar cells. These echoes must be numerically unmixed in order to get a fine understanding of the radar images. This unmixing is at the core of SAR tomography. SAR tomography reconstruction is generally performed in two steps: 1) reconstruction of the so-called tomogram by vertical focusing, at each radar resolution cell, to extract the complex amplitudes (a 1-D processing) and 2) transformation from radar geometry to ground geometry and extraction of significant scatterers. We propose to perform the tomographic inversion directly in ground geometry in order to enforce spatial regularity in 3-D space. This inversion requires solving a large-scale nonconvex optimization problem. We describe an iterative method based on variable splitting and the augmented Lagrangian technique. Spatial regularizations can easily be included in this generic scheme. We illustrate, on simulated data and a TerraSAR-X tomographic data set, the potential of this approach to produce 3-D reconstructions of urban surfaces.

TI  - Concept of Health and Sickness of the Spanish Gypsy Population: A Qualitative Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Roma community (RC) has poor health indicators, and providing them with adequate healthcare requires understanding their culture and cultural differences. Our objective was to understand the concept of the health and sickness of the RC in Spain, and for this, a qualitative study was conducted. A content analysis utilizing an inductive approach was used to analyze the data. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were performed, and four main categories were obtained after the analysis of the data: perception of the state of health, the value of health, what was observed, and causal attribution. The inter-relations between the categories shows that the RC have a dichotomous worldview split between non-sickness (health) and sickness mediated by causal attribution. Their worldview is polarized into two values: not sick/sick. When not sick, optimism is prioritized along with happiness, and these two emotions are highly valued, as they also play a physical and social function. When a person becomes noticeably sick, this is understood as being in a negative and severe state, and when there are visible physical implications, then the need to act is made clear. When faced with the need to act, the behavior of the RC is mediated by causal attributions, influenced by nature and religion, timing, concealment by not mentioning the disease, and the origin of the healthcare information. For the organization of an adequate health response for the RC, it is necessary for healthcare systems to be able to merge culture and health care.

TI  - Evaluation of SAR speckle filter technique for inundation mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of speckle in visual images makes the automated digital image classification a challenging task. Therefore, reduction of speckles is an important pre-processing step. The choice of speckle filter depends on the requirements of an application and the characteristics of the dataset. In this study, some most preferred speckle filters are assessed for the data from Sentinel-1 to map flood extent. The Sentinel-1 (VV-vertical transmit, vertical receive and VH- vertical transmit, horizontal receive) polarizing filter data were used to evaluate machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to classify an inundated area. The accuracies of the classifications were assessed by kappa coefficient, overall accuracies, and producer's and user's accuracies. The present study suggests an approach to monitor damage and provide basic information to help local communities manage water-related risk, land planning, water management, and flood control programs.

TI  - Continuous Dynamics Monitoring of Multi-Lake Water Extent Using a Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Fusion Method Based on Two Sets of MODIS Products
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the widespread presence of noise, such as clouds and cloud shadows, continuous, high spatiotemporal-resolution dynamic monitoring of lake water extents is still limited using remote sensing data. This study aims to take an approach to mapping continuous time series of highly-accurate lake water extents. Four lakes from diverse regions of China were selected as cases. In order to reduce the impact of noise and ensure high spatial and temporal resolution of the final results, two sets of MODIS products (including MOD09A1 and MOD13Q1) are used to extract water bodies. This approach mainly comprises preliminary classification, post processing and data fusion. The preliminary classification used the Random Forest (RF) classifier to efficiently and automatically obtain the initial classification results. Post-processing is implemented to repair the classification results affected by noise as much as possible. The processed results of the two sets of products are fused by using the Homologous Data-Based Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Fusion Method (HDSTAFM), which reduces the effect of noise and also improve the temporal and spatial resolution for the final water results. We determined the accuracy using Landsat-based water results, and the values of overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and kappa coefficients (KC) are mostly greater than 0.9. Good correlation was achieved for a time series of water area and altimetry data, obtained by multiple satellites, and also for water-level data selected from hydrological stations.

TI  - Detection of Phytoplankton Blooms in the Turbid Coastal Waters Using Satellite-Derived Fluorescence Line Height off Kakinada Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence line height (FLH) is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface in the chlorophyll fluorescence emission band. Satellite-derived FLH images provide information about the surface chlorophyll distribution which in turn can be used for monitoring surface phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters. The present study aims at observing a phytoplankton bloom in the Kakinada coastal waters along the east coast of India using nFLH product of MODIS-A. This quasi-permanent bloom could not be precisely observed using chlorophyll concentration in the turbid coastal waters due to the presence of other optically active constituents; hence, chlorophyll fluoresce is used to study the bloom phenomenon from nFLH product of MODIS. The analysis has been carried out by analysing the spectral variability using both in situ and satellite R-rs spectra over the bloom and non-bloom waters. Comparative study between in situ chlorophyll with satellite-derived FLH showed a good correlation with an R-2 of 0.43. The bloom phenomenon observed/assessed from the MODIS nFLH data showed > 0.25 W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m in the bloom-dominated pixels. This proves that the satellite-derived nFLH can also be used as an indicator in detecting the phytoplankton blooms and also as one of the important parameters for the ocean colour applications in case-II waters.

TI  - A Generalized Volume Scattering Model-Based Vegetation Index From Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel vegetation index from polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (PolSAR) data using the generalized volume scattering model. The geodesic distance between two Kennaugh matrices projected on a unit sphere proposed by Ratha et al. is used in this letter. This distance is utilized to compute a similarity measure between the observed Kennaugh matrix and generalized volume scattering models. A factor is estimated corresponding to the ratio of the minimum to the maximum geodesic distances between the observed Kennaugh matrix and the set of elementary targets: trihedral, cylinder, dihedral, and narrow dihedral. This factor is then scaled and multiplied with the similarity measure to obtain the novel vegetation index. The proposed vegetation index is compared with the radar vegetation index (RVI) proposed by Kim and van Zyl. A time series of RADARSAT-2 data acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2016 (SMAPVEX16-MB) campaign in Manitoba, Canada, is used to assessing the proposed RVI.

TI  - Drought decreases cooperative sentinel behavior and affects vocal coordination in meerkats
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cooperative breeding often evolved in harsh and arid habitats characterized by high levels of environmental uncertainty. Most forms of cooperative behavior have energetic costs and previous studies have shown that the contributions of individuals to alloparental provisioning are conditional on their food intake. However, the effect of naturally occurring, extreme environmental conditions on the persistence of costly forms of cooperative behaviors and their coordination by communication remain unknown. Here, we show that in meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the probability to act as sentinel, a cooperative vigilance behavior, was the same for typically occurring dry and wet conditions, but significantly reduced during a drought condition with almost no rain, especially in young individuals, members of small groups and groups with pups. The duration an individual stayed on sentinel guard, however, was most reduced during dry conditions. Besides reductions in sentinel behavior, the vocal coordination of foraging meerkats differed when comparing drought and wet conditions. Individuals responded more strongly to playbacks of sentinel "all-clear" calls and close calls, resulting in less vigilance and more foraging behavior during the drought condition. We conclude that while meerkats are adapted to commonly occurring dry periods with low rainfall, the extreme drought period with almost no rain, led to a decrease of the frequency of costly forms of cooperative behaviors in favor of behaviors that maximize direct fitness benefits and also affected the vocal coordination among group members.

TI  - Mapping Periodic Patterns of Global Vegetation Based on Spectral Analysis of NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation seasonality assessment through remote sensing data is crucial to understand ecosystem responses to climatic variations and human activities at large-scales. Whereas the study of the timing of phenological events showed significant advances, their recurrence patterns at different periodicities has not been widely study, especially at global scale. In this work, we describe vegetation oscillations by a novel quantitative approach based on the spectral analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. A new set of global periodicity indicators permitted to identify different seasonal patterns regarding the intra-annual cycles (the number, amplitude, and stability) and to evaluate the existence of pluri-annual cycles, even in those regions with noisy or low NDVI. Most of vegetated land surface (93.18%) showed one intra-annual cycle whereas double and triple cycles were found in 5.58% of the land surface, mainly in tropical and arid regions along with agricultural areas. In only 1.24% of the pixels, the seasonality was not statistically significant. The highest values of amplitude and stability were found at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere whereas lowest values corresponded to tropical and arid regions, with the latter showing more pluri-annual cycles. The indicator maps compiled in this work provide highly relevant and practical information to advance in assessing global vegetation dynamics in the context of global change.

AB  - Lack of opportunities in villages and towns, significant changes has been noted in the urban cities across the world which provides opportunities for the people to earn money. Being the second largest city in Telangana State, Warangal is well known for the monuments such as fortresses, lakes, temples, and stone gateways. To identify the expansion of build-up regions in Hanamkonda Taluk, a comparison study was made for the years 1992, 2001, 2011 and 2017. In the present study, series of Landsat images are used to perform the spatio temporal analysis. The supervised classification with maximum likelihood estimation was performed and the area of urban settlement coverage was found to be increased from 2.25% to 11.22% (1992 - 2017). Prediction of spatial distribution of urban settlement in Hanamkonda Taluk was performed and it is expected to increase to 32.33% in the year 2023.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes of Forests in Northeast China: Insights from Landsat Images and Geospatial Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dramatic changes of forests have strong influence on regional and global carbon cycles, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Understanding dynamics of forests from local to global scale is crucial for policymaking and sustainable development. In this study, we developed an updating and object-based image analysis method to map forests in Northeast China using Landsat images from 1990 to 2015. The spatio-temporal patterns of forests were quantified based on resultant maps and geospatial analysis. Results showed that the percentage of forested area occupying the entire northeast China was more than 40%, about 94% of initial forest cover remained unchanged (49.37 x 10(4) km(2)) over the course of 25 years. A small net forest loss (1051 km(2)) was observed during 1990-2015. High forest gain (10,315 km(2)) and forest loss (9923 km(2)) both occurred from 2010 to 2015. At the provincial level, Heilongjiang demonstrated the highest rate of deforestation, with a net loss of 1802 km(2) (0.89%). Forest changes along elevation, slope, and distance from settlements and roads were also investigated. Over 90% of forest changes occurred in plains and low mountain areas within the elevation of 200-1000 m and slope under 15 degrees. The most dramatic forest changes can be found within the distance of 2000 m from settlements and roads. The reclamation of sloping land, construction of settlements and roads, and possible smallholder clearing contributed more to forest loss, while ecological projects and related government policies play an important role on afforestation and reforestation. These results can provide useful spatial information for further research on the driving forces and consequences of forest changes, which have critical implications for scientific conservation and management of forests.

TI  - Estimation and analysis of the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration in forest ecosystems along the North-South Transect of East China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) is a key parameter for quantifying water use efficiency of ecosystems and understanding the interaction between ecosystem carbon uptake and water cycling in the context of global change. The estimation of T/ET has been paid increasing attention from the scientific community in recent years globally. In this paper, we used the Priestly-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory Model (PT-JPL) driven by regional remote sensing data and gridded meteorological data, to simulate the T/ET in forest ecosystems along the North-South Transect of East China (NSTEC) during 2001-2010, and to analyze the spatial distribution and temporal variation of T/ET, as well as the factors influencing the variation in T/ET. The results showed that: (1) The PT-JPL model is suitable for the simulation of evapotranspiration and its components of forest ecosystems in Eastern China, and has relatively good stability and reliability. (2) Spatial distribution of T/ET in forest ecosystems along NSTEC was heterogeneous, i.e., T/ET was higher in the north and lower in the south, with an averaged value of 0.69; and the inter-annual variation of T/ET showed a significantly increasing trend, with an increment of 0.007/yr (p<0.01). (3) Seasonal and inter-annual variations of T/ET had different dominant factors. Temperature and EVI can explain around 90% (p<0.01) of the seasonal variation in T/ET, while the inter-annual variation in T/ET was mainly controlled by EVI (53%, p<0.05).

TI  - Recent land surface temperature patterns in Antarctica using satellite and reanalysis data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica is among the most important regions when it comes to observing the effects of climate change. One important part of the variability of the land surface temperature (LST) observed on this continent is related to the sea surface temperature of the Tropical Pacific Ocean, which is associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This large-scale phenomenon is called tele-connection. In this study, we investigate the recent trends of LST in Antarctica over the last few decades and its relationship with one of the most intense El Nino events in 2015-2016. LST anomalies derived from satellite data (MODIS) and skin temperature from re-analysis (ERA-5 and ERA-Interim) were used, in addition to the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) time series. A non-parametric time series analysis was carried out to estimate LST trends over different zones of Antarctica. The results show a warming trend obtained from ERA-5 of about 0.9 K/decade in the interior of Antarctica, while MODIS showed the lowest temperature trends of similar to 1 K/decade in East Antarctica. The analysis between LST and the SAM index shows a negative relationship in the extreme periods of ENSO 2015-2016, showing colder autumns and warmer springs than in previous years. These results aide in understanding the effects of extreme phases of ENSO on Antarctica, which are of great importance given the projection of more intense phases over the next century as foreseen in future scenarios of climate change.

TI  - Forest Degradation Assessment Based on Trend Analysis of MODIS-Leaf Area Index: A Case Study in Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing forest degradation has been a challenging task due to the generally slow-changing nature of the process, which demands long periods of observation and high frequency of records. This research contributes to efforts aimed at detecting forest degradation by analyzing the trend component of the time series of Leaf Area Index (LAI) collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over Central Mexico from 2002 to 2017. The analysis of the trend component is proposed to overcome the challenge of identifying very subtle and gradual changes that can be undetected if only the raw time series is examined. Additionally, the use of LAI as an alternative to other widely used indexes (e.g., Normalize Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index) facilitates consideration of the structural changes evident from degradation though not necessarily observable with spectral indices. Overall, results indicate that 52% of the study area has experienced positive trends of vegetation change (i.e., increasing LAI), 37% has remained unchanged, and 11% exhibits some level of forest degradation. Particularly, the algorithm estimated that 0.6% (385 km(2)) is highly degraded, 5.3% (3406 km(2)) moderately degraded, and 5.1% (3245 km(2)) slightly degraded. Most of the moderate and highly degraded areas are distributed over the east side of the study area and evergreen broadleaf appears to be the most affected forest type. Model validation resulted an accuracy of 63%. Some actions to improve this accuracy are suggested, but also a different approach to validate this type of study is suggested as an area of opportunity for future research.

TI  - A Probabilistic Co-Occurrence Approach for Estimating Likelihood of Spatial Overlap Between Listed Species Distribution and Pesticide Use Patterns
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing potential spatial overlap between federally threatened and endangered ("listed") species distributions and registered pesticide use patterns is important for accurate risk assessment of threatened and endangered species. Because accurate range information for such rare species is often limited and agricultural pesticide use patterns are dynamic, simple spatial co-occurrence methods may overestimate or underestimate overlap and result in decisions that benefit neither listed species nor the regulatory process. Here, we demonstrate a new method of co-occurrence analysis that employs probability theory to estimate spatial distribution of rare species populations and areas of pesticide use to determine the likelihood of potential exposure. Specifically, we 1) describe a probabilistic method to estimate pesticide use based on crop production patterns; 2) construct species distribution models for 2 listed insect species whose ranges were previously incompletely described, the rusty-patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis) and the Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek); and 3) develop a probabilistic co-occurrence methodology and assessment framework. Using the principles of the Bayes' theorem, we constructed probabilistic spatial models of pesticide use areas by integrating information from land-cover spatial data, agriculture statistics, and remote-sensing data. We used maximum entropy methods to build species distribution models for 2 listed insects based on species collection and observation records and predictor variables relevant to the species' biogeography and natural history. We further developed novel methods for refinement of these models at spatial scales relevant to US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) regulatory priorities (e.g., critical habitat areas). Integrating both probabilistic assessments and focusing on USFWS priority management areas, we demonstrate that spatial overlap (i.e., potential for exposure) is not deterministic but instead a function of both species distribution and land use patterns. Our work serves as a framework to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of threatened and endangered species assessments using a data-driven likelihood analysis of species co-occurrence.

In Experiment 2 of the study 'I am not an animal: Mortality salience, disgust, and the denial of human creatureliness', Goldenberg et al. (Goldenberg et al. 2001 J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 130, 427-435.

In a replication of this experiment conducted with 128 volunteers, we did not observe evidence for a mortality salience effect.

TI  - Soil Chemical Attributes, Soil Type, and Rainfall Effects on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Cotton Fiber Yield Variability
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of how crop yield is influenced by interactions between the soil and environment is needed to minimize agricultural inputs and reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of soil chemical attributes, soil type, and rainfall on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields and yield variability. In this study, the average cotton fiber yield was collected from 101 fields over nine crop seasons. In these fields, located in central Brazil, the average and standard deviation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were determined. Growing season rainfall and soil nutrients were measured. The variables analyzed were: average cotton fiber yield, NDVI from Landsat images calculated at the boll development phenological stage (enlargement and fiber filling phases), CV of the NDVI, precipitation during the cycle, and soil chemical attributes. The average field NDVI values collected at the boll development phenological stage were correlated to yield (r = 0.50; p < 0.05). Fields with a higher CV for the NDVI values generally had lower yields. The effect of precipitation depends on the cotton phenological stage and soil type. A high rainfall volume at the beginning of the cropping cycle increased plant height variability, which harmed the cotton fiber yield. The highest average values of aluminum content, aluminum saturation, and potential acidity promoted variability in cotton plant growth. Soil chemical attributes related to aluminum were negatively correlated with yield (r = - 0.34; p > 0.05).

TI  - AquaSat: A Data Set to Enable Remote Sensing ofWater Quality for InlandWaters
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite estimates of inland water quality have the potential to vastly expand our ability to observe and monitor the dynamics of large water bodies. For almost 50 years, we have been able to remotely sense key water quality constituents like total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and Secchi disk depth. Nonetheless, remote sensing of water quality is poorly integrated into inland water sciences, in part due to a lack of publicly available training data and a perception that remote estimates are unreliable. Remote sensing models of water quality can be improved by training and validation on larger data sets of coincident field and satellite observations, here called matchups. To facilitate model development and deeper integration of remote sensing into inland water science, we have built AquaSat, the largest such matchup data set ever assembled. AquaSat contains more than 600,000 matchups, covering 1984-2019, of ground-based total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and SDDSecchi disk depth measurements paired with spectral reflectance from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 collected within +/- 1 day of each other. To build AquaSat, we developed open source tools in R and Python and applied them to existing public data sets covering the contiguous United States, including the Water Quality Portal, LAGOS-NE, and the Landsat archive. In addition to publishing the data set, we are also publishing our full code architecture to facilitate expanding and improving AquaSat. We anticipate that this work will help make remote sensing of inland water accessible to more hydrologists, ecologists, and limnologists while facilitating novel data-driven approaches to monitoring and understanding critical water resources at large spatiotemporal scales.

TI  - Land cover data of Upper Parana River Basin, South America, at high spatial resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new land cover map for the Upper Parana River Basin (UPRB-2015), with high spatial resolution (30 m), and a high number of calibration and validation sites. To the new map, 50 Landsat-8 scenes were classified with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and their level of agreement was assessed using overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The generated map was compared by area and by pixel with six global products (MODIS, GlobCover, Globeland30, FROM-GLC, CCI-LC and, GLCNMO). The results of the new classification showed an overall accuracy ranging from 67% to 100%, depending on the sub-basin (80.0% for the entire UPRB). Kappa coefficient was observed ranging from 0.50 to 1.00 (average of 0.73 in the whole basin). Anthropic areas cover more than 70% of the entire UPRB in the new product, with Croplands covering 46.0%. The new mapped areas of croplands are consistent with local socio-economic statistics but don't agree with global products, especially FROM-GLC (14,9%), MODIS (33.8%), GlobCover (71.2%), and CCI (67.8%). In addition, all global products show generalized spatial disagreement, with some sub-basins showing areas of cropland varying by an order of magnitude, compared to UPRB-2015. In the case of Grassland, covering 25.6% of the UPRB, it was observed a strong underestimation by all global products. Even for the Globeland30 and MODIS, which show some significant fraction of pasture areas, there is a high level of disagreement in the spatial distribution. In terms of general agreement, the seven compared mappings (including the new map) agree in only 6.6% of the study area, predominantly areas of forest and agriculture. Finally, the new classification proposed in this study provides better inputs for regional studies, especially for those involving hydrological modeling as well as offers a more refined LU/LC data set for atmospheric numerical models.

TI  - Multi-Method Tracking of Monsoon Floods Using Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods cause great losses in terms of human life and damages to settlements. Since the exposure is a proxy of the risk, it is essential to track flood evolution. The increasing availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery extends flood tracking capabilities because of its all-water and day/night acquisition. In this paper, in order to contribute to a better evaluation of the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to track floods, we analyzed a multi-pulse flood caused by a typhoon in the Camarines Sur Province of Philippines between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. Multiple simple classification methods were used to track the spatial and temporal evolution of the flooded area. Our analysis indicates that Valley Emphasis based manual threshold identification, Otsu methodology, and K-Means Clustering have the potential to be used for tracking large and long-lasting floods, providing similar results. Because of its simplicity, the K-Means Clustering algorithm has the potential to be used in fully automated operational flood monitoring, also because of its good performance in terms of computation time.

TI  - THE NATION STATE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE'S BASIC LAW: A THRESHHOLD OF ELIMINATION?
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOLY LAND AND PALESTINE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nation State of the Jewish People's basic law, passed in July 2018, constitutes a landmark in the evolution of Israel's settler-colonial nationalism and self-presentation. The law underscores the shift Israel has made from aligning itself with the Western liberal order to embracing, even spearheading, a radical right-wing populist worldview. The Jewish exclusivity and racism that the law embodies, I argue, did not result from changes in Israel's political and demographic landscape in the last two decades. Rather their genesis could be traced back to the debates which took place soon after Israel's establishment. Since then the desire for Jewish exclusivity has not dwindled but had been masqueraded through ideas of Israel's inimitability.

TI  - Detection of Dust Storm Origins in the Middle East by Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are one of the most common natural phenomena in the arid and semiarid regions. Long periods of drought and inappropriate land management practices, by removing soil moisture and vegetation cover, can make these region more susceptible to the occurrence dust storms. Over the last few years in the Middle East, the intensity and frequency of this phenomenon have increased, interrupting daily economic and social routines. The purpose of this study was to identify the sources of dust in the Middle East during the time period from 2003 to 2017 using the differential index of dust detection and MODIS satellite images in the period 2003 to 2017. The final steps involved detecting possible driving forces and consequences of dust storms in the region. The results showed that the origin of dust storms incoming to the west, northwest, and southwest of Iran is from Syria, Iraq, and parts of Saudi Arabia, which is also the main source of dust in northern Iraq and the border between Iraq and Syria. The results also showed that satellite images, by providing wide-angle view of surface features and acquiring daily images, would be a helpful tool to identify the origins of dust storms and detect their spatial pattern.

TI  - Unbiased Metagenomic Sequencing for Pediatric Meningitis in Bangladesh Reveals Neuroinvasive Chikungunya Virus Outbreak and Other Unrealized Pathogens
T2  - MBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The burden of meningitis in low-and-middle-income countries remains significant, but the infectious causes remain largely unknown, impeding institution of evidence-based treatment and prevention decisions. We conducted a validation and application study of unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to elucidate etiologies of meningitis in Bangladesh. This RNA mNGS study was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients admitted in the largest pediatric hospital, a World Health Organization sentinel site, with known neurologic infections (n = 36), with idiopathic meningitis (n = 25), and with no infection (n = 30), and six environmental samples, collected between 2012 and 2018. We used the IDseq bioinformatics pipeline and machine learning to identify potentially pathogenic microbes, which we then confirmed orthogonally and followed up through phone/home visits. In samples with known etiology and without infections, there was 83% concordance between mNGS and conventional testing. In idiopathic cases, mNGS identified a potential bacterial or viral etiology in 40%. There were three instances of neuroinvasive Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), whose genomes were >99% identical to each other and to a Bangladeshi strain only previously recognized to cause febrile illness in 2017. CHIKV-specific qPCR of all remaining stored CSF samples from children who presented with idiopathic meningitis in 2017 (n = 472) revealed 17 additional CHIKV meningitis cases, exposing an unrecognized meningitis outbreak. Orthogonal molecular confirmation, case-based clinical data, and patient follow-up substantiated the findings. Case-control CSF mNGS surveys can complement conventional diagnostic methods to identify etiologies of meningitis, conduct surveillance, and predict outbreaks. The improved patient- and population-level data can inform evidence-based policy decisions.IMPORTANCE Globally, there are an estimated 10.6 million cases of meningitis and 288,000 deaths every year, with the vast majority occurring in low-and middle-income countries. In addition, many survivors suffer from long-term neurological sequelae. Most laboratories assay only for common bacterial etiologies using culture and directed PCR, and the majority of meningitis cases lack microbiological diagnoses, impeding institution of evidence-based treatment and prevention strategies. We report here the results of a validation and application study of using unbiased metagenomic sequencing to determine etiologies of idiopathic (of unknown cause) cases. This included CSF from patients with known neurologic infections, with idiopathic meningitis, and without infection admitted in the largest children's hospital of Bangladesh and environmental samples. Using mNGS and machine learning, we identified and confirmed an etiology (viral or bacterial) in 40% of idiopathic cases. We detected three instances of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) that were >99% identical to each other and to a strain previously recognized to cause systemic illness only in 2017. CHIKV qPCR of all remaining stored 472 CSF samples from children who presented with idiopathic meningitis in 2017 at the same hospital uncovered an unrecognized CHIKV meningitis outbreak. CSF mNGS can complement conventional diagnostic methods to identify etiologies of meningitis, and the improved patient- and population-level data can inform better policy decisions.

TI  - Descriptive epidemiology of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Afghanistan: Reported cases to National Surveillance System, 2016-2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aims to provide descriptive epidemiology of human CCHF cases in Afghanistan by demographic, geographical, and seasonal characteristics.Methodology: This paper's findings are based on the retrospective analysis of the National Surveillance System's collected data from 2016 to 2018. Weekly cases exceeding the 90th percentile of the expected number of cases were considered to be exceptional and above normal.Results: The National Surveillance System detected 1,284 CCHF cases from 2007 to 2018, of which 163 cases were in 2016, 245 cases in 2017 and 483 cases in 2018. A total of 891 suspected and confirmed cases were reported between 2016 and 2018, 293 (33%) of these cases were confirmed by detecting IgM antibody using ELISA and RT-PCR. Among confirmed cases, the three-year case fatality ratio (CFR) was 43.3%. Among the reported cases, 68.5% were males and 31.5% females. The frequent reported occupational groups were housewives (15%), health staff (13%), shepherds (11%), butchers (6%), students (6%), animal dealers and farmers (both 2%) respectively, 19% were unemployed, and occupation was not recorded for 26% of cases.Conclusion: Recently, CCHF has significantly increased in Afghanistan. Despite the increased frequency of cases, the laboratory capacity to test specimens and overall knowledge of CCHF management remains limited.

TI  - Risk of Positive Sentinel Lymph Node After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer: Implications for Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy and Immediate Breast Reconstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Residual axillary lymph node involvement after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is the determining factor for postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). Preoperative identification of patients needing PMRT is essential to enable shared decision-making when choosing the optimal timing of breast reconstruction. We determined the risk of positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) after NST in clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer.Methods. All cT1-3N0 patients treated with NST followed by mastectomy and SLNB between 2010 and 2016 were identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Rate of positive SLN for different breast cancer subtypes was determined. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine correlated clinicopathological variables with positive SLN.Results. In total 788 patients were included, of whom 25.0% (197/788) had positive SLN. cT1-3N0 ER+HER2+, cT1-3N0 ER-HER2+, and cT1-2N0 triple-negative patients had the lowest rate of positive SLN: 7.2-11.5%, 0-6.3%, and 2.9-6.2%, respectively. cT1-3N0 ER+HER2- and cT3N0 triple-negative patients had the highest rate of positive SLN: 23.8-41.7% and 30.4%, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that cT2 (odds ratio [OR] 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.96), cT3 (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.30-5.38), grade 3 (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21-0.91), and ER+HER2- subtype (OR 3.94; 95% CI 1.77-8.74) were correlated with positive SLN.Conclusions. In cT1-3N0 ER+HER2+, cT1-3N0 ER-HER2+, and cT1-2N0 triple-negative patients treated with NST, immediate reconstruction can be considered an acceptable option due to low risk of positive SLN. In cT1-3N0 ER+HER2- and cT3N0 triple-negative patients treated with NST, risks and benefits of immediate reconstruction should be discussed with patients due to the relatively high risk of positive SLN.

TI  - Growing stock volume from multi-temporal landsat imagery through google earth engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing stock volume (GSV) is one of the most important variables for.forest management and is traditionally- estimated from ground measurements. These measurements are expensive and therefore sparse and hard to maintain in time on a regular basis. Remote sensing data combined with national forest inventories constitute a helpful tool to estimate and map forest attributes. However, most studies on GSV estimation from remote sensing data focus on small forest areas with a single or only a few species. The current study aims to map GSV in peninsular Spain, a rather large and very heterogeneous area. Around 50 000 wooded land plots from the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory (NFI3) were used as reference data, whereas more than 8 000 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM + scenes covering both the study period (1997-2007) and area were chosen as a compromise between availability and suitable temporal and spatial resolution to estimate GSV. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to handle the huge amount of remotely sensed data. A total of 805 predictors were calculated from Landsat spectral reflectances. Guided regularized random forests algorithm (RF) was used to deal with the arising multicolinearity and identify the most important predictors by comparing with NFI3 plot-level GSV data. As a result, to model the relationship between spectral information and GSV, the original 805 predictors were reduced to only 29 (highlighting texture metrics, vegetation indices and band ratios involving short wave infrared reflectance) while maintaining the accuracy level (R-2 approximate to 0.4 and RMSE approximate to 60 m(3) ha(-1)). A 30-m spatial resolution wall-to-wall GSV map over Peninsular Spain was obtained from a standard RF with the 29 selected predictors through GEE. Its accuracy was evaluated against NFI3 province-level GSV data, resulting in R-2 approximate to 0.91 and RMSE approximate to 15 m(3) ha(-1).

TI  - FATIGUE IN U12 SOCCER-7 PLAYERS DURING REPEATED 1-DAY TOURNAMENT GAMES-A PILOT STUDY
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe and compare the distances and displacement speeds of U12 Soccer-7 athletes during 4 tournament Soccer-7 games (TG) played in less than 24 hours (experimental condition) with those recorded during 2 league Soccer-7 games (LG) with 24 hours of rest before the match (control condition). Ten participants (age = 10.3 +/- 0.5 years) were recruited for the study. Main data analyzed during games included distance completed relative to match duration (Drel), maximal velocity, and distance completed at different running speeds (including acceleration, deceleration, standing, walking, jogging, medium-intensity running, high-intensity running, and sprinting). For data collection during games, athletes wore a global positioning system unit. Different (p <= 0.05) mean playing time was recorded during TG and LG (15.1 and 31.8 minutes/match, respectively). Drel during the 4 TG was maintained between 85.7 +/- 8.5 and 87.5 +/- 8.5 m.min(-1) (p > 0.05) and during the 2 LG between 84.2 +/- 10.9 and 87.5 +/- 9.9 m.min(-1) (p > 0.05). Moreover, similar Drel was recorded during TG and LG (86.8 and 85.9 m.min(-1), respectively). Compared with LG, during TG, maximal velocity was lower (23.0 and 21.3 km.h(-1), respectively; p <= 0.05). In addition, compared with the last game of the tournament, in the preceding games, the distance covered at low speeds (3.1-8.0 km.h(-1)) was lower (37.7 and 32.4%, respectively; p <= 0.05) and at high speeds (>= 18.1 km.h(-1)) tends to be higher (2.5 and 3.3%, respectively). Therefore, compared with the control condition, accumulated Soccer-7 games with less than 24 hours of interday rest negatively affect displacement speed distribution (but not overall relative distances) in U12 Soccer-7 athletes. These results may help to better plan training and competition schedules to youth players.

TI  - Monitoring of vegetation cover by remote sensing in Brazilian semiarid through vegetation indices
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Measures are needed aimed at the protection and conservation of water and natural resources quickly and efficiently. Remote sensing techniques are essential for the environmental monitoring of resources in the semiarid region in space and time. Aimed to monitor and analyze the dynamics of vegetation cover through the spatial-temporal variability of the surface albedo and indices of vegetation in the Caatinga region of the Brazilian semiarid by remote sensing. The study area is the municipality of Arcoverde, located in the semiarid of Pernambuco. The study was developed through six orbital images of Landsat-5 of the TM sensor. The digital processing of the biophysical parameters was performed by the SEBAL algorithm. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics and their variability. Possibly degraded areas were identified by high albedo values and significantly lower vegetation indices, located in the southwest and northwest of the region. The indexes showed similar behavior, mainly in the dry period, with low values being close to zero, areas affected by the dry period in the semiarid. The SAVI presented higher accuracy, highlighting better spectral response of the vegetation. Remote sensing promoted adequate space-time monitoring, highlighting mainly the period classified as climatically dry through the albedo and vegetation indexes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Systematic para-aortic and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is included in the standard comprehensive surgical staging in presumed early epithelial ovarian cancer. No prospective randomized evidence suggests it has potential therapeutic value, and related morbidity is not negligible.Primary Objective(s) To assess sensitivity, safety, and feasibility of the sentinel lymph node technique in identifying the presence of lymph node metastases in patients with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.Study Hypothesis Sentinel lymph node detection with indocyanine green can accurately predict nodal status in a cohort of women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.Trial Design The SELLY trial is a prospective phase II interventional multicenter study.Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1, apparent International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I-II, histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer. Exclusion criteria: evidence of carcinomatosis, mucinous only at definitive histology.Endpoint(s) Primary endpoint is sensitivity (true positive rate). Secondary endpoints include safety (complications rate of the procedure) and feasibility.Sample Size Assuming a sensitivity of 98.5% in predicting positive sentinel lymph nodes at histology, a pathological lymph node prevalence of 14.2%, a precision of estimate (ie, the maximum marginal error) d=5%, and a type I error alpha =0.05, a sample size of 160 patients is needed to test the general hypothesis (ie, to answer whether sentinel lymph nodes identified with indocyanine green can accurately predict nodal status at histology of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer). Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, a total of 176 patients will be enrolled in the study.Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results The accrual should be completed by December 2020 and results should be presented by March 2021.Trial Registration The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03563781).

TI  - The effects of forest cover and disturbance on torrential hazards: large-scale evidence from the Eastern Alps
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global human population growth, limited space for settlements and a booming tourism industry have led to a strong increase of human infrastructure in mountain regions. As this infrastructure is highly exposed to natural hazards, a main role of mountain forests is to regulate the environment and reduce hazard probability. However, canopy disturbances are increasing in many parts of the world, potentially threatening the protection function of forests. Yet, large-scale quantitative evidence on the influence of forest cover and disturbance on natural hazards remains scarce to date. Here we quantified the effects of forest cover and disturbance on the probability and frequency of torrential hazards for 10 885 watersheds in the Eastern Alps. Torrential hazard occurrences were derived from a comprehensive database documenting 3768 individual debris flow and flood events between 1986 and 2018. Forest disturbances were mapped from Landsat satellite time series analysis. We found evidence that forests reduce the probability of natural hazards, with a 25 percentage point increase in forest cover decreasing the probability of torrential hazards by 8.7%;1.2%. Canopy disturbances generally increased the probability of torrential hazard events, with the regular occurrence of large disturbance events being the most detrimental disturbance regime for natural hazards. Disturbances had a bigger effect on debris flows than on flood events, and press disturbances were more detrimental than pulse disturbances. We here present the first large scale quantification of forest cover and disturbance effects on torrential hazards. Our findings highlight that forests constitute important green infrastructure in mountain landscapes, efficiently reducing the probability of natural hazards, but that increasing forest disturbances can weaken the protective function of forests.

TI  - The Incorporation of a Spiritual Emergency Experience Into a Client's Worldview: A Grounded Theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on the process of constructing the meaning of a spiritual emergency experience. In the context of this study, spiritual emergency is understood as an experience of psychotic nature, defined by criteria such as good preepisode functioning, nonordinary states of consciousness, awareness of the intrapsychic nature of the process, or preserved ability to cooperate. In-depth interviews with 13 participants who experienced an episode of spiritual emergency were analyzed using the grounded theory method. The analysis yielded a core category titled "The incorporation of a spiritual emergency experience into a client's worldview." The process of incorporation was conceptualized by two complementary paths: (a) a Suppressive path characterized by an effort to mitigate or eliminate symptoms, considering them as a personally meaningless pathology, and return to a previous state of functioning and (b) a Facilitative path characterized by an acceptance of symptoms, a search for their meaning, and eventually, the adoption of a new perspective. The results are discussed in relation to different theoretical approaches to psychotic experiences.

TI  - Monitoring of a Sea-Dike in Northern Germany by Means of ERS-1, ENVISATASAR, and Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood events are one of the most severe natural hazards threatening billions of people living in coastal areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry can contribute significantly to civil security by providing a highly accurate tool for spatially explicit monitoring of flood protection structures. This article analyzes multitemporal SAR interferometry techniques like persistent scatterer interferometry and small baseline subset (SBAS) for C-band radar data in order to show the potential for a precise dike monitoring. These techniques not only achieve accuracies of few millimeters, but they also enable to reconstruct the deformation process in time. Thus, critical deformation processes can be identified timely and precautions can be taken to prevent dike bursts during flood events. In this article, sea dikes located at the North Sea coast in Germany are analyzed in order to show the potential but also the difficulties of this approach, using 34 ERS-12, 55 Envisat ASAR, and 44 Sentinel-1 scenes. All results point out that long-term deformation processes can be measured quite well. Due to decorrelation effects, the results on vegetated dikes are ambiguous. Applying SBAS to Sentinel-1 data is very promising to serve as a tool to precisely detect and understand deformation processes of dike bodies on large spatial scales.

TI  - Status of Emergency Signal Functions in Myanmar Hospitals: A Cross-Sectional Survey
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a large percentage of global mortality and morbidity rates from non-communicable diseases, including trauma. The establishment and development of emergency care systems is crucial for addressing this problem. Defining gaps in the resources and capacity to provide emergency healthcare in LMICs is essential for proper design and operation of ECS (emergency care services) reinforcement programs. Myanmar has particular challenges with road access for providing timely emergency medical care, and a shortage of trained health workers. To examine the ECS capacity in Myanmar, we used the Emergency Care Assessment Tool (ECAT), which features newly developed tools for assessing sentinel conditions and signal functions (key interventions to address morbidity and mortality) in emergency care facilities.Methods: ECAT is composed of six emergent sentinel conditions and corresponding signal functions. We surveyed a total of nine hospitals in five states in Myanmar. A constructed survey sheet was delivered by e-mail, and follow-up interviews were conducted via messenger to clarify ambiguous answers.Results: We categorized the nine participating institutions according to predefined criteria: four basic-level hospitals; four intermediate-level; and one advanced-level hospital. All basic hospitals were weak in trauma care, and two of 12 signal functions were unavailable. Half of the intermediate hospitals showed weakness in trauma care, as well as critical care such as shock management. Only half had a separate triage area for patients. In contrast, all signal functions and resources listed in ECAT were available in the advanced-level hospital.Conclusion: Basic-level facilities in Myanmar were shown to be suboptimal in trauma management, with critical care also inadequate in intermediate facilities. To reinforce signal functions in Myanmar health facilities, stakeholders should consider expanding critical functions in selected lower-level health facilities. A larger scale survey would provide more comprehensive data to improve emergency care in Myanmar.

TI  - The Influence of Seasonal and Interannual Variability on Surface Chlorophyll-a Off the Western Lesser Sunda Islands
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel and long-term satellite data (2003-2017) are analyzed to investigate the variability of ocean surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration off the Western Lesser Sunda Islands (WLSI) under the influence of the Indonesian Australian monsoon, the El Nio-Southern Oscillation, and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). In this article, we first analyzed the seasonal variability of Chl-a, and then describe the relationship among the sea surface Chl-a, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface wind stress in the region. Our results demonstrate that prevailing southeasterly wind stress plays a pivotal role in generating the Chl-a maxima off the WLSI. Particularly on seasonal time scale, the strengthening of southeasterly wind stress (up to similar to 0.01 Nm(-2)) during the southeast monsoon season produces enhanced Chl-a concentrations (0.59mgm(-3)) associated with sea surface cooling (similar to 28.8C) in the area of study. In contrast, the Chl-a maxima completely vanished during the northwest monsoon season. On interannual time scale, the largest positive Chl-a and wind stress anomalies and the coolest SST anomaly are observed in 2006 when El Nio and positive IOD events occur at the same time. Meanwhile, the greatest negative Chl-a anomaly is prevailed during the 2016 negative IOD event. This article demonstrates that wind variability is the essential factor in determining the magnitude of the Chl-a maxima off the WLSI.

In this work, we assess three understood local binary descriptors (BRIEF, ORB, and BRISK) for the iris recognition task. As iris recognition is a computationally overwhelming undertaking to run locally on cell phones, the proposal of a technique to perform iris recognition on a cloud foundation, which has lately developed as another worldview for facilitating and conveying services over the Internet, has been made. The primary objective of this is to give clients powerful correspondence with no significant blunders.

TI  - Is Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction a Kidney Disorder?
T2  - CURRENT HYPERTENSION REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous syndrome of exertional intolerance, cardiac dysfunction, and fluid overload and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.Recent Findings As our understanding of this syndrome has evolved, we are beginning to recognize the similarities and associations with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Salt and fluid retention are common in CKD and may be the sentinel event leading ultimately to the syndrome of HFpEF. Mechanisms linking both disease states include hypervolemia, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which are also common to comorbidities that drive both HFpEF and CKD.Summary In this review, we will discuss recent clinical research focusing on HFpEF, CKD, and comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes mellitus. We will review strategies for volume management and novel therapeutic approaches with new classes of drugs, including sodium-glucose cotransporters and angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, which may work through targeting of both the heart and the kidney. Lastly, we emphasize why focusing on the alleviation of factors provoking renal injury and slowing the progression of renal dysfunction may provide the most therapeutic benefit in patients who have been diagnosed with HFpEF.

TI  - A Semi-Automated Object-Based Gully Networks Detection Using Different Machine Learning Models: A Case Study of Bowen Catchment, Queensland, Australia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is a dominant source of sediment and particulates to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) World Heritage area. We selected the Bowen catchment, a tributary of the Burdekin Basin, as our area of study; the region is associated with a high density of gully networks. We aimed to use a semi-automated object-based gully networks detection process using a combination of multi-source and multi-scale remote sensing and ground-based data. An advanced approach was employed by integrating geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) with current machine learning (ML) models. These included artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), and an ensemble ML model of stacking to deal with the spatial scaling problem in gully networks detection. Spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and topographic conditioning factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope length (SL), and curvature, were generated from Sentinel 2A images and the ALOS 12-m digital elevation model (DEM), respectively. For image segmentation, the ESP2 tool was used to obtain three optimal scale factors. On using object pureness index (OPI), object matching index (OMI), and object fitness index (OFI), the accuracy of each scale in image segmentation was evaluated. The scale parameter of 45 with OFI of 0.94, which is a combination of OPI and OMI indices, proved to be the optimal scale parameter for image segmentation. Furthermore, segmented objects based on scale 45 were overlaid with 70% and 30% of a prepared gully inventory map to select the ML models' training and testing objects, respectively. The quantitative accuracy assessment methods of Precision, Recall, and an F1 measure were used to evaluate the model's performance. Integration of GEOBIA with the stacking model using a scale of 45 resulted in the highest accuracy in detection of gully networks with an F1 measure value of 0.89. Here, we conclude that the adoption of optimal scale object definition in the GEOBIA and application of the ensemble stacking of ML models resulted in higher accuracy in the detection of gully networks.

TI  - Predicting regional spatial distribution of soil texture in floodplains using remote sensing data: A case of southeastern Iran
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture is a physical property of soil and knowledge on its spatial distribution is essential for many agricultural and environmental activities especially in alluvial plains. This study aimed to predict the spatial distribution of soil fractions (i.e. percentages of sand, silt, and clay) in Sistan floodplain on a regional scale (area: 1500 km(2)). Random forest (RF), regression kriging-neural network residual kriging (RKNNRK), neural network residual kriging (NNRK), regression kriging (RK), and cokriging (COK) methods were used to map soil texture components over the region. Soil fractions were measured for 160 soil samples taken from the surface layer (0-30 cm) of various soil series in agriculture land of Sistan floodplain. The additive log-ratio (air) transformation was applied to transform texture components prior to prediction. Remote sensing data including Landsat 8' Bands (1-8), Band 4 to Band 8 ratio, Band 4 to Band 3 ratio, NDVI, GSI, Brightness Index, and Clay Index were used as auxiliary variables for interpolation of soil fractions. 80% of actual data was used for prediction and 20% of data was used for validation. The performance of methods used was evaluated using RMSE, ME and MAE criteria. The results showed that the RKNNRK model has the highest accuracy for prediction of sand (RMSE = 15.04%) and clay (RMSE = 8.77%) contents while the most accurate model for predicting silt content is NNRK (RMSE = 12.68%). RK and COK performed worse than NNRK and RKNNRK. A relatively high value of RMSE obtained for sand (17.89%), silt (14.15%), and clay (8.89%) contents by the RF model. This could be due to the low relief of study area, regional scale effects, low density of sampling points and high heterogeneity of soil texture components in floodplains. Our findings revealed that RKNNRK and NNRK models, when combined with remote sensing data, produce more accurate results and therefore can be used for appropriate mapping of soil fractions in floodplains and on a regional scale.

TI  - Intelligent Wind Retrieval from Chinese <i>Gaofen-3</i> SAR Imagery in Quad Polarization
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes the use of the artificial neural network for wind retrieval with Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. More than 10 000 images acquired in wave mode and quad-polarization strip map were collected over global seas throughout the 2-yr mission. The GF-3 operated in a quad-polarization channel-vertical-vertical (VV), vertical-horizontal (VH), horizontal-horizontal (HH), and horizontal-vertical (HV). These images were collocated with winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts at a 0.125 degrees grid. The newly released wind retrieval algorithm for copolarization (VV and HH) SAR included CMOD7 and C-SARMOD2. We developed an algorithm based on an artificial neural network method using the SAR-measured normalized radar cross section at quad-polarization channels, herein named QPWIND_GF. Simulations using the QPWIND_GF showed that the correlation coefficient of wind speed was 0.94. We then validated the retrieval wind speeds against the measurements at a 0.25 degrees grid from the Advanced Scatterometer. A comparison showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of wind speed was 0.74 m s(-1), which was better than the wind speed obtained using state-of-the-art methods-including, for example, CMOD7 (RMSE 0.88 m s(-1)) and C-SARMOD2 (RMSE 1.98 m s(-1)). The finding indicated that the accuracy of wind retrieval from GF-3 SAR images was significantly improved. Our work demonstrates the advanced feasibility of an artificial neural network method for SAR marine applications.

TI  - Surface Roughness-Induced Spectral Degradation of Multi-Spaceborne Solar Diffusers Due to Space Radiation Exposure
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar diffusers (SDs) have often been used as the onboard calibrators for the radiometric calibration of reflective solar band imaging sensors. After being spaceborne, the reflectance of SDs is observed to degrade with spectral dependence due to exposure to solar UV and energetic particle radiation. Long-term spectral reflectance data of SDs onboard multiple LEO imaging sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on SNPP, are analyzed. The reflectance of SDs on these three instruments degrades faster for the shorter wavelength bands than the longer wavelength bands. The Surface Roughness-induced Rayleigh Scattering (SRRS) model is applied to simulate the SD degradation on these instruments, and the growth of the surface roughness parameter of the SDs is derived. It is determined that the change of surface roughness scale length is tens of nanometers. To show the consistency of roughness growth rates among the SDs on Terra/Aqua MODIS and SNPP VIIRS instruments, the functional dependences of the growth rates are characterized according to the SD exposure time and the stage of surface roughness. It is also found that the flattening or reverse in the growth trend of the surface roughness for these three SDs occurred around the same interval between October 2013 and October 2015. The confirmation of the applicability of SRRS model with the long-term spectral reflectance data from three independent spaceborne SDs facilitates a better understanding of the origin and physical processes of the SD degradation.

TI  - Integration of Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Data in a Deep Learning Framework for Hourly Urban PM<sub>2.5</sub> Mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine spatiotemporal mapping of PM2.5 concentration in urban areas is of great significance in epidemiologic research. However, both the diversity and the complex nonlinear relationships of PM2.5 influencing factors pose challenges for accurate mapping. To address these issues, we innovatively combined social sensing data with remote sensing data and other auxiliary variables, which can bring both natural and social factors into the modeling; meanwhile, we used a deep learning method to learn the nonlinear relationships. The geospatial analysis methods were applied to realize effective feature extraction of the social sensing data and a grid matching process was carried out to integrate the spatiotemporal multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on this research strategy, we finally generated hourly PM2.5 concentration data at a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees. This method was successfully applied to the central urban area of Wuhan in China, which the optimal result of the 10-fold cross-validation R-2 was 0.832. Our work indicated that the real-time check-in and traffic index variables can improve both quantitative and mapping results. The mapping results could be potentially applied for urban environmental monitoring, pollution exposure assessment, and health risk research.

T2  - Bulletin of Botanical Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Global geographical coordinates of 284 bryophytes, which had been recorded from the Zhoushan archipelago, were obtained based on the data of GBIF(Global Biodiversity Information Facility), Tropicos. org and other published literature. The world were divided into 576 geographical units (GUs), each with a size of 15 degrees E x 7. 5 degrees N. Their presence/absence data in these GUs were recorded by using ArcGis 10. 2. Eleven geographical elements were identified for these bryophytes based on a clustering analysis with the above data and their actual geographical distribution. The eleven elements include cosmopolitan (26, 9. 15%), North temperate (36, 12. 68%), North temperate-South temperate (30, 10. 56%), Palaeotemperate (16, 5. 63%), Eastern Asian-Northern American (11, 3. 87%), Eastern Asian (84, 29. 58%), Pantropical (28, 9. 86%), Palaeotropical (6,2. 11%), Tropical Asian-Papua New Guinea (11, 3. 87%), Eastern Asian-Tropical Asian Papua New Guinea(6, 2. 11%), Eastern-tropical Asian-Australian-Ocean (11, 3. 87%) and other unknown (19, 6. 69%). Among these eleven elements, eight accord with the concepts proposed by Wu ZY. However,--tropical Asian element was special, cover larger regions than spermatophytes of the same element. Therefore, the tropical Asian element of the bryophytes recorded in the Zhoushan archipelago was further divided into three groups.

TI  - A Multitemporal Remote Sensing Image Registration Method Based on Water Bodies for the Lake-Rich Region
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate multitemporal remotely sensed image registration is essential for water body change detection and analysis of lake dynamics. However, lake-rich regions, such as Siberia, are mostly dominated by rivers and lakes, with few stable geometry features such as those typically used as control points for image registration. Lakes in Arctic regions are generally not static; their shorelines tend to expand and shrink seasonally, and may change substantially between different years, making it difficult to find consistent features for image registration. Consequently, traditional image-to-image registration methods, and even many sophisticated registration algorithms, rarely achieve accurate geometric correction in Arctic regions due to a lack of sufficient control points. In this article, we proposed a summary lake spatial attribute, the inferred deepest point of the lake (DPL), as a feature that is relatively insensitive to lake area changes, and therefore useful for registration of multitemporal images. The central focus of the DPL estimation algorithm is the identification of the largest inner circle (LIC) of the lake polygon. First, the internal Voronoi diagram of a lake polygon is calculated by the ``divide-and-conquer" method. The medial axis (MA) is then calculated by Voronoi diagram simplification, and finally, the LIC center is obtained by computing the distance from the MA intersection to all polygon edges. The approach was used to register HJ-1 and Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images in Siberia, where water bodies dominate the landscape and change significantly over time. The proposed method found a large number of control points from the extracted water bodies. Subpixel registration accuracy of 0.62 pixels (18.5 m) and 0.33 pixels (19.6m) root mean square error (RMSE) was obtained for the HJ-1 and MSS images, respectively. In comparison, the alternative method of using lake centroids, only achieved 0.75 pixels (22.4 m) and 0.49pixels (29.3 m) RMSE. This registration accuracy improvement is potentially important for large-scale regional cartography and change detection applications.

TI  - Deep learning for multi-modal classification of cloud, shadow and land cover scenes in PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery it is important to improve the efficiency and accuracy of satellite image indexing, retrieval and classification. Furthermore, there is a need for utilizing all available satellite imagery in identifying general land cover types and monitoring their changes through time irrespective of their spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions. Therefore, in this study, we developed deep learning models able to efficiently and accurately classify cloud, shadow and land cover scenes in different high-resolution (< 10 m) satellite imagery. Specifically, we trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to perform multi-label classification of multi-modal, high-resolution satellite imagery at the scene level. Multi-label classification at the scene level (a.k.a. image indexing), as opposed to the pixel level, allows for faster performance, higher accuracy (although at the cost of detail) and higher generalizability. We investigated the generalization ability (i.e. cross-dataset and geographic independence) of individual and ensemble CNN models trained on multi-modal satellite imagery (i.e. PlanetScope and Sentinel-2). The models trained on PlanetScope imagery collected over the Amazon performed well when applied to PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery collected over the Wet Tropics of Australia with an F-2 score of 0.72 and 0.69, respectively. Similarly, PlanetScope-based CNN models trained on imagery collected over the Wet Tropics of Australia performed well when applied to Sentinel-2 imagery with an F-2 score of 0.76, and the reverse scenario resulted in the same F-2 score of 0.76. This suggests that our CNN models have high cross-dataset generalization ability and are suitable for classifying cloud, shadow and land cover classes in satellite imagery with resolutions from 3 m (PlanetScope) to 10 m (Sentinel-2). The performance of our CNN models was also comparable to the state-of-the-art methods (i.e. Sen2Cor and MACCS) developed specifically for classifying cloud and shadow classes in Sentinel-2 imagery. Finally, we show the potential of our CNN models to mask cloud and shadow contaminated areas from PlanetScope- and Sentinel-2-derived NDVI time-series.

Based on our previously developed coupled soilcanopyatmosphere radiative transfer model (RTM) and a multiple parameters estimation scheme, this paper evaluates the performance of four machine learning algorithms [Gaussian process regression (GPR), back-propagation neural networks (NNs), random forest regression, and general regression NN] on emulating the coupled RTM, where the traditional lookup table (LUT) algorithm is also compared. The results show that the GPR algorithm can emulate complex RTMs with excellent accuracy and efficiency. GPR emulators of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed PAR, and incident shortwave radiation were applied to the multi-parameter estimation scheme to replace the traditional LUT algorithm, which avoids the need to integrate over the spectra while achieving an acceleration ratio of 16. A test of the updated multi-parameter estimation scheme at the Bondville site using 18 years of clear-sky observations demonstrates that replacing the computationally expensive integration processes with GPR emulators is practical. The emulators can also be used to simulate the corresponding parameters independently, and this GPR acceleration method for complex models is universal and can be easily applied to other time-consuming models.

TI  - The impact of rain to observed signal from Chinese Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar in typhoons
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3), a Chinese civil synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at C-band, has operated since August 2016. Remarkably, several typhoons have been captured by GF-3 around the China Seas over its last two-year mission. In this study, six images acquired in Global Observation (GLO) and Wide ScanSAR (WSC) modes at vertical-vertical (VV) polarization channel are discussed. This work focuses on investigating the observation of rainfall using GF-3 SAR. These images were collocated with winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), significant wave height simulated from the WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) model, sea surface currents from climate forecast system version 2 (CFSv2) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and rain rate data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Sea surface roughness, was compared with the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) from SAR observations, and indicated a 0.8 correlation (COR). We analyzed the dependences of the difference between model-simulated NRCS and SAR-measured NRCS on the TRMM rain rate and WW3-simulated significant wave height. It was found that the effects of rain on SAR damps the radar signal at incidence angles ranging from 15 degrees to 30 degrees, while it enhances the radar signal at incidence angles ranging from 30 degrees to 45 degrees and incidence angles smaller than 10 degrees. This behavior is consistent with previous studies and an algorithm for rain rate retrieval is anticipated for GF-3 SAR.

TI  - Monitoring Differential Subsidence along the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway with Multiband SAR Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-speed railways have strict standards of infrastructure deformation and post-construction settlement. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the ability to detect ground deformation with a high accuracy and wide coverage and is becoming a useful tool for monitoring railway health. In this study, we analyzed the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway (BTIR) track using InSAR time-series analysis with different data sets. First, by using RADARSAT-2 images, we examined the areas along the BTIR with significant subsidence. Then, we characterized these areas by means of X-band TerraSAR-X data. We adopted the expectation (Ex) and entropy (En) method, combined with GIS spatial analysis, to analyze the ground settlement differences on both sides of the railway. The results show that the area with the most severe differential settlement occurs between 12 and 20 km along the railway and within 120 to 20 m on both sides of the Chaoyang-Tongzhou section (CTS). Thereafter, we analyzed the reasons for the large difference in this area by considering different factors, e.g., regional land subsidence, groundwater level changes, and the dynamic load. In addition, we studied the impact of regional subsidence on the safe operation of the BTIR. The results show that the maximum different settlement along the BTIR is within the safe range, according to the high-speed railway design standard between 2010 and 2015. This study aims to provide technical support for assessing the impact of subsidence on the safety of railway operations.

TI  - Fast supervised novelty detection and its application in remote sensing
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-class supervised novelty detection (multi-class SND) is used for finding minor anomalies in many unknown samples when the normal samples follow a mixture of distributions. It needs to solve a quadratic programming (QP) whose size is larger than that in one-class support vector machine. In multi-class SND, one sample corresponds to n(c) variables in QP. Here, n(c) is the number of normal classes. Thus, it is time-consuming to solve multi-class SND directly. Fortunately, the solution of multi-class SND is only determined by minor samples which are with nonzero Lagrange multipliers. Due to the sparsity of the solution in multi-class SND, we learn multi-class SND on a small subset instead of the whole training set. The subset consists of the samples which would be with nonzero Lagrange multipliers. These samples are located near the boundary of the distributions and can be identified by the nearest neighbours' distribution information. Our method is evaluated on two toy data sets and three hyperspectral remote sensing data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance learning on the retained subset almost keeps the same as that on the whole training set. However, the training time reduces to less than one tenth of the whole training sets.

TI  - Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and axillary de-escalation management for patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explore the optimal time of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to assess the feasibility of selective elimination of axillary surgery after NAC in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients. From April 2010 to August 2018, 845 patients undergoing surgery after NAC were included in this retrospective study to analyze the correlation between different clinicopathological characteristics of cN0 patients and negative axillary lymph node after NAC (ypN0). Among the 148 cN0 patients, 83.1% (123/148) were ypN0. The rates of ypN0 in patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2-, HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer were 75.4% (46/61), 82.6% (19/23), 85.2% (23/27), and 94.6% (35/37), respectively (P < 0.001). The rates of ypN0 in TN and HER2+ patients were 94.6% and 95.5%, which were significantly higher than that in HR+/HER2- patients (P < 0.05). Molecular subtypes, clinical stage, radiologic complete response, and pathologic complete response (bpCR) of the breast tumor correlated with ypN0 after full-course NAC (P < 0.05). Molecular subtypes (OR = 2.374, P = 0.033), clinical stage (OR = 0.320, P = 0.029), and bpCR (OR = 0.454, P = 0.012) were independent predictors for ypN0. The optimal time of SLNB and NAC in cN0 patients might be different among different molecular subtypes: it would be preferable to perform SLNB prior to NAC for HR+/HER2- patients, and SLNB after NAC for TN and HER2+ patients to reduce the risk of axillary lymph node dissection. In view of the high ypN0 rate in cN0 patients, axillary surgical staging might be selectively eliminated, especially for HER2+ and TN patients.

TI  - Dramatic response of FOLFIRINOX regimen in a collision pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient with a germline <i>BRCA2</i> mutation: a case report
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are the most common gene mutations in familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Several reports have demonstrated the utility of platinum-based chemotherapy for treating cancer patients who harbour a BRCA mutation. Here we discuss a 47-year-old Japanese female with no relevant past history who presented with epigastralgia and fever in September 2016. A computed tomography scan revealed a low-density, low-enhanced tumour 15 mm in diameter in the head of the pancreas. The pathological diagnosis was a ductal pancreatic carcinoma. A 6 mm low-enhanced metastatic tumour was also detected in segment 4 of the liver. Because she had early onset of the disease and a family history-her mother died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at age 48-we considered a diagnosis of familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She received modified FOLFIRINOX. Two months after starting chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with an invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast. FOLFIRINOX was continued for 8 cycles (4 months); the primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma shrank and the liver metastatic foci disappeared, but the size of the breast tumour increased. Total right breast excision and sentinel lymph node dissection were performed. FOLFIRINOX was continued and after 12 cycles (6 months), both her pancreatic adenocarcinoma and liver metastasis were no longer visible using imaging. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed and the primary tumour had shrunk to 2.5 mm. Genetic testing revealed a germline BRCA2 mutation. The FOLFIRINOX regimen showed dramatic effects on the collision pancreatic but not on the breast cancer.

TI  - Using UAV Multispectral Images for Classification of Forest Burn Severity-A Case Study of the 2019 Gangneung Forest Fire
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing has limitations in acquiring images before a forest fire, although burn severity can be analyzed by comparing images before and after a fire. Determining the burned surface area is a challenging class in the analysis of burn area severity because it looks unburned in images from aircraft or satellites. This study analyzes the availability of multispectral UAV images that can be used to classify burn severity, including the burned surface class. RedEdge multispectral UAV image was acquired after a forest fire, which was then processed into a mosaic reflectance image. Hundreds of samples were collected for each burn severity class, and they were used as training and validation samples for classification. Maximum likelihood (MLH), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and thresholding of a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used as classifiers. In the results, all classifiers showed high overall accuracy. The classifiers also showed high accuracy for classification of the burned surface, even though there was some confusion among spectrally similar classes, unburned pine, and unburned deciduous. Therefore, multispectral UAV images can be used to analyze burn severity after a forest fire. Additionally, NDVI thresholding can also be an easy and accurate method, although thresholds should be generalized in the future.

TI  - Testing the relation between disgust and general avoidance behavior
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Disgust is posited to serve a disease-avoidance function, signaling the potential presence of a contaminant and encouraging prophylactic behavior. Indeed, some research indicates that disgust sensitivity is associated with avoidance of specific, disgust-related stimuli. However, disgust may be related to more general behavioral avoidance tendencies, but relatively little research has empirically tested this link. Across two studies, we sought to fill this gap. In Study 1, participants completed measures of disgust sensitivity, as well as a performance-based task and a self-report measure of approach-avoidance tendencies. Greater disgust sensitivity was generally correlated with more self-reported avoidance tendencies and more avoidance behavior of positive stimuli in the performance-based task. In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to either a disgust or control condition, which entailed consuming disgusting flavored or normally flavored jellybeans, respectively. They then completed the performance-based measure of avoidance. Participants in the disgust condition exhibited more avoidance behavior than participants in the control condition. Across both studies, disgust was associated with avoidance tendencies. These findings have broad implications for the role of disgust is shaping worldview and attitudes, in addition to disease avoidance.

TI  - Modelling Lichen Abundance for Woodland Caribou in a Fire-Driven Boreal Landscape
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are reliant on Cladonia spp. ground lichens as a major component of their diet and lichen abundance could be an important indicator of habitat quality, particularly in winter. The boreal forest is typified by large, stand-replacing forest fires that consume ground lichens, which take decades to recover. The large spatial extent of caribou ranges and the mosaic of lichen availability created by fires make it challenging to track the abundance of ground lichens. Researchers have developed various techniques to map lichens across northern boreal and tundra landscapes, but it remains unclear which techniques are best suited for use in the continuous boreal forest, where many of the conflicts amongst caribou and human activities are most acute. In this study, we propose a two-stage regression modelling approach to map the abundance (biomass, kg/ha) of Cladonia spp. ground lichens in the boreal forest. Our study was conducted in Woodland Caribou Provincial Park, a wilderness-class protected area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. We used field sampling to characterize lichen abundance in 109 upland forest stands across the local time-since-fire continuum (2-119 years-since-fire). We then used generalized linear models to relate lichen presence and lichen abundance to forest structure, topographic and remote sensing attributes. Model selection indicated ground lichens were best predicted by ecosite, time-since-fire, and canopy closure. Lichen abundance was very low (<1000 kg/ha) across the time-since-fire continuum in upland forest stands with dense tree cover. Conversely, lichen abundance increased steadily across the time-since-fire continuum in upland forest stands with sparse tree cover, exceeding 3000 kg/ha in mature stands. We interpolated the best lichen presence and lichen abundance models to create spatial layers and combined them to generate a map that provides a reasonable estimation of lichen biomass (R-2 = 0.39) for our study area. We encourage researchers and managers to use our method as a basic framework to map the abundance of ground lichens across fire-prone, boreal caribou ranges. Mapping lichens will aid in the identification of suitable habitat and can be used in planning to ensure habitat is maintained in adequate supply in areas with multiple land-use objectives. We also encourage the use of lichen abundance maps to investigate questions that improve our understanding of caribou ecology.

TI  - Multi-dimensional approach to end-of-life care: The Welfare Model
T2  - NURSING ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate and balanced decision-making is sentinel to goal setting and the provision of appropriate clinical care that are attuned to preserving the best interests of the patient. Current family-led decision-making in family-centric societies such as those in Singapore and other countries in East Asia are believed to compromise these objectives in favor of protecting familial interests. Redressing these skewed clinical practices employing autonomy-based patient-centric approaches however have been found wanting in their failure to contend with wider sociocultural considerations that impact care determinations. Evaluation of a number of alternative decision-making frameworks set out to address the shortcomings of prevailing atomistic and family-centric decision-making models within the confines of end-of-life care prove these alternative frameworks to be little better at protecting the best interests of vulnerable patients. As a result, we propose the Welfare Model that we believe is attentive to the relevant socio-culturally significant considerations of a particular case and better meets the needs of end-of-life care goals of preserving the welfare of patients. Employing a multi-professional team evaluation guided by regnant psychosocial, legal, and clinical standards and the prevailing practical and clinical realities of the particular patient's setting the Welfare Model provides a clinically relevant, culturally sensitive, transparent, and evidence-based approach to care determinations.

TI  - Excision of both pretreatment marked positive nodes and sentinel nodes improves axillary staging after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Marking the axilla with radioactive iodine seed and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy have been proposed for axillary staging after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in clinically node-positive breast cancer. This study evaluated the identification rate and detection of residual disease with combined excision of pretreatment-positive marked lymph nodes (MLNs) together with SLNs.Methods: This was a multicentre retrospective analysis of patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy and the combination procedure (with or without axillary lymph node dissection). The identification rate and detection of axillary residual disease were calculated for the combination procedure, and for MLNs and SLNs separately.Results: At least one MLN and/or SLN(s) were identified by the combination procedure in 138 of 139 patients (identification rate 99.3 per cent). The identification rate was 92.8 per cent for MLNs alone and 87.8 per cent for SLNs alone. In 88 of 139 patients (63.3 per cent) residual axillary disease was detected by the combination procedure. Residual disease was shown only in the MLN in 20 of 88 patients (23 per cent) and only in the SLN in ten of 88 (11 per cent), whereas both the MLN and SLN contained residual disease in the remainder (58 of 88, 66 per cent).Conclusion: Excision of the pretreatment-positive MLN together with SLNs after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in patients with clinically node-positive disease resulted in a higher identification rate and improved detection of residual axillary disease.

TI  - Seven-Component Scattering Power Decomposition of POLSAR Coherency Matrix
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) have increased in the past few decades. The potential of model-based decompositions is coupled with polarimetric information extraction from the POLSAR data for target identification and classification. The coherency matrix $[T]$ with nine independent parameters, and associated with some physical scattering models, serves as input to these decompositions. This paper attempts to assign one such physical scattering model to the real part of $T_{23}$ ($\text {Re}\{{T}_{23}\}$ ) and develop a new scattering power decomposition model, called as the seven-component scattering decomposition (7SD). Previously developed scattering power models have eliminated $\text {Re}\{T_{23}\}$ , assuming the orientation angle compensation condition, to reduce the number of independent $[T]$ parameters. The proposed 7SD model has been tested on fully polarimetric SAR data sets acquired by the spaceborne Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) and airborne F-SAR, and the results are compared with the existing scattering power decompositions. The physical scattering model for $\text {Re}\{T_{23}\}$ is derived from a particular configuration of dipoles (referred to as mixed dipole configuration), which gives rise to compound scattering. The mixed-dipole scattering occurs in urban areas that are highly oriented to the radar illumination direction as well as in vegetation areas. 7SD also delivers an additional mixed dipole scattering power compared to the previous six-component scattering model. The mixed-dipole scattering model reduces the contribution of volume scattering power in double-bounce predominant areas (such as oriented urban blocks), thereby imparting improved understanding of the polarimetric information contained in the coherency matrix.

TI  - Validation of SMAP Soil Moisture Products Using Ground-Based Observations for the Paddy Dominated Tropical Region of India
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission currently provides three surface soil moisture products based solely on instrument measurements. The three soil moisture products are: 1) the radiometer-only 36 km gridded; 2) a radiometer-only enhanced product gridded at 9 km; and 3) a high-resolution (3 km) SMAP-Sentinel activepassive product. It is important to validate these released SMAP soil moisture products over various land covers and hydroclimatic domains before they are routinely used in scientific research and applications. This paper evaluates SMAP-based soil moisture products for typical Indian conditions of extreme seasonal variability that leads to changes from very wet to dry soil, especially for the paddy dominated region. The assessment metrics indicate that the enhanced passive-only soil moisture product meets the SMAP accuracy requirement of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) during the nongrowing season (NGS) with unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values ranging between 0.025 and 0.036 m(3)/m(3). However, this product underperformed during the paddy growing season (GS) with ubRMSE values ranging between 0.063 and 0.097 m(3)/m(3). In addition, the SMAP-Sentinel activepassive soil moisture product shows satisfactory performance during the NGS (ubRMSE, 0.0170.051 m(3)/m(3)), but during the GS, ubRMSE ranged between 0.089 and 0.104 m(3)/m(3). Use of the vegetation water content climatology and low clay fraction in SMAP baseline algorithm (auxiliary database) that mismatched with the actual values may be the possible source of errors and biases in the SMAP soil moisture products. The reported study provides guidelines for the application of enhanced SMAP soil moisture products in India, especially for the tropical region, and provides information that can be used to improve the retrieval algorithm.

TI  - Sentinel Node Mapping in Gynecologic Cancers: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Gynecologic cancers are one of the most important causes of women death worldwide. The sentinel lymph node concept was introduced by Cabanas in 1977 for the penile cancer. This technique was proven safe and feasible in selected cancers such as breast cancer, melanoma, or some gynecologic cancers. Sentinel lymph node mapping is increasingly used in early stages of cervical or vulvar cancer in particular due to the safety, high detection rate, and sensitivity of the technique. In this review, we will discuss in depth the most recent evidence of nuclear medicine and other techniques used to determine the status of the sentinel lymph node in women affected by gynecologic neoplasms. Although significant efforts have been already done in order to address several issues, there are still determined questions without a clear answer, in particular for endometrial, ovarian, and vaginal neoplasms.

TI  - The forest transformation: Planted tree cover and regional dynamics of tree gains and losses
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensions of forest-transition theory to the tropics often depict sustained expansions of planted tree cover and corresponding long-term net gains in total tree cover. To explore the patterns and implications of continued tropical planted tree-cover expansion, we profiled sequences of tree-cover change over 1990-2010 according to Landsat imagery for recently observed (ca. 2014) planted tree-cover areas in 11 tropical countries. Alternative patterns of change emerged from these analyses. Termed the 'reforestation treadmill' and 'forest transformation' narratives, planted tree-cover change featured relatively ephemeral planted covers, modest net gains, and similar tree-cover change dynamics compared to nearby agricultural-forest mosaics. Planted areas were characterised not by unambiguous reforestation but rather combinations of tree-cover losses and gains, with losses typically being more prominent. Contemporary gains and losses during 5-10-year periods regularly distinguished planted areas from non-planted areas, with losses being 1.5-2.3 times more common than gains. Planted areas were only moderately distinguishable from non-planted areas overall with respect to tree-cover change dynamics. Relationships between tree-cover change and the export orientations of planted tree/tree-crop commodities were also examined. Greater export orientations did not significantly associate with tree-cover loss or larger planted patches, with partial exceptions for Southeast Asia. Regional disparities in planted tree-cover dynamics were apparent. In Southeast Asia, dominated by Indonesia, tree-cover declines in planted areas since 1990 were relatively pronounced (20% of planted areas), particularly with respect to progressive transitions from tree cover to cleared lands. Planted areas there were generally indistinguishable from nearby non-planted areas with respect to historical tree-cover change dynamics. In contrast, in South America, dominated by Brazil, tree-cover increases in planted areas since 1990 were more appreciable (at least 14% of planted areas), with most being progressive, stable, 'net' increases (10% of planted areas) and the remainder being dynamic increases entailing short-term losses since 1990 (4% of planted areas). Total tree-cover increases within South American planted areas were equal to or greater than total decreases since 1990. These patterns suggest a forest-transformation narrative in which major planted-area expansion occurs alongside minor net tree-cover change. This narrative appears particularly well suited to Southeast Asia, where planted areas are extensive and expansive but where net tree cover gains are tenuous, reflecting political-economic shifts in forest management and the devaluation of extensive, degraded natural forests.

TI  - Biophysical Submesoscale Processes in the Wake of Hurricane Ivan: Simulations and Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclone induced phytoplankton productivity is examined using a tropical cyclone version of the Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS (R)). A four-component Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Detritus biological model is integrated into COAMPS to create a fully integrated air-ocean-wave-biology model. This study investigates the upper ocean physical and biological states before and after Hurricane Ivan traversed the central Gulf of Mexico, in mid-September 2004. Elevated concentrations of surface chlorophyll-a appear in the simulation two days after the passage of the tropical cyclone, and these results are spatially and temporally coherent with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data for this time period. Model results reveal enhancement of chlorophyll-a in submesoscale filaments on the periphery of a warm-core eddy that are dominated by large values of lateral strain and relative vorticity at the surface. The vertical circulation of the filament, with its associated upward vertical motion, permits surface ventilation of cold, nitrogen-rich water and subsequent stimulation of primary biological production. Here, we show for the first time that coupled biological-physical submesoscale processes may be simulated via a fully integrated air-sea-wave-biology tropical cyclone model that provides a mechanistic explanation of the conspicuous features revealed in satellite ocean color imagery following Ivan.

TI  - A methodology based on GEOBIA and WorldView-3 imagery to derive vegetation indices at tree crown detail in olive orchards
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) is becoming an essential practice for the Implementation of sustainable agriculture that encompasses the efficient use of resources and a systematic crops monitoring. The increasing temporal and spatial resolution of satellite imagery, coupled with their availability and decreasing costs, create new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on different crops variables, more frequently available as ready-to-use data. The availability of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, such as the WorldView-3 (WV-3), leads to the advanced potential of satellite Remote Sensing (RS), becoming in the last decade one of the main data source in precision agriculture (PA). In the broad overview of these procedures, geographic object-based image classification (GEOBIA) techniques, gained broad interest as methods to produce geographic information in GIS-ready format. In this paper, methodologies for a semiautomatic process workflow is presented, providing olive tree crown detection in two different olive orchards in Calabria (Italy), collected by means of GEOBIA procedures, in order to investigate olive tree spectral behavior and the reliability of WW-3 derived vegetation indices (VIs). The semi-automated classification method, accomplished by imagery pre-processing steps, may constitute an operational processing chain for mapping and monitoring olive orchards at tree scale detail. Five VIs were investigated: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index 2 (MSAVI 2), Normalized Difference Red Edge Vegetation Index (NDRE), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index Improved (MCARI2), and NDVI2. The obtained results were statistically tested and their accuracy assessed. Thematic accuracy ranges from 95.33% to 96% in both study areas with an overall tree detection rate of 96.8%. Statistical analysis showed that the major differences in spectral behavior, over different plots of the investigated olive orchards, are mainly due to the component of the red-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM), where the red-edge becomes important in assessing the state of general vigor. Moreover, the proposed methodology increases the possibility of detecting tree stress at earlier stages and the benefits of using satellite-based approaches in terms of: larger area coverage, less processing and operator interaction coupled with more spectral information, thus reducing the need to collect costly reference data sampling.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Abandonment in Mountainous Areas Using an Annual Land-Use Trajectory Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the unceasing acceleration of China's urbanization and rapid development of the country's economy, cropland abandonment has become an ongoing issue, especially in mountainous areas. Mapping abandoned cropland using remote sensing technology is still challenging due to the difficulties in distinguishing abandoned cropland from fallowed land. In addition, there are few credible approaches to map timing and recultivation of abandoned cropland. In this context, this research developed an annual land-use trajectory approach to map different types of abandoned cropland based on freely available Landsat and HJ-1 satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Based on this method, five types of cropland change, including one type of fallowed land and two types of abandoned land, were identified in a mountainous town of China (Zhongduo). In addition, the timing and recultivation of abandoned cropland were assessed. The accuracy of the abandonment map was assessed as high as 86.67%. It was found that the percentages of spontaneous abandoned, induced abandoned, fallowed, stable, and lost cropland in Zhongduo were 23.16%, 8.40%, 13.69%, 27.84%, and 26.91% from 2012 to 2017, respectively. The average time for spontaneously abandoned cropland was 3.45 years. Furthermore, 50.54% of the spontaneously abandoned cropland and 12.91% of induced abandoned cropland were recultivated due to fluctuating prices of agricultural products and materials, and the implemented land transfer policy.

TI  - Investigation of potential source regions of atmospheric Black Carbon in the data deficit region of the western Himalayas and its foothills
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, BC was measured at three western Himalayan sites (Site-A approximate to 650 m, Site-B approximate to 2050m and Site-C approximate to 2600 m a.s.l.) during summer and winter seasons of 2014-2016. The objective of this study is to investigate the variability of BC as a function of meteorological conditions and identify potential combustion sources (biomass vs fossil fuel). Furthermore, boundary layer (ABL) height and wind patterns, MODIS fire maps and Concentrated Weightage Trajectory (CWT) analysis were utilized to study potential BC source regions. The average BC concentration at Site-A, B and C were observed to be 4.98 +/- 2.79, 4.57 +/- 3.54 and 3.01 +/- 2.95 mu gm(-3), respectively. At Site-B, daytime BC was observed to be higher than nighttime, indicating that ABL development and consequent upward transport of pollution from IGP contributed to high BC concentrations in lesser Himalayas. Nevertheless, variable fraction of BC attributable to biomass vs fossil fuel at three stations indicates the effect of transport from IGP overlapped with the effect of mixing with different combustion sources, including local biomass burning practices which modulated BC levels especially at a high-altitude site in winter. On the basis of CWT analysis and MODIS fire counts, emissions from agriculture residue burning in northwestern-IGP impacted the BC aerosols at all monitoring locations, although, based on our in-situ aethalometer measurements, biomass burning fraction of BC remained below 25-30% at Site-A and B. Episodic westerly long-range transport events (from Middle-East, Europe and Central-Asia) can contribute to background BC concentrations especially in wintertime which were, however, in range of sub-mu gm(-3) levels based on our observations at Site-C.

TI  - Spatial Patterns of Chemical Weathering at the Basal Tertiary Nonconformity in California from Multispectral and Hyperspectral Optical Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible through shortwave (VSWIR) spectral reflectance of the geologic units across the basal Tertiary nonconformity (BTN) is characterized at three spatially disparate locations in California. At two of these sites, location-specific spectral endmembers are obtained from AVIRIS imaging spectroscopy and linear spectral mixture models are used to visualize spatial patterns in chemical weathering associated with the BTN. Weathering patterns are found to match well with traditional geologic maps of the BTN at each site, but results show more spatially detailed quantitative geologic information about the spatial variability of chemical weathering near the nonconformity than is possible in a traditional geologic map. Spectral endmembers and unmixing results are also compared across locations. At the two locations with AVIRIS coverage, strong absorptions centered near 2200 nm are observed, consistent with previous geologic publications reporting intense chemical weathering at the BTN. Information loss associated with multispectral sampling of the reflectance continuum is also examined by resampling endmembers from the Maniobra location to mimic the spectral response functions of the WorldView 3, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors. Simulated WorldView 3 data most closely approximate the full information content of the AVIRIS observations, resulting in nearly unbiased unmixing results for both endmembers. Mean fraction differences are -0.02 and +0.03 for weathered and unweathered endmembers, respectively. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 are unable to distinguish narrow, deep SWIR absorptions from changes in the overall amplitude of the SWIR spectral continuum, resulting in information loss and biased unmixing results. Finally, we characterize a third location using Sentinel-2 observations only. At this site we also find spectrally distinct features associated with several lithologies, providing new information relevant to the mapping of geologic contacts which is neither present in high spatial resolution visible imagery, nor in published geologic mapping. Despite these limitations, the spatial pattern of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 fraction estimates is sufficiently similar to that of the WorldView 3 and AVIRIS fraction estimates to be useful for mapping purposes in cases where hyperspectral data are unavailable.

TI  - What temporal resolution is required for remote sensing of regional aerosol concentrations using the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have directly addressed the question of what temporal resolution is required for air quality studies using geostationary remote sensing data. If timescales are too large, there is a risk that events affecting air quality may be missed; and if too small, there is a possibility that large data files may be processed frequently, at significant computing cost and potentially without concomitant improvements in the monitoring of air quality. The problem is particularly significant in sparsely populated regional areas such as the Pilbara in Western Australia, where air quality issues arising from a range of events, dispersed over a vast area, increase the risk of environmental health and ecosystems impacts and where the use of conventional monitoring is impractical. This study aimed to establish an optimum temporal sampling interval for air quality studies using geostationary data and determine the impact of different timescales on ground level concentrations. The study was based on an analysis of Himawari-8 satellite data relating to a dust storm within a roll cloud which occurred near Onslow in Western Australia on 8 March 2017. Data from the Himawari-8 satellite were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology relating to the event and were used to: (1) assess the probability of a satellite overpass coinciding with the event; (2) determine scale factors of different time periods during the event; and (3) undertake an analysis of event duration using remote sensing data. The analysis identified numerous sub-phases of the dust event, each lasting between 30 and 50 min. Data analysis considered all thermal infrared bands and Taylor plot analysis reduced the ten wavelength bands to six independent bands. Principal component analysis of brightness temperature difference between these six bands identified the rate of aerosol compositional change and established that an optimal geostationary sampling frequency of five to 10 min would be required to quantify these temporal changes effectively.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma - Current Controversies and Future Directions
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine skin malignancy. Evidence for management comes from case series and single-arm trials. Optimal outcomes require assessment of the patient in a multidisciplinary team setting. Rapid diagnosis and staging are essential for locoregional control and may reduce metastasis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) adds prognostic information. FDG-positron emission tomography has high sensitivity and specificity and affects management in a quarter of cases. Surgical excision and radiotherapy provide good locoregional control even with positive margins. Wide surgical margins are needed if adjuvant radiotherapy is not used. It is uncertain whether adjuvant radiotherapy or elective surgery for uninvolved nodes or for patients selected by positive SLNB improves survival. Total doses of 50 Gy provide high levels of control for microscopic disease but at least 60 Gy should be given for macroscopic disease. Chemotherapy can be given safely with radiotherapy, but the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy remains uncertain. Trials of adjuvant immune therapy are underway. Unresectable primaries might be controlled with radiotherapy alone or combination systemic therapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Metastatic disease often responds to chemotherapy, but the response duration can be short. Immunity is central to disease control. Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment resulted in high response rates in chemotherapy-naive patients and lower rates in chemotherapy-refractory patients. Durable responses are observed.

TI  - <i>The Discarded Image</i> and the Debunked <i>Tao</i>: Objective Value in CS Lewis' Medieval Model and His Critique of Modernity
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers C.S. Lewis' "doctrine of objective value" in two of his major works, The Abolition of Man and The Discarded Image. Lewis uses the Chinese name Tao, albeit with an incomplete understanding of its origins, for the objective worldview. The paper argues that Tao, as an explicit theme of The Abolition of Man, is also a determining undercurrent in The Discarded Image. In the former work, Tao is what Lewis wants to defend and restore against twentieth-century secular ideologies, which Lewis condemns as infected with "the poison of subjectivism". In the latter work, where Lewis presents one of the best accounts of the European medieval model of the Universe, objective value (the Tao in Lewis' argument) underlies both how the model has been shaped, and how Lewis, as a medievalist, accounts for and draws upon it as an intellectual and spiritual resource. The purpose of this parallel study is to show that Lewis' explication of the Tao in The Abolition of Man, which is a "built-in", implicit belief in The Discarded Image, provides a critique of tendencies towards the subjectivism prevalent in Lewis' lifetime. These tendencies can be traced into the moral relativism, pluralism and reductionism of the twenty-first century, giving Lewis' work the status of twentieth-century prophecy.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The processing tool TREX, standing for 'Tool for Raster data EXploration' is presented and evaluated in the Biebrza wetlands in northeastern Poland. TREX was designed for the automatization of processing satellite data from the Proba-V satellite into maps of NDVI or LAI in any defined by the user projection, spatial resolution, or extent. The open source and access concept of TREX encourages the potential community of users to collaborate, develop, and integrate the tool with other satellite imagery and models. TREX reprojects, shifts, and resamples original data obtained from the Proba-V satellite to deliver reliable maps of NDVI and LAI. Validation of TREX in Biebrza wetlands resulted in correlations between 0.79 and 0.92 for NDVI data (measured with ASD Field Spec 4) and 0.92 for LAI data (measured with LiCOR-LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer).

TI  - Efficacy of diurnal BG-Sentinel traps to capture nocturnal adult <i>Armigeres subalbatus</i> mosquitoes and impact of altitudinal variations in forests
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To establish an efficacious and efficient surveillance method of Armigeres (Ar.) subalbatus, a known filarial vector, surviving in forest habitats to estimate realistic population density and assess the impact of altitudinal variations on the efficacy of the trap.Methods: In the study, 12 locations in areas with an altitudinal range from 82 m to 920 m were selected in three reserve forests for night sampling of adult Ar. subalbatus mosquito using standard chemical lure based BG-Sentinel traps and CDC-light traps in pairs. Effects of locations and time were estimated on the efficacy of traps as mosquito density using multifactor analysis of variance for significant differences. Impact of altitudinal variations on the efficacy of traps was assessed using multiple regression with slope comparison.Results: BG-Sentinel trap collected significantly more adult Ar. subalbatus, 4.43 folds in Gorumara NP, 5.19 folds in Neora Valley NP and 12.10 folds in Mahananda WLS than the CDC-light trap irrespective to locations. BG-Sentinel traps were tolerant of altitudinal variations (80 m - 170 m) and showed no significant relationship between density and altitudes in contrast to CDC-light traps which showed a significant negative impact on capturing efficacy with increase in altitudes (P<0.001).Conclusions: The study suggests that BG-Sentinel traps can be used effectively and efficiently to collect more Ar. subalbatus mosquitoes during night time in comparison to CDC-light trap under complex climatic conditions of forest and variable altitudes.

TI  - Mapping tropical dry forest age using airborne waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forest (TDF) regeneration has been extensively characterized as three deterministic successional stages, i.e., early, intermediate, and late, for the past few decades. This deterministic definition, however, ignores many biophysical and biochemical processes in the forest regeneration. This study mapped a second TDF as a function of regeneration age at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP) Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Costa Rica, using an airborne full-waveform LiDAR (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor or LVIS), a hyperspectral dataset (Hyperspectral MAPper or HyMap) and three advanced machine learning methods. We defined five age groups (0-10 years, 10-20 years, 20-30 years, 30-50 years, 50 + years) based on historical forest cover maps, and analyzed their effective LiDAR waveforms and cumulative return energy curves (derived from LVIS) and their reflectance (derived from the HyMap). Then, nine LVIS metrics and eleven HyMap indices were calculated and their abilities to differentiate the age groups were evaluated using Multiple Comparison Analysis (MCA). We found that six of the LVIS metrics which describe the vertical structure of the forests can significantly differentiate all age groups. None of HyMap metrics can differentiate all age groups, but some of them can identify certain age groups. Selected LVIS metrics and HyMap indices were used to map TDF age, through Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest (RF). We found LVIS plus HyMap metrics generally produced more accurate forest age maps than either LVIS metrics or HyMap indices and RF better performed than other two classifiers. We finally proposed a method to synthesize different forest age maps into one age map which had the highest accuracy for all age groups. Our study highlighted the importance to consider the forest regeneration as a continuous stochastic phenomenon, and also highlighted the advantages to incorporate multiple remote sensing techniques to describe the forest regeneration. Our method to synthesize the forest age map can also benefit other researchers who need to take advantage of multiple mapping results.

TI  - Convective Initiation Nowcasting Over China From Fengyun-4A Measurements Based on TV-L<sub>1</sub> Optical Flow and BP_Adaboost Neural Network Algorithms
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convective initiation (CI) nowcasting over China has a problem of a high false-alarm rate (FAR) due to the local convective processes, most of which do not produce severe weather. In order to focus on those CIs with severe weather, a new 0-2 h CI nowcasting system is developed in this article, named rapidly developed convection monitoring system (RDCMS), using the data from the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager onboard China Fengyun-4A(FY-4A) satellite. The RDCMS is not only used to identify CIs at the early stage, but also to prevent the relative high FAR. The key solutions of RDCMS are to introduce the total variation L-1 norm (TV-L-1) optical flow method for more tracking efficiency, and to use a supervised learning method named BP_Adaboost neural network for severe convection checking. Case studies show that the RDCMS' skills have been improved as expected in four regions of China, which are Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the East China, Northeast China, and South China. In the southern China region, the CI lead time is 17-40 min, and the best probability of detection is as high as 0.80, with the FAR lower than 0.34.

TI  - The Effect of NDVI Time Series Density Derived from Spatiotemporal Fusion of Multisource Remote Sensing Data on Crop Classification Accuracy
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolutions can help to improve the accuracy of the estimation of crop planting acreage, and contribute to the formulation and management of agricultural policies. Therefore, it is important to determine whether multisource sensors can obtain high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data for the target sensor with the help of the spatiotemporal fusion method. In this study, we employed three different sensor datasets to obtain one normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series dataset with a 5.8-m spatial resolution using a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). We studied the effectiveness of using multisource remote sensing data to extract crop classifications and analyzed whether the increase in the NDVI time series density could significantly improve the accuracy of the crop classification. The results indicated that multisource sensor data could be used for crop classification after spatiotemporal fusion and that the data source was not limited by the sensor platform. With the increase in the number of NDVI phases, the classification accuracy of the support vector machine (SVM) and the random forest (RF) classifier gradually improved. If the added NDVI phases were not in the optimal time period for wheat recognition, the classification accuracy was not greatly improved. Under the same conditions, the classification accuracy of the RF classifier was higher than that of the SVM. In addition, this study can serve as a good reference for the selection of the optimal time range for base image pairs in the spatiotemporal fusion method for high accuracy mapping of crops, and help avoid excessive data collection and processing.

TI  - Characterizing Tree Species of a Tropical Wetland in Southern China at the Individual Tree Level Based on Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of species at the individual tree level would be beneficial to many applications including forest landscape visualization, forest management, and biodiversity monitoring. This article develops a patch-based classification algorithm of individual tree species based on convolutional neural network. The individual trees are first detected using the local maximum method from the canopy height model, as derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The detected individual trees are then cropped into patches for classification based on the tree apexes, and three spatial scale image patches are chosen for analysis and discussion. A modified ResNet50 deep network is further employed for the cropped individual tree patches classification. The patch-based method accounts for the contexture information of a tree and does not require the feature selection or the feature reduction processes. About 1388 training samples including Ficus microcarpa Linn. f., Delonix regia, Chorisia speciosa A.St.-Hil., Dimocarpus longan Lour., Musa nana Lour., Carica papaya, and Others (the other tree species except the above six) were collected from both field work and visual interpretation. Aerial images, LiDAR data, and Worldview images were used for the tree species classification. For 362 test tree samples, the results of patch size 64 achieve the best accuracies, and the proposed method outperforms the traditional machine learning method with the overall accuracy of 89.06 0.58 using aerial images only. Transferability Study to the Luhu Park also indicated the feasibility of our method. While challenges in individual tree detection and multisource data fusion remain, the solution shows the potential in characterizing tree species at the individual tree level using remote sensing data.

TI  - ScanSAR Interferometry of the Gaofen-3 Satellite with Unsynchronized Repeat-Pass Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 is a Chinese remote sensing satellite with multiple working modes, among which the scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) mode is used for wide-swath imaging. synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry in the ScanSAR mode provides the most rapid way to obtain a global digital elevation model (DEM), which can also be realized by Gaofen-3. Gaofen-3 ScanSAR interferometry works in the repeat-pass mode, and image pair non-synchronizations can influence its performance. Non-synchronizations can include differences of burst central times, satellite velocities, and burst durations. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze their influences and improve the interferometric coherence. Meanwhile, interferometric phase compensation and rapid DEM geolocation also need to be considered in interferometric processing. In this paper, interferometric coherence was analyzed in detail, followed by an iterative filtering method, which helped to improve the interferometric performance. Further, a phase compensation method for Gaofen-3 was proposed to compensate for the phase error caused by the unsynchronized azimuth time offset of image pair, and a closed-form solution of DEM geolocation with ground control point (GCP) information was derived. Application of our methods to a pair of Gaofen-3 interferometric images showed that these methods were able to process the images with good accuracy and efficiency. Notably, these analysis and processing methods can also be applied to other SAR satellites in the ScanSAR mode to obtain DEMs with high quality.

TI  - Thermal environment characteristic and cooling effect of greenery in Beijing First Green Belt area
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the thermal environment characteristics of Beijing First Green Belt (BFGB) area, which is defined as the sub-districts intersected with the belt, and identified the cooling effect of greenery. Land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved and greenery land cover was interpreted by Landsat 8 image data in 2015, and thermal environment characteristics and cooling effect of greenery were analyzed by GIS spatial analysis, moving window landscape pattern indices, and statistical analysis methods. Heat island intensity in the study area showed a pattern of "south high and north low" and "east high and west low". BFGB inner zone had higher proportion of strong heat island area than the outer zone, suggesting that governance in the belt was not sufficient to effectively regulate the thermal environment. At sub-district level, 55.74% of sub-districts had net contribution to strong heat island. Greenery ratio was negatively correlated with the proportion of heat island area and positively correlated with the proportion of cool island area, suggesting that high greenery ratio in sub-districts could effectively mitigate heat island. At grid sampling point level, sampling points with net contribution to strong heat island accounted for 51.69%. Buffer zone with a 500 m radius was generated by every sampling point. The regression model showed that the impact radius of greenery on mitigating heat island effect was between 150-200 m, and that 1% enhancement of greenery within 50-100 m and 100-150 m circles can result in 0.023 and 0.013 degrees C decrease of LST. From the greenery spatial pattern, the larger the patch area, the simpler the shape, the more aggregated the spatial distribution, the stronger the cooling effect is; while the higher the patch density, the more complex the shape, the more dispersed the spatial distribution, the weaker the cooling effect is.

TI  - Effectiveness of sentinel lymph node scintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probing with gold standard elective neck dissection in patients with N0 oral squamous cell cancers
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Oral cancer ranks in the top three of all cancers in India, accounting for over 30% of all cancers reported. Elective neck dissection (END) is the mainstay of treatment in early disease. Performing ENDs for node negative (N0) patients can result in significant morbidity with questionable benefit and impair the patients' quality of life. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB), is an emerging investigation helping in risk stratification of patients with early oral cancer and node negative disease. SLNB is a simple, easy to perform investigation with a high sensitivity and plays a major role in avoiding neck dissection. Studies have compared SLNB-based neck dissection with END in early oral cancers, and also on survival benefit with prophylactic neck dissection at the time of primary surgery as compared to watchful waiting followed by therapeutic neck dissection for nodal relapse, in patients with clinical N0 (cN0) oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) on literature search. Aim Our primary aim was to determine the effectiveness of lymphoscintigraphy in OSCC in clinically neck node negative (cN0) patients in comparison to gold standard END for nodal metastases identification and secondly to assess the utility of gamma probe in guiding SLNB in this group of patients. Materials and Methods Fifty-eight patients (M:F = 42:16) with histologically confirmed OSCC of T1-3 stage with cN0 and planned for curative intent primary surgical treatment were divided into two arms. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging and biopsy. Arm 1 underwent nodal dissection based on SLNB positivity, while all patients in arm 2 had wide neck dissection irrespective of SLNB findings. Results SLN was detected in all 58 patients, 96.4% patients showed SLN immediately postinjection. More than one SLN was found in 94.3% patients and 6.8% patients showed contralateral SLN also. Higher proportion of nodal metastasis were observed in tongue cancers than in remaining floor of mouth and buccal mucosa cancers (38% vs 12%, P< 0.01). We also found significant association between T size and nodal metastasis in our series. Sensitivity of SLNB was 88.23% with a specificity of 100%, both for SLN imaging and gamma probing localization reflecting the reliability of this technique. Serial step sectioning at 150 micrometre is recommended. SLNB showed positive nodes in 29.3 % patients with cN0 neck. We found that the association between the outcome in both arms was not statistically significant. On follow-up, three patients with T3N0 OSCC of arm 2 had nodal recurrence/lung metastases. One patient of arm 1 had nodal recurrence. Two patients expired within one year. As high as 73% patients (22 negative necks out of 30) had unwarranted neck dissection in arm 2. Conclusion SLNB is an effective method to circumvent unwarranted neck dissection in early OSCC and prevent complications. Gamma probing is a robust and easy tool to identify SLN in T1-3 stages with N0 necks clinically. A positive SLNB is found to be reliable in guiding neck dissection in this small study. Larger studies are warranted to establish its recommendation in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Interaction Among Influenza Viruses A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B in Japan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal influenza epidemics occur each winter season in temperate zones, involving up to 650,000 deaths each year globally. A published study demonstrated that the circulation of one influenza virus type during early influenza season in the United States interferes with the activity of other influenza virus types. However, this finding has yet to be validated in other settings. In the present work, we investigated the interaction among seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) in Japan. Sentinel and virus surveillance data were used to estimate the type-specific incidence from 2010 to 2019, and statistical correlations among the type-specific incidence were investigated. We identified significant negative correlations between incidence of the dominant virus and the complementary incidence. When correlation was identified during the course of an epidemic, a linear regression model accurately predicted the epidemic size of a particular virus type before the epidemic peak. The peak of influenza type B took place later in the season than that of influenza A, although the epidemic peaks of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 nearly coincided. Given the interaction among different influenza viruses, underlying mechanisms including age and spatial dependence should be explored in future.

TI  - Flood hazard assessment and the role of citizen science
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood hazard assessment is at the core of flood risk management. In order to develop an efficient flood hazard assessment, it is of primary importance to have a well-defined flood scenario encompassing all processes that could occur during an event. Understanding and assessing these processes requires meteorological, topographical and land-use data as well as historical observations. Nowadays, flood delineation is based upon hydrological and hydraulic modelling, ground data collection, and remote sensing. Despite the advantages of these tools, they also present some specific limitations, either intrinsic to the approaches or linked with constraints of the local context. With the rapid advancement of web 2.0 technologies (e.g., Flickr and Wikimapia) and the increase of the use of participatory research, citizen science has the potential to provide valuable and complementary information at all levels of flood risk management and in particular for flood hazard assessment. After reviewing the capabilities and limitations of the current tools used in flood hazard assessment, this paper demonstrates the role that citizen science can play in providing key information on factors leading to flooding and on flood hazard parameters.

TI  - Remotely assessing above-ground fresh biomass weight of wheat based on the combinations of pair vegetation indexes from HJ-CCD images
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the reliability of remote sensing assessment model of above-ground fresh biomass weight (AFBW) in wheat, we investigated the relationships of AFBW at different critical stages with their corresponding vegetation indexes obtained from HJ-CCD images, established and evaluated new AFBW models based on paired vegetation indexes. The results showed that combination of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), namely N(NDVI, SIPI), could be used to accurately assess AFBW at jointing stage with R-2 and RMSE of 0.84 and 379.14 kg ha(-1), respectively, and more feasible than the single vegetation index model with accuracy increased by 10.95%. Moreover, the ratio combination of NDVI and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), namely R(NDVI, GNDVI), could be used to accurately assess AFBW at booting stage with R-2 of 0.87 and RMSE of 987.64 kg ha(-1) and accuracy increased by 12.56%. The difference combination of NDVI and nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), namely D(NDVI, NRI), could be used to accurately assess AFBW at anthesis with R-2 of 0.86 and RMSE of 1786.37 kg ha(-1) and accuracy increased by 13.37%. In totally, N(NDVI, SIPI), R(NDVI, GNDVI) and D(NDVI, NRI) are potential indicators of AFBW at different stages and can be applied as a new method for more accurate assessment of wheat growth.

TI  - Synthetic aperture radar sensitivity to forest changes: A simulations-based study for the Romanian forests
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic disturbances pose a significant threat to forest condition. Continuous, reliable and accurate forest monitoring systems are needed to provide early warning of potential declines in forest condition. To address that need, state-of-the-art simulations models were used to evaluate the utility of C-, L- and P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors within an integrated Earth-Observation monitoring system for beech, oak and coniferous forests in Romania.The electromagnetic simulations showed differentiated sensitivity to vegetation water content, leaf area index, and forest disturbance depending on SAR wavelength and forest structure. C-band data was largely influenced by foliage volume and therefore may be useful for monitoring defoliation. Changes in water content modulated the C-band signal by <1 dB which may be insufficient for a meaningful retrieval of drought effects on forest. C-band sensitivity to significant clear-cuts was rather low (1.5 dB). More subtle effects such as selective logging or thinning may not be easily detected using C- or L-band data with the longer P-band needed for retrieving small intensity forest disturbances. Overall, the simulations emphasize that additional effort is needed to overcome current limitations arising from the use of a single frequency, acquisition time and geometry by tapping the advantages of dense time series, and by combining acquisitions from active and passive sensors.The simulation results may be applicable to forests outside of Romania since the forests types used in the study have similar morphological characteristics to forests elsewhere in Europe.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the key principle of precision farming, variation of actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) within the field serves as the basis for crop management. Although the estimation of evapotranspiration has achieved great progress through the combination of different remote sensing data and the FAO-56 crop coefficient (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water stress coefficient (Ks) at different space-time scales still hinder its operational application to farmer practices. This work aims to explore the potential of multispectral images taken from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating the temporal and spatial variability of Ks under the water stress condition and mapping the variability of field maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model. To search for an optimal estimation method, the performance of several models was compared including models based on Ks either derived from the crop water stress index (CWSI) or calculated by the canopy temperature ratio (T-c ratio), and combined with the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Compared with the Ks derived from the T-c ratio, the CWSI-based Ks responded well to water stress and had strong applicability and convenience. The results of the comparison show that ET derived from the Ks-CWSI had a higher correlation with the modified FAO-56 method, with an R-2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived from the Ks-T-c ratio had a relatively lower correlation with an R-2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 1.25 mm/d. To obtain the evapotranspiration status of the whole maize field and formulate reasonable irrigation schedules, the CWSI obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer was inverted by the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI) and the transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI). Then, the whole map of Ks can be derived from the VIs by the relationship between CWSI and Ks and can be taken as the basic input for ET estimation at the field scale. The final ET results based on multispectral UAV interpolation measurements can well reflect the crop ET status under different irrigation levels, and greatly help to improve irrigation scheduling through more precise management of deficit irrigation.

TI  - Quantifying water storage change and land subsidence induced by reservoir impoundment using GRACE, Landsat, and GPS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of hydropower dams is a common strategy to support a country's increasing need for electricity and river water management for industry and agriculture. Although the hydrological and geophysical impacts of water relocation are usually assessed prior to impoundment, their accuracy is generally limited due to the lack of in situ observations, especially in a remote area. This study presents a workflow to quantify the terrestrial water storage change ( TWS) and land subsidence induced by a reservoir's water impoundment using multiple satellite observations (GRACE, Landsat), land surface models (CABLE, GLDAS, NCEP, ECMWF), and GPS data. The study site is the Bakun Dam, located in Sarawak, Malaysia, which is the largest hydropower dam in Southeast Asia. Commencing operation in late 2010, the dam induced a change of water mass and lake surface area that was clearly observed by GRACE and Landsat observations, respectively. During the 17-month impounding period (from August 2010 to December 2011), GRACE observed a dramatic increase of approximately 200 mm equivalent water height, while Landsat detected an increased lake extent of around 600 km(2). In this paper, a forward model is developed to determine the increased water surface level corresponding to GRACE observations, estimated to be about 120 m. In contrast to GRACE, the TWS derived from land surface models cannot capture the increased TWS, due to the lack of reservoir routing algorithms in the models. In addition, the land subsidence was calculated using the disk load model constructed based on the GRACE-derived lake level and Landsat-derived lake extent; the result is validated with the GPS data from BIN1 station, located at the western coast of Borneo. The commencement stage of the Bakun Dam induces the large-scale land subsidence, which causes the GPS-BIN1 station to subside by similar to 9 mm, and move toward the Bakun Lake by similar to 4 mm. Computation of the surface displacements directly from GRACE spherical harmonic coefficient data fails to capture the subsidence feature, mainly due to the truncation error. Overall, this study demonstrates that evaluating GRACE in conjunction with Landsat, LSMs, and GPS data allows the exploitation of the gravity signal at a much smaller spatial scale than its intrinsic resolution. Benefiting from global coverage, the newly developed satellite-based algorithm is a valuable tool for assessing the impacts of reservoir operation on hydrological and geophysical changes from local to regional scales.

TI  - Land use/land cover change evaluation using land change modeller: A comparative analysis between two main cities in Sierra Leone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the proven capability of remotely sensed data in the extraction and analysis of land use land cover (LULC) change, Landsat ETM+ and OLI imagery of 2000 and 2015 have been used in this research to carry out the LULC change comparative analysis in Bo and Freetown, two major urban areas in Sierra Leone, Africa. The supervised imagery classification with maximum likelihood algorithm method was adopted for the extraction of LULC categories. To demonstrate our idea effectively, we used the land change modeller integrated into IDRISI Selva software package to quantify and map the changes of each LULC category. Employing an error matrix table and estimator of Kappa statistics (Khat), we achieved overall accuracy and Khat greater than 80% for both cities and class level accuracies were also achieved as greater than 70%. The LULC change statistics show dynamic characteristics of LULC in the areas where maximum fluctuation was observed in dense vegetation category in Bo and agricultural land in Freetown. The built-up area shows a continuous increasing trend in both cities. Results of our analysis demonstrated that dense vegetation increased by 1024 ha (ha) in Bo whereas it reduced by 3807 ha (ha) in Freetown between 2000 and 2015 study years. Likewise, agricultural land increased by 545 ha (ha) in Bo and decreased by 9145 ha (ha) in Freetown during the same period. It is worth noting that the built-up area increased in both cities as 1326 ha (ha) and 8543 ha (ha) were recorded in Bo and Freetown, respectively. The spatial trend of LULC transition reveals that most of the transition has been occurring in the central part of Bo; whereas the transition occurs in the northern and southern parts in Freetown. However, both cities witness transition at the southern part with regards to dense vegetation category. These findings could assist in making policies for the efficient use of natural resources leading to the development of sustainable urban environments.

TI  - Landslide Detection Using Multi-Scale Image Segmentation and Different Machine Learning Models in the Higher Himalayas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides represent a severe hazard in many areas of the world. Accurate landslide maps are needed to document the occurrence and extent of landslides and to investigate their distribution, types, and the pattern of slope failures. Landslide maps are also crucial for determining landslide susceptibility and risk. Satellite data have been widely used for such investigations-next to data from airborne or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne campaigns and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). We have developed a methodology that incorporates object-based image analysis (OBIA) with three machine learning (ML) methods, namely, the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and random forest (RF), for landslide detection. We identified the optimal scale parameters (SP) and used them for multi-scale segmentation and further analysis. We evaluated the resulting objects using the object pureness index (OPI), object matching index (OMI), and object fitness index (OFI) measures. We then applied two different methods to optimize the landslide detection task: (a) an ensemble method of stacking that combines the different ML methods for improving the performance, and (b) Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), to combine the multi-scale segmentation and classification results. Through the combination of three ML methods and the multi-scale approach, the framework enhanced landslide detection when it was tested for detecting earthquake-triggered landslides in Rasuwa district, Nepal. PlanetScope optical satellite images and a DEM were used, along with the derived landslide conditioning factors. Different accuracy assessment measures were used to compare the results against a field-based landslide inventory. All ML methods yielded the highest overall accuracies ranging from 83.3% to 87.2% when using objects with the optimal SP compared to other SPs. However, applying DST to combine the multi-scale results of each ML method significantly increased the overall accuracies to almost 90%. Overall, the integration of OBIA with ML methods resulted in appropriate landslide detections, but using the optimal SP and ML method is crucial for success.

TI  - Impact of Land Use/Land Cover Change on Hydrological Components in Chongwe River Catchment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chongwe River Catchment, a sub-catchment of the Zambezi River Basin, has been experiencing changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and in its hydrology. This study aims to assess the impact of LULC changes on the catchment's hydrological components such as streamflow, evapotranspiration and water abstractions. LULC change data, detected from the 1984, 1994, 2014 and 2017 USGS Landsat imagery using a maximum likelihood supervised classifier, were integrated into the WEAP Model along with soil, slope and hydro-climate data. The results showed that between 1984 and 2017 built-up area increased by 382.77% at 6.97 km(2)/year, irrigated agriculture increased by 745.62% at 1.70 km(2)/year, rainfed farms/ranch/grassland increased by 14.67% at 14.53 km(2)/year, forest land decreased by 41.11% at 22.33 km(2)/year and waterbodies decreased by 73.95% at 0.87 km(2)/year. Streamflow increased at a rate of 0.13 Mm(3) per annum in the wet seasons and showed a high variation with flow volume of 79.68 Mm(3) in February and 1.01 Mm(3) in September. Annual actual evapotranspiration decreased from 840.6 mm to 796.3 mm while annual water abstraction increased from 8.94 mm to 23.2 mm from the year 1984 to 2017. The pattern of LULC change between 1984 and 2017 has negatively impacted the hydrology of the Chongwe River Catchment. From these findings, an integrated catchment management and protection approach is proposed to mitigate the negative impacts of LULC dynamics on hydrological components in the Chongwe River Catchment.

TI  - Surgery for Metastatic Melanoma: an Evolving Concept
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review This review describes the evolving role of surgery in stage III and IV melanoma. Recent Findings Surgery has been the first option to cure melanoma patients at initial diagnosis of metastatic spread: a complete surgical excision of the disease either in stage III or IV has been the gold standard for decades. A positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has been followed by a complete lymph node dissection (CLND) since the early stages of modern surgical oncology. However, since two randomized trials have indicated that a CLND does not improve survival in patients with a positive SNB, a CLND is no longer considered mandatory. A therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND) is still offered to patients with macroscopic nodal disease and in highly selected cases, patients with distant melanoma metastases can be treated surgically as well. Also the availability of adjuvant, and in the future possibly neoadjuvant, systemic therapy have shifted the landscape to less extensive surgery in metastatic melanoma. With the development of new systemic options, surgery in metastatic melanoma has become more and more part of a multidisciplinary treatment: surgical indications are moving from previous standards to a new role.

TI  - Urban Expansion Analysis using Landsat Images in Penang, Malaysia
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion mapping is important in urban planning, land use and water resources management. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the spatio-temporal trends of urban expansion in Penang using three Landsat satellite images taken in 2004, 2011 and 2018. Maximum Likelihood was used to classify the land uses into urban, agricultural, water, and forest. Comparison of the classified images with time-series Google Earth images and field data collection resulting an accuracy up to 90%. The results showed that urban have been expanded around 5% from 2004 to 2018. Major urban development is mainly found in the eastern part of Penang island. Meanwhile, major development in the Penang mainland can be found in the middle and western regions. Due to the limited development land on the Penang Island, a rapid urban expansion can be found in the south-western part of the Penang mainland that near to the second bridge. In order to maintain the city and community sustainability in Penang, government needs to plan on balanced socioeconomic growth for the near future.

TI  - Ship wake region detection by using multi-feature recombination and area-based morphological analysis in ATI-SAR systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - For moving ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, ship wakes on the sea surface may be detectable, thus leading to interferences in reconnaissance. To address this issue, a wake region detection approach by using multi-feature recombination and area-based morphological analysis is proposed with along-track interferogram-SAR systems. This approach aims to detect the near-ship wake region that is nearby a ship's hull and between two kelvin cusp lines. A novel test is constructed by recombining magnitude, phase, and the local variance of phase in the complex multi-look interferometric SAR image to detect the potential pixels of the ship wakes. Then, with a clustering algorithm based on the proposed test and the pixel spatial distance, the potential wake regions are acquired, and the real ones having sufficiently large areas can be accurately determined. Finally, experimental results on the TerraSAR-X dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - On-Orbit Measurement of the Effective Focal Length and Band-to-Band Registration of Satellite-Borne Whiskbroom Imaging Sensors
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed an approach for the measurement of the effective focal length (EFL) and band-to-band registration (BBR) of selected spectral bands of satellite-borne whiskbroom imaging sensors from on-orbit data. Our approach is based on simulating the coarser spatial resolution whiskbroom sensor data with finer spatial resolution Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus or Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data using the geolocation (Earth location) information from each sensor and computing the correlation between the simulated and original data. For each scan of a selected spectral band of the whiskbroom dataset, various subsets of the data are examined to find the subset with the highest spatial correlation between the original and simulated data using the nominal geolocation information. Then, for this best subset, the focal length value and the spatial shift are varied to find the values that produce the highest spatial correlation between the original and simulated data. This best focal length value is taken to be the measured instrument EFL, and the best spatial shift is taken to be the registration of the whiskbroom data relative to the Landsat data, from which the BBR is inferred. Best results are obtained with cloud-free subsets with contrasting land features. This measurement is repeated over other scans with cloud-free subsets. We demonstrate our approach with on-orbit data from the Aqua and Terra MODIS instruments and SNPP and J1 VIIRS instruments.

TI  - Assessment of two intense dust storm characteristics over Indo - Gangetic basin and their radiative impacts: A case study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is focused to examine the impacts of two intense dust storms on aerosol characteristics and their radiative impacts occurred in pre-monsoon season of 2018 (i.e. 17 May and 14 June 2018) over Kanpur (26.51 degrees N, 80.23 degrees E, 123 above nisi). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) true colour images, trajectory pathways of dust storm along with satellite observation and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements confirms that both the dust storms are either originated from or transported over the Thar Desert, causing a higher aerosol loading which spread over entire Indian-Gangetic Basin (IGB) and modifying the aerosol optical (i.e. aerosol optical depth, angstrom exponent, refractive index etc.), physical (i.e. size distribution) and radiative properties (i.e. single scattering albedo, asymmetric parameter). The space-borne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) - retrieved aerosol measurements reveal the presence of elevated dust/polluted dust aerosol (up to 3-5 km) over IGB which is well corroborated with aerosol characteristics observed by MODIS, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM8b) shows a good agreement with satellite retrievals with higher value of surface dust concentration in the range of 320-640 mu g/m(3) over Kanpur during the dust storm days. An enhancement in monthly mean outgoing longwave radiation (up to 60 Wm(-2)) is observed over IGB and downwind flow region during the dust storm days. The atmospheric aerosol radiative forcing is found 124 Wm(-2) and 84 Wm(-2) during both the dust storm days (17 May and 14 June 2018) associated with heating rate 2.69 K day(-1) and 1.84 K day(-1) respectively which may be significant to affect the regional atmospheric dynamics and hence the climate system also.

TI  - Cropland Classification Using Sentinel-1 Time Series: Methodological Performance and Prediction Uncertainty Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods based on Sentinel-1 data were developed to monitor crops and fields to facilitate the distribution of subsidies. The objectives were to (1) develop a methodology to predict individual crop species or or management regimes; (2) investigate the earliest time point in the growing season when the species predictions are satisfactory; and (3) to present a method to assess the uncertainty of the predictions at an individual field level. Seventeen Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes (VV and VH polarizations) acquired in interferometric wide swath mode from 14 May through to 30 August 2017 in the same geometry, and selected based on the weather conditions, were used in the study. The improved k nearest neighbour estimation, ik-NN, with a genetic algorithm feature optimization was tailored for classification with optional Sentinel-1 data sets, species groupings, and thresholds for the minimum parcel area. The number of species groups varied from 7 to as large as 41. Multinomial logistic regression was tested as an optional method. The Overall Accuracies (OA) varied depending on the number of species included in the classification, and whether all or not field parcels were included. OA with nine species groups was 72% when all parcels were included, 81% when the parcels area threshold (for incorporating parcels into classification) was 0.5 ha, and around 90% when the threshold was 4 ha. The OA gradually increased when adding extra Sentinel-1 scenes up until the early August, and the initial scenes were acquired in early June or mid-May. After that, only minor improvements in the crop recognition accuracy were noted. The ik-NN method gave greater overall accuracies than the logistic regression analysis with all data combinations tested. The width of the 95% confidence intervals with ik-NN for the estimate of the probability of the species with the largest probability on an individual parcel varied depending on the species, the area threshold of the parcel and the number of the Sentinel-1 scenes used. The results ranged between 0.06-0.08 units (6-8% points) for the most common species when the Sentinel-1 scenes were between 1 June and 12 August. The results were well-received by the authorities and encourage further research to continue the study towards an operational method in which the space-borne SAR data are a part of the information chain.

TI  - Global Cloud Detection for CERES Edition 4 Using Terra and Aqua MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Clouds and Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES) has been monitoring clouds and radiation since 2000 using algorithms developed before 2002 for CERES Edition 2 (Ed2) products. To improve cloud amount accuracy, CERES Edition 4 (Ed4) applies revised algorithms and input data to Terra and Aqua MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiances. The Ed4 cloud mask uses 57 additional channels, new models for clear-sky ocean and snow/ice-surface radiances, and revised Terra MODIS calibrations. Mean Ed4 daytime and nighttime cloud amounts exceed their Ed2 counterparts by 0.035 and 0.068. Excellent consistency between average Aqua and Terra cloud fraction is found over nonpolar regions. Differences over polar regions are likely due to unresolved calibration discrepancies. Relative to Ed2, Ed4 cloud amounts agree better with those from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). CALIPSO comparisons indicate that Ed4 cloud amounts are more than or as accurate as other available cloud mask systems. The Ed4 mask correctly identifies cloudy or clear areas 9096 of the time during daytime over nonpolar areas depending on the CALIPSOMODIS averaging criteria. At night, the range is 8895. Accuracy decreases over land. The polar day and night accuracy ranges are 9091 and 8081, respectively. The mean Ed4 cloud fractions slightly exceed the average for seven other imager cloud masks. Remaining biases and uncertainties are mainly attributed to errors in Ed4 predicted clear-sky radiances. The resulting cloud fractions should help CERES produce a more accurate radiation budget and serve as part of a cloud property climate data record.

TI  - CORIGAN: Assessing multiple species and interactions within images
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Images are resourceful data for ecologists and can provide a more complete information than other methods to study biodiversity and the interactions between species. Automated image analysis however often relies on extensive datasets, not implementable by small research teams. We are here proposing an object detection method that allows the analysis of high-resolution images containing many animals interacting in a small dataset. We developed an image analysis pipeline named 'CORIGAN' to extract the characteristics of animal communities. CORIGAN is based on the YOLOv3 model as the core of object detection. To illustrate potential applications, we use images collected during a sentinel prey experiment. Our pipeline can be used to detect, count and study the physical interactions between various animals. On our example dataset, the model reaches 86.6% precision and 88.9% recall at the species level or even at the caste level for ants. The training set required fewer than 10 hr of labelling. Based on the pipeline output, it was possible to build the trophic and non-trophic interactions network describing the studied community. CORIGAN relies on generic properties of the detected animals and can be used for a wide range of studies and supports. Here, we study invertebrates on high-resolution images, but the same processing can be transferred for the study of larger animals on satellite or aircraft images.

TI  - Evaluation of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral images for mineral identification and mapping
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancement of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing techniques provides subtle variations to identify minerals and to make distinctions between rock formations. These techniques clearly define barren land versus economically viable zones containing ores and minerals. As we know profitable mineral zones are commonly associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, hyperspectral remote sensing techniques have the capability to identify and distinguish between altered, weathered, and clay minerals. In this research work, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing image from AVIRIS-NG is used to identify hydrothermally altered minerals in the Jahajpur region of Bhilwara district, Rajasthan, India. The purpose of this study is the identification of the minerals through spectral features of image spectra in corroboration with field sample spectra and USGS laboratory spectra. The spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Spectral Feature Fitting (SFF) algorithms were used for the mapping of the minerals. This study was conducted to prove the capability of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral remote sensing data to identify zones of profitable mineral deposits.

TI  - Soil and transport factors in potential distribution systems for biofertilisers derived from palm oil mill residues in Malaysia
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm provides an important source of edible oils and fats, accounting for > 30% of total global production and > 55% of the international trade in these foodstuffs. The palms produce fresh fruit bunches, comprising several hundreds of small fruitlets, which are compressed and steamed to extract the oil. Soil nutrients in oil palm estates become depleted after decades of heavy harvesting and require fertilisers. Liquid palm oil mill effluent, solid empty fruit bunches and other residues can have deleterious environmental impacts and require careful management.The problems of residue disposal and soil nutrient impoverishment can be linked and managed by composting the oil palm mill residues and distributing the biofertiliser produced back to the plantation. Using case studies from West Malaysia we present an early stage practical tool for the planning of the distribution component of such a cycle. The computer-based tool uses multiple field-based and remote sensing data sources to integrate the effects of local soil conditions, transport distances, environmental protection and management priorities and then models customised distribution plans. The tool operates at plantation level and can be augmented with detailed local data, but the approach is extensible and potentially applicable to regional or national planning.

TI  - Estimation of Groundwater Use Pattern and Distribution in the Coastal Mekong Delta, Vietnam via Socio-Economical Survey and Groundwater Modelling
T2  - ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In many provinces of Mekong delta, excessive groundwater extraction has resulted in many serious groundwater-related problems. To solve problems relevant to increasing water demand as well as other negative influence of groundwater depletion, an exigent question was raised whether at what time in future is the limits to local groundwater use reached? Hence, there is a need to know groundwater use (GWU) pattern and distribution in the study area for future groundwater management.In this study, firstly, the study used socio-economic data of Tra Vinh Province to classify groups of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, potential of water resources and population distributed in each district in order to design and conduct the socio-economic survey and to explore information relevant to GWU for each purpose. Secondly, the data set of 419 survey questionnaires per 9 surveyed communes were analysed by SPSS tool to estimate ratio of household using groundwater (RHHUG) for each purpose as well as average pumping rate (APR) per household for domestic use and per ha for agriculture use, respectively. Thirdly, the APRs were extended to propose the total GWU pattern and distribution during 2007-2016 by using socioeconomic data of the province and expand to spatial distribution by using correlation with land surface temperature (LST) which was estimated from Landsat 8 images. Besides, the groundwater flow model of the study area was developed to verify the estimated amount of groundwater pumping (pattern and distribution) in the period.The study found that the GWU of Tra Vinh Province in dry season of 2016 was 346,279 m(3)/d in which two coastal districts occupied more than 50 percentages, i.e., about 188,551 m3/d. RHHUG increased from 1.5 to 2 times during the period of 2007 to 2016 in this area. LST distribution performed a good correlation (adj-R-2 = 0.646) with GWU distribution in Tra Cu district. Results of groundwater modelling also showed that the discharge from aquifer (mainly pumping) was always higher than the recharge to aquifer.

TI  - The Christianization of African Traditional Religions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MISSION
M3  - Article
AB  - In studies of the historical growth and spread of Christianity in Africa, the focus has been too much on Christianizing African social and religious institutions and structures, and not enough on African traditional religion itself, which needs to be addressed by Christianity. This article addresses the core - that is, the theology and worldview - of the African traditional religion. It argues that this core needs to be Christianized and shows how this can be done. In order to achieve this task, the article uses a new theological method, a "systematic theology" of African traditional religion, as the basis for a theological method of engagement and interaction of religions and worldview. This new method explains in practical terms how Christianity can effectively Christianize African traditional religions and worldviews.

TI  - Touch Imprinting Cytology may be useful in the intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel lymph node in melanoma
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to assess whether the reliability of Touch Imprinting Cytology (TIC) of Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in skin melanoma patients allows intraoperative decisions regarding simultaneous radical lymphadenectomy to be made. Previous experiences have shown that the limit of TIC in extemporaneous diagnosis was represented by the minimal deposits of the tumor. Many current data seem to show that in this situation radical lymphadenectomy is no longer necessary, so we wondered if TIC could regain importance in the intraoperative management of these patients.METHODS: TIC results of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Biopsy (SLN) were compared with those of standard histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations.RESULTS: A total number of 110 SLN were detected from 50 melanoma patients. TIC revealed the presence of metastases only in 1 out of 13 melanoma-positive SLN (sensitivity 7.6%). There were no false-positive results of TIC (specificity 100%). The negative predictive value was 75.5%, the positive one 100% with a total diagnostic accuracy of 76%.CONCLUSIONS: TIC for SLNs is a reliable method, relatively fast and not very expensive. Although with a very high specificity, its sensitivity was very low, and almost exclusively limited to macro-metastases (>2mm). Furthermore, it was not possible to identify a subgroup of patients, based on the characteristics of the primary, tumor, in which the method could have been more useful. Finally, even in positive cases, the method rarely reduced the need of a tactic in two stages, principally for the management of the operating room.

TI  - Determination of Appropriate Remote Sensing Indices for Spring Wheat Yield Estimation in Mongolia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mongolia, the monitoring and estimation of spring wheat yield at the regional and national levels are key issues for the agricultural policy and food management as well as for the economy and society as a whole. The remote sensing data and technique have been widely used for the estimation of crop yield and production in the world. For the current research, nine remote sensing indices were tested that include normalized difference drought index (NDDI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health index (VHI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), and vegetation supply water index (VSWI). These nine indices derived from MODIS/Terra satellite have so far not been used for crop yield prediction in Mongolia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the best remote sensing indices in order to develop an estimation model for spring wheat yield using correlation and regression method. The spring wheat yield data from the ground measurements of eight meteorological stations in Darkhan and Selenge provinces from 2000 to 2017 have been used. The data were collected during the period of the growing season (June-August). Based on the analysis, we constructed six models for spring wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the range of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of estimated spring wheat yield was between 4.1 (100 kg ha(-1)) to 4.8 (100 kg ha(-1)), respectively. The range of the mean absolute error (MAE) values was between 3.3 to 3.8 and the index of agreement (d) values was between 0.74 to 0.84, respectively. The conclusion was that the best model would be (R-2 = 0.55) based on NDWI, VSDI, and NDVI out of the nine indices and could serve as the most effective predictor and reliable remote sensing indices for monitoring the spring wheat yield in the northern part of Mongolia. Our results showed that the best timing of yield prediction for spring wheat was around the end of June and the beginning of July, which is the flowering stage of spring wheat in this study area. This means an accurate yield prediction for spring wheat can be achieved two months before the harvest time using the regression model.

TI  - Rainfall Contribution of Tropical Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal between 1998 and 2016 using TRMM Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Bay of Bengal (BoB) area, landfalling Tropical Cyclones (TCs) often produce heavy rainfall that results in coastal flooding and causes enormous loss of life and property. However, the rainfall contribution of TCs in this area has not yet been systematically investigated. To fulfil this objective, firstly, this paper used TC best track data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) to analyze TC activity in this area from 1998 to 2016 (January-December). It showed that on average there were 2.47 TCs per year generated in BoB. In 1998, 1999, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, and 2016 there were 3 or more TCs; while in 2001, 2004, 2011, 2012, and 2015, there was only 1 TC. On a monthly basis, the maximum TC activity was in May, October, and November, and the lowest TC activity was from January to April and in July. Rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) were used to estimate TC rainfall contribution (i.e., how much TC contributed to the total rainfall) on an interannual and monthly scale. The result showed that TCs accounted for around 8% of total overland rainfall during 1998-2016, and with a minimum of 1% in 2011 and a maximum of 34% in 1999. On the monthly basis, TCs' limited rainfall contribution overland was found from January to April and in July (less than 14%), whereas the maximum TC rainfall contribution overland was in November and December (16%), May (15%), and October (14%). The probability density functions showed that, in a stronger TC, heavier rainfall accounted for more percentages. However, there was little correlation between TC rainfall contribution and TC intensity, because the TC rainfall contribution was also influenced by the TC rainfall area and frequency, and as well the occurrence of other rainfall systems.

CP  - 16th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Consensus Conference (SGIBCC) - Optimizing Early Breast Cancer Therapies
CL  - Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - Managing elderly breast cancer patients brings challenges both to physicians and patients themselves. There are certain controversial issues regarding local treatment of early breast cancer in this population. Since elderly patients are more likely to have comorbidities and functional limitations, they are more prone to undertreatment.Although surgical treatment in elderly patients were reported to be safe, severity and number of comorbidities are shown to be related with increased complications, hence may lead to higher mortality and lower life quality. Therefore, frailty is one of the concerns which prevents elderly patients to receive standard-of-care local treatment. Nevertheless, breast cancers developing in elderly are more likely to be low grade and luminal type. Until now, primary endocrine treatment without surgical resection, omitting whole breast irradiation after partial mastectomyand avoiding sentinel lymph node biopsy, which are otherwise accepted as standard-of-care, were questionned in healthy, low-risk, elderly fit patients. Two main issues were suggested to be considered when assessing the impact of local treatment options in this patient group; the clinical significance of treatments' effects, and the patients' expectations. Due to their vulnerability, baseline geriatric assessment should be the initial step for management in elderly breast cancer patients. Even in those who are healthy and fit with long life-expectancy, de-escalation in management might be an option in low-risk patients after considering patients' individual expectations and limited clinical benefits of standard local treatment options.

TI  - Multi-season RapidEye imagery improves the classification of wetland and dryland communities in a subtropical coastal region
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is considered a valuable tool for monitoring the impacts of global change on vegetation species composition, condition and distribution. Multi-season imagery has been shown to improve the classification of vegetation communities though the contribution of the winter season in multi-seasonal classifications remains to be assessed. The capability of multi-season images of RapidEye, a new generation high spatial resolution (5 m) space-borne sensor containing an additional red-edge band, was evaluated for the classification of several wetland and dryland communities. RapidEye images were obtained for four seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) between 2011 and 2012 for a subtropical coastal region of South Africa. The separability of nine wetland and dryland communities was assessed for each season using the Partial Least Square Random Forest (PLS-RF) algorithm. The four-seasons approach yielded a higher overall classification accuracy (OA = 86 +/- 2.8%) when compared to using any single-season classification. The highest single-season accuracies were obtained in spring (80 +/- 2.9%), summer (80 +/- 3.1%), and autumn (79 +/- 3.4%) compared to the winter (66 +/- 3.1%). A three-season combination of autumn, winter and spring yielded the highest average OA (86 +/- 3.1%), maximised the user's accuracies and minimised the number of comparable pairs confused. The inclusion of indices in the classification scenarios showed a minor (+/- 1 percentage points) difference in the average overall and user's accuracies compared to the classification results where only bands were used. The red-edge band of RapidEye increased the overall and average user's accuracy for most of the scenarios by 2-6 percentage points and thus contributed to the separability of communities which are dominated by evergreen tree species.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance of <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolated from uncomplicated UTI in general practice patients over a 10-year period
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recommendations of first choice antibiotic therapy need to be based on actual antibiotic susceptibility data. We determined the antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli in uncomplicated UTI among women and compared the results with 2004 and 2009. In 30 sentinel general practitioner practices of Nivel Primary Care database, urine samples were collected from women with symptoms of uncomplicated UTI. Patient characteristics, E. coli susceptibility, and ESBL production were analyzed. Six hundred eighty-nine urine samples were collected; E. coli was the most isolated uropathogen (83%). Antibiotic susceptibility was stable over time except for ciprofloxacin (96% in 2004, 97% in 2009, and 94% in 2014; P < 0.05). The susceptibility to co-amoxiclav was 88%, 87%, and 92% in 2004, 2009, and 2014, respectively. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli increased from 0.1% in 2004 to 2.2% in 2014 (P < 0.05). Regional differences in antibiotic susceptibility for co-trimoxazole were found being the highest in the west (88%) and the lowest in the north (72%, P = 0.021). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was related to antibiotic use in the past 3 months (97% no use versus 90% use, P = 0.002) and age > 70 years (P = 0.005). In 2014, prescription of fosfomycin increased compared to 2009 (14.3% versus 5.6%) at the expense of co-amoxiclav, co-trimoxazole, and fluoroquinolones (P < 0.05). The susceptibility percentages to most antimicrobial agents tested were stable over 10 years' period although the prevalence of E. coli and ESBLs significantly increased. Performance of a survey with regular intervals is warranted.

TI  - Mangrove forests of Cambodia: Recent changes and future threats
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests around the world are critical agents for coastal area protection, ecosystem services and socioeconomic functions. Cambodia is rich is natural resources such as mangrove forests. There are many discrepancies in the estimated area of mangrove forests by different agencies over a few decades in Cambodia. In this study, decadal changes in mangrove forests along the Cambodian coastline were analysed using satellite data (Landsat series). Overall loss of mangrove forests between 1989 and 2017 has been estimated as 42% (1415 ha/year) in the four coastal provinces of Cambodia (Koh Kong, Kampot, Preah Sihanoukville, and Kep). Individual losses of mangrove areas in Koh Kong, Kampot, Sihanoukville and Kep during the study period were 39%, 45%, 52% and 34%, respectively. Three main causes of mangrove forest destruction in Cambodia (salt farming, charcoal production and shrimp farming) have been perceived based on the literature review. Reforestation of mangrove species, banning on illegal charcoal production and deactivation of non-profitable aquaculture ponds are some of the key factors that are believed to have caused a reduction in mangrove loss in recent years in Cambodia.

AB  - Axillary management in breast cancer is still controversial. Recent clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that in breast-conserving surgery, axillary dissection could be an overtreatment when metastases are present in only 1-2 sentinel lymph nodes. Nonetheless, axillary dissection remains the principal treatment in patients undergoing mastectomy with at least one metastatic sentinel lymph node and in patients eligible for breast conserving surgery with three or more positive sentinel lymph nodes. In this analytical review, we discuss the clinical evidence, taking into account recent guidelines, for axillary management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Eco-Development Response to Climate Change and the Isostatic Uplift of Southwestern Finland
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, care for our planet is mainly focused on the remediation of climate change induced by the huge amount of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses and its precursors. Transforming fossil combustion to more sustainable energy worldwide is a wellknown example. In contrast, what is little known is that the environment shaped by humans is also challenged by relatively fast geological dynamical phenomena such as the isostatic uplift of Fennoscandia, parts of Canada and northwestern Russia. Due to this uplift, the archipelago along the coast of southwestern Finland and Sweden changes rapidly to mainland. This phenomenon deeply affects both nature as well as the environment, resulting in the relocation of human activities. Here, we interpret the on-ground observed regression of the Gulf of Bothnia on the coasts of southwestern Finland and its implications on countryside activities in the framework of the eco-development paradigm. Furthermore, remotely sensed data on surface wetness confirms this sea regression and the silting-up of the nearby lakes that drain precipitation to the Gulf. We show that this eco-development paradigm may rebalance nature, environment, humans and culture and that it is a valid alternative against the past and present-day socioeconomical approach that has accelerated the change in the Earth's climate.

TI  - Landsat Time Series Assessment of Invasive Annual Grasses Following Energy Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive annual grasses are of concern in much of the western United States because they tolerate resource variability and have high reproductive capacity, with propagules that are readily dispersed in disturbed areas like those created and maintained for energy development. Early season invasive grasses "green up" earlier than most native plants, producing a distinct pulse of greenness in the early spring that can be exploited to identify their location using multi-date imagery. To determine if invasive annual grasses increased around energy developments after the construction phase, we calculated an invasives index using Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery for a 34-year time period (1985-2018) and assessed trends for 1755 wind turbines installed between 1988 and 2013 in the southern California desert. The index uses the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for early season greenness (January-June), and mean NDVI (July-October) for the later dry season. We estimated the relative cover of invasive annuals each year at turbine locations and control sites and tested for changes before and after each turbine was installed. The time series was also mapped across the region and temporal trends were assessed relative to seasonal precipitation. The results showed an increase in early season invasives at turbine sites after installation, but also an increase in many of the surrounding control areas. Maps of the invasive index show a region-wide increase starting around 1998, and much of the increase occurred in areas surrounding wind development sites. These results suggest that invasions around the energy developments occurred within the context of a larger regional invasion, and while the development did not necessarily initiate the invasion, annual grasses were more prevalent around the developments.

TI  - Needle in a haystack: Mapping rare and infrequent crops using satellite imagery and data balancing methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most cropping systems around the world are organised around few dominant crops and a larger number of less frequent crops. While rare and infrequent crops occupy a small share of the cropped area, they produce ecological benefits on farmland, contribute to sustainability and help provide food and nutritional security. However, data about their location and extent derived from satellite imagery generally lack accuracy, largely owing to the class imbalance problem. Class imbalance occurs when only few instances of some classes are available for training classifiers, and leads to large error rates of the infrequent classes. In this study, we assessed the magnitude of the class imbalance problem in crop classification and evaluated balancing methods to combat it by creating synthetic minority observations or by removing majority observations. To that aim, we generated 18 unbalanced data sets from Sentinel-2 time series and crop type observations in Victoria, Australia. These data sets covered a wide range of complexity, number of classes, number of samples per class and spectral separability which enabled us to gather evidence about the benefits and drawbacks of balancing methods in various settings. Classification accuracy was assessed with two metrics: the Overall Accuracy (OA), which gives more weight to majority classes, and the G-Mean accuracy (GM), which is more sensitive to minority classes. Results showed that class imbalance explained near 40% of the accuracy variability. We found that balancing methods boosted GM by 0.01-0.54 but no single best solution emerged. The price for increasing the accuracy of minority classes was a drop in OA of a magnitude that was problem- and method-specific. We thus applied an algorithm selection method called the F-race to identify optimal balancing methods in a computationally economic fashion. Optimal balancing methods lead to maximum gain in GM and minimum loss in OA. We demonstrated that this approach either successfully identified optimal balancing methods or ones that were not significantly sub-optimal, while reducing the computational cost by up to 60%. It can readily be incorporated to operational crop classification systems with little disruption to the existing processing chains. This contribution paves the way for achieving a more comprehensive and detailed view of crop distribution and cropping sequences.

TI  - A Rapidly Assessed Wetland Stress Index (RAWSI) Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are important resources, providing great economic benefits for surrounding communities. In this study, we developed a new stress indicator called "Rapidly Assessed Wetlands Stress Index" (RAWSI) by combining several natural and anthropogenic stressors of wetlands in Delaware, in the United States. We compared two machine-learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), to quantify wetland stress by classifying satellite images from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). An accuracy assessment showed that the combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel SAR data had the highest overall accuracy (93.7%) when used with an RF classifier. In addition to the land-cover classification, a trend analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from Landsat images during 2004-2018 was used to assess changes in healthy vegetation. We also calculated the stream sinuosity to assess human alterations to hydrology. We then used these three metrics to develop RAWSI, and to quantify and map wetland stress due to human alteration of the landscape. Hot-spot analysis using Global Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* identified several statistically significant hot spots (high stress) in forested wetlands and cold spots (low values) in non-forested wetlands. This information can be utilized to identify wetland areas in need of further regulation, with implications in environmental planning and policy decisions.

TI  - Rapid increase of gonorrhoea cases in Guangdong Province, China, 2014-2017: a review of surveillance data
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives An increased trend in the number of reported gonorrhoea cases has been observed between 2014 and 2017 in China. This study aims to describe the reported epidemic of gonorrhoea and potential driving forces in Guangdong Province, China.Design A review of surveillance data.Participants Three different sources of data from Guangdong Province were analysed: gonorrhoea cases reported to the Chinese sexually transmitted infections (STI) case report system (CRS); a clinic-based retrospective study conducted to collect information on annual gonorrhoea screening coverage and data from the Guangdong governmental sentinel surveillance network (SSN) to examine the gonorrhoea prevalence among males attending STI clinics.Outcome measures Reported incidence of gonorrhoea, number of reported gonorrhoea cases, number of screening tests for gonorrhoea and gonorrhoea prevalence.Results The STI CRS data showed that the reported incidence of gonorrhoea has increased rapidly from 15.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2014 to 27.3 cases per 100 000 in 2017 in Guangdong (p<0.001). Regions with a reported incidence of gonorrhoea cases of more than 10 cases per 100 000 expanded from 7 cities in 2014 to 13 cities in 2017. The SSN data showed that the gonorrhoea prevalence among males attending STI clinics increased from 2.7% in 2015 to 3.6% in 2017 (p=0.14). The retrospective study showed that the increased rate of screening for gonorrhoea between 2014 and 2017 was 35.0%, which was much lower than the increased rate of the number of reported gonorrhoea cases (123.3%).Conclusions The number of gonococcal infections is rapidly rising in Guangdong, China. Expanded screening coverage, use of more sensitive diagnostics and increase of gonorrhoea prevalence are three potential contributors to the epidemic. Additional targeted intervention strategies are necessary in the future to control the epidemic.

TI  - Adaptive scale selection in multiscale segmentation based on the segmented object complexity of GF-2 satellite image
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation is the premise and key step of object-oriented classification, but scale selection remains a challenge in image segmentation. Over the years, scale selection methods of image segmentation have been extensively explored and developed. When the scale is chosen, all the features are generally extracted from images in these methods. In addition, in these methods, an optimal scale is generally selected based on the pre-estimation of the statistical variance of remote sensing images or determined by the post-segmentation evaluation results, rather than during the segmentation. In this study, with the central and eastern parts of Longchang City in Mid-Sichuan Hilly Region as the study area, based on the Gaofen-2 (GF-2) image, an adaptive scale selection method was proposed to determine the optimal scale of each segmentation object during the segmentation. First, the single-scale optimal image segmentation is determined by an unsupervised evaluation method which uses weighted variance and Moran's I to measure global intra-segment homogeneity and inter-segment heterogeneity, respectively. Then, spectral, texture, and shape features of each segmented object were extracted to construct the complexity index function, and the optimal scale of the segmentation objects was determined through the iterative calculation according to the threshold value. The proposed method was applied to process GF-2 image to obtain the segmentation results and classification map, compared with the methods of determining the optimal scale through estimation local statistic variances of image and post-evaluation of segmentation results. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is of practical helpfulness and effectiveness for generating the optimal scale matching the actual ground objects.

TI  - A sheared low-rank model for oblique stripe removal
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe noise removal from remote sensing imagery is a key preprocessing step for many applications, such as urban planning, military, and environmental monitoring. Two significant priors of the stripe are low-rankness and group sparsity, which play a central role in many destriping methods. However, for oblique stripes, these two priors are no longer explicitly applicable. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel sheared decomposition framework for oblique stripe removal. The main idea is to perform a shear operation on the observed image, so that the oblique stripe is transformed to nearly vertical lines. For the stripe component, we characterize the low-rankness and group sparsity priors in the sheared domain. For the image component, we characterize the smoothness prior in the original domain by unidirectional total variation (UTV), which can preserve the strong edges and geometric features while suppressing stripes. To solve the proposed model, we design an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Experiments using simulated and real data show that the proposed method can remove the oblique stripe effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

TI  - Sea Surface Salinity Products Validation Based on Triple Match Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since satellites have observed the sea surface temperature (SSS) from space for years, the scientific community has devoted many efforts to the validation of satellite SSS products. Typically, this validation procedure is based on the "double match" method between the in situ and remote-sensed measurements. However, this direct comparison has its limitations because it does not take into account sampling error of different SSS sources. Actually, the in situ method presents the pointwise measurements and the satellite data are the spatial average within its footprint, so the in situ data contain the true small-scale SSS signal which cannot be resolved by satellite data. Researchers introduce the representativeness error to describe the small-scale signal. However, the estimation of representativeness error remains challenging. In this study, based on the constancy of salinity variance, we develop a new method to estimate the representativeness error and apply it to the triple collocation dataset of Argo data and L3 SSS product of soil moisture activepassive (SMAP) and soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS). The representativeness error is estimated to be 0.093 psu(2) in global oceans. The random error of Argo data is better than 0.21 psu which is superior to SMAP and SMOS. Considering the different sampling resolution of SMAP and SMOS, the quality of SMAP SSS product (0.33 psu) is slightly better than SMOS (0.41 psu).

TI  - Capability of Sentinel-2 MSI data for monitoring and mapping of soil salinity in dry and wet seasons in the Ebinur Lake region, Xinjiang, China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most important causes for land degradation and desertification and is an important threat to land management, farming activities, water quality, and sustainable development in arid and semi-arid areas. Soil salinization is often characterized with significant spatiotemporal dynamics. The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake region in the Northwestern China. However, detailed local soil salinity information is ambiguous at the best due to limited monitoring techniques. Nowadays, the availability of Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2, offers unprecedented perspectives for the monitoring and mapping of soil salinity. The use of MSI data is an innovative attempt for salinity detection in arid land. We hypothesize that field observations and MSI data and MSI data-derived spectral indices using the partial least square regression (PISA) approach will yield fairly accurate regional salinity map. Based on electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC) of 72 ground-truth measurements (out of 116 sample sites) and various spectral parameters, such as satellite band reflectance, published satellite salinity indices, red-edge indices, newly constructed two-band indices, and three-band indices from MSI data, we built a few inversion models in an attempt to produce the regional salinity maps. Different algorithms including Pearson correlation coefficient method (PCC), variable importance in projection (VIP), Gray relational analysis (GRA), and random forest (RF) were applied for variable selection. The results suggest that both the newly proposed normalized difference index (NDI) [(B12 - B7) / (B12 + B7)] and three-band index (TBI4) [(B12 - B3) / (B3 - B11)] show a better correlation with validation data and could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the remaining 44 independent ground-based measurements. The RF-PLSR model performed the best across the five models with R-V(2), RMSEv, and RPD of 0.92, 7.58 dS m(-1), and 2.36, respectively. The result from this model was then used to map the soil salinity over the study area. Our analyses suggest that soil salinization changes quite significantly in different seasons. Specifically, soil salinity in the dry season was higher than in the wet season, mostly in the lake area and nearby shores. We contend that the results from the study will be useful for soil salinization monitoring and land reclamation in arid or semi-arid regions outside the current study area.

TI  - Comparison of Three Algorithms for the Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature from Landsat 8 Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful launch of the Landsat 8 satellite provides important data for the monitoring of urban heat island effects. Since the Landsat 8 TIRS data has two thermal infrared bands, it is suitable for many algorithms to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST). However, the selection of algorithms for retrieving the LST, the acquisition of algorithm input parameters, and the verification of the results are problems without obvious solutions. Taking Changchun City as an example, this paper used the mono-window algorithm (MWA), the split window algorithm (SWA), and the single-channel (SC) method to extract the LST from the Landsat 8 image and compared the three algorithms in terms of input parameters, accuracy, and sensitivity. The results show that all three algorithms can achieve good results in retrieving the LST. The SWA is the least sensitive to the error of the input parameters. The MWA and the SC method are sensitive to the error of the input parameters, and compared with the error of the LSE, these two algorithms are more sensitive to the error of atmospheric water vapor content. In addition, the MWA is also very sensitive to the error of the effective mean atmospheric temperature.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation Characteristics of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China, from 2013 to 2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution, including particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, is extremely harmful to the environment as well as human health. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Region has experienced heavy PM2.5 pollution within China. In this study, a six-year time series (January 2013-December 2018) of PM2.5 mass concentration data from 102 air quality monitoring stations were studied to understand the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of the BTH region. The average annual PM2.5 mass concentration in the BTH region decreased from 98.9 mu g/m(3) in 2013 to 64.9 mu g/m(3) in 2017. Therefore, China has achieved its Air Pollution Prevention and Control Plan goal of reducing the concentration of fine particulate matter in the BTH region by 25% by 2017. The PM2.5 pollution in BTH plain areas showed a more significant change than mountains areas, with the highest PM2.5 mass concentration in winter and the lowest in summer. The results of spatial autocorrelation and cluster analyses showed that the PM2.5 mass concentration in the BTH region from 2013-2018 showed a significant spatial agglomeration, and that spatial distribution characteristics were high in the south and low in the north. Changes in PM2.5 mass concentration in the BTH region were affected by both socio-economic factors and meteorological factors. Our results can provide a point of reference for making PM2.5 pollution control decisions.

TI  - On-Orbit Calibration Approach Based on Partial Calibration-Field Coverage for the GF-1/WFV Camera
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-1 (GF1) optical remote sensing satellite is the first in China's series of high-resolution civilian satellites and is equipped with four wide-field-of-view cameras. The cameras work together to obtain an image 800 km wide, with a resolution of 16 m, allowing GF1 to complete a global scan in four days. To achieve high-accuracy calibration of the wide-field-of-view cameras on GF1, the calibration field should have high resolution and broad coverage based on the traditional calibration method. In this study, a GF1 self-calibration scheme was developed. It uses partial reference calibration data covering the selected primary charge-coupled device to achieve high-accuracy calibration of the whole image. Based on the absolute constraint of the ground control points and the relative constraint of the tie points of stereoscopic images, we present two geometric calibration models based on paired stereoscopic images and three stereoscopic images for wide-field-of-view cameras on GF1, along with corresponding stepwise internal-parameter estimation methods. Our experimental results indicate that the internal relative accuracy can be guaranteed after calibration. This article provides a new approach that enables large-field-of-view optical satellites to achieve high-accuracy calibration based on partial calibration-field coverage.

TI  - Mapping sugarcane in complex landscapes by integrating multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images and machine learning algorithms
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is an important type of cash crop and plays a crucial role in global sugar production. Clarifying the magnitude of sugarcane planting will likely provide very evident supports for local land use management and policy-making. However, sugarcane growth environment in complex landscapes with frequent rainy weather conditions poses many challenges for its rapid mapping. This study thus tried and used 10-m Sentinel-2 images as well as crop phenology information to map sugarcane in Longzhou county of China in 2018. To minimize the influences of cloudy and rainy conditions, this study firstly fused all available images in each phenology stage to obtain cloud-free remote sensing images of three phenology stage (seedling, elongation and harvest) with the help of Google Earth Engine platform. Then, the study used the fused images to compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each stage. A three-band NDVI dataset along with 4000 training samples and 2000 random validation samples was finally used for sugarcane mapping. To assess the robustness of the threeband NDVI dataset with phenological characteristics for sugarcane mapping, this study employed five classifiers based on machine learning algorithms, including two support vector machine classifiers (Polynomial-SVM and RBF-SVM), a random forest classifier (RF), an artificial neural network classifier (ANN) and a decision tree classifier (CART-DT). Results showed that except for ANN classifier, Polynomial-SVM, RBF-SVM, RF and CART-DT classifiers displayed high accuracy sugarcane resultant maps with producer's and user's accuracies of greater than 91%. The ANN classifier tended to overestimate area of sugarcane and underestimate area of forests. Overall performances of five classifiers suggest Polynomial-SVM has the best potential to improve sugarcane mapping at the regional scale. Also, this study observed that most sugarcane (more than 75% of entire study area) tends to grow in flat regions with slope of less than 10 degrees. This study emphasizes the importance of considering phenology in rapid sugarcane mapping, and suggests the potential of fine-resolution Sentinel-2 images and machine learning approaches in high-accuracy land use management and decision-making.

TI  - Forest Canopy Height and Gaps from Multiangular BRDF, Assessed with Airborne LiDAR Data (Short Title: Vegetation Structure from LiDAR and Multiangular Data)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Both vegetation multi-angular and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) remote sensing data are indirectly and directly linked with 3D vegetation structure parameters, such as the tree height and vegetation gap fraction, which are critical elements in above-ground biomass and light profiles for photosynthesis estimation. LiDAR, particularly LiDAR using waveform data, provides accurate estimates of these structural parameters but suffers from not enough spatial samplings. Structural parameters retrieved from multiangular imaging data through the inversion of physical models have larger uncertainties. This study searches for an analytical approach to fuse LiDAR and multiangular data. We explore the relationships between vegetation structure parameters derived from airborne vegetation LiDAR data and multiangular data and present a new potential angle vegetation index to retrieve the tree height and gap fraction using multi-angular data in Howland Forest, Maine. The BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution factor) index named NDMM (normalized difference between the maximum and minimum reflectance) linearly increases with the tree height and decreases with the gap fraction. In addition, these relationships are also dependent on the wavelength, tree species, and stand density. The NDMM index performs better in conifer (R = 0.451 for tree height and R = 0.472 for the gap fraction using the near infrared band) than in deciduous and mixed forests. It is superior in sparse (R = 0.569 for tree height and R = 0.604 for the gap fraction using the near infrared band) compared to dense forest. Moreover, the NDMM index is more strongly related to tree height and the gap fraction at the near infrared band than at the three visible bands. This study sheds light on the possibility of using multiangular data to map vegetation's structural parameters in larger regions for carbon cycle studies through the fusion of LiDAR and multiangular remote sensing data.

TI  - Transparent Reporting on Research Using Unstructured Electronic Health Record Data to Generate 'Real World' Evidence of Comparative Effectiveness and Safety
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research that makes secondary use of administrative and clinical healthcare databases is increasingly influential for regulatory, reimbursement, and other healthcare decision-making. Consequently, there are numerous guidance documents on reporting for studies that use 'real-world' data captured in administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) databases. These guidance documents are intended to improve transparency, reproducibility, and the ability to evaluate validity and relevance of design and analysis decisions. However, existing guidance does not differentiate between structured and unstructured information contained in EHRs, registries, or other healthcare data sources. While unstructured text is convenient and readily interpretable in clinical practice, it can be difficult to use for investigation of causal questions, e.g., comparative effectiveness and safety, until data have been cleaned and algorithms applied to extract relevant information to structured fields for analysis. The goal of this paper is to increase transparency for healthcare decision makers and causal inference researchers by providing general recommendations for reporting on steps taken to make unstructured text-based data usable for comparative effectiveness and safety research. These recommendations are designed to be used as an adjunct for existing reporting guidance. They are intended to provide sufficient context and supporting information for causal inference studies involving use of natural language processing- or machine learning-derived data fields, so that researchers, reviewers, and decision makers can be confident in their ability to evaluate the validity and relevance of derived measures for exposures, inclusion/exclusion criteria, covariates, and outcomes for the causal question of interest.

TI  - Intercomparisons of Cloud Mask Products Among Fengyun-4A, Himawari-8, and MODIS
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we developed a unified and operational cloud mask algorithm for the new-generation geostationary (GEO) meteorological satellite imagers of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) aboard Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) and the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8 (H08). We investigated the all-round performance of the cloud mask algorithm. Spatiotemporally, the algorithm matches the official Collection-6 cloud mask products of a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from both the Terra and Aqua platforms, which we employed as the benchmark for performing intercomparisons and validations. The robust cloud mask algorithm can show high consistency between FY-4A/AGRI and H08/AHI. The MODIS-based validation results suggest that cloudy scene identification is better than that observed for clear skies for both FY-4A/AGRI and H08/AHI; there is also a relatively low false-alarm ratio (FAR). Moreover, the algorithm is more reliable during daytime hours, with a hit rate (HR) of approximately 92 for both FY-4A/AGRI and H08/AHI. We found slightly higher accuracy in cloud-masking results over water than those over land. Furthermore, we found that more than 67 of the matched pixels for both advanced GEO imagers had no bias when taking MODIS as the benchmark. Overall, HR values were approximately 91.04 and 91.82 for FY-4A/AGRI and H08/AHI, respectively. These results confirm the high quality of the algorithm for retrieving real-time cloud mask products.

TI  - Onboard satellite visibility prediction using metamodeling based framework
T2  - AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite autonomous systems are employed to address complex space applications through onboard data processing and mission planning. To take advantage of onboard autonomous systems, rapid onboard satellite visibility predictions are necessary for certain decision-making missions, including Earth observation resource allocation and satellite data transmission. We consider this visibility prediction process as a roots-finding problem for a multiple hump function, and design a metamodeling-based framework with a self-adaptive interpolation method. Metamodels are developed as surrogates for visibility prediction functions to reduce expensive computational costs. Our proposed framework has a broad range of applications for all orbital types and orbit propagators. We conduct the experiments using different metamodeling techniques, radial basis functions, Kriging, and support vector regression based upon real China's satellites. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed framework outperforms existing interpolation methods, efficiently reducing the onboard computational cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Large-scale MODIS AOD products recovery: Spatial-temporal hybrid fusion considering aerosol variation mitigation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a pivotal parameter to reflect aerosol properties, such as aerosol radiative forcing and atmospheric corrections of the aerosol effect. Unfortunately, the valid pixels of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products are scarce, which has attracted great attention from scholars. In recent years, numerous AOD recovering algorithms have been proposed and the algorithms merely employing a single temporal AOD image are regarded as the most convenient and flexible for large-scale practical applications. However, current algorithms face the challenge of insufficiently considering the impacts of aerosol variation resulted from the temporal difference. Meanwhile, the improvement of AOD valid pixels is also poor due to the scarce excavation of complementary information. In order to address these issues, a novel algorithm of spatial-temporal hybrid fusion considering aerosol variation mitigation (ST-AVM) is developed to fill the missing pixels in Aqua AOD products with a single Terra AOD image in large scale. The results show that the total recovered AOD products nearly maintain the original accuracy of MODIS. Meanwhile, the AOD coverage is significantly improved in the study areas and the degrees of improvements regionally vary. Overall, the AOD coverage over land is increased by 123.9% (from 20.5% to 45.9%) after the recovery. Besides, the spatial distribution of recovered monthly AOD products remains fairly consistent as the original Aqua. Also, the recovered annual AOD spatial distribution shows more coherent, which indicates the reliability of ST-AVM algorithm.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations in Farmland Water Conditions in the Yanhe River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To gain a deeper understanding of the influence of climate change on water cycling and water resources, it is important to investigate the changes in farmland moisture profits and losses and the influencing factors. In view of this, using the Yanhe River Basin as an example, we adopted the Penman-Monteith model to calculate the amounts of moisture profit and loss in the basin and analyzed the spatio-temporal variations of moisture profit and loss from 2003 to 2015. Based on our results, the Yanhe River Basin was characterized by water shortage from 2003 to 2015. From 2003 to 2007, the water deficit of the basin was obvious, while from 2007 to 2011, the water shortage was moderate. From 2011 to 2015, the area experienced an aggravated water deficit. Overall, from 2003 to 2015, the area proportions of the regions with normal and mild water deficits decreased by 32.65% and 18.98%, respectively, while the area proportion of the regions with acute water deficits increased by 32.97%. In terms of the spatial distribution of moisture profits and losses in the Yanhe River Basin, the water deficit was gradually mitigated from northwest to southeast. Precipitation and near-surface air specific humidity were the main factors influencing the water conditions in the river basin.

TI  - A remote sensing adapted approach for soil organic carbon prediction based on the spectrally clustered LUCAS soil database
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content plays an important role for carbon sequestration in the context of climate change, food security and soil degradation. Reflectance spectroscopy has proven to be a promising technique for SOC quantification in the laboratory and increasingly from air- and spaceborne platforms, where hyperspectral imagery provides great potential for mapping SOC on larger scales with regular updates. When applied on larger scales, soil prediction accuracy decreases due to the inhomogeneity of samples. In this paper, we examined if spectral clustering of the LUCAS EU-wide topsoil database is successful without using other covariates than the spectral database and can improve SOC model performance compared to a reference model that was calibrated on the whole database without clustering. Different clustering methodologies were tested, including a k-means clustering based on principal component analysis or based on spectral feature variables, combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, and a clustering based on a local PLSR approach which builds a different multivariate model for each sample to be predicted. Furthermore, in order to allow for subsequent application to hyperspectral remote sensing data, atmospheric water wavelengths were removed from the analyses. The local PLSR approach achieved best results and was additionally applied to LUCAS spectra resampled to the upcoming hyperspectral EnMAP sensor which led to good results: R-2 = 0.66, RMSEP = 5.78 g kg(-1) and RPIQ = 1.93. The k-means clustering approach showed slightly better results than the reference model. Overall, our results showed similar performances for SOC prediction models compared to other approaches using PLSR with a larger spectral range and other soil parameters as covariates. This study shows that (i) it is possible to transfer the local PLSR approach onto a wavelengths reduced spectral library and to predict estimations of SOC at low-cost with reasonable accuracy based on large scale soil databases; and (ii) that the local regression approach is a valuable tool for SOC prediction models based solely on spectral data without the use of other soil covariates.

TI  - Tracking Multidecadal Lake Water Dynamics with Landsat Imagery and Topography/Bathymetry
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resource management is of critical importance due to its close relationship with nearly every industry, field, and lifeform on this planet. The success of future water management will rely upon having detailed data of current and historic water dynamics. This research leverages Google Earth Engine and uses Landsat 5 imagery in conjunction with bathymetry and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model data to analyze long-term lake dynamics (water surface elevation, surface area, volume, volume change, and frequency) for Lake McConaughy in Nebraska, USA. Water surface elevation was estimated by extracting elevation values from underlying bathymetry and digital elevations models using 5,994 different combinations of water indices, water boundaries, and statistics for 100 time periods spanning 1985-2009. Surface elevation calculations were as accurate as 0.768 m root mean square error (CI95% [0.657, 0.885]). Water volume change calculations found a maximum change of 1.568 km(3) and a minimum total volume of only 23.97% of the maximum reservoir volume. Seasonal and long-term trends were identified, which have major affects regarding regional agriculture, local recreation, and lake water quality. This research fills an existing gap in optical remote sensing-based monitoring of lakes and reservoirs, is more robust and outperforms other commonly used monitoring techniques, increases the number of water bodies available for long-term studies, introduces a scalable framework deployable within Google Earth Engine, and enables data collection of both gauged and ungauged water bodies, which will substantially increase our knowledge and understanding of these critical ecosystems.

TI  - Modes of Narrative Integration of Experiences of Contingency in Highly Sensitive Children: a Qualitative Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Narrative integration of experiences of contingency describes the ways (modes) in which people assimilate the uncontrollability-or contingency-of life, while accepting, acknowledging and tolerating the existential fears accompanying these experiences, thus keeping contingency open. Contingency is defined as events being 'possible (or not impossible) and also not necessary at the same time'. Experiences of contingency, caused by the interplay between life events, one's worldview and ultimate life goals, disrupt one's life story, challenging one's basic needs for understanding, coherence and meaning.The different modes of narrative integration are studied in six highly sensitive Dutch children, aged between 6 and 12 years old. A practice-based model by Kruizinga et al. (2017) is compared to a theoretical construct of religious philosophical contingency constructed by Wuchterl (2011; 2019). Practical and theoretical differences are discussed. This study confirms the findings by Kruizinga et al. (2017).Four modes of dealing with contingency are identified: Denial, Acknowledging, Accepting and Receiving. In mode four, Receiving, people transcend themselves (self-transcendence). Contrary to Wuchterl's theory, vertical transcendence is not a prerequisite for narrative integration of contingency, or for keeping contingency open. We conclude that the model of narrative integration of experiences of contingency by Kruizinga et al. is a valid tool for further research. Possible applications in the field of spiritual care are discussed.

TI  - Satellite IoT Edge Intelligent Computing: A Research on Architecture
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the number of satellites continues to increase, satellites become an important part of the IoT and 5G/6G communications. How to deal with the data of the satellite Internet of Things is a problem worth considering and paying attention to. Due to the current on-board processing capability and the limitation of the inter-satellite communication rate, the data acquisition from the satellite has a higher delay and the data utilization rate is lower. In order to use the data generated by the satellite IoT more effectively, we propose a satellite IoT edge intelligent computing architecture. In the article, we analyze the current methods of satellite data processing, combined with the development trend of future satellites, and use the characteristics of edge computing and machine learning to describe the satellite IoT edge intelligent computing architecture. Finally, we verify that the architecture can speed up the processing of satellite data. By demonstrating the performance of different neural network models in the satellite edge intelligent computing architecture, we can find that the lightweight of neural networks can promote the development of satellite IoT edge intelligent computing architecture.

TI  - A Statistical Model for Estimating Midday NDVI from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 16 and 17
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The newest version of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite series (GOES-16 and GOES-17) includes a near infrared band that allows for the calculation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at a 1 km at nadir spatial resolution every five minutes throughout the continental United States and every ten minutes for much of the western hemisphere. The usefulness of individual NDVI observations is limited due to the noise that remains even after cloud masks and data quality flags are applied, as much of this noise is negatively biased due to scattering within the atmosphere. Fortunately, high temporal resolution NDVI allows for the identification of consistent diurnal patterns. Here, we present a novel statistical model that utilizes this pattern, by fitting double exponential curves to the diurnal NDVI data, to provide a daily estimate of NDVI over forests that is less sensitive to noise by accounting for both random observation errors and atmospheric scattering biases. We fit this statistical model to 350 days of observations for fifteen deciduous broadleaf sites in the United States and compared the method to several simpler potential methods. Of the days 60% had more than ten observations and were able to be modeled via our methodology. Of the modeled days 72% produced daily NDVI estimates with <0.1 wide 95% confidence intervals. Of the modeled days 13% were able to provide a confident NDVI value even if there were less than five observations between 10:00-14:00. This methodology provides estimates for daily midday NDVI values with robust uncertainty estimates, even in the face of biased errors and missing midday observations.

TI  - Application of SAR Interferometry Using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Data as Precise Method to Identify Degraded Peatland Areas Related to Forest Fire
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in peatland areas such as Kalimantan, Indonesia has been going on for decades. The deforestation has indirectly increased peatlands to become degraded and flammable. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry approach for identification of degraded peatlands can be performed using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data by converting land deformation data generated from SAR interferometry analysis into water table (WT) depth data using Wosten models. Peatlands with WT depth conditions of more than 40 cm are classified as degraded peatlands which are flammable. By using fire data from previous studies, this research confirms that identification of degraded peatlands using SAR interferometry approach by ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 is more reliable with high precision related to forest fires, with a precision level of 88% compared to 5% precision level using the WT depth monitoring system that has been installed in Central Kalimantan. The highest wavelength of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (L-Band) data can resolve the limitation due to temporal and volumetric decorrelation, compared to C-Band and X-Band satellite data. The combination methods of SAR interferometry approach and the real-time WT depth monitoring system to identify degraded peatlands can be more efficient, faster, and accurate. The advantage of this research result shows that SAR interferometry analysis can reach blank spot areas that are not covered by the observation station of WT depth monitoring system. It also gives a benefit as a guide to select precise locations of observation stations related to degraded peatland and forest fire.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of One-Time Birth Cohort Screening for Hepatitis C as Part of the National Health Service Health Check Program in England
T2  - VALUE IN HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Birth cohort screening for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been implemented in the US, but there is little evidence of its cost-effectiveness in England. We aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of one-time HCV screening for individuals born between 1950 and 1979 as part of the National Health Service health check in England, a health check for adults aged 40 to 74 years in primary care.Methods: A Markov model was developed to analyze add-on HCV testing to the National Health Service health check for individuals in birth cohorts between 1950 and 1979, versus current background HCV testing only, over a lifetime horizon. The model used data from a back-calculation model of the burden of HCV in England, sentinel surveillance of HCV testing, and published literature. Results are presented from a health service perspective in pounds in 2017, as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life years gained.Results: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from 7648 pound to 24 pound 434, and 18 pound 681 to 46 pound 024, across birth cohorts when considering 2 sources of HCV transition probabilities. The intervention is most likely to be cost-effective for those born in the 1970s, and potentially cost-effective for those born from 1955 to 1969. The model results were most sensitive to the source of HCV transition probabilities, the probability of referral and receiving treatment, and the HCV prevalence among testers. The maximum value of future research across all birth cohorts was 11.3 pound million at 20 pound 000 per quality-adjusted life years gained.Conclusion: Birth cohort screening is likely to be cost-effective for younger birth cohorts, although considerable uncertainty exists for other birth cohorts. Further studies are warranted to reduce uncertainty in cost-effectiveness and consider the acceptability of the intervention.

TI  - Assessment Techniques in Forest Biomass along the Timber Supply Chain
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - As a part of the renewable energy cycle, forest biomass resources are considered to be important renewable materials and energy sources in many countries. It is evident from international and local research into forest biomass utilization that several challenges must be addressed to ensure logging waste can be transformed into material of commercial value. Several logistical and supply chain challenges have already been identified, including uncertainty about the nature, amount, and quality of forest residues. In this context, this paper presents a summary review of estimation methods and techniques for managing forest and woody residue along the timber supply chain. The review examines both the opportunities and the challenges evident in the international forest residue estimation methods within each supply chain for primary and secondary forest resources. The review also discusses techniques for supply chain and management planning and highlights the limitations of existing information and communication technology (ICT) implemented for forest biomass research.

TI  - Disarming the rulers and authorities: Reading Colossians in its Roman imperial context
T2  - REVIEW & EXPOSITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The scant scholarly discussion that focuses on the relationship between Colossians and the Roman Empire has tended to reduce the relationship to a binary proposition: either Colossians is anti-empire, or it has little to say altogether with regards to empire. Neither perspective captures the complexity of Colossians in this regard. Colossians was not written explicitly for the purpose of opposing Rome's empire. Yet it does have significant bearing on understanding how to live life faithfully under the dominion of empire. Writing to combat what the author perceives as a dangerous philosophy for the Colossian Christians, the author gives readers a glimpse into a worldview at sharp odds with Roman imperial ideology. The theological and Christological claims of the letter engage with Roman imperial ideology in ways that contest, threaten, and also mimic Roman imperial power.

TI  - Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms for Instantaneous Net Surface Shortwave Radiation Retrieval Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR) is one of the most important fundamental parameters in various land processes. Benefiting from its efficient nonlinear fitting ability, machine learning algorithms have a great potential in the retrieval of NSSR. However, few studies have explored the level of accuracy that machine learning algorithms can reach for different land covers on the worldwide scale and what the optimal independent variables are in the machine learning-based NSSR model. To guide the use of machine learning algorithms correctly in the retrieval of NSSR, it is necessary to give a comprehensive analysis from algorithm complexity, accuracy, and other aspects. In this study, three classic machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were built well to estimate instantaneous NSSR with optimal hyperparameters by elaborately selecting different independent variables, including top of atmosphere (TOA) channel spectral reflectance, geographic parameters, surface information, and atmosphere conditions. Global FLUXNET in situ measurements throughout 2014 were used to validate the accuracies of retrieved NSSR over various land cover types. The root mean square error (RMSE) is below 55 W/m(2), and the distributions of error histogram are also similar. Approximately 50% of absolute error were within 25 W/m(2). There was a performance difference of NSSR estimations in various surface types, and the performance of three machine learning methods in a specific surface type was also different. However, the RF method may be considered as the optimal methodology to retrieve NSSR from MODIS data, owing to its relatively better precision and concise hyperparameter-tuned process. The importance analysis of the proposed independent variables of NSSR retrieval shows that the introduction of geographic information can effectively reduce the error of NSSR retrieval, and surface information and atmosphere information are not necessary. It was also found that a combination of geographic information and blue band TOA reflectance already have a pretty good accuracy in NSSR retrieval, which implies there is a possibility to transfer our NSSR model to other satellite sensors, especially with insufficient channels. In a word, the NSSR model with machine learning algorithms would be an efficient, concise, and general method in the future.

TI  - Estimating Rainfall Interception of Vegetation Canopy from MODIS Imageries in Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The interception of rainfall by vegetation canopies plays an important role in the hydrologic process of ecosystems. Most estimates of canopy rainfall interception in present studies are mainly through field observations at the plot region. However, it is difficult, yet important, to map the regional rainfall interception by vegetation canopy at a larger scale, especially in the southern rainy areas of China. To obtain a better understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation canopy rainfall interception with regard to the basin scale in this region, we extended a rainfall interception model by combining the observed rainfall data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer leaf area index (MODIS_LAI) data to quantitatively estimate the vegetation canopy rainfall interception rate (CRIR) at small/medium basin scales in Guangdong Province, which is undergoing large changes in vegetation cover due to rapid urban expansion in the area. The results showed that the CRIR in Guangdong declined continuously during 2004-2012, but increased slightly in 2016, and the spatial variability of CRIR showed a diminishing yearly trend. The CRIR also exhibited a distinctive spatial pattern, with a higher rate to the east and west of the mountainous areas and a lower rate in the central mountainous and coastal areas. This pattern was more closely related to the spatial variation of the LAI than that of rainfall due to frequent extreme rainfall events saturating vegetation leaves. Further analysis demonstrated that forest coverage, instead of background climate, has a certain impact on the canopy rainfall interception, especially the proportion of broad-leaved forests in the basin, but more in-depth study is warranted in the future. In conclusion, the results of this study provide insights into the spatiotemporal variation of canopy rainfall interception at the basin scale of the Guangdong Province, and suggest that forest cover should be increased by adjusting the species composition to increase the proportion of native broad-leaved species based on the local condition within the basin. In addition, these results would be helpful in accurately assessing the impacts of forest ecosystems on regional water cycling, and provide scientific and practical implications for water resources management.

TI  - Remotely-Observed Early Spring Warming in the Southwestern Yellow Sea Due to Weakened Winter Monsoon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal warming over the southwestern Yellow Sea (YS) in the spring is of vital importance to the local ecologic environment, especially to the massive green algae blooms of the YS in late spring and early summer. Based on daily optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (SST) data consisting of satellite derived SST from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and in situ measurements, this study analyzed the spring SST variation over the southwestern YS (SWYS) from 1982 to 2018. The results show that the recent warming trend of spring SST over the SWYS is four-to-six times that of the global average, and as a result, sea water over the Subei Shoal (SBS) shifts about 10-13 days earlier to reach 10 degrees C in early April. This implies that, accordingly, the micro-propagules of green algae over the SBS may have the chance to germinate earlier. SST variability in early April significantly correlates with northerly wind and exhibits a general warming over the SWYS with an intensified warming anchored along the axis of the submarine canyon off the Yangtze estuary. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) red-green-blue composite images captured the intrusion of the Taiwan Warm Current (TWC) into the SWYS through the submarine canyon during northerly wind relaxation in early April. Ocean remote sensing provides important clues for understanding the regional SST variability in the SWYS. Following this clue, this study finds that the weakening of winter monsoon in the spring leads to northward migration of the TWC and results in enhanced spring warming over the SWYS. The attendant advanced warming in spring, resulting in a favorable temperature condition for early development of green alga, may have contributed to the green tide blooms in the Yellow Sea in the recent decade.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in forest loss and its linkage to burned areas in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire-induced forest loss has substantially increased worldwide over the last decade. In China, the connection between forest loss and frequent fires on a national scale remains largely unexplored. In this study, we used a data set for a time-series of forest loss from the Global Forest Watch and for a MODIS-derived burned area for 2003-2015 to ascertain variations in forest loss and to explore its relationship with forest fires (represented by burned areas) at the country- and forest-zone levels. We quantified trends in forest loss during 2003-2015 using linear regression analysis and assessed the relation between forest loss and burned areas using Spearman's correlation. Forest loss increased significantly (264.8 km(2) a(-1); R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.01) throughout China, with an average annual increase of 11.4% during 2003-2015. However, the forest loss trend had extensive spatial heterogeneity. Forest loss increased mainly in the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest zone (315.0 km(2) a(-1); R-2 = 0.69, p < 0.01) and tropical rainforest zone (38.8 km(2) a(-1); R-2 = 0.66, p < 0.01), but the loss of forest decreased in the cold temperate deciduous coniferous forest zone (- 70.8 km(2) year(-1); R-2 = 0.75, p < 0.01) and the temperate deciduous mixed broadleaf and coniferous forest zone (- 14.4 km(2) a(-1); R-2 = 0.45, p < 0.05). We found that 1.0% of China's area had a significant positive correlation (r >= 0.55, p < 0.05) with burned areas and 0.3% had a significant negative correlation (r <= - 0.55, p < 0.05). In particular, forest loss had a significant positive relationship with the burned area in the cold temperate deciduous coniferous forest zone (16.9% of the lands) and the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest zone (7.8%). These results provide a basis for future predictions of fire-induced forest loss in China.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Classification of Imbalanced Data Using Multistage Sampling Method and Deep Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Class imbalance is a key issue for the application of deep learning for remote sensing image classification because a model generated by imbalanced samples training has low classification accuracy for minority classes. In this study, an accurate classification approach using the multistage sampling method and deep neural networks was proposed to classify imbalanced data. We first balance samples by multistage sampling to obtain the training sets. Then, a state-of-the-art model is adopted by combining the advantages of atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and Encoder-Decoder for pixel-wise classification, which are two different types of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) that can obtain contextual information of multiple levels in the Encoder stage. The details and spatial dimensions of targets are restored using such information during the Decoder stage. We employ four deep learning-based classification algorithms (basic FCN, FCN-8S, ASPP, and Encoder-Decoder with ASPP of our approach) on multistage training sets (original, MUS1, and MUS2) of WorldView-3 images in southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and GF-2 images in northeastern Beijing for comparison. The experiments show that, compared with existing sets (original, MUS1, and identical) and existing method (cost weighting), the MUS2 training set of multistage sampling significantly enhance the classification performance for minority classes. Our approach shows distinct advantages for imbalanced data.

TI  - The Optimal Image Date Selection for Evaluating Cultivated Land Quality Based on Gaofen-1 Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a method for determining the optimal image date to improve the evaluation of cultivated land quality (CLQ). Five vegetation indices: leaf area index (LAI), difference vegetation index (DVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and ratio vegetation index (RVI) are first retrieved using the PROSAIL model and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images. The indices are then introduced into four regression models at different growth stages for assessing CLQ. The optimal image date of CLQ evaluation is finally determined according to the root mean square error (RMSE). This method is tested and validated in a rice growth area of Southern China based on 115 sample plots and five GF-1 images acquired at the tillering, jointing, booting, heading to flowering, and milk ripe and maturity stage of rice in 2015, respectively. The results show that the RMSEs between the measured and estimated CLQ from four vegetation index-based regression models at the heading to flowering stage are smaller than those at the other growth stages, indicating that the image date corresponding with the heading to flowering stage is optimal for CLQ evaluation. Compared with other vegetation index-based models, the LAI-based logarithm model provides the most accurate estimates of CLQ. The optimal model is also driven using the GF-1 image at the heading to flowering stage to map CLQ of the study area, leading to a relative RMSE of 14.09% at the regional scale. This further implies that the heading to flowering stage is the optimal image time for evaluating CLQ. This study is the first effort to provide an applicable method of selecting the optimal image date to improve the estimation of CLQ and thus advanced the literature in this field.

TI  - Short and mid-term sea surface temperature prediction using time-series satellite data and LSTM-AdaBoost combination approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in the global ocean-atmospheric system, changes of which can have profound effects on the global climate and may lead to extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Therefore, predicting the dynamics of future SSTs is of vital importance which can help identify these extreme events and alleviate the losses they cause. In this paper, a machine learning method combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network model and the AdaBoost ensemble learning model (LSTM-AdaBoost) is proposed to predict the short and mid-term daily SST considering that LSTM is good at modelling long-term dependencies but suffers from overfitting, while AdaBoost has strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted. By combining these two strong and heterogeneous models, the prediction errors related to variance may cancel out each other and the final results can be improved. In this method, the historical time-series satellite data of SST anomaly (SSTA) is used instead of SST itself considering that the fluctuations of SSTs are very small compared to their absolute magnitudes. The seasonality of the SSTA time series is first modelled using polynomial regression and then removed. Then, the deseasonalized time series are used to train the developed LSTM model and AdaBoost model independently. Daily SSTA predictions are made using these two models, and eventually, their predictions are combined as final predictions using the averaging strategy. A case study in the East China Sea that predicts the daily SSTA 10?days ahead shows that the proposed LSTM-AdaBoost combination model outperforms the LSTM and AdaBoost separately, as well as the optimized support vector regression (SVR) model, the optimized feedforward backpropagation neural network model (BPNN), and the stacking LSTM-AdaBoost model (S_LSTM-AdaBoost), when judged using multiple error statistics and from different perspectives. The results suggest that the LSTM-AdaBoost combination model using the averaging strategy is highly promising for short and mid-term daily SST predictions.

TI  - Remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle: A review of advances over 50 years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.

TI  - Bayesian evaluation of meteorological datasets for modeling snowmelt runoff in Tizinafu watershed in Western China
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tizinafu watershed is characterized by extremely scarce precipitation and low temperature, and snow and glacier melting which dominate the main water resource of this area. Thus, assessing the snowmelt water resource has great significance to local residents and ecological systems. Based on snowmelt runoff model (SRM) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, four combinations of meteorological data consisting of two daily temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model and two daily precipitation data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and VIC, respectively, are evaluated for this ungauged basin in Bayesian uncertainty analysis. By comparing the performances of the four meteorological data combinations based on SRM (SRMMODIS + TRMM, SRMMODIS + VIC, SRMVIC + TRMM and SRMVIC + VIC, the former and latter subscripts denote temperature and precipitation data, respectively), results show that the four SRMs are both capable of reproducing the runoff process of the Tizinafu watershed on daily runoff simulation, and SRMVIC + VIC has the best performance. In addition, the impact of climate change on the water resources of the Tizinafu watershed is also evaluated in Bayesian uncertainty analysis, and four climate change scenarios under the condition of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 of CMIP5 projection are considered. The results demonstrate that the mean annual runoff prediction of the 2090s increased by 17.2%, 20.2%, 24.1%, and 16.2% compared to that of base year for the four scenarios, respectively. In addition, with the increase of the cryosphere area, snow cover area will have an increasing impact on the mean annual runoff of the study area in the 2090s. The runoff components of snowpack melt and new snow are both sensitive to the cryosphere area, while the runoff component of rainfall is not sensitive to the cryosphere area.

TI  - Tropospheric Delay Correction Based on a Three-Dimensional Joint Model for InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric delays in spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can contaminate the measurement of small amplitude earth surface deformation. In this paper, a novel TXY-correlated method is proposed, where the main tropospheric delay components are jointly modeled in three dimensions, and then the long-scale and topography-correlated tropospheric delay components are corrected simultaneously. Moreover, the strategies of scale filtering and alternative iteration are employed to accurately retrieve all components of the joint model. Both the TXY-correlated method and the conventional phase-based methods are tested with a total of 25 TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images collected over the Chaobai River site and the Renhe Town of Beijing Shunyi District, where natural scenes and man-made targets are contained. A higher correction rate of tropospheric delays and a greater reduction in spatio-temporal standard deviations of time series displacement are observed after delay correction by the TXY-correlated method in both non-urban and urban areas, which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Evaluation of twelve evapotranspiration products from machine learning, remote sensing and land surface models over conterminous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) products were evaluated over the conterminous United States (CONUS). These products include the following: 1 product from machine learning model (GFET), 3 products based on remotely sensed observations (SSEBop, MOD16 and GLEAM) and 8 products from land surface models in NLDAS-2 (Mosaic, Noah28, SAC and VIC403) and NLDAS-3 (CLSM25, Noah36, NoahMP36 and VIC412). The AmeriFlux observations and water balance derived ET (WBET) were used to validate these products at point and basin scales. The three-corned hat (TCH) method was employed to quantify ET uncertainties over the basin scale and in each grid over the whole CONUS. The ET interannual variability and the impacts of drought on ET were analyzed over the basin scale and Texas. The results indicate that all models are able to capture ET seasonal variations compared to AmeriFlux observations. Over basin scale, all ET products are closely related to WBET with high correlation coefficient values (larger than 0.83). Noah28 (VIC412) has smallest root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of 27.32 mm/year (42.78 mm/year). The uncertainties calculated from TCH method indicate that NLDAS-3 monthly ET products have lower uncertainties (4-7 mm/month) than those from NLDAS-2 ET (7-8 mm/month) and two MODIS ET (MOD16 and SSEBop) (10-15 mm/month). Specifically, ET uncertainty is reduced 47% (19%) for Noah36 (NoahMP36) compared to Noah28; it is reduced 19% for VIC412 compared to VIC403; it is reduced 19% for CLSM25 compared to Mosaic. The GFET (4.37 mm/month) and GLEAM (6.44 mm/month) have comparable low uncertainties with NLDAS-3 ET products. This study provides an important basis for the selection of proper ET data sets for the hydrological analysis over CONUS.

TI  - Discriminative Adaptation Regularization Framework-Based Transfer Learning for Ship Classification in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship classification in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images is of great significance for dealing with various marine matters. Although traditional supervised learning methods have recently achieved dramatic successes, but they are limited by the insufficient labeled training data. This letter presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) method, termed as discriminative adaptation regularization framework-based transfer learning (D-ARTL), to address the problem in case that there is no labeled training data available at all in the SAR image domain, i.e., target domain (TD). D-ARTL improves the original ARTL by adding a novel source discriminative information preservation (SDIP) regularization term. This improvement achieves an efficient transfer of interclass discriminative ability from source domain (SD) to TD, while achieving the alignment of cross-domain distributions. Extensive experiments have verified that D-ARTL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the task of ship classification in SAR images by transferring the automatic identification system (AIS) information.

TI  - Algorithm to derive inherent optics properties from remote sensing reflectance in turbid and eutrophic lakes
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inherent optical properties play an important role in understanding the biogeochemical processes of lakes by providing proxies for a variety of biogeochemical quantities, including phytoplankton pigments. However, to date, it has been difficult to accurately derive the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton [a(ph)(lambda)] in turbid and eutrophic waters from remote sensing. A large dataset of remote sensing of reflectance [R-rs(lambda)] and absorption coefficients was measured for samples collected from lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River basin (MLYHR), China. In the process of scattering correction of spectrophotometric measurements, the particulate absorption coefficients [a(p)(lambda)] were first assumed to have no absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength. This assumption was corrected by estimating the particulate absorption coefficients at 750 nm [a(p)(750)] from the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended particulate matter, which was added to the a(p)(lambda) as a baseline. The resulting mean spectral mass-specific absorption coefficient of the nonalgal particles (NAPs) was consistent with previous work. A novel iterative IOP inversion model was then designed to retrieve the total nonwater absorption coefficients [a(nw)(lambda)] and backscattering coefficients of particulates [b(b)(p)(lambda)], a(ph)(lambda), and a(dg)(lambda) [absorption coefficients of NAP and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)] from R-rs(lambda) in turbid inland lakes. The proposed algorithm performed better than previously published models in deriving a(nw)(lambda) and b(b)(p)(lambda) in this region. The proposed algorithm performed well in estimating the a(ph)(lambda) for wavelengths > 500 nm for the calibration dataset [N = 285, unbiased absolute percentage difference (UAPD) = 55.22%, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.44 m(-1)] and for the validation dataset (N = 57, UAPD = 56.17%, RMSE = 0.71 m(-1)). This algorithm was then applied to Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) satellite data, and was validated with field data. This study provides an example of how to use local data to devise an algorithm to obtain IOPs, and in particular, a(ph)(lambda), using satellite R-rs(lambda) data in turbid inland waters.

TI  - Novel Polarimetric Contrast Enhancement Method Based on Minimal Clutter to Signal Ratio Subspace
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing the contrast of target and clutter is a crucial issue in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image target detection. In this paper, we define a novel subspace, called minimal clutter-to-signal ratio (MCSR) subspace, which can minimize the clutter-to-signal ratio (CSR) by projecting the feature vector to the subspace. Based on MCSR, a novel polarimetric contrast enhancement method is proposed. The MCSR subspace is learned based on the commonly used polarimetric feature vectors extracted from the labeled training SAR image pixels. The feature vectors extracted form candidate SAR image pixels are projected to the MCSR subspace. By calculating the square norm of each transformed feature vector, an enhanced image can be obtained. It is demonstrated that the existing optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE) is a special case of the proposed method to some extent. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional OPCE method on the RadarSat-2 SAR data.

TI  - Object-based classification of cloudy coastal areas using medium-resolution optical and SAR images for vulnerability assessment of marine disaster
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate access to coastal land cover information is of great significance for marine disaster prevention and mitigation. Although the popular and common sensors of land resource satellites provide free and valuable images to map the land cover, coastal areas often encounter significant cloud cover, especially in tropical areas, which makes the classification in those areas non-ideal. To solve this problem, we proposed a framework of combining medium-resolution optical images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with the recently popular object-based image analysis (OBIA) method and used the Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images acquired in Singapore in 2017 as a case study. We designed experiments to confirm two critical factors of this framework: one is the segmentation scale that determines the average object size, and the other is the classification feature. Accuracy assessments of the land cover indicated that the optimal segmentation scale was between 40 and 80, and the features of the combination of OLI and SAR resulted in higher accuracy than any individual features, especially in areas with cloud cover. Based on the land cover generated by this framework, we assessed the vulnerability of the marine disasters of Singapore in 2008 and 2017 and found that the high-vulnerability areas mainly located in the southeast and increased by 118.97 km 2 over the past decade. To clarify the disaster response plan for different geographical environments, we classified risk based on altitude and distance from shore. The newly increased high-vulnerability regions within 4 km offshore and below 30 m above sea level are at high risk; these regions may need to focus on strengthening disaster prevention construction. This study serves as a typical example of using remote sensing techniques for the vulnerability assessment of marine disasters, especially those in cloudy coastal areas.

TI  - Suitability Analysis of Water Body Spectral Index in Urban River Network
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban surface water is an important part of urban ecological environment. Hyperspectral remote sensing of surface water environment is an important application direction of hyperspectral remote sensing. Water extraction is the first step of hyperspectral remote sensing of surface water environment. Its main task is to obtain the contour of the surface water body from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The water body spectral index makes full use of the spectral information, and the calculation is simple, the implementation is easy, and the extraction effect is excellent. Spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) hyperspectral difference water index (HDWI) and index of water index (IWI) have been widely used in the extraction of open water bodies such as lakes and large rivers. In recent years, with the development of imaging spectroscopy technology, the acquisition capability of hyperspectral remote sensing data has also advanced rapidly, and spatial resolution and spectral resolution have been continuously improved. The rivers and lakes are basically distributed along the topography in the basin while the urban surface water is generally small, criss-crossed, forming a river network. When hyperspectral remote sensing data are used for urban surface water extraction, the spatial resolution of the image, the type of features and the complexity of the ground objects are very different from those of rivers and lakes. Therefore, the applicability of these commonly used spectral indices in urban surface water extraction needs to be evaluated. This article is based on this starting point and goal, taking the Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province in China, which is in Jiangnan Water Town and has a dense river network as the research object, and using the high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data acquired by airborne imaging spectrometer for applications (AISA) as data source. The optimal threshold is determined by Youden index. The overall accuracy, commission error, omission error and Kappa coefficient are used as the accuracy evaluation indicators. The suitability of NDVI, NDWI, HDWI and IWI in urban river network extraction was analyzed and evaluated. The results show that the trend of the shadow spectrum is similar to the water spectrum, and is the main factor causing high commission errors in the water body extraction. All four indices accurately suppress the shadows that fall in the vegetation, but do not effectively suppress the shadows that fall in the buildings. Although HDWI can suppress shadows cast in buildings to a certain extent, it cannot effectively suppress the bright buildings. Through further analysis of the spectrum of different types of water bodies and (the ground objects under) shadows, the water and shadow spectral curves are similar, and there are peaks around 560 similar to 600 nm, but the heights of water and shadow peaks are different. The water wave peaks are larger while the peak value of the shadow wave is lower. Therefore, by fully excavating the spectrum reflectance information at 560 similar to 600 nm in water bodies and shadows, it is expected to further suppress building shadows and improve the accuracy of water extraction in urban river networks.

TI  - Characteristics of recent evolution in Qinzhou Bay influenced by human activities
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the underwater topographical data and remote sensing data from the 1980s, we analyze the characteristics of shoal-trough pattern change and erosion-siltation evolution in Qinzhou Bay under the influence of recent high intensity human activities. We also discuss the reasons from the aspect of dynamic geomorphology combining the methods of remote sensing, GIS, and numerical simulation. The results indicate that the Maowei Sea showed overall deposition, the siltation intensity of the shallow water area above the 2m isobath was significantly greater than that in the other areas, and the channel was characterized by erosion due to artificial sand mining and enhancement of tidal current. The outer bay was dominated by deposition, but its deposition rate was less than that of the inner bay. The scouring and silting characteristics of the shoal and trough were significantly different. The west channel, middle channel, and the side foreland were dominated by deposition, while Middle Shoal, East Channel were characterized by scour. Due to high intensity human activities, the flood and ebb tidal capacity of the Maowei Sea reduced 4.6% and 4%, respectively, which caused continuous deposit. The coastline in the middle of the outer bay has been pushed toward the sea significantly, which made the tidal current concentrated and increased velocity by 0.1 similar to 0.2 m.s(-1), leading to the erosion of the Middle Shoal. The deepening of the East Channel made flow in the Middle Channel move to the East Channel, which made the Middle Channel shrink. The changes of the horizontal Kelvin number indicate that human activities have greater impact on the East and Middle channels of the outer bay. The stability of the East Channel is enhanced and the Middle Channel continues to shrink, while the stability of the West Channel remains basically unchanged.

T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer (from June to September) time series of 15 years (2002-2016) of chlorophyll-a (Chl a) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua products were collected to discuss seasonal and interannual variability of ecological response of the Pearl River Plume in the Northern South China Sea (NSCS). In June, under the influence of southwest monsoon, nutrients from the Pearl River Delta were transported eastward to the shelf area, phytoplankton bloomed and Chla increased. The coverage area over the shelf in the NSCS reached the maximum in July, and decreased in August when the river discharge and wind reduced. In September when the northeasterly wind prevailed in the NSCS, the coverage area with high concentration of Chla (AHCHL) west of the estuary increased. Linear regression analysis suggested that the river discharge was the main reason for driving the AHCHL variability with a time lag of about one month. The combined effect of stronger (weaker) than the multi-year mean river discharge and wind resulted in extremely large (small) AHCHL in 2008 (2004). Because the spatiotemporal variability of Chl a in the NSCS was mainly influenced by the Pearl River Plume, the quality controlled satellite Chl a products can be used to discuss the variability of the Pearl River Plume.

TI  - Woody Plant Cover Estimation in Texas Savanna from MODIS Products
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody plant cover, the area of the vertical projection of woody plants (trees, shrubs, and bushes), plays an important role in the structure and function of savanna ecosystems and is needed by the savanna modeling community. Recent problems facing savanna ecosystems such as woody plant encroachment and subsequent habitat fragmentation further underscore the relevance of regional-scale and even larger-scale woody plant cover mapping. The mixture of woody plants and herbaceous vegetation in savanna landscapes lends woody plant cover mapping to fractional representation. This study endeavors to develop a simple and reliable approach for fractional woody plant cover mapping in savanna ecosystems. It was tested in the savanna of central Texas, which features a wide woody plant density gradation. A multiple linear regression model was calibrated between orthophoto-based fractional woody plant cover and metrics derived from time series MODIS products of surface reflectance (MOD09A1) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (MOD15A2H). By applying this model, woody plant cover was extrapolated to Texas savanna at MODIS scale (500 m). Validation suggests a mean absolute error of 0.098 and an R-squared value of 0.60. This study demonstrates a potential approach for woody plant cover mapping in other savanna ecosystems of the world. It also highlights the utility of time series MODIS products in savanna woody plant cover estimation.

TI  - Chemical characteristics of atmospheric carbonyl compounds and source identification of formaldehyde in Wuhan, Central China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The chemical characteristics of carbonyl compounds were investigated concurrently at urban (ZY) and suburban (JX) sites in Wuhan in 2017. Thirteen carbonyl compounds were quantified, with average total mixing ratios of 11.29 +/- 3.85 ppbv at ZY and 8.72 +/- 3.75 ppbv at JX. Formaldehyde (HCHO), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and acetone (CH3COCH3) were the three most abundant atmospheric carbonyl compounds, accounting for > 85% of the total carbonyl compound mixing ratio at both sites. HCHO exhibited highest concentrations during summer and lowest concentrations during winter at ZY and JX. In contrast, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 showed an opposite seasonal trend, suggesting that HCHO may be mainly generated by photochemical reactions in summer, while CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 might be originate from primary emissions in winter. Diurnal variations were assessed, with HCHO exhibiting peak values at midnight in all seasons, with levels associated with diesel-fuel vehicle emissions. High ratios of C-1/C-2 and C-2/C-3 were observed in summer at ZY and JX, suggesting biogenic sources significantly contribute to carbonyl compound formation. Furthermore, linear regression analysis showed a high HCHO contribution from primary sources in winter (73.5% at ZY, 58.6% at JX) and secondary sources in summer (67.2% at ZY, 47.4% at JX). The results of this study will help formulate effective emission control strategies for carbonyl pollution in Wuhan.

TI  - Luminescence enhancement of Ln<SUP>3+</SUP>-β-diketonate complexes confined in zeolite aqueous suspension by 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane
T2  - JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Encapsulation of lanthanide complexes within the pores of zeolites can lead to interesting luminescent composite. However, the luminescence quenching caused by water molecules and increased proton strength inside the pore under aqueous conditions limit the applications of the materials in aqueous solution and wet conditions. Making them be suitable for application in aqueous environment still remains a big challenge. Herein we developed a simple, cost-effective, less time-consuming and environmentally friendly strategy to make the luminescent composite retain their high luminescence even dispersed in aqueous solution for a long time by simply modifying them with 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) under aqueous conditions. The APTES attached to zeolite Y (ZY) dispersed in water can remarkably enhance the luminescence of confined Ln(3+)-beta-diketonate complexes and can also make them highly waterproof. The mechanism responsible for the luminescence enhancement and the waterproofness is that the presence of APTES can neutralize the acidic sites thus favoring the formation of lanthanide complexes with higher coordination number and can prevent water molecules from entering the pores of ZY. Highly luminescent aqueous suspension of composite with tunable emitting color were therefore achieved by varying the Eu3+/Tb3+ molar ratio, and strongly luminescent films were therefore prepared by incorporating the composite into PVA polymer from aqueous solution.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, various remote sensing data, modeling data and emission inventories were integrated to analyze the tempo-spatial distribution of biomass burning in mainland Southeast Asia and its effects on the local ambient air quality from 2001 to 2016. Land cover changes have been considered in dividing the biomass burning into four types: forest fires, shrubland fires, crop residue burning and other fires. The results show that the monthly average number of fire spots peaked at 34,512 in March and that the monthly variation followed a seasonal pattern, which was closely related to precipitation and farming activities. The four types of biomass burning fires presented different tempo-spatial distributions. Moreover, the monthly Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), concentration of particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) total column also peaked in March with values of 0.62, 45 mu g/m(3) and 3.25 x 10(18) molecules/cm(2), respectively. There are significant correlations between the monthly means of AOD (r = 0.74, P < 0.001), PM2.5 concentration (r = 0.88, P < 0.001), and CO total column (r = 0.82, P < 0.001) and the number of fire spots in the fire season. We used Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model to resolve the sources of PM2.5 into 3 factors. The result indicated that the largest contribution (48%) to annual average concentration of PM2.5 was from Factor 1 (dominated by biomass burning), followed by 27% from Factor 3 (dominated by anthropogenic emission), and 25% from Factor 2 (long-range transport/local nature source). The annually anthropogenic emission of CO and PM2.5 from 2001 to 2012 and the monthly emission from the Emission Database for Global Atmosphere Research (EDGAR) were consistent with PMF analysis and further prove that biomass burning is the dominant cause of the variation in the local air quality in mainland Southeast Asia.

TI  - Satellite-detected gain in built-up area as a leading economic indicator
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leading indicators of future economic activity include measures such as new housing starts, managers purchasing index, money supply, and bond yields. Such macroeconomic and financial indicators hold predictive power in signaling recessionary periods. However, many indicators are constrained by the fact that data are often published with some delay and are subject to constant revision (Bandholz and Funke 2003, Huanget al 2018, Orphanides 2003). In this research, we propose a leading indicator derived from satellite imagery, the expansion of anthropogenic bare ground. Satellite-detected gain in built-up area, a major land cover and land use (LCLU) outcome of anthropogenic bare ground gain (ABGG), provides an inexpensive, consistent, and near-real-time indicator of global and regional macroeconomic change. Our panel data analysis across four major regions of the world from 2001 to 2012 shows that the logarithm of total ABGG, mostly owing to its major LCLU outcome, the expansion of built-up land in either year t, t - 1 or t - 2, significantly correlated with the year t logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP, de-trended by Hodrick-Prescott filter). Global ABGG between 2001 and 2012 averaged 7875 km(2) yr(-1), with a peak gain of 11 875 (+/- 2014 km(2) at the 95% confidence interval) in 2006, prior to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. The curve of global ABGG or its major LCLU outcome of built-up area in year t - 1 accords well with that of the de-trended logarithm of the global GDP in year t. Given the 40 year archive of free satellite data, a growing satellite constellation, advances in machine learning, and scalable methods, this study suggests that analyses of ABGG as a whole or its LCLU outcomes can provide valuable information in near-real time for socioeconomic research, development planning, and economic forecasting.

TI  - Comparison between convolutional neural networks and random forest for local climate zone classification in mega urban areas using Landsat images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme is a classification system providing a standardization framework to present the characteristics of urban forms and functions, especially for urban heat island (UHI) research. Landsat-based 100 m resolution LCZ maps have been classified by the World Urban Database and Portal Tool (WUDAPT) method using a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier. Some studies have proposed modified RF and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches. This study aims to compare CNN with an RF classifier for LCZ mapping in great detail. We designed five schemes (three RF-based schemes (S1-S3) and two CNN-based ones (S4-S5)), which consist of various combinations of input features from bitemporal Landsat 8 data over four global mega cities: Rome, Hong Kong, Madrid, and Chicago. Among the five schemes, the CNN-based one with the incorporation of a larger neighborhood information showed the best classification performance. When compared to the WUDAPT workflow, the overall accuracies for entire land cover classes (OA) and for urban LCZ types (i.e., LCZ1-10; OA(urb)) increased by about 6-8% and 10-13%, respectively, for the four cities. The transferability of LCZ models for the four cities were evaluated, showing that CNN consistently resulted in higher accuracy (increased by about 7-18% and 18-29% for OA and OA(urb), respectively) than RF. This study revealed that the CNN classifier classified particularly well for the specific LCZ classes in which buildings were mixed with trees or buildings or plants were sparsely distributed. The research findings can provide a basis for guidance of future LCZ classification using deep learning.

TI  - The effects of water depth on estimating Fractional Vegetation Cover in mangrove forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of mangroves have often been limited to showing the presence or absence of mangrove trees and seldom have studies shown an important indicator of ecosystem integrity such as vegetation cover. Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is used to assess ecosystem health, land cover and carbon stocks, hence accurately measuring FVC is an important task for scientists and land managers. Many methods have been proposed to measure FVC and simple linear models are commonly used. We created an experiment that allowed us to: 1) acquire very detailed hyperspectral imagery (1 mm pixel size) from a simulated mangrove forest, 2) measure the effect of water depth on FVC estimations, and 3) compare the relationship of eight spectral bands and indices with FVC using linear and non-linear models. After acquiring the imagery we corrected for dark signal and a white reference, performed spectral and spatial resampling, and created linear and non-linear models across four pixel sizes. Our results suggest that 1) linear and beta models have similar performance across all pixel sizes; 2) Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAW), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index2 (MSAVI2) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) perform better than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDV), and, 3) our models perform better at fine pixel sizes than coarse scales. We tested our results on high-resolution satellite imagery with similar results and, therefore, recommend using SAW, EVI or MSAVI2 when predicting FVC instead of NDVI.

TI  - Using Landsat OLI and Random Forest to Assess Grassland Degradation with Aboveground Net Primary Production and Electrical Conductivity Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland coverage, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and species composition are used as indicators of grassland degradation. However, soil salinization deficiency, which is also a factor of grassland degradation, is rarely used in grassland degradation assessment in semiarid regions. We assessed grassland degradation by its quality, quantity, and spatial pattern over semiarid west Jilin, China. Considering soil salinization in west Jilin, electrical conductivity (EC) is used as an index with ANPP to assess grassland degradation. First, the spatial distribution of the grassland was measured with information mined from multi-temporal remote sensing images using an object-based image analysis combined with classification and decision tree methods. Second, with 166 field samples, we utilized the random forest (RF) algorithm as the variable selection and regression method for predicting EC and ANPP. Finally, we created a new grassland degradation model (GDM) based on ANPP and EC. The results showed the R-2 (0.91) and RMSE (0.057 mS/cm) of the EC model were generally highest and lowest when the ntree was 400; the ANPP model was optimal (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 15.81 gC/m(2)) when the ntree was 600. Grassland area of west Jilin was 609.67 x 10(3) ha in 2017, there were 373.79 x 10(3) ha of degraded grassland, with 210.47 x 10(3) ha being intensively degraded. This paper surpasses past limitations of excessive reliance on vegetation index to construct a grassland degradation model which considers the characteristics of the study area and soil salinity. The results confirm the positive influence of the ecological conservation projects sponsored by the government. The research outcome could offer supporting data for decision making to help alleviate grassland degradation and promote the rehabilitation of grassland vegetation.

TI  - Habitat suitability modelling revealing environmental-driven abundance variability and geographical distribution shift of winter-spring cohort of neon flying squid <i>Ommastrephes bartramii</i> in the northwest Pacific Ocean
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To identify climate-related habitat changes and variations in abundance and distribution of Ommastrephes bartramii in the northwest Pacific Ocean, an habitat suitability index (HSI) model was developed in this study including sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and sea surface height anomaly (SSHA). The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of O. bartramii gradually decreased between 2006 and 2015, and the latitudinal gravity centres (LATG) of the fishing effort shifted southward. Correlation analyses suggested that CPUE was positively related to SST, PAR, and the areas of suitable and optimal habitat, but negatively correlated with SSHA and the percentages of poor habitat. A significantly positive correlation was found between the LATG and the average latitude of the most preferred SST, PAR, and the average latitude of the area with an HSI between 0.9 and 1.0. From 2006 to 2015, the annual declined CPUE was highly consistent with the increase in areas of poor habitat and the reduction in areas of suitable and optimal habitats. The south-approaching LATG coincided with the southward migration pattern of the latitude of the HSI area in the range of 0.9-1.0. Moreover, compared to the El Nino events, the La Nina events, and normal climate condition yielded enlarged suitable habitat areas for O. bartramii, and the LATG moved further north.

TI  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar imaging mapping methodology based on FPGA-DSP hybrid heterogeneous architecture
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technologies in recent years, the huge amount of remote sensing data bring challenges for high-speed transmission and real-time processing. The general platform with GPU, CPU or digital signal processor (DSP) cannot meet the requirement for short delay and low power. Therefore, a field-programmable gate array-digital signal processor (FPGA-DSP) SAR imaging accelerate platform has become a solution for processing performance with a lower latency and power. In this study, an effective mapping strategy is adopted to the FPGA-DSP hybrid heterogeneous architecture to accelerate the processing performance according to the analysis of Chirp Scaling SAR imaging algorithms. As a proof of concept, a FPGA-DSP hybrid heterogeneous accelerating platform is designed and realised. The platform requires 12 s to focus a stripmap SAR raw data with a granularity of 16,384 x 16,384.

TI  - Diagnostic utility of touch imprint cytology for intraoperative assessment of surgical margins and sentinel lymph nodes in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients using four different cytological stains
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background OSCC is most commonly associated with positive surgical margins. The important cause of loco regional recurrence is histologically positive or closed margins. Clear surgical margins might favor the patient with a better prognosis and prevent repetitive surgeries. The present study was designed to the diagnostic utility of touch imprint (TI) smears using H and E, Pap, Giemsa and Feulgen stains, so that they can be used on a routine basis. Materials and methods A total of 720 smears from 130 margins resected from 32 patients who underwent surgical resection of OSCC were prospectively evaluated. The slides were fixed in alcohol and randomly divided into four different batches for staining with H&E, rapid Pap, Giemsa, Feulgen stain. TI of 30 sentinel lymph node were fixed in 95% alcohol, stained by (H&E) and evaluated by two independent observers. The results were compared with gold standard histopathology. Results H&E stain showed sensitivity 44%, rapid Pap 35%, Giemsa 29% and Feulgen stain 25%. Positive predictive value-100% for all the four stains. NPV-H&E 70%, Pap 66%, Giemsa 62%, Feulgen 59%. Diagnostic test accuracy of H&E stained smears was higher 72%, compared to Pap 67%. Giemsa 65%, and Feulgen 63%. In lymph nodes, Specificity was 94.74%, PPV 90.91%, NPV 94.74%, diagnostic accuracy 93.33%. Conclusion TIC is effective in identifying an inadequate or severe dysplasia margin comparable to gold standard histopathology. It might be used to intraoperatively identify metastases in sentinel lymph nodes in clinically N0 Patients.

TI  - Variability of phraseological units embodying the ⟪blame⟫ concept in national linguistic cultures
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents a conceptual analysis of the phraseological variation that arose as a result of reflecting the mental activity of people and the world language picture. It is vividly expressed in the phraseology of the language, which determines the state of the language and the conditions for its variability, which depend on the worldview and the cultural values of the speakers of national languages. The cognitive-linguistic study of phraseological corpus allows studying the variability of the French verbal phraseological units which represents the concept of blame as the component of the ethnic worldview. The concept of blame is a certain type of phraseological concept. It consists of verbal phraseological units of the French language. The verbal phraseological units which are the representatives of the given concept are included in the category of concept scenarios, as they objectify the semes of action, motion, and process. The aim of the study is via the example of the French verbal phraseological units-representatives of the concept of blame to demonstrate the ability of lexical and grammatical variation within a single language system, while maintaining the identity of their phraseological variants, and to prove the dynamics of the units at lexical and phraseological levels in synchronous level. This proves the novelty of the research, which results in the possibility of the existence of various phraseological features of the studied concept. They are a unified image, the same source of origin, a general denotative meaning, a partial or a complete coincidence of the structural meanings of the verbal lexical units when their grammatical structure does not coincide and vice versa. The variants of verbal phraseological units representatives of the concept of blame are being revealed. They are structured-grammatical, lexical-stylistic, lexical, and quantitative variants.

TI  - Determination of Hydrothermal Alteration Zones Using Remote Sensing Methods in Tirka Area, Toroud, NE Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of current study is the identification of hydrothermal alteration by remote sensing methods in Tirka area, NE Iran. The field of study with area about 13 km(2) (scale: 1:20,000) is part of the Toroud-Chahshirin magmatic belt, which is located in central Iran structural zone. Hydrothermal alteration zones are interpreted based on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer remote sensing data. In the first stage, atmospheric, topographic and geometric corrections were performed on satellite imagery. Then, different image interpretation techniques consisting of band ratio, principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, least squares fitting (LS-Fit), spectral angle mapper and spectral feature fitting (SFF) methods were used. Therefore, VNIR bands for iron oxide alteration, SWIR bands for argillic, phyllic and propylitic alterations, and TIR bands for silicification were applied. The results showed iron oxide and propylitic alterations occurred at the SW and the argillic and phyllic alteration zones were existed in the northern and SE parts of the area. Silicification happened sporadically in the region. Lineaments were processed by false color composite, high-pass filters and hill-shade digital elevation model methods, and two NW-SE and NE-SW major trends were revealed. Field observation and laboratory analysis were used for accuracy of satellite studies. Finally, alteration and lineament maps were integrated for the recognition of high-potential mineralization. Petrographic studies showed that SFF and LS-Fit methods are more reliable than other techniques for the determination of hydrothermal alterations.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - UROLOGIA INTERNATIONALIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: To determine the application of sentinel node biopsy in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Pooled false negative rate and detection rate were presented using Meta-Disc (version 1.4), and comprehensive meta-analysis (version 2). Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed using funnel plot, Cochrane Q test, and I-2 index. Results: The pooled detection rate was 91% (95% CI 87-93%) and pooled sensitivity was 79% (95% CI 0.69-0.86%). When the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group of patients was omitted, the pooled sensitivity changed to 82% (95% CI 74-88%), and the Cochrane Q and I-2 statistics were 15.44 and 48.2%, respectively. The pooled sensitivity of studies that included > 50% of pT 3 or 4 patients was 70% (59-80), by omitting studies that enrolled > 50% of patients at pT stage of 3 or 4, the pooled sensitivity increased to 93% (81-98). Conclusions: Although the studies on SN biopsy of muscle invasive bladder cancer patients resulted in a high detection rate and sensitivity, further validated multicenter trials with larger sample size are essential to confirm the reliability and accuracy of this approach and obtain a standardized method. We showed that pT1 or pT2 bladder cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes are the most appropriated group for sentinel lymph node mapping.

AB  - Current global leaf area index (LAI) products are generally produced from single-temporal satellite observations acquired by a single sensor. These LAI products are usually spatiotemporally discontinuous and inaccurate for some vegetation types in many areas, which limit the applications of these LAI products to the understanding of land dynamics. In this paper, a new data assimilation method was proposed to estimate multiscale and temporally continuous LAI values from multi-sensor time-series satellite observations with different spatial resolutions. An ensemble multiscale tree (EnMsT) was used to establish the conversion relationships between different spatial resolution LAI values, and dynamic models of the LAI at different spatial scales were constructed to evolve LAI at the corresponding spatial scales over time. At each time step, a multiscale Kalman filter (MKF) was introduced to fuse the predicted LAI values from the dynamic models at different spatial scales and to construct a forecasted EnMsT. When satellite observations were available, an ensemble multiscale filter (EnMsF) technique was applied to update the LAI values at each node of the EnMsT. The method was applied to estimate temporally continuous multiscale LAI values from the time series of Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM) surface reflectance data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data at several sites with different vegetation types. The estimated multiscale LAI values were compared with the MODIS and GEOV2 LAI products, and the reference LAI values at the corresponding scales aggregated from the high-resolution LAI surface images. The estimated LAI values with the finest spatial resolution were also validated by ground measurements from the selected sites. The results show that the new method is able to simultaneously estimate temporally continuous multiscale LAI values by assimilating satellite observations with different spatial resolutions, and the estimated multiscale LAI values are well consistent with the reference LAI values at the corresponding scales over the selected sites. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination of the retrieved LAI values at the finest spatial scale against the ground measurements over the selected sites are 0.539 and 0.788, respectively.

TI  - Evaluation of the Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimate Model in Winter Wheat Simulation under Different Irrigation Scenarios
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the major grain crops grown in Guanzhong Plain, China. Rapid and accurate crop growth and yield estimation are important for agricultural monitoring and policy decision-making. Crop model simulation is an effective way to provide objective growth and yield forecast. In this study, we investigated the applicability of the Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimate (SAFY) model for estimating winter wheat dry shoot biomass (M-S,M-d) and grain yield, using two growing seasons field data from different irrigation scenarios. Results showed that the leaf area index (LAI) could be reasonably well simulated, with a minimum root mean square estimate (RMSE) of 0.11. The water stress intensity of each irrigation scenario was well accounted for through stress factor of effective radiation use efficiency. Good accuracy were achieved for M-S,M-d simulation in both calibration (RMSE = 0.054-0.183 kg m(-2)) and validation (RMSE = 0.146 kg m(-2)) datasets, but showed a general over-estimation during later growth stages. The grain yield was well estimated with a relative error of 1.9% to 16.7% in 2013 to 2014 and 0.1% to 16.7% in 2014 to 2015. The comparison between estimated and measured yield of all irrigation scenarios were robust in both seasons, with the minimum RMSE and MRE of 35.0 g m(-2) and 4.7%, respectively. This work demonstrates the potential of a simple crop model for estimating biomass and yield only by calibrate the LAI without further in situ data, and prefigures assimilation application with remote sensing data in future.

TI  - Machine-learned prediction of annual crop planting in the US Corn Belt based on historical crop planting maps
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate crop planting map can provide essential information for decision support in agriculture. The method of post-season and in-season crop mapping has been widely studied in the land use and land cover community. However, it remains a challenge to predict the spatial distribution of crop planting before the growing season. This paper is the first attempt to use machine learning approach on the prediction of field-level annual crop planting from historical crop planting maps. We present an end-to-end machine learning framework for crop planting prediction using Cropland Data Layer (CDL) time series as reference data and multi-layer artificial neural network as prediction model. The proposed framework was first tested at Lancaster County of Nebraska State, then scaled up to the U.S. Corn Belt. According to the experiment results from 53 Agricultural Statistics Districts, we found the machine-learned crop planting map was expected to reach 88% agreement with the future CDL. Meanwhile, the crop acreage estimates derived from the machine-learned prediction were highly correlated (R-2 > 0.9) with the crop acreage estimates of CDL and official statistics by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service. This study provides a low-cost and efficient way to predict annual crop planting map, which can be used to support many agricultural applications and decision makings before the beginning of a growing season.
